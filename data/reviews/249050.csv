"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MTizzler/recommended/249050/","MTizzler","Dark MT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MTizzler/","483 products in account","Firstly, a TL;DR for the lazy reader:\n+ Great Art and Music\n+ Great lore, for those interested in the Endless setting\n+ Great design and interpretation of the rogue-like genre\n+ For 10 bucks, you can enjoy at least a solid 6-10 hours of gameplay and potentially dozens more.\n+ Multiplayer is finally fixed and well designed.\n- However, it is heavily team dependant and one player can genuinely kill three others by making rash decisions. With friends, this game should be a blast.\n- The game’s mechanics may not be for you, read section “Game Mechanics” for more info.\n- Some minor bugs\n\nRead More:\nDungeon of the Endless follows the lore of previous games by Amplitude Studios (Endless Space & Endless Legend) and presents it this time, in a “rogue-like” fashion. The objective is simple: Explore the dungeon, search the rooms and then get the dust crystal through swarms of aliens into the teleporter for the next floor. The mechanics of this game are somewhat profound and relatively unique, based on a turn-like system that dispenses new events after a door in the dungeon is opened. This isn’t to be mistaken with the fact that the game is very much in real-time, players will have to make very quick decisions on defensive relocations, retreats and emergency use of skills/medkits. I imagine the most convenient mechanics comparison to be drawn here is to that of Faster Than Light.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nThe biggest design component of the game leads me to warn potential buyers to possible disappointment- heed my word. Suppose the main feature of rogue-likes that people enjoy is the risk: reward decisions one has to make. This is tied with the subsequent “snowballing” of a character’s strengths and the increasing challenges; item collections in Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac. At first glance, Dungeon of the Endless may not meet these expectations, decisions to develop one’s character is often met with only simply a new ability or meagre stat boosts. This isn’t an inherent flaw in the design but rather, a choice made to cater to players having to combine all of the resources: Industry, to build modules for resources and defense, food for character development and medkits, sciences for researching better modules. A player that may only enjoy, say, the character development of a roguelike will be met with disappointment here as one cannot neglect the other aspects of the game in order to succeed- the very same reason why Amplitude has curbed the potential of characters clearing whole floors by themselves.\n\nHowever, when said mechanics are utilised properly the game truly shines. Players will find themselves scrutinising their floor’s layout, optimising where to allocate power and resources, what resources are most required, whether or not to save resources for the next floor, if characters should be replaced by newfound possible companions, the list goes on. Decision making is the core component of the game that gives it drive, anticipation of resources desperately needed, whether it be dust or a replacement for a fallen companion will lead players into a game that forces them to make decisions. Make no mistake, the game is balls to the walls difficult and will not hesitate to stomp on your carefully knitted floor plans whenever it gets the chance. For this, I commend the developers in creating a relatively fresh balance of mechanics in a recently inflated genre of “rogue-likes”.\n\nMultiplayer:\nMultiplayer is also quite entertaining with gameplay identical to that of singleplayer except with one character per player. This leads to less micro-managing and a larger pool of resources, making the game easier only when players can cooperate properly and plan ahead together. The biggest complaint I have about this however, is the lack of a save-multiplayer feature, thus games can often stretch out for multiple hours and leave players exhausted or unwilling to continue. Furthermore, the lack of a host migration system means that if a host leaves the game—you’re screwed. Amplitude must address these features as they are critical to the quality of gameplay and I find myself only playing alone or with a friend instead of with other players.\n\nArt & Music:\nOther than that, the only noteworthy mention of the game is its further development of the Endless lore, which I am a particular fan of and DotE does not fail to impress, new characters and revelations about the world left me relatively keen on the story of the game. Furthermore, secret character interactions are revealed when specific combinations of characters are placed in a party, leading to a more interesting play through and for the eager player, experimentation with compositions. This lore is accompanied by a pixel art style that is of an impressive quality and the usual stature of music that amplitude has impressed me with so far. Though these are subjective and you in particular may not agree with me.\n\nFinal Judgement:\nFor the singleplayer experience alone, I recommend the game for its listed retail price. On sale, it’s a must-buy. Though multiplayer bogs the game’s overall quality down, Amplitude is known to respond very well to player criticisms and I am confident they will address these issues. Overall a fantastic little game. On my first playthrough, I fought hard to get the crystal to the elevator and in my rash attempt to escape, left my other party members behind to get eaten by aliens. Made me think “Would play again”- and I did, a lot.\n\nUpdate as of 27th April 2015:\n- There is a save feature for multiplayer now, this was much desired and a great improvement.\n- However, the community has slowly died down. It is not impossible to find a match depending on the hour of the day, however there are far fewer lobbies than a few months ago. I would recommend searching globally and not just within your region when searching for a game.\n- Multiplayer overall works well now, however there has been observations of a recent bug that removes items from the characters of certain players whilst they return when traded to others. Hopefully this is fixed by amplitude.","November 5, 2014","true","9.4"," 329 of 351 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","329","351","10","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MichaelWilson/recommended/249050/","MichaelWilson","Michael Wilson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MichaelWilson/","667 products in account","Warning: The following was composed while the game was released in Alpha 0.1.0.\nPlease understand that the game is still in development and when the game is updated the information in this review may be obsolete. When the development surpasses Alpha 0.1.0 you may be able to use this review to compare how the game has changed over development.\n\n\nIntroduction\nRogue-like games are normally games which offer some form of level randomization and permanent death; your character dies and you must either start over or keep going until everything is lost. These types of games are normally unforgiving.\n\nIf you have an interest in Rogue-like games and think that an intermixed concept of base defense is a good idea, keep reading. If you do not like traditional Rogue-like games where it is turn based, you might still like this since it is a hybred of turn-based and real-time with a pause feature. However if you do not like either concept of Rogue-like “permadeath” or base defense you may want to consider doing more research or finding something else.\n\nAlso with a Rogue-like game the graphics are not normally the main focus, thus if you are turned off by anything below 3D graphics you should consider something else.\n\nThis will be a breakdown of concept and features, atmosphere and stability.\n\n\nConcept / Features\nThe concept of mixing Rouge-like with base defense is interesting; it gives an interesting way to progress. Including Dungeon of the Endless uses real-time with waves verse the traditional turn based method.\n\nRight now the game has three available resource types, Food, Dust (energy) and Industry (tech). Food is used to recruit new members to your team, heal them and level them up. Industry is used to create defenses in powered rooms. Dust is used in two ways first to buy things from random merchants and to power rooms beyond the starting room with the core. Dust currently resets every level while Food and Industry do not.\n\nProgressing in the dungeon you will have to make decisions on if it is correct to save Food to heal or on the chance to recruit someone or even to level someone up. The current max level is five and five makes a large difference verses a level one however it is expensive.\n\nThe player will have to decide what rooms to open to since they will not have enough Dust to supply all the rooms at the start. When you have access to merchant the player will have to decide if they are going to give up Dust used for defenses to buy equipment or sell equipment for dust. Defenses can be used to also increase your income while exploring.\n\nProgression also at this time also includes finding chests and blueprints for building new defenses.\n\nThe interface is rather clean and easy to use after you have it down. It also allows short-cut keys while building defenses, so you can hold shift and click to place multiple defenses instead of reusing the menu.\n\nThe game also employs a monster wave system, where waves occur over time from unpowered rooms. Thus if the room remains unpowered monsters come from the vast darkness to kill the team.\n\nThe overall objective is to find the room to the next level and then move the core there using one of the heroes to do so. You will find that the rooms begain to lose power while doing this and waves of monsters start to show up to stop you.\n\n\nAtmosphere\nOverall the feeling is deployed correctly for alpha; the story is short and sweet and not overly lengthy or bulky. Basically your team of two is on a ship and become stranded and must progress through the dungeon. The generated two characters the player start with have a slight background to have the player interested and give a hint on how they should be used to progress.\n\nThe graphics are a very nicely done pixel art format, with effects and seem to pay homage to older graphical related Rouge-likes very well. Personally I found the graphics enjoyable.\n\nMusic was interesting and seems to fit well with the current atmosphere of the game however it may become bland unintentionally over extended play.\n\n\nStability\nOverall the game /did not/ hang or crash on older machines that lacked the graphics requirement. I tried on older desktop machines and laptops under windows Vista and Windows 7; it was pretty efficient and was not a complete resource hog on the system. I also did not run into any critical errors which cased instability and the program failed to run. While I’m unable to speak for everyone and their systems it seems to be overall pretty solid. Most of the time games in alpha or beta still are unstable while this game seems to be nicely polished in respect to stability in the listed windows environments.\n\n\nConclusion\nI would currently recommend this to someone who is /interested and willing/ to try a Rogue-like combined with base defense which is implemented in hybred fasion of real-time and turn-based. This game will most likely have a very interesting development process from Amplitude Studios and I look forward to it.\n\n\nWork History\nPosted: Dec 11, 2013 @ 6:09pm\n\nUpdated: Dec 11, 2013 @ 11:15pm\nSlight Edits\nUpdated: Nov 7, 2014 @ 12:28pm\nAdded Work History.\nNone of the complied review text was changed.\nChanged text formating slightly.","December 11, 2013","true","36.5"," 364 of 402 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","364","402","0","6"

The heroes can be told where to go, and each have a couple abilities that can be activated to assist in combat, but they will auto-attack enemies in the room.

As diverse as the settings and gimmicks are, roguelikes have some things in common - as you get more and more powerful and you explore the world, the game tries to match your power with more powerful foes or new mechanics, and throughout the way the game tries to kill you when you make a wrong decision, get in a wrong area, or do a wrong step. This is not necessarily a bad thing - it gives a sense of challenge and a thrill that gives roguelikes its addictive charm.\n\nMost roguelikes also feature a huge number of mechanics and statistics that can be very daunting - for example, Tales of Maj'Eyal has at least six unique resources (health, mana, stamina, rage, hate, equilibrium), seven stats, at least 26 different types of damage, saving throws for physical, spell, and mind damage, resistances, resistance penetration, five types of speed (global, movement, spell, attack, mental)...you get it. The more unorthodox Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead has a complex crafting system, twenty-nine skills ranging from computer knowledge to tailoring expertise, and at least 102 feats for your character. All of this can be incredibly daunting to face for newbies and is a staple of the genre.\n\nDungeon of the Endless, however, breaks from that mold. The concepts and challenges are simple: find the exit, bring the Crystal to the exit, defend the crystal carrier against waves of enemies. There are only eight statistics all in all, with each character possessing a set of passive and active skills that will be seen as the character levels up. The skills and statistics are simple to understand and make use of.\n\nCompared to most roguelikes, Dungeon of the Endless is relatively gimmick-free: there is one non-random gimmick about characters killing one another due to their relationship, which is incredibly frustrating but is easily avoided in your next playthrough (unlike unbeatable scenarios in FTL or some "trap" areas in Tales of Maj'Eyal). If you lose, it's not the fault of the game as it usually is in roguelikes - it's all yours. Maybe you didn't think about watching your carrier's back; maybe you neglected defending a certain chokepoint, leading to your party getting flanked and killed.\n\nSince you know it's your mistake, you can determine what you did wrong and how you can prevent it next time. Not only is it a new game every single time, but you learn and refine your strategy, and you buckle down and see if you can make it to a deeper floor with your experience this time.\n\nDungeon of the Endless represents what a modern roguelike should aspire to be: a highly replayable game that provides a genuine, fair challenge that you can climb through and improve your skill in every playthrough.\n\n(I still like Tales of Maj'Eyal better. :3)\n\n10/10 gg","December 13, 2014","true","15.8"," 251 of 278 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","251","278","15","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tywyllach/recommended/249050/","Tywyllach","Overcooked Pineapple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tywyllach/","812 products in account","This review was done with the Founder Pack version.\n\nPretty fun game from what I've played so far. It's a tower defense dungeon crawler/RPG. For the stage the game is at the moment I think it's very polished and the artwork is fantastic. The game generates random dungeons so there is a lot of replayabilty.  Another thing that I thought that was neat was DOTE follows the lore of Endless Space (Another fantastic game, especially if you like a more simplistic Civ game in space). Which I think is a nice touch.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game if you like FTL (Faster than Light). Pretty similar gameplay but in a dungeon and you have to protect your Crystal reactor. Which you use to power up rooms with open slots for upgrades for industry,agriculture and science. Dust much like Endless Space is the currency but also doubles as a fuel source in this game. Which you would use to power up the rooms or to buy items from the merchant. Also you can level up your heros with agricuture, instead of experience like Endless Space. I think it would have been cool to get Xp from slaying mobs but it is still early access so the developers may change that (The developer is very active with the community and takes feedback. They also have votes for changes in the game via their forums that you got from buying the game).\n\nI'm going to play this game a lot more and would recommend it but to someone who hasn't played Endless Space (They use a lot of of the resources, tech trees and lore, that Endless Space uses.) or doesn't likes tower defense games. You should probably wait until it's on sale or when it's out of early access (As of right now there is only 3 levels).\n\nFounder Pack version notes:\n\nThis part of the review will go over the Founder pack extras that are included in-game and cross game. I'll add in the other in-game items and extras once they are released (Or if I even remember to :D). The to be released items and extras are the Ship Pack: The Library, the Hero: Josh 'Ntello, the Official soundtrack and Vaulterskins for Endless Legends (Game will be out next 2014).\n\nAt the moment you get 50% off for Endless Space and the expansion pack (This is an awesome game, a more simplicated Civ game in space with tons of lore), 2 community badges on the Amplitude forums (So you can feel special over people with no badges, just kidding) and The Vaulter faction for Endless Space. The Vaulter faction for Endless Space is a bit disapointing for me at least.\n\nI had a chance to play today and they do have nice stats and nice abilites but the ships were disapointing and also that there was no introduction video for their faction, like other factions have. They're really similar to the United Empire ships. Unlike the the Piligrims ships where you can see the differences in ship design there is little to none with the Vaulters. They just seem to be reskined United Empire ships like with the Sheredyn faction. Where as it's understandable with Sheredyn faction sense they're still close to the United Empire and were the Emperors  personal guards. But other then that, as of now the Founder pack was worth it (My opinion). Hopefully they will redesign the ships and add a introduction video in a future update.\n\nFounder Pack and can be a hit and miss for some and would recommend that you buy the Pixel pack instead, if you're unsure. Amplitude have been known to have an option to upgrade for Endless Space so it's possible that you will be able to upgrade later but at the same time it's a "Founder pack" it may be limited time only.\n\nUpdate: Now that the game has officially been released, a couple of things have changed. See below.\n\n- Currency is now randomized (FIDS) and is not just Dust. FIDS is Food, Industry, Dust and Food.\n\n- Science is now used to update modules and you research via Endless Artefact.\n\n- Updated the intro movie, main menu and some parts of the Hero UI. (I like it)\n\n- Soundtrack has been updated.\n\n- You can now save items in a backpack now, that are not in your heros inventory for the next level. (I was waiting so long for this)\n\n- Ships can be unlocked now, by completing certain conidtions in a successful playthough.\n\n- Heros can be unlocked now, by meeting them in a playthrough and meeting certain conditions.\n\n- Monuments also have been added which give random buffs or debuff for a  random duration.\n\n- And a multiplayer mode has been added but have yet to try it.\n\n- You have to click exit to move to the next level.\n\n- Loading screen to next level has been changed.\n\n- 13 levels to complete a playthough. Unlimited levels, if you use the Drill ship. (Unlockable)\n\n- Steam cards and Steam achievements have also been added with DOTE's release.\n\nMy thoughts; game is amazing now that it has released and awesome updates to the DOTE. Updates will probably be continued just like it's sister games ot the Endless Universe.","December 11, 2013","true","18.3"," 127 of 140 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","127","140","0","3"

But that was when it was in early access.\n\nNow this is a review for the game now it has been released.\n\nYou should be buying this already. Hell, you should have already bought it.\n\nHere's the deal. Do you like tower defence? Do you like roguelikes? Do you like dungeon crawling strategy type games? If the answer to all three is yes, then I can imagine your trepidation at hearing that this game combines all three, as I was nervous too. I mean there IS such a thing as too much of a good thing, and too many cooks spoil the broth, and sometimes many great things added together do not make an awesome thing...\n\nBut in this case you can lay your fears to rest. Dungeon of the Endless is an incredible game, so much fun, brutally difficult and very rewarding. It requires quick thinking, strategic planning, and a buttload of blind stupid balls-to-the-walls courage at times.\n\nThe BAD parts of this game is that the view is very zoomed in, and there are only two states to the view. Zoomed right the hell in, or zoomed right the hell out so it looks like a map screen. This DOES make things slightly awkward, especially if you have split your party to explore a particularly large dungeon, or if an attack comes from various areas of the map.\n\nSecondly it's unforgivingly hard, even on "Too Easy" mode. The game lies. Too Easy is still brutally hard. You will lose party members. You will get two floors with a new team member unscathed, only to have them die suddenly and unexpectedly during the rush to get the crystal to the next floor before you can unlock him or her fully.\n\nThirdly the pixelly graphics may not appeal to some. To me, personally, they are amazing, I love them. They've got a lot of charm, BUT I recognise that it isn't always everyone's thing. It CAN also make combat extremely confusing. Granted you don't have to directly target any enemies, but it's still difficult to watch lots of things at once.\n\nFinally the control system takes a little getting used to. It's simple enough to navitage everything via right clicks and left clicks and such but getting used to the UI and how it does equipping and everything is .... well it feels slightly counter-intuitive. An ability to click-drag items about would have been nice for example, and a quicker way to open/close inventory/stat panels too...\n\n\nNow for the good stuff:\n\nMusic? Really nice. Not too epic, sadly, but not annoying at all, or obnoxiously loud and grating, nor does it overwhelm you. The devs know when to use what music and it's very apparent that in that aspect their sound design is definately on the ball.\n\nGameplay mechanics? rock solid. Resource management and building, turret defence/augmentation placement, power management and placement, the Risk/reward nature of opening just one door or many doors for the added XP/loot multiplier at the risk of being overrun by swarms of enemies, the various different types of enemies and their priority targets, the sheer volume of characters and skills and strengths... The pure joy of opening a door and finding a merchant or item box and being able to equip something awesome is amazing. Finding cool little things like Steles or Research Artefacts is also great fun.\n\nAlso this game has an amazing, rather dark sense of humour. Characters make quips as they traverse between levels and as they open certain doors, they talk to each other, they crack jokes... The item/skill/module descriptions as well are ALWAYS worth reading too for a good chuckle.\n\nAs for a game that's come through Early Access? Incredible results. It's come out so polished and refined, and so full of meat and bones that it's become an even greater game for all the feedback the fans gave it. This is well worth your money and absolutely a lot of fun.\n\nJust be sure to prepare yourself for inevitable demise.","October 27, 2014","true","26.7"," 108 of 116 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","108","116","3","0"

It tricks you into thinking its just a roguelike dungeon crawler.  And if thats how you treat it, you will not last past the first floor.  It centers around exploring each level room by room, and once you locate the exit to the level, moving your power source to the exit.  You have to place your heroes tactically (at choke points basically), and build defenses around those heroes to harden their key positions around your power source.  This usually leaves only one hero remaining to explore.  Enemies spawn in random unpowered rooms you have discovered.  So, sometimes one of your heroes may get overwhelmed, and you will have to take advantage of the handy pause feature to make sure one of that hero is not getting totally butt-r***ed.  And, if he is, then you need to figure out which hero you can send to reinforce him.  Or, you can activate one of his, unique to each hero, cooldown skills.  Which will give him a temporary boost in combat.  Or, you could order him to run away.  Fleeing is always a viable option in this game.  The in-game currency revolves around entering new rooms.  For each new door you open you get a set amount of resources and/or currency which allows you to build extra defenses, hire another hero, level up your existing heroes, research better defenses, heal your heroes in combat, power new rooms (to set up new defenses), or buy new gear for your heroes.  Once you have opened a door, you cannot close it.  So, you have to be careful not to expose a flank route to your power source by brainlessly opening doors.\n\nThats kind of it in a nutshell.  I obviously recommend it, even in its alpha stage.  It has not crashed once for me, and is pretty content rich.  I can't wait for the game to be content complete.","April 25, 2014","true","11.3"," 88 of 90 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","88","90","0","1"

The object is to explore randomly generated floors all while defending your crystal. The crystal gets used to power rooms that you'll place defenses and harvesters that bring in extra science, food and industry for every new door that you open. Once you discover the exit, one of your party members needs to lug that crystal from the elevator to the exit as the floor floods with enemies. Any party member not in the room with the exit gets left behind if you chose to exit without them.\n\nYour characters will defend a room automatically and fix any damaged equipment if there's nothing happening. You only need to have your people in the right room at the right time. Its a fun and casual way to play the game. If someone gets too low on health, you can click a medical bag near your character's card to use food for more health. Some difficulties even replenish your health for each room or wave of monsters that you clear. You can spend food on each character to level up.\n\nThe more rooms of a floor that you clear out, the greater chance of enemy waves attacking. There are still rooms full of enemies, but its the waves that make things a true challenge. These waves will spawn in any room that isn't powered. Your foes can't go through doors and they'll only spawn in rooms you've uncovered so its best when you start a new floor to choose one door and work down that path instead of opening all four doors to each elevator.\n\nYou've got your choice of four characters from the start and plenty to unlock as you progress. You can find new recruits and purchase them with food, but that doesn't mean they're unlocked. In order to unlock them you need to have and keep them for at least a floor. The game lets you have a maximum of four per party and it can be difficult juggling them, because you can only control four at once. Under normal circumstances, I have three of them guard the crystal and explore with one.\n\nDungeon of the Endless has an amazing multiplayer that gives each player one character. Its a much easier experience. You pick a server locally, with your friends or even global. Then select who you want to be or let the game chose randomly and hop into a game. Once it starts no one else can join, even if a player drops out. When a character dies, they can't be revived and this goes for single player too! Instead you'll need to find a new character in the dungeon and recruit them. If you have more than one character under your control, you can pass them to another player. If you play global, its just as smooth as someone in your own region. The only issue that I have with the multiplayer is when the host leaves, the game ends!\n\nThe controls are easy, right click to move. That's it. Right click a door to open it and watch your character go to the door. Right click to interact with something. Right click your character icon to open their stats. Of course there are still hot keys and you can scroll the screen or focus in on your character. If you ever need to see the map, mouse wheel back to see the entire dungeon along with icons where the players, enemies and highlights are. Even see unopened doors in red. Its all streamlined, then mouse wheel forward again. Again, its super easy, a joy to play.\n\nAlong the way you'll find merchants to sell you things, but the game doesn't bog you down in equipment. Most characters have two or three equipment slots. There are science crystals that you spend science to research upgrades. You'll need to wait a while and open more doors before the research is complete, so don't spend science to research then exit the floor immediately. The recruits and merchants you find will also be attacked, so you'll need to defend them or they'll die.\n\nThere are plenty of things to find throughout the rooms: treasure chests, capsules to unlock at the cost of industry and even things that give you science, industry or food. Everything takes a second or two to unlock. Even doors take a while to open, but once they're open they can't be closed. An odd thing about the game is when you open a door, you've commit to walking into the room beyond it. So if its full of enemies, you will still walk in. Even a room full of enemies doesn't feel like a threat, you can still fallback to a room full of turrets that you've setup.\n\nAs for placing defenses, you can't just dump a bunch of turrets into a room, you need empty modules in a room to place modules. Some rooms don't even have any modules available, but 90% of them do and the trick is powering the rooms. You've got a limited amount of power your crystal can generate. If the crystal takes damage, it can power fewer rooms. Of course exploring will find more power to beef up your crystal and charge more areas. In terms of defenses, you've got health, defense and weapons. Defense things such as holograms that will attract enemies. Weapons like turrets, Tesla and sentries. New things can be unlocked at science crystals.\n\nOnce you find the exit, its best to deactivate some of the powered rooms in order to power ones along the path. After they're powered setup defenses, because when you pick up your crystal every door opens automatically. So every undiscovered enemy is activated, but more pressing than that are the waves of enemies that spawn.\n\nInstead of classes, there are characters. Each character has their own stats for speed, damage, health and so on. Every piece of equipment can change those stats slightly. Things will boost your speed while lowering your damage per second. Some characters use swords, others have a pistol or a gun. Characters all have their own defense needs, some rely on armor, shields or devices. These characters all look and feel unique to be and play as.\n\nDungeon of the Endless does have only fifteen floors before you'll need to play again from the start. So there is an end game for anyone that needs a goal. Its just reaching that fifteenth floor that is a challenge. Floors become longer, more difficult and dangerous, yet still doable.\n\nSince the game revolves around a sci-fi setting, the premise is simple, you've crash landed in your escape pod. Why am I telling you that now this deep into a review? Because its never an issue in the game, the only time it is an issue is before you start, you'll select your escape pod. After going through the game, you'll unlock different escape pods, each with its own perk. There are a few different difficulties, very easy and easy. I assume that you can unlock more, but after 8 hours into the game I still have two difficulties.\n\nAs for the graphics, they're simple and pixelated, yet still drip in atmosphere. Dungeon of the Endless is a dark and eerie sort of beautiful with a futuristic alien twist. The music gets relegated to ambiance and near chip tune music. Its barely a memory in my mind even after 8 hours of playing.\n\nWith everything said, Dungeon of the Endless is definitely worth your time for fans of both dungeon crawlers and tower defenders. This isn't a genre for everyone, but what's here is addictive, engrossing and easy to play.","April 18, 2015","true","17.9"," 89 of 92 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","89","92","4","0"

Simply opening doors without much thoughts will ONLY lead you to bad endings.\n\nLists below are what I believe to be the game's good parts and (rather than saying bad directly) parts that left me unsatisfied.\n\nGood parts\n+ Simple - collect and manage resources, survive the enemy waves, construct towers to help your heroes, RESEARCH: these are all you need to know to "endure" the challenges until you get the grasp of more details\n+ The simplicity is what makes the game really Fun as well! Its easy to get into and rogue like element makes every round different from each other\n+ Interesting characters to choose. Later into game, you would prioritize operator (for extra resource production) over other characters, but IT IS WORTH exploring other types too! They have their own unique taste of skills and playstyle.\n+ To be able to level up and equip heroes you love and enjoy playing so that they can be even more stronger and sometimes.. a little bit OP under certain circumstances\n+ Different dungeons to choose, finally managed to finished the first? Here comes the second with even harder (subjective) which may require different strategies\n+ THE JOY OF BEING ALIVE at the end of each round. Seriously, after dying so much times and failing to clear due to stupid mistakes, this relief makes you go on in the game\n+ Ridiculously hard sometimes - greatly recommended to those who enjoy challenges out there\n\nBad/Unsatisfactory parts\n- Lack of multiple saves system, basically you are stuck in one game to either beat or be crushed\n- Hard to play in a co-op game, as in barely any room to join (playing with 3 other friends instead is generally recommended rather than waiting)\n- After awhile, you can notice some heroes are plainly just more "useful", balancing is left to be desired\n\nSTILL the game is just amazing, I really did not expect for me to have this sort of intense fun when I bought the game\nTherefore, I would like to rate the game 9.5/10! :)","November 8, 2015","true","17.8"," 98 of 107 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","98","107","6","0"

Maybe the floor's exit would be in there, or it would lead to a hallway leading to the exit, or something, for God's sake every other area of this floor had been opened, it had to be in here...\n\nIt opened to a hallway with three doors... upon opening it, the dozens of unpowered rooms surrounding us burst forth with monsters, crawling in from every corner of the icy hellhole we were trapped in. We fought desperately, exhausted out abilities, lost countless turrets to the hordes that door had unleashed upon us, and what did we unlock for our efforts? The opportunity to open three brand new doors, to watch our defenses wither and die at the hands of the disgusting hellish bugs that lay behind these doors, there was no doubt, there was no lingering hope, no desperate chance... the team was too battered, our turrets and defenses worn ragged, the next wave would surely kill us.\n\nSquidward was the first to admit it, that we were going to die. I had tried to fill my team with optimism, but when he called it like it was, there was no denying it, the next door would kill us, so many monsters would spawn that we'd be overwhelmed, and die within seconds. "We're out of food, Handsome Burger's barely got any health left... I think this is where we all say our goodbyes." he typed, the text lingering on the screen in brutal silence. Burger responded promptly, "It's been an honor, bois." "Amen to that." I chimed in, all the while desperately wracking my brain for a solution to this impossible problem, trying to plan some kind of escape route or fullproof defense in my head, there had to be some way to change this, fate may be a fickle mistress, but this was beyond unfair, it had become a downright impossible run...\n\nNo. Nothing was impossible. Defending the next wave, perhaps, but with so much of the map already revealed, it had to be in one of the three...\n\n"Guys, don't open anything yet, I've got an idea."\n"Um... sure, ♥♥♥♥ it, what is it?" Squidward remarked.\n"We open all three at the same time."\n"You know, we could just abandon this one, not sure I feel like watching us die after all this."\n"One of them has to have the exit, we've checked everywhere else. We open all three, we see the exit, I run the crystal there, we escape."\n"What if they're all hallways, or empty rooms? Have you seen how this game has ♥♥♥♥ed us so far?"\n"Guys, we can't defend the crystal from the next wave, but if we throw up enough neurostun modules and slow them down a bit, we can outrun them to the exit. This is our one shot."\n"♥♥♥♥. I wish you weren't right..."\n"Let's do it."\n\nWe took our positions; Squidward, Burger, and Gray each stood before a door, and I sat beside the crystal, throwing what little indus I had left into neurostun modules along the path.\n\n"Ready?"\n"Ready."\n"RIP in pepperoni."\n\nThey activated the doors, and an eternity passed as they yawned open, my fingers hovered over the mouse, ready to desperately right click the crystal to freedom.\n\nDead end.\n\nDead end.\n\nHallway with a door.\n\n"OPEN IT NOWE," There was no time to spell check, the waves were coming, the map was filling with a wall of red dots, Burger triggered his slowing ability, and the neurostuns did their part, but as slow as the wave was, that didn't keep it from being pant-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly big.\n\nSquidward sprinted for what had to be the last door, and as it slowly opened, and as the fastest of the creeps burst into the crystal room and rabidly dove for me, I prayed to RNGesus for one last chance at freedom... that we could be free from this god-forsaken facility, and that we could taste the sweet clean air of the surface world that awaited us just behind that final door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree more doors.\n\n♥♥♥♥ this game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This game is worth $20. It costs $12. If you're a fan of strategic roguelike gameplay, you should buy this, sale or not. Don't freak out about DLC, just buy the pixel edition. This game doesn't shame you, there's no question mark heads eternally gracing your roster, it only shows who you have in your game, which is an incredibly respectful way to handle DLC in this day and age. If you come to love the game as you play it, the DLC's worth grabbing, but in multiplayer, if the host owns it, you can play it, so don't sweat it, and come hate this ♥♥♥♥ing game with us! :D)","January 2","true","93.1"," 80 of 87 people (92%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","92","80","87","57","0"

Tower Defense wasn't my "scene" and the pixelated (albeit stylized) graphics didn't grab me either. However, many of my gaming friends at "Octopus Overlords" were raving about it, so I eventually gave it a try. And I'm glad I did.\n\nIn the game, your crew of heroes must explore a floor of a spaceship to find the exit. Then, they must transport the generator/crystal to the exit to progress to the next floor, and ultimately exit and win the game. What really hooked me were the RPG elements built in to the game, where you can upgrade and customize your crew members, also outfitting them with weapons and gear. The random nature of each floor and the included encounters/events/surprises appealed to me too (but then, I'm a sucker for Rogue-like games). Lastly, as a gamer with a family, it's nice that each floor makes a satisfying, quick play session - convenient for when real life calls. (There is a "Save & Quit" option if needed mid-level).  And I haven't even gotten to the point where I've unlocked all of the ships and crewmembers to use.\n\nDrawbacks: The tutorial is short and not entirely helpful. I had to check the wiki for clarity on some of the game basics. (i.e. - Opening doors are the "turn" mechanism; You manually choose to level characters from their inventory/stat screens;etc.).  I haven't attempted multi-player, though it seems people are reporting problems at this date. (The developers are continuing to address this with patches.) I've not encountered any technical problems, on my mid-level gaming laptop.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It's surprised me with how much fun it has been, once I got the hang of it. To win me over to a genre that I usually avoid is high praise, in my opinion. My last thought (again, shared by an Octopus Overlord member): "Easy" level is hard. "Very easy" is normal.

And once we've lifted off, who cares if they figure out who was pulling them? No one on the ship will return to Mazen. Our future lies among the stars.\n\nThe Dungeon of the Endless Dungeon of the Endless is a hard and unforgiving game. It teaches its gameplay mechanics by making you die a thousand times over. With each run you'll find yourself in a different situation, can't find the elevator exit, not enough dust to power another set of rooms, not enough industry to create much needed modules etc. It's an addictive game. Each playthrough has twelve floors, which get much and much harder with every floor.\n\nSo many puppets A few hundred condemned criminals find themselves shipped on the prison ship "Success". Only for the ship to be shot by a nearby planets defensive system. A few escape pods flew off towards the planet, and crash deep inside an old facility of the Endless. The game has an roster of nineteen heroes, which are all very unique and fun to control. You start with two heroes and you can recruit two other random heroes you find deep inside the dungeon. With the big roster of heroes, you'll easily find a favorite. Each hero is balanced by his/her/its strength, defense, speed and DPS. The heroes are all set in three different factions: Prisoner, Crew or Native. This will also affect your group, heroes can have special conversations in the elevator rides in between the floors and they can have special buffs if heroes from the same factions are present in the room with each other.\n\nSo many strings Dungeon of the Endless has rouge-lite elements like FTL and The Binding of Isaac, RPG elements with its leveling and skill system, and tower defence elements with the modules that you need to protect yourself with. It's a weird combination of genres, but it works so amazingly fine. As said before, it's an addictive game, you'll die many times because of its hard and unforgiving nature. But sometimes it feels unfair and based around luck. You could've made this floor easily if only you choose the upper path instead of the path to the left. This is what I think every time I die, but that gives it just a little bit more of that addictiveness.\n\nConclusion Dungeon of the Endless is a true gem. A game that you see or hear little to nothing about on steam, but deserves so much more attention than that it gets. With a giant roster of great heroes, and a perfect mix of genres that you would've never suspected to even get mixed. The game can sometimes be based around luck a lot, making runs very unfair at times. That being said, Dungeon of the Endless is definitely worth your money. That is if you're up for a big challenge.\n\n9/10","November 23, 2014","true","31.3"," 86 of 105 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","86","105","3","0"

I would say that the game is amazing with one big caveat -- it's not balanced at the moment. The game's primary resource: Dust controls how many rooms you can have lit up or safe from enemy spawns. However getting the resource is entirely too random and it's the main game ender at the moment.\n\nNot having enough dust will leave you with multiple rooms that will spawn enemies and there is no way for you to cope even with the best defenses or heroes in the game.

It is a top-down real-time tactical squad-based tower defense RPG roguelike, which does not make any sense as a concept. It is also, somehow, very fun and vey hard and gives all the feelings of reward and tension and loss that a well-designed roguelike game should. On top of that, Amplitude puts an exceptional level of polish and awesome UI design into this and all their other games, more so than almost any AAA or indie titles I've ever seen.\n\nThe game plays a lot like FTL on a dungeon layout rather than inside a ship - you command your units to a certain room or door and they'll set about doing whatever task they can, but it's also topped with an equipment, level-up, and skills system that gives layer of individual investment in your heroes similar to 2000-era Infinity Engine RPGs. Within every floor of the dungeon, you're also gathering and investing resources into a sort of base-building system, using build-nodes and a power grid to either auto-generate more resources or to actively help your heroes in defending rooms. It all takes a lot of getting used to, but once you get enough of a grasp on all the systems to work towards understanding them better, they come together in a really satisfying way.\n\nThe soundtrack is very FTL as well (perhaps too FTL-like, even), noticeable but not overbearing space-y background tracks that feel fitting for whatever situation you're in. There's a large amount of flavor text across equipment, research, hero dialog, and other things like that, and everything I've seen of it has been generally informative and often surprisingly funny. The humor isn't the overt RPG-parody style of something like Dungeons of Dredmor, but more simple and under-stated in a way that's appropriate to the style and setting.\n\nThe one complaint I have so far is that there seems to be no way to move multiple heroes as a unit, at least not that I've found. I very often want 2 or more heroes to stay together or all get into one room ASAP, but my instinct to use click-and-drag style group selection does not work. It's kind of flow-breaking to instead select people one by one and then issue each of them the exact same movement command, and it makes breaching new rooms as a group or falling back to a different position more cumbersome and take a bit longer than it should. A very minor interface gripe in an experience that has otherwise been awesome. (**EDIT: Nevermind most of this paragraph - there is a way to set groups and quick-select those groups. But I still think click-and-drag selection would be the ideal.**)\n\nBottom-line short-form summary: This game is fun, and I have never played anything like it and maybe never will again. I'm not capable of recommending anything more highly than that.","November 24, 2014","true","16.4"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","45","50","0","0"

Part tower defence, part squad management and part roguelike.\n\nDoTE presents an interesting dilemma for the player; should I open this door? Ever door you open has the chance to make your escape to the next floor harder. Every room you don't run power too, and very rarely will you have enough power for every room, has a chance to spawn hordes of aleins who want you dead. You can slow their assault by building towers in powered rooms. You must also choose which resources to generate so you can afford more towers, tower upgrades or character levels. Everything in DoTE comes down to a simple choice: how hard do I want to make this for myself? All of this, with a helping of humour and increasing difficulty results in very rewarding risk/reward gameplay.\n\nThere is a wealth of characters in DoTE, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Their combined flavour texts makes for an interesting narrative and the various interactions between the characters in the post level screen is a very nice touch and makes the world feel alive. You will rectuit additional squad members  the deeping you dive into the dungeon, but you will have to decide who to sacrafice in order to create room for them as you can onyl have 4 squad members. Even unlocking new characters for future playthroughs has a risk/reward aspect to it as you must dive at least 3 floors into the dungeon with your new compainion before they are available to you for other playthroughs.\n\nThe only downsides to DoTE are in the multiplayer. At the time of writing this here are my issues:\n\nYou cannot create private multiplayer matches. This has resulted in me kicking many people (sorry!) when I only wanted to play with a friend.\n\nYou cannot trade items between player's characters outside of selling the items to the shop keeper and having them buy them.\n\nThe game tends to drop connections often and you cannot rejoin a game which effectively ends it.\n\nYou cannot save your progress in a multiplayer game and a game of DoTE can take a few hours so make sure you have nothing else you need to do before you start a game up.\n\nI hope that the devs iron out the technical issues so that multiplayer can be a more enjoyable experience.\n\nIn conclusion, I would highly reccomend this game despite its flaws in multiplayer. If you like rogue-likes and tower defence games you should definitely try this one out. It is a steal at only $14 (CAD) and some of the most fun I have had with a game in recent memory!\n\nTL;DR: Rogue-Like, Squad Management, Tower Defence. Very fun. Very cheap. Broken multiplayer.

I'd say if you enjoy tower defense games, roguelike mechanics, science fiction settings, and a subtle sense of humour, there is a high probability that you will enjoy this one. If you get easily frustrated or like strategy based only on skill, without an element of luck, perhaps this is not the game for you.\n\nPersonally, I love this game. It has all the right ingredients for me, and it's quickly become a favourite. I can't praise it enough.\n\nGood points:\n\n+Solid design and game mechanics.\n+Beautiful pixel art.\n+Immersive soundtrack and sound effects.\n+Great characters and subtle humour.\n+Endless replayability. Every game is different, and every combination of heroes and items will make you rethink your approach.\n+Good time versatility: you can either pick it up for half an hour or half a day. Though a complete run will require several hours to complete, once you know the game mechanics it's relatively easy to pick up a game partway through.\n+Relatively frequent updates. In a time where far too many games get abandoned in Early Access stage, finding developers that actually listen to the players and release updates seems such a rarity!\n\nPossible caveats:\n\n-I have not tested the multiplayer\n\n(The general consensus seems to be that it still needs some work. Same with some crashing issues. The developers seem to be aware and working on it.)\n\n-Difficulty spike towards the later levels. Even the easiest settings can be very, very challenging. This may make the game feel unbalanced.\n-On that same note, bear in mind that you require both skill and luck to win the game.\n\nThese points are not a problem for me, I've played old school roguelikes and this one feels pretty forgiving in comparison, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. A bad combination of items, heroes or rooms, and your late game may become nearly impossible. A good one, and you can win with much less effort (though a certain degree of skill is a must, and you will still be punished quite severely for acting foolishly or carelessly).\n\nI do like that element of luck, and find that any frustration vanishes fairly quickly in the face of the next challenge (a rarity for me these days, as I don't have much free time and seem to have grown old and grumpy when it comes to frustrating games). I  find luck a perk, rather, something that distinguishes this game from other roguelikes, and I think the immersion really helps, in my case.\n\n-Some extra content is unlocked separately\n\nI'm making a note of this because I've seen some nasty comments around. There is a special edition of the game (crystal pack) that unlocks an extra character and ship, but if you want the other extra character and ship you have to buy the special edition of Endless Legend, as well. I believe that the developers plan to later unlock this content, but are giving this option now for early supporters of their games, which I think is a fair strategy. I think this is much preferable to standard DLC, in any case. Your opinion may differ, so I think it is fair to give a warning.\n\n(Edited to correct a sneaky typo!)","November 29, 2014","true","55.1"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","30","34","0","0"

It also has an amazing retro pixel look, which is very aesthetically pleasing. I've honestly never played anything like this.

Every time you open a door, monsters spawn in all the unlit areas of the dungeon and try to attack your heroes and reach your base. You can stop them by attacking with your heroes or building defenses.\n\nAfter the wave of monsters is done, you are safe and may build or upgrade your structures. This phase plays a lot like a 4X game where you must manage food, research, and industry. Each room can a certain number of structures of various types, and some rooms contain existing structures.\n\nYour heroes themselves level up and gain skills as they would in an RPG. Death is permanent and when all your heroes die, you must restart the game from scratch.\n\nThere is a huge amount of replayability here due to the random elements and number of ships and characters you can choose. A typical game can take 3-4 hours.\n\nAs with roguelikes this is fairly difficult game, particularly if you play it on the harder difficulty (there are two difficilties, mislabelled "easy" and "very easy").

It makes the rest of the game meaningless; there's no strategy to an unwinnable floor. </edit>\n\nMy library is full of rogue-likes and I have hundreds of hours spent playing them, but I have a hard time recommending a game that a) leaves up a lot to chance while b) having extremely long completion times.   The number of times I made it to floor 12 only to lose because I got a double door-breaking rino spawn that I couldn't address because I can't control which enemies my character attacks was just too damn high.  It's not the deaths that are so bad - it's that it takes 2-3 hours to get through a run and to have it end because of nothing you did is just infuriating.\n\nThe run that finally turned me against this game was a run to floor 12 and there was not a single room in the 12 that I was able to check that had a place to put down a major module.  I had 700 industry saved up just to make generators and 4 characters at level 12 / 13 and there was nothing I could do.  I couldn't kill the swarms before they got to my crystal, and while I killed many of them, when you have 15 dust, you will lose that game of attrition.","October 7, 2015","false","29.1"," 198 of 319 people (62%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","62","198","319","24","13"

Now I only bought this game two weeks before release, but at that point it was already more polished and complete than most on release and now that is is officially out I am blown away by the quality!\n\nI just love this game for the randomness, but usually that isn't enough for me what makes this game special is every game feels like a new story. "Does this group have what it takes?" I find myself asking, "Is luck on my side today?" sometimes I find my way through the maze and beeline to the exit, (happened on floor 10 kinda scared me because its so damn huge and I found the exit so fast couldn't even power half the rooms on the way to the exit) and the writing for the characters is awesome! Sure they don't talk much but the descriptions, plus the few intertwining stories that you may or may not hear in the elevator really flesh out the characters to a point where I find myself making up relationships between them that might fit, or thinking about how much they must hate having to work together and I will even make up friendships between heroes that end up working together throught multiple floors. (sometimes i can even encorperate one of the "canon" stories into it and it just feels great)\nOn top of all that. is an amazing game that doesn't really have any peers (at least to my knowledge) sure it feels like FTL or Space Marines or what have you but it combines them all in such a way that it creates something revolutionary.

Its a great game that makes you think a bit (but not too hard!), punishes you fairly for bad decisions and helps you learn your way, but it isn't brutal on you (especially with the ability to pause at will with the spacebar).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepemustard/recommended/249050/","pepemustard","pepemustard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepemustard/","242 products in account","First off, I highly recommend this game for anyone that is looking to kill some time. It's definitely worth the money. I bought this during early access, and am usually hesitant of buying unfinished titles, due to some scoundrel developers taking the money and running with it, leaving gamers with a half-finished product. But Amplitude has a very good track record of not only finishing what they started, but also continuing with support well after the title has been released. This game is no exception. Just when I thought the game was finished, I stopped playing for a bit. I came back to this a week ago, only to find they added a bunch more characters, and new options when starting a new game. So a big kudos to them for being a developer that really puts the work into their games.\n\n\nNow on to the game.\n\nIt's simple, yet complex. Keep your guys alive, get out of the dungeon in one piece. But you can't just rush every level, or else you will skip out on collecting a lot of much needed resources and research opportunities. Opportunities you will desperately need later on. Open too many doors at once, or have a lot of unpowered rooms, and a swarm of enemies will come your way and end your game quick. It's a fine balance between greed and fear. Try to open one more door, to try and get just a bit more resources before going to the next level, you could be hammered with 5 waves of hell. But if you skip out on it, it might hurt you in the long run.\n\nSince dungeons are randomly generated, and so are things like weapons/armor/item/artifact locations, there is an element of luck to it. But once you get the hang of it, you can make it through most playthroughs even with some bad luck.\n\nThere is quite a bit of lighthearted humour from the characters in-game, which is right up my alley. From a woman who thinks she's a spider, to an overcompensating midget with a huge sword. They all have their quirks. It's not so much a band of heroes, as it is a group of unlikely misfits. You might even recognize characters from other games, such as Samus Aran..... errrr... I mean Sara Namus...\n\nThe game plays a lot like a turn-based tower defense. First you decide how to set up your defenses and production, then you begin the action phase by opening a door.  That's when it goes from "Okay, everything seems to be coming along fine, all hallways seem to be covered" to "CRAP! DON'T ATTACK THERE! THAT WAS MY FREAKING GENERATOR YOU JUST TRASHED YOU ♥♥♥♥♥!!!!"\n\nAll in all, as far as bang for your buck goes, I'd rate this title a 10/10. If you like cheesy humour and tower defense, don't hesitate to buy this game. You won't regret it.\n\nedit: Don't feel ashamed if you cried after losing on easy mode.....

The limited resource dust is aquired from exploring and killing enemies. You have to manage this resource to power rooms so you don't get overwhelmed.

But what if you need to transport the core to an exit point after finding it? This is what gives this game a really interesting system to it.\n\nBasically, you start out with the core, two people to start exploring and so called "Dust", which is currency and the life of the core at the same time. 10 dust is needed to power a room after exploring it. Powering it will result in being able to build structures in it and make enemies not be able to spawn. Opening doors will give you resources to build things, level up or heal your team. You gain Dust by exploring further and killing enemies, which allows you to expand your base in the course of the level. Your crew is the key to getting these resources as you can place members next to built resource stations to increase thier gain per opened door, also they act as moveable turrets to keep enemies away. If all of them die though, the game's over.\n\nAs the goal is to take the core and find the exit, it is important to power the right rooms, place your guys right and build the right structures. When you think you're ready for the heat, take the core by letting somebody pick it up and run for it, if the carrier dies though, it's also game over. When the core leaves the beginning of the level, enemies will spawn non-stop in every room that's not lit. Every room the core passes will not be powered any longer as the energy's not connecting to them anymore.\n\nSo far it seems like a really dynamic game and like a fresh idea to the genre, and for it's early Alpha stage the game still seems very finished when it comes to the design and the systematics. I am looking forward to the content as it's added to the game and happily recommend it to everyone that is into these kind of games.","December 12, 2013","true","5.5"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

The room I am in seems like a generator room with a bright yellow cube. I figure the woman should proceed first as she wields a sword which'd be better at close range and then I can send in the man to attack from a range. This worked efficiently and I managed to gather to enough resources to level up both my characters a few times.\n\nJOURNAL ENTRY #2\n- Warning symbols appear all around the generator room, I figure my objective is to protect that for now, so I use the woman's special ability which lets her move significantly faster to get back to the base. I make and it is swarmed by multiple enemies. My gunman follows and I use his special ability which buffs our damage in the room. We manage to fight off the enemies and return to exploring the ship. I now come across what I imagine to be an escape, so I grab the generator core and run using the woman's special ability to get out faster. We escape and that's floor one done.\n\nJOURNAL ENTRY #3\n- After upgrading my characters a few times and equipping them with the new gear found, I continue using the same strategy as before. After reaching a shop I spend a lot of money on new equipment for my characters. Bad idea, I now have no money to spend on health. Enemies appear in the next room so I send the sword wielding woman in to fight them and send the gunman back to base. A wave comes and I manage to fight them off, but I forget about the woman who sadly gets overwhelmed with enemies and dies. After two more waves I finally find the exit and escape. Alone.\n\nJOURNAL ENTRY #4\n- Alone on the next floor, I begin searching for the rooms, I find the exit almost instantly and figure it's my best interest to escape now so I can get a good score. I grab the generator and head down.\n\nJOURNAL ENTRY #5\n- This is where things start to get difficult. I begin by upgrading my character and saving enough money for healing. I start searching the rooms and each is a struggle. I narrowly survive each room and gather enough money to heal regularly. A wave is now incoming. I prepare by heading to the base. Enemies flood in from 3 directions and I fend them off the best I can.

The concept is simple. Every time you open a door you're given resources. You use those resources to power rooms (preventing monsters from spawning in them) and place machinery to gather more resources and act as defensive/offensive turrets. Of course it's not all that easy, each room has a chance to contain monsters, useful items, blueprints for more machinery and additional people that you can hire.\n\nThe goal, get your power crystal at the start room to the exit, when you find it. Each play is randomised so you're never sure what's going to be behind that next door!\n\nOf course there are lots of other elements in there beyond this. Each member of your team has their own stats and abilities which you can level up at the cost of food. Placing them in a room with a machine increases its efficiency but of course this means spreading your team out. If a machine is destroyed so is the building platform making the room much less useful. It goes on and on.\n\nRegarding the Alpha. Game length seems limited right now, you get three dungeon runs before you win but of course each run is different so the limit really is more to do with leveling your team than actual play time. This really is a state whereby the mechanics are being tested rather than the content. The developer is keen to engage with players and encourages feedback and voting on features. And the future feature list is quite extensive.\n\nAs I said at the start. If you like FTL then this should suit you down to the ground, it's Alpha but it's very much playable and will be fun to see it grow into a full release.","January 5, 2014","true","6.4"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","2"

Think dungeon keeper as a rogue-like but with only a few units, and heavily influenced by RPG mechanics. Basically, you start out in a randomly generated dungeon, and your goal is to find a room with the exit. All rooms can be "powered", which means enemy monsters will not spawn in them, and allows you to build all sorts of defenses, offenses, and resource generators. Whenever you open up a new room, it is counted as you taking your turn. Once you take your turn, enemy monsters will spawn in rooms that you do not have enough resources or "dust" to power up, and try to attack either your heroes or your crystal which is like your "heart." If all your guys die, or your crystal's dust reaches 0, you lose and have to make a new game. It gets increasingly tricky to balance everything as you get into later levels, so you'll die a lot at first.\n\nPros:\n- Randomness makes each playthrough unique.\n- Even though your heroes just sit there auto attacking enemies, you have to constantly watch their health bars and be ready to use active abilities or micro them to another room. It can get a little frantic.\n- Music and sound effects are great and totally pleasing.\n- Strategic placement of modules and traps is rewarding.\n- Self-Powered Rooms.\n- Heroes have a decent amount of variation and customization.\n- The art looks cooler as the game progresses.\n\nCons:\n- There could be a little more variation in random occurances in rooms. After a little more than a few playthroughs, I had seen all the random room events. Off the top of my head I can think of many more which wouldn't be hard to implement, such as "Trade a hero permanently for 50 food?" or "Trade 30 science for 20 dust and 20 industry?" Very simple things to spice rooms up a little more.\n- Multiplayer has given me and my friends a lot of headaches. I keep trying to play with people and I get disconnected, or I get de-synced. I haven't been able to get past a couple levels without something going awry, so I have nothing else to say about the rest of multiplayer.\n- Slightly lacking in variation of mobs. I was hoping there was a "boss" mob or randomly generated super enemies. After one-two playthroughs, you won't see any different mobs unless you got further than you did the last time.\n\nMisc:\n- For all the RPG elements in the game, it's weird they didn't include critical hits. At least I haven't seen any.\n","December 31, 2014","true","53.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

It's not that much of a tower defense game (even though it has strong influences from the genre, like waves after waves of mobs and module/tower building) as it is a resource-management and a survival game.\n\nThis game is step-based, meaning you have to open doors in the dungeon, and after each door is opened you gain resources depending on how many active modules you have and an action phase starts where mobs rush to your crystal room. Game is real-time during the action phase, but it can be paused to plan your strategy accordingly.\n\nThere is a lot of depth in this game from things like:\n- many heroes, all of them with stat progressions, levels, abilities and personalities\n- many constructable minor and major modules, that offer effects to your rooms, heroes or resources\n- research system, that allows you to unlock module tech by spending science\n- item system that lets you tweak heroes in various ways (each hero can hold 3 items in special slots)\n- though monsters, most of them with special effects\n- interesting progressive dungeon rooms, with good visuals, and many bonuses to be explored\n\nBonus points:\n- great minimalistic artstyle\n- soothing soundtrack\n- great gameplay\n- future potential as the devs continue to develop it\n- devs are great and they are updating the game frequently\n- endless hours of fun\n- challenging gameplay\n\nBad points:\n- can be too difficult\n- still in early development\n\nI really recommend this game to anyone that wants a challenge and a good old rogue-like, with a modern feel.","October 11, 2014","true","30.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

To transition floors, you must use a crystal to power the elevator.  But the crystal is heavy and fragile, and everything living inside the dungeon wants to kill it above all other things.\n\nAlong the way you'll encounter new "heroes"--some of these individuals have histories with one another (for better or worse) and each represents a unique set of potential skills in getting the hell out of the dungeon.  You'll also find an anachronistic mix of equipment--swords and machineguns, textbooks and jumpsuits--for outfitting these characters.\n\nWhile heroes will be your primary way of interacting with the dungeon (and the only way to get the crystal from one elevator to the next) you will also need to research and develop a whole host of "modules" that bolster your defenses against the dungeon hordes while your heroes search for the next exit.  There are modules for generating new sources of science (needed to research and upgrade new modules), food (needed to level-up heroes), and industry (needed to actually BUILD modules), modules for killing different kinds of creatures, modules for defense and healing, etc.  Suffice to say, your heroes probably won't get very far unless you're actively researching and developing new modules.\n\nThere's also a fourth resource simply called "Dust", which is required to power rooms.  Modules only function in powered rooms, and powered rooms prevent monsters from spawning in them.  To keep your defenses functioning and your heroes from being mauled by monstrous swarms, you'll need to carefully route and re-route power to rooms as you explore each floor.\n\nBut for as complex as the game can be, there's an efficiency to it that makes it easy to learn but challenging to master.  There's no obligatory grinding, or dead-end research trees to waste time on, or useless skills to invest in.  You can rush through each map as quickly as it takes you to find the exit, and ignore research or heroes (at your own peril).  Everything that exists in the game has a valid role or use, with few (if any) "traps" to watch out for.  And that's nice, frankly, because you'll be experimenting with a lot of different strategies and dying a lot in the process.\n\nSpeaking of dying, there are a few issues with the game that may sour opinions.  For starters, dungeons can be downright stingy with Dust--the aforementioned resource that powers modules and rooms--later on in the game.  If you're not prepared for the chagrin of the RNG, a Dust-shortage can rapidly spell disaster.  Fortunately there are numerous solutions to this scenario, including Emergency Generators, Shop modules, and hero-specific skills and items that promote Dust collection...but most of them require at least a little foresight.  I don't think it's a huge issue, but some players may disagree.\n\nThere's also one enemy that really doesn't work well with the game's mechanics.  It has a chance to spawn in later rooms where it mutates into a powerfully "tanky" and immobile monster.  Although it doesn't pose an immediate threat to your heroes, it must be killed for the game to consider the wave ended.  As a result you'll frequently have situations where everything's dead except for one (or more) of these things, they've already grown into their final form, and now you've got your heroes on rotation, taking turns whittling its health down and stepping out of the room to heal.  Alternatively, you've got to break defenses and rush out to kill them as quickly as possible...but then your (wounded) hero has to kite the inevitable horde of angry creatures back to a powered room and hope it doesn't overwhelm them.  Neither scenario really adds anything to the game.\n\nFor the most part, though, Amplitude--a company known for approaching things a little differently--really delivered on Dungeon of the Endless.  It's not a perfect recipe but it's incredibly novel and, between the variety of unique heroes, loot, modules, and "ships" (game modes), there's a significant degree of replayability in a compact package.  The average player will find it to be thoroughly challenging while rarely feeling cheap or unfair.\n\nThen again, the RNG is not always forgiving.","April 11","true","174.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","2"

I wish I had an option somewhere between yes and no. This is fun, but ultimately it is almost entirely ruled by a random number generator. I had a good time figuring out the mechanics, but after the fifth dungeon where I was only offered terrible upgrades (a mixture of hero oriented and tower oriented upgrades which did not play well together) and received almost no dust for opening doors in a highly branched and un-linear environement (thus being unable to reduce mob spawns or place defence effectively) I got pretty frustrated. I suppose that's the nature of "rogue-likes", but even Angband would allow you to regenerate a level if you got dealt total crap (assuming you could find an up staircase). In this game, if you get dealt awful it will follow you until you die (probably somewhere around level 6 or 7). It's the biggest failling of this game. Sometimes (frequently?) you will be handed a pile of steaming crap. In other rogue type games, part of the skillset is being able to recognize this and bailing appropriately. In this game, one bad level will follow you since your resource totals persist over levels, mobs get increasingly harder as you descend, and there is no going back to earlier levels if you had to bail due to terrible RNG. If there had been some option to redo a very unlucky level, I'd give this a yes. As it stands, your only option is to go deeper and there were many, many games where I knew I was done for well before I actually died. If the developers had offered some way to mitigate this, I would give this an unhesitanting thumbs up. Unfortunately, they didn't.","November 27, 2014","false","27.3"," 77 of 136 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","77","136","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Koopah/recommended/249050/","Koopah","Koopah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Koopah/","558 products in account","Now here's a game with some choice meat on it. Dungeon of the Endless is a sci-fi rogue-like/dungeon crawler/RTS/TD hybrid where you control a team of explorers trying to escape an underground dungeon that they crash landed into from outer space. You create a team of varied heroes, who all have different feats and strengths to climb this dungeon floor by floor. Each floor is randomized every time and to clear each floor you have to explore unlit closed rooms for an exit to bring your power crystal to the next floor. Each room you open gives you resources to either level up your crew, plant resource generators, or create towers to help defend you against monsters. Here's the catch, each unlit room has the chance to spawn monsters which will fight your heroes or ultimately attack your power crystal. You can light up each room by placing a hero in that room or by using a resource called dust, which can be collected by killing monsters or found randomly in unlit rooms. If your crystal is destroyed, or your heroes all die, you lose the game and must start a new randomized run from the ground floor.\n\nThe game plays like an RTS, in that you control your heroes from a top down perspective with only your mouse. It feels like an RPG because you can level up and collect loot for your crew, and you can also pause time by pressing the space bar. However, it is crucial in your survival to learn the TD aspect of creating minor towers to help you defend your crystal. Finally the perma-death "everything goes away" along with the "everything is randomly generated" gives it that touch of rogue-like that everyone loves these days. This game is the true definition of a hybrid if I've ever seen one.\n\nFair warning, the game is HARD. There's a strong difficulty curve when playing on what I can only see as a developer joke of a difficulty labeled "easy". It is not easy, you will die and you will die a lot. But like other rogues, the game has that patented addictive element of "just one more floor".\n\nMultiplayer is currently busted, so I can't really comment on it. There's lag spikes, desynchs which cause disconnects with no reconnect feature, and no item share functionality. If you do get a game working without disconnects, the co-op is pretty great. But do not get your hopes up, as currently it's a problem 90% of the time.\n\nHowever as a single player experience, this fairs very, very well. It's definitely a new favorite of mine to spend time with. Between the simply gorgeous art style, the very good soundtrack, and the interesting mish-mash of game elements that somehow just work, this game is an insanely good time. Highly recommended.","January 18, 2015","true","15.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Your crew is consisted of 2 to 4 heroes, which have their own skills, stats, intentory, background story and dialogue. Upon landing you explore the dungeon by opening doors to other rooms, which are hidden in a fog of war, until you open them. Every door opening counts as a turn. Each turn you gain resources, which you can then spend on: building modules which generate more resources or assist your heroes in various ways; constructing turrets and such in rooms you have already visited and sent power to; shopping for equipment and leveling up your heroes. Your ultimate goal is to find an exit/elevator on each floor and to deliver the 'crystal' you start off with in a first room to the elevator.\n\nThe catch is: every 'unpowered' room you discover has a chance to spawn monsters every time you open a door. Every monster will then proceed to attack your crystal, reducing your 'dust'(A currency, required to power rooms which also serves as crystal's HP) until it's depleted. Also as soon as you take your crystal off its place - there is no turning back, monsters will spawn in every room and begin attacking you until you reach the elevator.\n\nYour progress is not limited to just leveling up your heroes and giving them equipment. Tons of random events occur in a dungeon, which offer you to hire new heroes in your party, trade your resources for a powerful equipment and research over a dozen turrets, modules and other ways to defend your crystal as you proceed through the floors.\n\nThe game features a great amount of unlockable content. Characters, starting setups and an artwork gallery. Its replayability is totally on the highest of levels. Especially considering that every piece of equipment found inside a dungeon is generated with random stats.\n\nGame also features a multiplayer mode, which adds more tactical depth since you can divide the roles and do whatever you wanted to but lacked a partner controlling a character in a singleplayer mode.\n\nTL;DR : A great party dungeon crawler with a randomly generated floor structures, deep tower defense features, unique and interesting pre-made heroes and a great replayability value because of the unlocks. Also music. The soundtrack is very good.","October 28, 2014","true","36.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Every one of which could put you in a slightly better position, dramatically worse position, or end your game completely.\n\nDotE is a very unique experience that combines RPG-roguelike, tower defense, and resource management elementals into a single game - and somehow it manages to do so quite well. Every turn you have to weigh your options: Should you spend food to level up a team member? Should you hold on to it in case you need it for healing? Should you spend precious materials on defenses before you open the next door? Should you even open the next door at all? Maybe it's better to head for exit while things are relatively safe.. Research new defenses?.. Research better resource production? Maybe you should just hold on to those research points in case you happen to run across a merchant who uses them as currency.. Maybe you should head north.. maybe east.. Maybe you should cut the power to one room and risk monsters spawning there next turn in order to power another room and make that section safer.\n\nThis game is a constant struggle with choices.. and more often than not you don't know in advance which is the better option in the remote or even immediate future.

Once you learn your basic skills and get some confidence be carefull it is very easy to become over confident and this will lead to a quick and painful death!

It has a great art style, and brings new ideas to the table when it comes to the roguelike genre. Here's the kicker: it's not balanced. This might require some explanation.\n\nYou start the game off with 2 heroes and they gain minor stat increases and activated abilities by leveling up. To level up it takes food. Your ability to get food is based on the number of rooms you can power using dust which drops off monsters. Now it seems pretty straightfoward that you should unpower rooms in order to accumulate more dust from monsters, but if you spawn more monsters it gets harder every time you open another room. Also, if you unpower rooms you can't accumulate income from the modules you place, and the turrets and support modules won't work in that room. So you want to be saving up industry, food and science but you can't do that if you unpower rooms.\n\nDungeon of the Endless actively punishes the player for doing well, making it more difficult to push their advantages. It also becomes extremely deadly when the player is behind on item upgrades, industry and dust. To me, at least, that is the polar opposite of how a roguelike game should be balanced. It's just not fun!\n\nEach run of this game takes a TON of hours to complete. There's 12 floors in a run and if you want to succeed you really need to open nearly every door per floor. It's the only way to get resources, so you have to! The game gets repetitive really quickly in this way. I really wish they would trim down the floors per run. It would feel more roguelike increasing the enemy diversity you encounter per floor.\n\nAnother problem is the number of enemies the game spawns negates the level of effort put into art design. Have fun watching a pixelated sword flash inside a mob of 40 pixelated enemies which would like awesome if there were only a few but endless is definitely the correct term for the number of enemies spawning.\n\nI also have found the concept of using heroes in a turret defense, but placing more weight on research and turrets quite confusing. They have spent considerable time developing these characters and putting them in the spotlight but discouraging gameplay revolved around leveling your heroes quickly.\n\nI'll mention briefly all merchants were bugged on release, however the devs have caught on and said it's being fixed in their next patch. Unfortunately the bug made the game virtually unplayable as your items could get stuck in your inventory, and merchants are the primary source of upgrades for your heroes.\n\nMultiplayer seems tacked on, much like Risk of Rain's multiplayer which is still quite buggy. Most community posts concerning multiplayer have been negative. Honestly I don't know why roguelikes are even including multiplayer it's really not the point!\n\nUnless something BIG happens to change the game balance I simply can't reccomend Dungeon of the Endless. The experience has been more frustrating than fun, albeit some interesting concepts.","November 8, 2014","false","10.9"," 121 of 223 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","121","223","6","0"

Comes highly recommended to fans of tower defense and rough-lite games since death is permanent and every level is randomized.\n\n\nGame Detail\nName: Dungeons of The Endless\nDeveloper: Amplitude Studio [Endless Space, Endless Legends]\nGenre: Tower Defense, Resource Management, Rogue-lite\nPersonal Score: Hard but is cushion enough to never blame the game but instead each mistake is yours alone.\n\nWhat is Dungeon of The Endless? From Amplitude Studios, maker of such fine strategy games Endless Space and Endless Legends comes a game that does not match their portfolio at all, Dungeon of The Endless; a rogue-lite 2D dungeon escaping game with a dash of tower defense and resource management where every resources count and the RNG hates you.\n\nDespite being their first foray into this genre they took what works and throws out what doesnt and in the end we are left with a compact,clean and functional game where the RNG actually adds level of fun instead of pure hate and grind. Read on.\n\n\nShort Intro\nYou are a prisoner sent to a new world where it shall be your duty to colonize it but just above the planet your prisoncraft explodes plunging you straight towards the planet below and stright into the bowels of an Endless Underground Complex.\n\nWill you escape towards the surface? Or will you perish along with the others?\n\n\n1:Graphics\n2D retro style graphics that is from the 90s style not the horrible 80s one. That means delicious looking bits of colourful pixel where it is detailed enough for us to know what we are looking at yet vague enough for us to assume a little bit.\n\nIncluded within the game is an album that fills up as you accomplish objectives showing short bio about the characters and monster as if it is written by a mysterious omni-present being. Beautifully done stuff overall.\n\n\n2:Music And Sound\nFans of the Endless series rejoice for once again Amplitude has included within your game directory the soundtrack for the game as they have always done. Melodious and well crafted music flows along as chiptune version of their usual fare brighthens up your day in the dark dungeons or in situation where all hopes are lost, carries you forward to the next game.\n\n\n3:Gameplay\nYou start the game in your chosen escape pod with 2 heroes inside and as you progress through the game, more escape pods for your future session that has their own pros and cons to consider although the starting pod is the most balance thankfully.\n\nThe gameplay is fundamentally about you defending a crystal as you open doors after doors that each count as a turn and watch in horror as your supplies dwindle, the monster kills you and a myriad of other things. The crystal serve 3 function, providing you with dust so you can power up rooms and make sure nothing spawns there and as the power souce you need to escape from the current floor you are in once you found the exit. Its destruction means the end of the game session and even minor damage can easily set you back in precious Dust which does not carry over to the enxt floor.\n\nProtecting your crystal are heroes that you control up to a maximum party of 4. They can be hired with Food if you happen to find them in the dungeon and you start the game with a few of thems. Each hero are vaguely divided into several classes with the hard hitting bruiser and the fast speedster serving as an example. Conversely their class type also reflects upon their stats and equipment allowed. A trickster type simply would not be able to carry weapons with them but they serve as an important utility with their myriad of skills.\n\nAs you open doors which serve as a turn indicator, monsters and other random events can happen to you and without spoiling things the theme of the floor often reflects on the danger that lies behind these doors. Enemies are divided into several sub-types that have different priority with an anti hero monster will target the hero, an anti-crystal will go straight for the crystal and boss enemy will destroy everything in their wake. They only ever spawn in dark unpowered rooms but considering doors and room outnumber your Dust resources by several magnitude you often find yourself being swarm by them the moment you open doors.\n\nTo help you with that the game allows you to build modules and turrets to help lessen the diffculity a bit. Turrets and modules uses your precious industry point and science point to for both research and building purposes. Many types of turrets do not attack but give buffs and debuffs instead but sad to say any turrets you have built will be lost when you reach the next floor. Modules make you industry, science and food points respectively but their cost goes up as you place more but more efficient module can be research.... at the cost of more resource point.\n\nIndustry point serves as your base building points and the occasional random room where you gamble it for goodies, science points are spent at artifacts room for researching new modules and turrets and lastly food points are used to heal, level up and recruit more heroes. But the little wrench in the whole things are the merchants, randomly spawning in rooms they demand one of your resource point for items that are useful for your hero but the thing is they will sometimes charge in Dust , your most precious resource used to power up rooms to stop monster spawn.\n\nMore heroes are unlock along with new escape pods as you play through the game.\n\n\nConclusion  Once again Amplitude Studios produce the same minimalist game with the same great quality soundtrack as they have always been known for and it sure is great. Death while harsh is still cushioned confortably by the game so even the loss of 2 of your heroes does not spell doom for your game session. Overall a great rouge-lite game.\n\nFinal Verdict: Do it. Buy it.\n\nTips!\nIndusty point is your greatest weakness early on, try to upgrade its module and carefully watch where you are spending but by late game you are swimming in dough.\nMerchants sell items.... they also buy. So while you can only save 4 junks to carry to the next floor it might be wish to hold on to them should you find a merchant who can buy it from you.\nThe most badass hero often gets targeted first otherwise the game defaults to first come first serve in regard to the enemy ai so use it to your advantage.\nEasy is misleading, choose Too Easy First to familiarize yourself with the game.\n\nLastly my name is Chlorique Queas and thank you for reading my review of Dungeons of The Endless.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

However the game is sooo good that you dont really give a ♥♥♥♥ about them.\n\nNo joke. Thats how good it is.. Seriously though i really hope the developers polish this game up and fix alot of the issues with multiplayer. Having no save function in multiplayer means having to commit to atleast 3-6+ hours. Which isnt ideal... another huge problem is no reconnectability.. soo if you DC, it's curtains to you and your 3-6+ hours of time spent.\n\nThere are also a small amount of flat out glitches in the  game.. like somtimes you cant buy or sell from a merchant. Or sometimes your cant equip your items..It just makes things more difficult sometimes.. Its funny though, even though ive been ♥♥♥♥ed over countless times by those glitches, i still play because its just that good.\n\nIt almost feels like they want it to be, not only hard in game, but also hard IRL.. playing in co-op requires TONS of teamwork, and having no voice chat funtions in-game, no reconnectability and no save makes it feel like they dont want you to play with friends..\n\nEven though this game has its issues i cannot argue with the gameplay. The amount of strategy needed in this game is absurd.. The kinds of ideas and decisions you need to come up with to make it out of your first shuttle is rediculous. Its not just hard because all the mobs are diverse and all priotize their attack on different things.. its not just hard because it requires you to spend resources efficently.. its hard because it forces you to think and prepare for any little thing that might happen.. Its like having a knife fight with RNGesus.\n\nThe graphics are classic 32bit style, extremely well done.. the lighting is amazing and the effects are extremely pleasing to the eye.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing.. it gives you chills while youre playing especially in the most tense moments.\n\nThis game is a master piece and deserves to be in everyones library.\n\n10/10 = Single Player\n\n8/10 = Multiplayer (FIX YOUR BEAUTIFUL GAME...

It also carries the inevitable pondering a potentially deadly situation and permadeath punch of a true roguelike.\n\nThe core mechanic is exploring a dungeon level to find a rare resource 'dust' in order to power rooms to carry your crystal from a central location to the 'exit'. Dust is always in short supply, and so you will find yourself forced to leave rooms unpowered. Unpowered rooms allow a variety of incresingly powerful monsters to spawn, who will attack towards your crystal.\n\nYou can use module slots located in each of the rooms to power either major modules (which give a resource boost); minor modules (which assist your chracters) or turrets, which defend the rooms. Balancing these out will be key to  a successful run.\n\nThe characters trying to escape are varied and range across a variety of skills and playtypes, and finding a combination that plays to your micromanagement style (or lack thereof) is one of th egame's brilliant design features. Esepcailly when a key character dies and you're forced to substitute them with someone you're not as comfortable with/have to learn, or make do without.\n\nA lot of love has gone into the level and character design, and the pixel art is terrific. Sadly, the music from the launch trailer vastly outstrips anything in the game itself (and is also not on the soundtrack, for some unfathomable reason).\n\nThis is a great game to experience core elements of different genres at the same time, without getting bogged down in the trappings of each (it allows the player a great deal of freedom in how to approach the game, at least initially). Highly recommended, but also fair warning: this will not be an 'easy' win for the casual or AAA gamer--mistakes come swiftly and are fatal.","November 3, 2014","true","55.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

A 'turn' is triggered when you open a new door, and once you open all doors on a floor (unless there is some other way to generate resources outside of discovery and 'turns'), you're at an impasse until the next floor.\n\nThe visuals appear retro in their pixelated designs, but are exquisitely intricate. Shadows move dynamically, lasers illuminate the environment, lights glow eerily in darkened rooms; it's really something to lay eyes upon and it looks spectacular in motion.\n\nI'm yet to complete this game on what I think is the highest difficulty (labelling everything with variants of easy doesn't distill much confidence), but I've had a blast doing it.\n\nIt doesn't take much time for a single playthrough (even less so if you're terrible at it like I am), and it is cruel but rarely unfair. Be ready for the monster house that you unleash with the removal of your crystal.\n\nOnly real gripes with the game are minor ones: the fonts used in the menus does not align with the visual aspect (modern vs retro), and anyone that has played Endless Space is going to notice the FIDS icons used to denote the currencies for research, levelling up and construction in all of their crisp glory which clashes wtih the game's general aesthetic. I get that the Endless (currently at a trilogy: Space/Dungeon/Legend) games are linked (which I think is cool), but it's still a little jarring given the overall style of DotE.\n\nAll-in-all, I love what I've played of this game thus far (Steam game time is not 100% accurate as I have spent some time playing this on my daily train rides to work), and look forward to continuing to fail miserably in the future.

Try your hand at it. You will be pleasantly surprised :-)\n\nEDIT: I would not buy this for the co-op multiplayer mode, unless you have friends to play with.

Very challenging, totally unique and fresh.\n\nHere's some tips. Learn how the game works. There is a ton to take in, but the game is so addicting it only takes one session to learn all the hidden rules. Think 32 bit arcade Dark Souls Co-op.\n\nA tip on movement. If you need to gain some distance from an enemy to fire ranged shots. Click to a different room, (away from mobs) than reclick the room that you and the mobs are in and you'll turn back around and start firing.\n\nCriticism: Game is likely at it's funnest when playing with competent friends. However, there are a few functionalities that put a direct negativity to multiplayer.\n\n1: Not being able to save the game while in multiplayer is dissapointing. I agree it shouldn't be so simple as "oh lets save a 3 player progressed game and I'll just finish it later by myself." But we were at it for 3 hours and only got to the 7th level of the 12 levels on the first dungeon. Now the idea is kind of cool to do it all in one sitting, which if you can do, that'd probably be best. But some gamers are workers too, and might not be able to commit 6 hours for on session game. What I'd like to see is a "group save" function, where the save file is only accessible if all involved players are present.\n\n2: Keeping criticism 1 in mind with how long the session can last and how you can't save, you also can't re-join any game you somehow DC from. 3 and half hours of progress then "poof." Gone. You lost the hero you almost earned, and your mates will have to try and carry on without you. This happened to me and it was extremely dissapointing (because this game is extremely good.) After surviving hordes and hordes of some of the most difficult mobs, no one wants to die indefinitely to server problems.\n\n3: It's far easier to earn new heroes playing solo, since in a party of 3, there can be only one more hero added to the party and can only be controlled by a single player and only that single player will earn  that hero. Which from a different perspective may seem like "only the ones who earn the hero get the hero" but to me it's just a reason to not play multiplayer, which this game shouldn't be doing.\n\nIn summary, embrace the multiplayer. Make it a bit friendlier. Other than that, awesome game. 4/5 stars.\n\nOne more thing. The 32 bit art in this game is gorgeous.","October 29, 2014","true","32.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

A blend of beautiful pixelated graphics, fantastic music, addictive gameplay, and replayability galore. As one of it's trailer perfectly describes, it's a "pixel art, old school, squad-based, adventure, tower defense strategy dungeon rogue-like roleplaying game", and not to forget that it has MULTIPLAYER. Boy does it mix everything well.\n\nAt it's very core, it's a rogue-like, where you take turns by walking into different rooms, discovering something, and typically fighting spawning monsters. However, you can also build buildings that generate resources and towers that, like in a tower defense, just blast away at the monsters. You also can meet up with other characters that can join you along the adventure, and traders. In the end, you have to take your crystal from the elevator to the exit, which will progress you to the next level.\n\nDoes that sound convoluted? Probably, which is why at first I was hesistant to buy this game. It seemed like a cluster♥♥♥♥ of different game modes meshed together. Believe me, it's pretty simple to grasp the concept of the game once you start playing it.\n\nI also want to give a special shout out to the multiplayer in this game, which is AMAZING. Imagine playing an already-awesome game with your best friends. Ugh, so much fun. The only con with the game comes here which is that you can't save multiplayer games to resume them later.

This game has everyting a gamer would love, little bit of rpg, big chunk of tower defense, and big scoop of strategizing.\n\nThere are just so many things you have to keep in mind, so many trials and erros, and the fact that it's all randomized each time you play is just pure genius. Yes, indeed you also need some luck due to the fact that it's randomized, but that's what makes this game THE game.\n\nEven though it's so frustrating at times it just makes it that much more satisfying to finally beat it, it is so challenging that you don't want to try the "too easy" option, it brings out the inner gamer competitiveness in you (seriously don't puss out and do "too easy").\n\nAt first you may go "WTF this ain't no RPG man you cant even control the damn heroes the way you want!", but as you play the game you will realize how ♥♥♥♥ing wrong you were.\nThis game IS RPG, maybe not the RPG you are normally used to, which is what makes this game so unique! Just that hint of RPG, the roles of heroes that you need in a group, the dream team, it just makes my inner nerd so HARD.\n\nYou seriously have to put your soul in this game, you have to figure out every little details to fully enjoy it. It is so simple that it's complicated, this game will test your limits and to break those limits you will have to use everything you learn and know about the game to beat it every.single.time.\n\nIn all, to me the best part of the game honestly was the ending scene, it has no fancy cinematic or anything at all, just one mother♥♥♥♥ing epic cutscene, it makes everyting just so worthwhile, too epic, so majestic. It just makes you want to beat it again with different heroes.\n\nDO NOT get this game if you are impatient or if you do not have good game senses, I guarantee that you will probably stop playing after couple hours.\nIt is a VERY hard game so I recommend you play with at least 1 or 2 really good friends that you can communicate with at all times, or else you are going to have a bad time. COMMUNICATION IS KEY (you can trade all resources with other players at any time, don't hoard resources if you don't need them, ask for resources!)\n-You can trade resources by clicking your resources at top left of the screen-\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSOME TIPS: Leaving a hero in a unpowered room makes it so that it's "slightly lit", which makes it so that mobs don't spawn from that room. THIS IS KEY TO WINNING, so make sure to place them strategically after each waves and such before opening any more doors.\n\nNever get the same module updates as other players, pick a role and stick with it, DO NOT get greddy.\nIt is also important that you play this game like any other RPGs, pick a tank, dps, support.\n\nI recommend having 1 range dps, 1 tanker, 1 runner (fastest movement speed for crystal run at the end of floor), and a operator with high wits for that extra resource boost when operating major modules.\n\nI also recommend getting Tear Gas and Smoking Gun for offense because with those 2 combos you will melt the ♥♥♥♥ out of mobs with ease. (Tear Gas is ♥♥♥♥ing dope, that defense reduce so sexy as hell)\n\nEvery other minor modules are not really necessary to beat the game, other than Autodoc Shards for heals really late game. What I did was have a room full of Autodoc Shards as a back up "healing room" for emergencies or for fighting bosses that appears late games.\n\nPrisoner Prods are also good for cheap defense for early games and such, upgrade them ASAP for easy wins early floors.\n\nAlthough not necessary to win the game it will be a lifesaver to have the Emergency Generator major module for late games when dusts are rare as ♥♥♥♥.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are still some annoying glitches such as not being able to buy or sell ♥♥♥♥ to the merchant, which can be a HUGE pain in the ♥♥♥ esp late game, but bear with it and just play the game through.\nThis however is easily fixable during a solo play by saving and quitting then just continuing the game again (for some reason this fixes everyting, yay :D). Still a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ since you obviously can not do this during a multiplayer game.\n\nWith this in mind you will have the best chance to beat the game, it will still take incredible amount of replays to get it just right, so be patient and hope for the best.\n\nBUT SERIOUSLY BUY THE GAME AND PLAY IT, ENJOY!\n\nP.S. no you can not trade items with other players sooo don't be hogging all the chest you come by.","November 7, 2014","true","39.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Yes, indeed you also need some luck due to the fact that it's randomized, but that's what makes this game THE game.\n\nEven though it's so frustrating at times it just makes it that much more satisfying to finally beat it, it is so challenging that you don't want to try the "too easy" option, it brings out the inner gamer competitiveness in you (seriously don't puss out and do "too easy").\n\nAt first you may go "WTF this ain't no RPG man you cant even control the damn heroes the way you want!", but as you play the game you will realize how ♥♥♥♥ing wrong you were.\nThis game IS RPG, maybe not the RPG you are normally used to, which is what makes this game so unique! Just that hint of RPG, the roles of heroes that you need in a group, the dream team, it just makes my inner nerd so HARD.\n\nYou seriously have to put your soul in this game, you have to figure out every little details to fully enjoy it. It is so simple that it's complicated, this game will test your limits and to break those limits you will have to use everything you learn and know about the game to beat it every.single.time.\n\nIn all, to me the best part of the game honestly was the ending scene, it has no fancy cinematic or anything at all, just one mother♥♥♥♥ing epic cutscene, it makes everyting just so worthwhile, too epic, so majestic. It just makes you want to beat it again with different heroes.\n\nDO NOT get this game if you are impatient or if you do not have good game senses, I guarantee that you will probably stop playing after couple hours.\nIt is a VERY hard game so I recommend you play with at least 1 or 2 really good friends that you can communicate with at all times, or else you are going to have a bad time. COMMUNICATION IS KEY (you can trade all resources with other players at any time, don't hoard resources if you don't need them, ask for resources!)\n-You can trade resources by clicking your resources at top left of the screen-\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSOME TIPS: Leaving a hero in a unpowered room makes it so that it's "slightly lit", which makes it so that mobs don't spawn from that room. THIS IS KEY TO WINNING, so make sure to place them strategically after each waves and such before opening any more doors.\n\nNever get the same module updates as other players, pick a role and stick with it, DO NOT get greddy.\nIt is also important that you play this game like any other RPGs, pick a tank, dps, support.\n\nI recommend having 1 range dps, 1 tanker, 1 runner (fastest movement speed for crystal run at the end of floor), and a operator with high wits for that extra resource boost when operating major modules.\n\nI also recommend getting Tear Gas and Smoking Gun for offense because with those 2 combos you will melt the ♥♥♥♥ out of mobs with ease. (Tear Gas is ♥♥♥♥ing dope, that defense reduce so sexy as hell)\n\nEvery other minor modules are not really necessary to beat the game, other than Autodoc Shards for heals really late game. What I did was have a room full of Autodoc Shards as a back up "healing room" for emergencies or for fighting bosses that appears late games.\n\nPrisoner Prods are also good for cheap defense for early games and such, upgrade them ASAP for easy wins early floors.\n\nAlthough not necessary to win the game it will be a lifesaver to have the Emergency Generator major module for late games when dusts are rare as ♥♥♥♥.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are still some annoying glitches such as not being able to buy or sell ♥♥♥♥ to the merchant, which can be a HUGE pain in the ♥♥♥ esp late game, but bear with it and just play the game through.\nThis however is easily fixable during a solo play by saving and quitting then just continuing the game again (for some reason this fixes everyting, yay :D). Still a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ since you obviously can not do this during a multiplayer game.\n\nWith this in mind you will have the best chance to beat the game, it will still take incredible amount of replays to get it just right, so be patient and hope for the best.\n\nBUT SERIOUSLY BUY THE GAME AND PLAY IT, ENJOY!\n\nP.S. no you can not trade items with other players sooo don't be hogging all the chest you come by.","November 7, 2014","true","39.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The lore ties into their other 2 games (Endless Legend, Endless Space), and there is a feeling of awe as you discover bits of the lore.\n\nThis game is basically a 4x-towerdefense-roguelikelike. The resource management has a lot of similarities to a 4x game and you sure have to explore/expand/exterminate and to some degree exploit. To really optimize your play, you have to consider some TD elements: wave management and turret choice (and Hero location) is very important, but the feel of the game is very roguelike. Failed runs feel like roguelike failed runs.

After playing it for several hours, I can say that skepticism wasn't warranted. It may have some aspects of those types of games, but don't udnerestimate it.\n\nWith quite an extensive amount of content (unlockables) and replayability (procedural generation) I can see myself sticking with this game for quite a while. One major gripe, though, is the inability to save in multiplayer; when playing with other people you're in it for the long run.\n\nJust a warning, even on Very Easy, it's tough and unforgiving. It's a game of planning, strategy, and reflex. Good luck.","December 25, 2014","true","14.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Throw the following genres: tower defense, strategy, RPG, economy management, dungeon crawler and a tiny breeze of gambling into a mixer and have a delicious juice. I'm not sure how to describe the result, so just let us stick to the name 'Dungeon of the Endless.' The game acts in the 'Endless Universe' like 'Endless Space' and 'Endless Legend'. Unlike the other 2 games is 'Dungeon of the Endless'no 4X game, but if you have already played an Endless title, then you will notice, that the game shares the same background story (most notably races) and the typical ressources like Dust, Food, Industry and Science, which is pretty great. The Endless universe is awesome and it's really adorable to see, how AMPLITUDE Studios is handling it and how different AND successful games of the same universe can be.\n\nBefore you can start your journey you have to choose a capsule and your starting hero(es). Why a capsule? Because your spaceship will blow up and you're forced to make an emergency landing (story at store page)! There are several unlockable capsules to choose from and each provides a different challenge. Your objective is to defend your energy crystal, to find an exit in form of an elevator and to finally carry your crystal to the exit (which will summon endless hordes of monsters), stage after stage (most capsules have 12 random generated stages) until you have reached the surface...alive. You don't navigate your characters directly, instead you can send them from room to room and they automatically engage in combat, once they've reached the target area. Skills, levelups, healing, research, building and vendor actions are completely under your control.\n\nTo find the exit you'll have to open A LOT of doors. One newly opened door = one turn. You will gain ressources (Industry - needed for modules, Science - needed for research, Food - needed for healing + lvlup, Dust - needed to light up dark rooms) according to your production rate. You never know, what's hiding behind a closed door. It can be a group of monsters, recruitable people, monsters, a vendor, monsters, resources, monsters, research stations, monsters, the exit or nothing. More monsters can only spawn in dark rooms after every turn. They don't have to, but they can. You can switch the light on for 10 dust per room, but you're only able to light up a room, which is next to an already powered room and the power supply always has to be connected all the way to your crystal. Usually you're not able to light up the whole stage and this is the point, where the real fun begins. You have to spread your power and make decisions, where and how you want to put up your defenses and how to move on with your exploration. There are very different types of enemies. Some will hunt your people, others are magically attracted by your crystal, some prefer to simply destroy all your modules and others...oh god how I hate them...want to open even more doors, which can lead to a total apocalypse. Luckily you can research and upgrade loads of different modules to increase your production and defense, but usually you will have a hard time, which will force you to grind and open more doors. It will become an addiction, even if you don't really need more at the moment, but more is always better, right? Right. And then the moment will come: stage 10, 11 or 12, everything is fine, just one more door and boooom, hell on Auriga, 2 hours wasted, AGAIN. So keep in mind: one single door can lead to a massive escalation. Don't become to greedy, especially if you've already found the exit!\n\n\nPro:\nunique and interesting game concept\nlovely artstyle and animations\nunique and very different characters\nfunny elevator conversations\nrandom generated levels\ndifferent capsules provide interesting different challenges\nhigh replayability\nit shares the same fictional universe, ergo references, and resources like it's the case in Endless Space and Endless Legend\nloads of different modular units\nit makes fun with friends\naddictive\n\nContra:\nit could need a higher number of different items\nitems like armor or weapons don't change the visual look\nmore possible conversations would be nice\nonly 2 difficulties and even the easiest one can become very in brutal in the last stages often\nmultiplayer has still some connection problems -> Devs are working on it\nno save function and midgame join option in multiplayer (your game is doomed, if one of your friends disconnects or you have to go) -> Devs are working on it\n\nConclusion:\nThe game has triggered a door addiction for me. I could wander all day long through my home and open doors, close them and open them again...so satisfying, aw yeah. On a more serious note: the game is pretty great, addicting and the blend of different game genres works surprisingly well, which turns the game into something purely unique. My experience in single- and multiplayer was very good. However, the multiplayer has still some flaws like connection problems and no save/load function, which can ruin the fun sometimes, but the devs are aware of it and are working on it. If you're merely looking for a great multiplayer experience, then you should definitely wait for the update and keep your money in your pocket, BUT don't forget about this gem of game. If you prefer to play alone or don't have any friends (please insert 'forever alone meme'), then I can really recommend it to you. There are some things, which could be improved in my opinion and along with the multiplayer flaws I have to give 'Dungeon of the Endless' a 7/10 for now. The game deserves a 8/10, once the multiplayer is really finished. It's still a great game!\n\n\n7/10 ...just one more door\n\n\n----------------------\n~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion?

Wait there is more then 1 tab which I can build from?\nYou continue to find more monsters and some loot to equip for your characters and find the exit.\nYou are like: "How do I continue?" and after a while you find out that you can pick-up the crystal from the start and go to the exit to the next floor. But as you try to do that and forgot to lit up some rooms with your dust you get swarmed by all monsters that spawn from the "Exit event" and die.\n\nPros:\n- Fun to play after you found out how to play\n- Strategy elements are really needed to win the game\n- A run on easy can take up to 3-4 hours. Which you can split up into multiple segments by save and exit.\n- Multiplayer can cause ultimate chaos for you (and your friends)!\n- Unlockables, every char you have to survive a few floor with before you unlock them and to unlock each new ship you have to win the game with the last ship you earned or achievements!\n- Game get regurarly updated with some new content and its bugfixes.\n\nCons:\n- As of now the multiplayer still has a few bugs if the host or someone who joins times out for a few seconds, which makes the one who joined invisible for the host (however this can lead to some exploits like double loot from a room)\n- You need to learn how to play the game before you can actually start enjoying it.\n- If RNG isnt on your side in the later floors you can get f**ked real hard and fast.\n- Micro-managing can be a pain in the butt.\n\nConclusion:\nDungeon of the Endless can be a endless pain if you dont know what you are supposed to do. But as you progress and start to learn more as you go on this game is endlessly fun. Every run is unique due to the random layouts on each floor. You can have a floor with no monsters and then your next floor nothing can be lit up. RNG decides a lot in this game which is a good and a bad thing.\nIf I had to give this game a score it would be around a 8/10","February 11, 2015","true","75.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/recommended/249050/","ksempac","Ksempac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/","303 products in account","A very good surprise ! Based on the trailer, i was expecting a basic roguelike or a "roguelike-like" (like FTL or Binding of Isaac). So i was expecting something interesting, but not very original. But it turns out Dungeon of the Endless is a completely unique mix of roguelike, tower defense and ressource management.\n\nThe game asks you to explore a dungeon with a group of 1 to 4 heroes. But each time you open a new door, it starts a new "turn". At the start of each turn, each dark room may spawn monsters. You have to clear all the monsters of that wave to "end the turn", and get automatic and full healing of your heroes. When the turn is over, you're free to build more stuff, change the inventory of your heroes, etc. The game is in a suspended test until you feel ready to open a new door.\n\nI talked about building stuff, because that's the second part of the game, the tower defense aspect. Your heroes do not have to face enemies all by themselves, you can build offensive and defensive structures, that will hopefully stop the monster waves. You have many available buildings, so figuring out the best way to lighten the load for your heroes is of critical importance.\n\nThe last part, the resource management, comes from the fact that 3 buildings are here to produce 3 resources. Industry is what you have to pay to build. Science is what you have to pay to research new technologies. Food is what you use to heal and level up your heroes. The last ressources is gained automatically but is in very short supply: Energy is what you use to power a room. A powered room is automatically lit, and therefore can't spawn monsters, but also is required to build structures. A structure doesnt work unless it's in a powered room.\n\nSo, with a limited amount of resources, and building spaces available, you have to figure out how to maximize the resources you currently need and also prepare for the future, as the latter floors will be deadly. The goal of the game is "simply" to reach the exit of each floor, until you get to the last floor and can finally escape the dungeon.\n\nAs i said, Dungeon of the Endless was a very good surprise, i wasn't expecting that. Once i got the hang of the system, the game became very addictive, it definitely has that "One more turn" aspect that all turn-by-turn gamers know well enough. You always want to open one more door, until you notice it's 2 AM and you should have been to bed a long time ago. It's hard to leave the game when your in the middle of a run, and want to know what will happen to your crew. Somehow, i've logged more than 30h in my first week of play, even though it felt like half that, because i was so engaged in the game.\n\nDungeon of the Endless also manage to be fairly accessible. Though it doesn't explain all its mechanisms and you will have to figure some stuff out it offers two difficulty modes "Too Easy" and "Easy" (yes the developers are cheeky) to cater to different groups of people. Too easy difficulty should please people who aren't too familiar with roguelike mechanisms, or people who just want to enjoy the game without having too much trouble. Easy difficulty is definitely 2 steps above that, and should please people used to roguelikes, or games such as FTL.\n\nMoreover the game has good replayability. First you get many different characters, who are all interesting to discover, unlock and play with. Moreover you will be able to unlock new "Escape pods", which change the game rules, and therefore the playstyle you will have to use. One pod gives you stronger heroes and weaker buildings, one pod is the opposite, and others pods mix things even more. Some will even up the difficulty quite a bit for those looking for a greater challenge.\n\nAn interesting twist is you can also play the game online, with others people, which change the rules a bit and will also increase the replayability.\n\nTo sum it up, Dungeon of the Endless has a pretty artstyle, a unique and interesting gameplay, a very diverse and well made cast of characters, and has good replayability. Definitely a big thumbs up for me !","April 26, 2015","true","44.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rscarrab/recommended/249050/","rscarrab","Sändningar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rscarrab/","123 products in account","Introduction:\n\nDoTE is an interesting take on Tower Defense, coupled with what should be turn-based RPG, Rouge-like squad combat.\nInitially i was gonna give this one a pass, considering i dislike the turn-based aspect. But here the combat itself is done in real-time, so i thought id give it a go.\n\nThe only turn-based aspect to this title, is in essence; the opening of doors. Once you open a door, you are commiting your turn. Resources wont generate in real-time, instead they will increase based on each turn (door opened). Though i may have very little experience in the case of turn-based games (never played FTL, for instance), i would say that this game is as close as ill get to enjoying one.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe pixel art style here is done very well, especially on the characters. The environments are nice too, each varying style of floor have their own theme. Though maybe they are slightly *too* static, in places. Admittedly there are some animated effects that compliment rooms, like blinking rats, candles and toxic/electro-magnetic 'aura's' (which in the case of the last two; play into the game mechanics).\n\nIdle and movement character animations were very well-done and add a lot of flavour to the style. I was hoping for more variation in attack animations for each Hero, though. Yet at the same time i will say that they are more than adequate.\n\nThe UI/menu presentation is of its own style and its non-obtrusive and easy on the eyes. Players are given the option between a large/small UI/HUD based on their own personal preference.\n\nAudio:\n\nWhoever did the music, has really nailed the atmosphere for this game. Probably one of the best aspects to this game, i think. The sound effects themselves are adequate, nothing bad about them, nor is there anything overly impressive about them either. There is no spoken dialogue, yet there are text based conversations between Heroes.\n\nGameplay:\n\nTo put it simply; its turn-based tower defense with real-time combat. You move, in real-time, your group of up to 4 Heroes through a procedurally generated dungeon. Enemies/monsters wont have a chance at spawning until you open a door, so its important to plan before opening too many doors. You can place Minor/Major modules (Automated Weapons/Resources) which is where this game gets its Tower Defense tag from. To expand on that, the player is constantly having to choose between risk/reward. For instance; do i save my resources for the next floor? Or do i increase the amount of weaponry (Minor Modules) i have in this current floor, to aid my Heroes? Its quite risky hanging onto your resources and hoping your Heroes will get the job done, on their own. Yet if it pays off, come the next floor (or many after, due to an overabundance of resources), if you manage to succeed.\n\nThere have been many times where ive lost a Hero or two, because i attempted to hoard my resources. This is by far the most challenging aspect of the game for me. As im constantly trying to ensure i use 'just enough' Minor/Major Modules to keep my neck above the water, so i can bank enough resources for the next floor.\n\nThe combat itself, which was an important aspect for me buying this game, doesnt give you direct control of your Heroes attacks. Rather you have real-time control of their movements and their attacks are automatic, if in the same room as enemies.\n\nA wide variety of strategies can be deployed based on your Hero setup and/or your preferred play-style. This gives the player the sense that he/she can beat this game in a variety of ways. Which is a good thing. For instance, you could level up your Heroes and Tactical HUD Modules to increase their stats and effectiveness in combat. Alternatively you could research Minor Modules which come in the form of base defense weaponry, focus on accumulating more science points and upgrading those weapons further. That wont necessarily increase your Heroes stats in combat, but will increase their chances if they occupy the same room.\n\nBoth of those strategies will require quite differing tactics in order to succeed. I tend to use the latter and got as far as attempting to hoard enough resources so i could afford the former. That lead to my eventual death on the 11th floor.\n\nNarrative:\n\nThis game definitely has its own edge in humour. Which is mainly played out through small story arcs that happen between certain Heroes if they are grouped together. Some of the dialogue/bio's got a few chuckles out of me alright, especially the midget who is obsessed with his disparity in height, so much so that he has worked his muscles and upper-body strength to the point where he can wield over-sized weaponry. Inbetween levels, in the elevator, he said something to another Hero that made me lose it. Ill omit that considering i believe it belongs in the game, not this review. ;)\n\nIf certain Heroes are grouped together for enough time (ie. levels/floors), their dialogue will eventually lead to an end in their story which will have either a positive or negative effect on both of them. This gives the narratives a purpose, as in, its not just tacked on. Its complimentary.\n\nOverall:\n\nA solid offering. I was pleasantly surprised at how much i ended up enjoying this game. Initially i was very aprehensive as i really dont like turn-based games, but i believe that DoTE should appeal to both fans of turn-based games, and those who arent but have an interest in tower defense with squad based combat.

It's not easy at all (despite the fact that the initial difficulty levels are labelled easy and too easy) and you are going to die, a lot. The music also has a chiptuny, retro-style which fits well with the graphics assets.\n\nThe game style is a very nice blend of RPG, tower defense strategy and roguelike games. There is a constant feeling of uncertainty and fear, since stuff happens whenever you open a door: you might find new loot or something/someone else, you might trigger a mighty horde of monsters coming for you, your resource nodes, defences and/or your energy crystal (which, if it breaks, leads you to a game over). Resources are scarce so you will have to think well how to spend them; moreover, the fact that the dungeons are procedurally generated means that such a strategy will have to change whenever you restart the game.\nDuring the game you can research for new weapons (both static defenses and items for your heroes) and for new, better resource nodes.\n\nTo me, it feels like a board game (a feeling that is enhanced even more in multi player) that changes every time you play; the board game closest to Dungeon of the Endless I can think of is Munchkin: whenever you open a door, you don't know what you will get. Riches? Monsters? Even worse? Nobody knows, but -- unlike in Munchkin -- at least your companions won't turn against you. :)\n\nIf you like roguelike or tactical games with strategic elements and you're a fan of sci-fi settings in general, I highly recommend you Dungeon of the Endless.\n\nMy vote: 8/10\n\nUpdate 20/12/2014: Upped my vote from 7.5 to 8 as the game is really growing on me. I've died countless times already yet I keep coming back for more.\n\nUpdate 27/12/2014: added a Munchkin reference, for those who know the board game.","December 19, 2014","true","34.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But is it really so? Let's find out.\n\nThe game starts with two characters chosen from a pool of sixteen (many of them locked at the beginning) on a crashed spaceship. Their only source of energy is a crystal they must protect at all costs, and their objective will be to escape the "dungeon" where they have landed. The dungeon has twelve random generated floors, each of them considered a level. On each level, you explore the rooms in search for an elevator to take you to the next one. But it's not enough to find it. Once you find the elevator, you have to carry the crystal there.\n\nBoth in the exploration and the transport phases, monsters will attack you, but in different ways. Here comes a key element of DotE: the dynamic combination of real-time and turn-based gameplay. A new turn begins each time you open a door. At this moment, you receive resources and monsters spawn. From this point, you control your characters in real time to fight the monsters or build new defenses. When you take the crystal to carry it to the elevator, the game becomes full real-time, with monsters spawning continuously until you reach the level exit. Or die.\n\nThe game takes elements from different genres. First, you have a party of up to four characters. You start with two and recruit more during the exploration. Some will die, and death is permanent, so you'll need to hire replacements. Each character has three item slots that can vary from one to another, in which you can equip stuff found on chests or bought from merchants. They also have a particular level system: you don't level up by fighting monsters and getting experience points, you level up by spending food (one of the resources avaliable) on the characters. Higher levels lead to better stats and new abilities, both active and passive. Characters are different enough to have different gameplay styles.\n\nNext you have the resource system. There are four resources in this game: industry to build things, science to research new things, food to heal and level up your heros, and dust to lit rooms. Lit rooms allows you to build things in them, and also prevents monster from spawning. You can increase your production in any of the first three resources by building modules, but dust is only obtained when found through the dungeon, and resets at every new floor. There are also a lot of minor modules to build. From stat bonuses to plain offensive towers to enemy mind control modules.\n\nDotE comes with two difficulties: "very easy" and "easy", which in fact mean normal and hard, respectively, and also some pods that determine certain gameplay changes, like no health regeneration in exchange for better heals with food. This, in combination with the different character choices and research decisions, help to increase the game lifespan.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a highly original game, an unique combination of genres with an identify of its own, and probably one of the best indies of the last year. It's hard and it's punishing, and many gameplay aspects are left for you to discover for yourself, but beating it is really rewarding.","April 2, 2015","true","28.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I think a brief description of the game might be the best way to help you decide if it is for you:\n\nIn Dungeon of the Endless, your goal is to ultimately lead a band of unique characters out of a dungeon.    To do so, you must open new doors in each floor to find the elevator that takes you to the next level.  As a part of the game mechanic, the opening of each door counts as a turn.  Similar to the beacon jumping in FTL, everything happens within the turn is executed in real-time.\n\nThe dungeon is dangerous and unforgiving place!  Research and build towers to help you survive.  Don't let the name fool you!!  The dungeon itself is not endless; it only takes 3-4 hours to finish a successful run.  However, finishing your first successful run can be a different story!!

However it has not grown on me after many hours.\n\n-there is virtually no reward for defeating monsters, only a small chance to gain 1 dust which is not kept between floors. even the large special enemies in the last floors yield nothing at all. you have to spend science and/or food in combat and you risk damage to your structures/heroes, so combat quickly feels like an undesirable chore and even a risk that discourages exhaustive exploration later on.\n\n-my first experience with the character story interactions was that the quick blue girl outright kills my fat rambo tank dude. This crippled my team in combat and the only thing I got from it was like +10% attack and -5% defense on the blue girl. I haven't seen any other interactions that are that bad, but the rewards are always something with almost no impact at all, which brings me to the next problem:\n\n-everything is a drop in the bucket. leveling and equipping your team, improving structures and farming resources - all these things progress painfully slowly, the best you can hope for is to very slightly improve your crew on each floor and still break even on resources. only rarely do you get something satisfying like a new weapon or ability from a levelup that affects your game right away. everything else is just about very slowly accumulating tiny bonuses. they do add up eventually, but it takes hours to reach that point. Winning is slow, but losing is slower. when you lose something important like a character or resource structures, the game slows to a crawl. you'll have to spend more resources for cooldowns/heals in combat, you might lose structures, you might lose dust. much like the incremental progression, your defeat in this game will be excruciatingly drawn out - the more ♥♥♥♥ed you are the more ♥♥♥♥ed you get, you will scrape by with 2-3 characters and make it to the elevator but you know exactly that you have no chance to beat the game anymore. Genuine game overs don't happen because you will just throw the game and start over instead of wasting half an hour trying to get as far as possible.\n\n-the tower defense aspect is very weak. there's only one turret available at the start, new ones must be researched with resources and cost 200-300% more to construct than the basic one. you will notice that it is not possible to "funnel" enemies the way I know I love to do in tower defense. if you get lucky with the layout you might be able to defend several paths to your core, but never all of them - the core itself cannot house any turrets, you would have to build turrets all around it which is just too expensive and not even reliable as they are quite weak and fragile when unattended (anything you build can be destroyed by enemies). overall turrets are expensive and unflexible, they will often be useless because half the enemies will use a path they don't cover.\n\n\nTL; DR\ncombat is a chore, progression happens extremely slowly with barely noticeable unsatisfying increments, tower defense works out poorly due to the need to fight enemies in multiple rooms, setbacks like loss of a character or dust are a huge bummer you will not recover from and will snowball to kill you very slowly, RNG is mostly frustrating\n\nthese concepts and mechanics are the only things I have a problem with. the audio is ok, characters are cool, visuals are great. if you like spending hours slightly increasing and decreasing numbers, this game might be for you.","December 12, 2014","false","17.8"," 77 of 145 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","77","145","0","0"

And why do I restart every time? But first let’s take a look at this gem which keeps me nailed to the screen for hours. DotE is the third "Endless" Installment from Amplitude. You don’t need to know the other 2 and you don’t need to have played them. The story is simple: A Prison Space Ship crashes into an unknown planet, releasing its "cargo", prisoners and guards. Here they are, our newborn heroes. We should call them anti-heroes, because they are all pretty messed up, brutal, sociopath, misanthropic but at the same time, funny. If your humor is coloured black as mine is you will laugh a dozen times. Every hero has it’s own background, special abilities and some of them have a special connection, which you, the player, shall unfold. The game delivers everything in wonderful pixel-art, combined with a chilling, sci-fi soundtrack, so...\n\nHow to play?\n\nThis is the core of this game. It is a mixture of tower-defense, rogue-like, dungeon crawling and RPG. These 4 components fit together in a very unique, yet pretty awesome way, I would call it "easy to learn, nearly impossible to master!”. Your task is to protect an energy-producing crystal, starting in a random stage, trying to get it to the exit. While this sounds simple on paper it gets pretty hard in reality. You start with 2 heroes, whom you pick just before entering the dungeon. Getting deeper into the dungeon you may or may not meet other heroes. First thoughts: Which one should I pick before entering? A Melee with good attack and defense? A ranged one? Or an intelligent contender, caring for your modules, producing more resources. Speaking of resources and modules. You are crawling through the dungeon, room by room. Every opened door rewards with ressources: Wisdom, Industry, Food and Dust. Industry is used for building stuff, wisdom to research new modules, food to heal or level-up your heroes. Dust is special. Your crystal needs it to produce more energy, because every room needs energy if you want to install modules or turrets. And you will need turrets. Not only resources but monsters will await behind every opened door. And to make it even harder, every room not getting energy from your crystal will possibly spawn new mobs. And they all know one target: the crystal! Mobs differ from stage to stage, forcing you to adapt and rethink strategies. Research is important to utilize your defense with different turrets, answering the mixture of monsters.\n\nBig Text, Quick Facts:\nPro:\nDifferent heroes to choose from and unlock\nMultiple turrets + modules to strategize with\nHeroes can be equipped with different (funny) weapons, armours and gadgets\nRandomized game + unlockable modes guarantee hours of re-playabilty\nGreat (but unforgiving) AI\nPixel-art (if you like it) Con:\nIt is very difficult, sometimes the first stage will be your last\nYou will die a lot. Although this is not really a con this game doesn’t suit everyone.\nStory is fun but don’t expect too much of it.\nLevel-design gets repetitive sometimes.\nSome heroes simply seem to be underpowered compared to others.\nSummary:\nDungeon of the Endless is one of my all-time favourites already. It mixes different genres and what comes out is a brutally hard, yet unbelievably satisfying pixel-art gem. Although the background story could be better explained I like the way some heroes react and team-up with each other. There are some hidden stories I’ll let you find for yourself.\nYou don’t care about dying a hundred times? You want to laugh about stupid item-names and weird dialogues? You want to build your turrets, equip your heroes and defend that shiny crystal?

You don’t need to know the other 2 and you don’t need to have played them. The story is simple: A Prison Space Ship crashes into an unknown planet, releasing its "cargo", prisoners and guards. Here they are, our newborn heroes. We should call them anti-heroes, because they are all pretty messed up, brutal, sociopath, misanthropic but at the same time, funny. If your humor is coloured black as mine is you will laugh a dozen times. Every hero has it’s own background, special abilities and some of them have a special connection, which you, the player, shall unfold. The game delivers everything in wonderful pixel-art, combined with a chilling, sci-fi soundtrack, so...\n\nHow to play?\n\nThis is the core of this game. It is a mixture of tower-defense, rogue-like, dungeon crawling and RPG. These 4 components fit together in a very unique, yet pretty awesome way, I would call it "easy to learn, nearly impossible to master!”. Your task is to protect an energy-producing crystal, starting in a random stage, trying to get it to the exit. While this sounds simple on paper it gets pretty hard in reality. You start with 2 heroes, whom you pick just before entering the dungeon. Getting deeper into the dungeon you may or may not meet other heroes. First thoughts: Which one should I pick before entering? A Melee with good attack and defense? A ranged one? Or an intelligent contender, caring for your modules, producing more resources. Speaking of resources and modules. You are crawling through the dungeon, room by room. Every opened door rewards with ressources: Wisdom, Industry, Food and Dust. Industry is used for building stuff, wisdom to research new modules, food to heal or level-up your heroes. Dust is special. Your crystal needs it to produce more energy, because every room needs energy if you want to install modules or turrets. And you will need turrets. Not only resources but monsters will await behind every opened door. And to make it even harder, every room not getting energy from your crystal will possibly spawn new mobs. And they all know one target: the crystal! Mobs differ from stage to stage, forcing you to adapt and rethink strategies. Research is important to utilize your defense with different turrets, answering the mixture of monsters.\n\nBig Text, Quick Facts:\nPro:\nDifferent heroes to choose from and unlock\nMultiple turrets + modules to strategize with\nHeroes can be equipped with different (funny) weapons, armours and gadgets\nRandomized game + unlockable modes guarantee hours of re-playabilty\nGreat (but unforgiving) AI\nPixel-art (if you like it) Con:\nIt is very difficult, sometimes the first stage will be your last\nYou will die a lot. Although this is not really a con this game doesn’t suit everyone.\nStory is fun but don’t expect too much of it.\nLevel-design gets repetitive sometimes.\nSome heroes simply seem to be underpowered compared to others.\nSummary:\nDungeon of the Endless is one of my all-time favourites already. It mixes different genres and what comes out is a brutally hard, yet unbelievably satisfying pixel-art gem. Although the background story could be better explained I like the way some heroes react and team-up with each other. There are some hidden stories I’ll let you find for yourself.\nYou don’t care about dying a hundred times? You want to laugh about stupid item-names and weird dialogues? You want to build your turrets, equip your heroes and defend that shiny crystal? Hesitate no more, go get it. 9/10","April 29, 2015","true","63.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Although the game is in a very raw early acssess state one can see where the dev team is heading, in the TowerD part of the game you power up a limited number of rooms in the dungeon making paths to rooms that could modules to assist you in clearing the dungeon. After the room is powered you set up in the room an array of turrets and relays that will buff your party in combat against enemies that will come from new rooms and waves that may spawn from unpowred rooms, and if the room contains a slot for it you may place a module that will collect resources for you to use (the end game plans to have 3 but only two are currently avalible). The resources are used to build, trade with merchants, power rooms, or to hire and upgrade heroes, the third as of yet unimplamented resource will allow you to research a tech tree and upgrade buildings. The combat side of the game is a party based RPG where you move your party in real time either using them to explore or boost modual output. You can pause the game at anytime so as to give you time carefully layout plans as things can get quite tense as your heroes are not super powered space marines (at least not at the start) and will be mobbed and killied quickly if not managed properly. Overall in its raw form DotE is a fun experiance brining new ideas to both rouglites and tower defense and I'm egarly awaiting to see what the the devs will breakout in the future.","December 12, 2013","true","11.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnnymurda/recommended/249050/","johnnymurda","Geek Citadel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnnymurda/","472 products in account","http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=337419176\n\nI admit that I’m not a big fan of Tower Defense games. I don’t see the appeal but somehow Dungeon of the Endless drew me in. Maybe it’s the Rogue-Like tendencies and the dungeon crawling aesthetic, but I was instantly intrigued by what this game had to offer. You play as a slew of heroes who have crash landed inside of a strange dungeon. The goal is to explore and defend your ships' power generator as you  head to the next floor. Does Dungeon of the Endless accomplish the combination of tower defense and exploration well? Let’s find out in this Bullet Point Review!\n\nWhat we liked\n\nPixel Perfect – The visuals in Dungeon of the Endless excels at providing a fluorescent sci-fi atmosphere to lose yourself in. The sleek pixel animations of characters and minimalist level design convey a truly splendid artistic wonder.\n\nThe Sound of a Journey – Without a doubt the wispy tones of the soundtrack carry the heroes on their way to adventure. It’s a euphoric tickle of the ears that saturates us in unique and calming melodies. It reminds me of a few Chrono Trigger songs, and that my friends is high praise!\n\nEngrossing Exploration – The combination of RPG elements, Rogue-Like mazes, and Tower Defense feels just right in Dungeon of the Endless. Each door leads to a room that is randomly generated on each play session. The use of a power grid structure to illuminate the area and fortify a room is fanciful fun. Hunkering down to begin hoarding resources and plotting your escape is highly addicting. I always wanted to see what the next room had in store, even if it only lead to more monsters.\n\nNo don’t open that door – Opening doors count as turns that activate enemy waves, complete research, and restore skill based moves for the heroes. It's an interesting take on turn-based strategy.\n\nSmart Automation – Combat is an automatic affair but it isn’t the type to frustrate you with dumb A.I. routines. The heroes will not allow enemies to stand on the other side of the room and destroy the precious generator. They make sure to keep all essential hostiles dealt with, so that you don’t have to break out into a rage festival.\n\nTons of characters – The heroes aren’t necessarily deep characters in terms of backstory, but each of them have specific skill sets, designs, and animations to represent their personalities. It feels good to find a new survivor in the dungeon and bring them into the fold.\n\nBring some friends – The Multiplayer allows up to four people to go online and survive some dungeons together. It copies the single-player fairly well, and gives each player their own resources for surviving the harsh monster attacks.\n\nWhat we didn’t like\n\nWeapon bug – Players can only pick up 4 heroes in the Dungeon, and. the only way to recruit new heroes is by dismissing the one currently in the group. The problem is that any gear removed from the dismissed cannot be placed on the newly recruited hero. It can’t even be sold to the merchant and basically clutters up the inventory window until the next dungeon is reached.\n\nSelecting Characters – Multi-tasking can be in a pain the butt when you’re playing alone. Not because it’s difficult to move the heroes, but because you can’t always easily select them. The character portrait highlights are not easy to see, so at times a hero will be highlighted that you didn’t wish to move. Maybe a patch can allow us to scroll over the heroes to select them in Real-Time Strategy games.\n\nThat looks familiar – Even though there are tons of variations on rooms, the areas begin to look extremely similar really quickly. This tends to be a problem with Rogue-Likes in general with the need to focus on indoor grid design. It can bog down the exploration experience when one place looks a little too similar to the last.\n\nMultiplayer Flaws – Dungeon of the Endless allows for players to reach 12 floors before completing the game. Players can stop and save anytime with one player, but Multiplayer does not have the option to save. This cuts down on the idea of exploration because games can take hours to complete. Also, items in chests are not distributed to multiple players. This would not be an issue if you could trade or door loot for a dungeon companion. Lastly, players can invite players to join a game but the option to create a private much does not exist.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe story is a little light but that’s typical of the genre. What you have instead is a fun time waster that quickly becomes addicting. Searching around for various characters, stacking resources, and exploring for loot is a blast! We recommend you go out and buy Dungeon of the Endless. Find four friends and explore the endless mystery that awaits you.","November 5, 2014","true","31.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It's really fun and has some interesting ideas, resource management, RPG character progression, randomly generated levels, and a decent difficult curve from what is available so far at least. It has a quite nice pixel-art style too if you're into that.\n\n\nThat said, it is very much in Alpha right now and doesn't have much content (There's only three floors available). If you're looking for a GAME to play a lot of, and not an ALPHA to support, this is probably not the game for you.

WIth a team of heroes, you must plan a strategic escape by moving your ship's powercore to elevator. Along the way, without knowing where your destination lies, you must open doors to dark rooms populated with monsters, hazards, or if you are lucky, treasures, recruits, resources and special events. One of your main decision lies in using the game's main currency to power rooms, preventing monsters from spawning. You also have to allocate resources to build defenses, improve your hero, and invest in long term tech growth.\n\n===Review===\n*Note: this is a beta review.\n\nGameplay:\n+++ Great balance betwen Macro and Micro management. Macro involves resource allocation, where and when to power/unpower rooms, tech progression, defense placement and combination. Micro involves allocating heroes to point of defense, creating chokepoints, using abilities, etc. This is a huge plus because at any given point in the game, you will always make meaingful decisions for which you can be rewarded or punished.\n\n+++ Great Pacing.

Do not make this mistake of using difficulty metric from other games. EASIEST difficulty = NORMAL,  play on easiest difficulty to learn game's mechanics.

With game elements such as Tower Defense and Turn-Based/Real-Time components, the current alpha will take some thinking to get through, even if it is only a few levels.\n\nThe goal of the game is to explore the "Dungeon" to find the exit point. The exit point isnt for your characters, but rather an Artifact that you must protect and transport. The Artifact isnt solely for the Capture the Flag purpose, it must be defended whilst you are exploring the dungeon, since all damage done is taken out of an important resource that can only be gained through exploring, killing enemies and selling items (from what I have discovered).\n\nBy Turn-Based, we can classify the turns as the opening of a new room.

As soon as a door is opened, there is a chance of gaining loot, meeting a character, or initiating a wave of aliens. The aliens may not only come from that room, but other rooms that you have opened that have no line of sight. So by using the free time, you prepare your defenses for the eventuality that the aliens come.

Dust is collected by opening some rooms and by defeating monsters. Dust is required to power a room. you can only buid machines and defenses in rooms that are powered. Some rooms are powered by themselves,however you may not power a room if it is not  connected to a room powered between it and yout starting point. Thhere is a technology that will allow this, but the cost is expensive. You will rarely have enough Dust to power every room. Unpowered rooms will spawn monsters that will attack you ,your technology or your crystal. The Crystal is always in the room you start in. once you find the exit, one of your heroes must carry the crystal. Of course carrying the crystal will severly cripple that heroes speed. you must defend the helpless hero as he/she makes thier way to the exit room. once there any heros in the exit room with the crystal may exit that floor and continue to progrees the dundeon, While you take unspent resources with you ,finding Dust seems to diminish as you reach the final handful of levels. The levels and items are procedurally-generated ,making  for worth playing again and again. Leveling up your heroes is fun and unlocks new abilities. I had a bit of a hard time learning the game. I did have to watch some play throughs before understanding what was really required to be successful. Once you grasp  the resources, how to get them, and what they are useful for  the game actually plays quite simple. While it plays simple Dungeon of Endless is hard and tense at times. You will die often and have to start over, however unlocking new heroes for your next playthrough is rewarding even in defeat. 4/5","March 7, 2015","true","23.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Talking about Endless Dungeon, it was the first time in a while a game has challenged me in just the right way. Too many times today, games rely on "artificial" difficulty, or difficulty without substance. Not Endless Dungeon. I've played the game many times, and successful runs are scarce. As a fan of both genres the game embodies (a rouguelike dungeon crawler paired with a tower defense), it represents each part of the game in a very solid way, providing an excellent coop strategy game that will certianly last. Just be sure you have a couple hours before you sit down and play it. The only issues that I can name is the inability to save in multiplayer, which I heard will be fixed, and my poor luck to find out about this series and not getting the special heros from pre-ordering other games in the series. These are minor things and barely take away from this fantastic game a whole.","March 16, 2015","true","59.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

The concept of the game is simply keep your crystal safe and along the way you collect dust witch is needed to power up the next dark rooms, you get dust by defeating the mobs, you also have to set up defenses and you get great loot from chest like blueprints or armor/weapons and you can upgrade your player stats by collecting food. You might also find a vendor or an extra crew member to help in the fight but will cost you dust. I am only about 30 hours or so but still a great fun game for a cheap price. I hope they add multiplayer or local multiplayer, but no mention in the forums, they have stated that they wll update the game every 2 weeks but have not stated what they have planned.","December 14, 2013","true","33.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The question of what lies behind that closed door. Whether it is the exit or a merchant or just a empty room. This single constant thought is what drives me to try and open every single door in this game. The chance of finding maybe the little bit of dust to power another room. The hope of finding the exit and going for a wild run to it. The fear of seeing three door in the next room instead of one.\n\nSo what makes this game special? It’s this feeling of dread and wonder that you will experience in every single game. Dungeon of the Endless is by no standard a content heavy game or even has a little of items and enemies. It’s how it works with this small amount of content that generates this feeling. Each level is randomly generate when you load it and you’ll often see the same rooms. Problem is the layout is always different and the exit might just be in the next room or at the end of a long hallway. So what you need to do is slowly room by room explore your own maze and hope that with opening the next door no monster spawn, because you won’t be able to light up all rooms. Especially later on when Dust, their energy currency, becomes a rare commodity.\n\nOutside of the very well used game mechanics it also has a lot of hidden story about each character/heroes you can unlock. By pairing up two certain or more heroes with another everytime you beat a level you get a bit of story about them. And let me tell you some of these pairings aren’t good. You can beat a level with it but it will be hard.\n\n\nSo all in all I would recommend Dungeon of the Endless.\nYes, the pixel graphics are very fitting with the game and the soundtrack. The gameplay is solid and even after failing on the tenth floor of the first level after 2 hours you want to try again and again and again. Because you’ll always be telling yourself:\n\nJust one more door…\n\nP.S. for the more hardcore of gamer: The game starts in Too Easy. You will fail on the Too Easy mode. Just throwing that out there.\n","June 17, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

In each ship you come across a crystal,that you have to protect it and in order to go to the next floor you.As far as gameplay goes you have to set up several sections of industry, science,food,LAN for the ship.The industry lets build up turrets for your defence against the plenty of hordes that will come.The food generators let you make food that you heal your hero with.The science produces as in the name more science which lets you upgrade the other modules.The LAN module Adds 120%/140%/170%/200% to all module's defense.The last main module is the Tactical HUD which adds 18%/21%/23%/26% attack power to all heroes on the floor.There is also a multiplayer so instead of contolling two charaters by yourself you can work as a group of four (Maximum).A few disclaimers,The standard price for the game is 19.99 as said earlier but I wouldnt reccommend buying it for that much,The most I personally be willing to pay for a game like this is around 10-15 US dollars.I personally purchased the game for 6.49 US dollars for the Endless Sale where all endless games were going on sale.Another slight problem with the game is the elevator at the end of the level on my first multiplayer game on The Endless Dungeon i had grabbed the crystal and went to the elevator and traveled up by myself to the next floor my team was left behind.Overall though I have enjoyed my time playing this game.I would reccommend if you are a fan of indie games,old school pixil graphics,and tower defence game.My overall rating for the game is a 85/100.","April 17, 2015","true","3.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Very few weakpoints listed in the pro/con section. I made a video featuring a last man standing amateur tournament with 18 out of 20 playable characters, added to this review.\n\nDungeon of the Endless does a lot of things right, taking the positive aspects of various genres and\nsurprisingly manages to mash them together without creating a big pile of crap.\nNot only is it fun to play, easy to pick up and hard to master, it also offers a great deal of replayability\nand nice community.\n\n\nPRO/CON\n\nI won't go with a full pro/con list here, let's focus on the very few cons.\n\n-- A few (currently 2 out of 20) playable characters need to be purchased separately and cost way more than what would be reasonable. Josh N'tello is included in the Dungeon of the Endless Chrystal Edition\nand Kreyang in the Endless Legend Founder Pack, an addon for a different game of Amplitude Studios.\nIt has been stated on the forums that the Kreyang-situation will be adressed at some point in the future.\n\n-- Some footage from the trailers isn't actually included in the game or simply outdated, like the overworld view with the Necrophage Nibblers, or Max opening a door that takes a lot longer to open in the actual game.\n\n-- While the game features coop-mode, at this point in time it lacks a savefunction (will be added) and also offers a different and in my opinion not as enjoyable experience because of the missing pause-feature, which is an essential part of the singleplayer mode as you can issue orders while pausing.\n\n-- The secret hero of the game is rather a gimmick and in my opinion way too weak in comparison to the other heroes.\n\n-- often slowpaced, heavy focus on strategy and ressource management, also permadeath. Stuff like that isn't for everybody.\n\nThat being said I thoroughly enjoy the game and can easily recommend it. Not sure about the chrystal edition because of the unreasonably high price, but that's something everybody should decide on their own, I got it anyway.\n\nI also created a video featuring a fully edited last man standing amateur tournament of almost all playable characters, where I not only shoutcast but at the same time explain the basics of the game in more detail.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1_AYaGb2p3g","April 11, 2015","true","123.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

When I saw DotE hit Steam as Early Access, I hoped for a new dungeon crawler like Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, and others.  What I got wasn't really what I was looking for and I put it down and did not touch it.  Fast forward to months after the purchase.  I decided to load it back up and give it a chance, due to the fact that I was starting to really get into rogue likes.  I didn't understand it, but I kept pushing myself to learn what makes this game work and if I can like it.

I'm still bad at it, but it's due to my skill and not for the fact that I originally hated it.

The latest expansion pack with the Rescue Team is still a mystery to me. I haven't explored all the content, or discovered the storyline reasons for each character's presence. But I expect good, high quality content, which is what I've received with this game so far.\n\nMy only issue with this game is that it's STILL buggy as hell. It WILL regularly crash on you and/or devour your saves and leave you with only a fading memory of those 11 floors you and your buddy put in on Easy mode, escaping death by a fingernail's breadth. Then *POOF* the game takes a crap on you. This WILL happen. I personally think the game is worth putting up with this stuff, but I can see why it would put some people off.\n\nAll this being said, this game has many hours of fun dungeon delving for you to enjoy. The randomization is sometimes cruel, but overall the game is reasonably well balanced. Some characters are quantitatively better than others, pure and simple. But there's enough variation in the character skills to make trying each one out something you'll want to try. Especially with the expansion content, there's significantly altered mechanics.\n\nFinally, PLEASE play this game in multiplayer a couple times. It's a fantastic experience that you won't forget. You and up to 3 friends will be pitted against the dungeon together, which is what friends are all about. When you do this, I recommend that you learn how to manually back up your own saves. It's just too painful to lose a game to a corrupt save, or a de-sync glitch, or any number of other things. Just don't use it to cheat, please.\n\nThis game is one of my top five favorite plays right now. I recommend you try it too!","November 30, 2015","true","169.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Cool.\n\nThen I played it and lost a lot. I suck at Rogue-like games. So I put it away.\n\nA few months pass, and a Steam friend of mine invites me to play with him via MP (he's in France). 5 hours later, and I see the allure, but I still suck in SP. SO, DotE gets shelved again.\n\nA few more months pass and I need to write a Friday eXcurision for eXplorminate and here is the product (http://explorminate.net/2015/09/11/friday-excursion-dungeon-of-the-endless/). That results in me playing the iPAD version, and I finally learn how to play the game.\n\nSo, how is the game? FUN. But it's hard, and brutal, but if you plan ahead and prepare, you can do fine on the Very Easy level, which is actually normal to hard. Easy is anything but, and don't get me started on the hard mode (you need a special pod for that). On to the review!!!\n\nYou start the game as a survivor of a crashed escape pod on Auriga where the Endless were conducting experiemnts on live subjects in a crazy torture lab/arena. THe planet is like Mortal Kombat world and this is where the combatants are made.  Anyways, as you try to escape the labs to the surface, you face monsters and random events every time you open a door...  Why do you open doors? to search for the escape elevator. Each time you open the door, you get resources that you can use to upgrade your heroes, power and buildup your rooms, and investigate tech to further your modules.\n\nYou repeat the above for 12 floors until you find the exit, and all the while, you'll be attacked by hordes of monsters.\n\nLet me repeat this point - the game is BRUTAL in SP, and equally BRUTAL in MP, but at least there, you get to lose together with your friends.\n\nI recommend this title, because it fantastic, and Amplitude Studios has just released a 3rd, that's right, count it.  1.. 2... 3... free dlc adding content.\n\nHave fun dying, I know I did.","October 31, 2015","true","48.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","1"

It only took me a couple hours to experience just about all of the in game "behind the door" events, level up all the different heroes, and unlock all the different structures currently available. Ordinarily I would not recommend this title for the average buyer, since there is so little content existing at the present moment. However, as an owner of Amplitude Studio's previous title, "Endless Space", I know this developer as a consumer-oriented, professional studio that sets deadlines and pushes themselves to continue creating content for their games well past the "we could just abandon the game, take the money, and run" phase. I have lots of confidence that the content will continue coming. You will just have to be patient for crucial game elements like the whole research system, all character abilities, the full character roster, DEAR GOD MORE FLOORS PLZ AMPLITUDE, etc...\n\nThe graphics and colors of this game are very pleasing to the eye, and shadows look great. FlyByNo is an AMAZING in-house composer, and his work on this game is just as great as his work on Endless Space. I do not know who does the writing at Amplitude but whoever it is, they put such flavor into every tooltip, every item description in all their games that you'll find yourself reading every word that finds its way onto your screen, no matter how dull you may expect the description for an item like "T-Shirt" to be. The founder edition comes with 50% coupons for Endless Space and the new Endless Space expansion (since buying the Disharmony expansion was in my plans already, this practically offset the cost difference between a Founder's Edition and Pixel Edition alone) for a total of about $20 in savings. The Founder's Edition itself costs $20 normally ($15 on sale now) so if you were actually thinking about buying Endless Space and it is not on sale, you may as well buy a Founder's Edition of Dungeon of the Endless and apply the discounts to maximize your Steam Wallet.\n\nIn short, this is a fun and unique game with lots of easily visible potential that it doesn't live up to yet. If you are not confident in this developer's ability to deliver content steadily and stay committed to their titles, you will likely feel ripped off for the amount of content currently available and I'd recommend waiting for an official, non-early release. Otherwise, you'll enjoy this, but slowly, and you will wish there was more content available just because you're so enticed by what already exists.","December 17, 2013","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/systemchalk/recommended/249050/","systemchalk","systemchalk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/systemchalk/","508 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'd be hesitant to offer a recommendation on a work in progress (something the game advises youf upon login), but this game really got its hooks into me from the first play through which is probably reason enough to give a recommendation. Let me first be clear though that the current version only offers 3 levels and so this is akin to paying for a demo with the promise of more to come.\n\nThe simple premise of opening doors and dealing with the consequences offers a surprising amount of variety given the fact that the events are randomly generated (or so the advertisng seems to make me want to believe), and the presence of resources that must be managed effectively. I consider this second element something of a boon as any kind of game where you build a base (mostly Real Time Strategy, but this 'Dungeon Defense' can fall into the same trap) will immediately set me to designing the 'perfect base' which takes a lot of time and tends to keep me from enjoying all that a game has to offer. Of course, if you happen to like doing such things, there's no sandbox mode, so keep that in mind.\n\nIn the present [0.1.1] version you must be mindful of Dust, Industry, and Food. Dust powers rooms and, if it falls to 0, marks the end of the game. Industry allows you to build improvements that do everything from improve your production to offer defense. Food heals, hires, and levels the characters you have under your control (starting with 2, maximum of 4). Resources (including character health) are restored when entering a new room, and so some element of guess work is involved in best preparing yourself for whatever the next room will bring.\n\nSuccess, as far as it can be measured in such a game, is achieved by picking up your crystal - the heart of your base - and bringing it to an exit once it is discovered. Easily the most tense moments of the game are created by the waves of enemies that attempt to prevent your heavily encumbered crystal holder from accomplishing this goal. Assuming the crystal makes it to the exit intact, you'll be presented with the next dungeon with whatever resources you had previously (as you might suspect, and I learned the hard way, committing all of your resources to achieving this goal is ill advised).\n\nThere are possibly two considerations a potential buyer might want to be aware of before jumping in with this title. Similar to the publisher's previous title, Endless Space, fairly significant elements of the game don't seem immediately clear to a first time player, even after considering the tutorial. For instance, I assumed a character's level automatically increased by collecting food (it doesn't), and it took me until the second play through to both discover how to accomplish this and equip the items I was hoarding in my inventory. Fortunately, this title has very simple controls and so it is not unresonable to assume that most players would be able to figure these things out eventually, but this process of discovery may not to be all players' tastes.\n\nSecond is simply the question of value. Is the game worth your money, and if so, does the Founder Pack confer enough benefit to justify the slightly higher expense. The game itself is definately worth it, and I myself went for the Founder Pack. FIrst, consider that the majority of benefits come from owning previous, and anticipated, games by Amplitude (and so you are likely to already be an owner of these games, though my copy came with a 1/2 coupon off for Endless Space and its expansion, so if you're not an owner, you have a good excuse to become one). The other major benefit is the participation in the G2G program. On this front I would caution that I was a long time owner and player of Endless Space and have not yet taken advantage of the points I have earned for that title. I also encountered difficulty when attempting to use these credits (resolution pending). So if the G2G content alone is the reason for upgrading, I would suggest going with the Pixel Pack. That said, as an owner of Endless Space, I don't regret my decision to go for the Founder pack.\n\nAll told, I think this a very engaging title that is simple to pick up but doesn't go stale. Even in its unfinished state, it's a nice looking game with a wonderful soundtrack (another feature it shares with its predecessor Endless Space). I'm really looking forward to what the developers have in store as they complete their work on the title, but I absolutely feel like I got value for the money I spent even in its early access form. Check it out if you're looking to try something new.","December 13, 2013","true","48.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only downside to possibly playing this on early access is getting yourself burnt out for when the actual game comes out- there are a few features not implemented yet, but development is speedy and happening every week or two.\n\nThe graphics and music are amazing, and stylistically what you'd expect from other Amplitude games. The quirky humour you see in sci-fi games comes along too, retaining a serious feel while putting in the odd joke here and there (for example, there is a convict who is 100% convinced she is a spider and her description says she sometimes attempts to climb up walls), and overall the game is beautiful to look at and listen to.\n\nThe gameplay might seem a bit overcrowded with buzzwords by reading the features list (My first thought: "A turn based tower defense roguelike squad based exploration game? Is there mining and crafting and fighting zombies too...?" ) but it somehow gets pulled off perfectly without feeling like there is way too much crap being thrown at you to juggle. Every feature is used and balanced- you need your towers to survive as much as you need to buff your heroes. The game is surprisingly simple, but unforgiving. I never beat the game to the "under construction" point, but I did get close- where it stands in early access, the dungeon is quite short, about 2-3 hours of solid playtime to get as far as you can if you rush.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend. Maybe you want to wait until it's finished, but spending money on it now is definitely not going to make you feel like you wasted your cash on a generic overhyped early access title.\n\n(for some reason I always buy the "master edition" of these games just because I enjoy having tons of icons on a forum I never use... I think I have a problem.)\n\nEDIT: The game is officially coming out on the 27th, and if you are interested in buying the master edition I am going to warn you the soundtrack is free despite earlier promises it would only be for those who bought the master edition. The soundtrack is here http://gameaudiofactory.bandcamp.com/album/dungeon-of-the-endless-soundtrack\n\nI am not sure if there is going to be a price drop or increase from the early access edition to the finished product on the 27th.","September 8, 2014","true","22.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My favourites include Risk of Rain, Faster Than Light and One Way Heroics, so i have some experience on the genre. But yeah, let's get to the point:\n\nIn Dungeon of The Endless your goal is to escape the Underground Lab whilst defending yourself with heroes and different turrets. You start humbly, but as you make your way closer to the entrance, you'll recruit new heroes, and unlock new turrets to keep them alive. But as you grow stronger, enemies grow outright brutal, in strength, variety and sheer numbers...\n\nThe game is a masterpiece. I'd recommend it to anyone who's into roguelikes, towerdefence or dungeon crawling. If you're into 2 or more of those categories, you should have alredy bought the game just to see what you're missing.\nHere are the pros and cons of the game:\n+ Art style is unique and pretty.\n+ Music is great.\n+ Gameplay is innovative and fresh.\n+ Glitches are extremely rare.\n+ The story is interesting (if you care to search for it), as are the interactions between playable characters (heroes).\n+ Amazing replayability.\n+ Micromanagement. Doing one thing over and over might get you trough couple floors, but after that the enemies will slaughter you. So it's important to keep in mind what kind of enemies the floor in question hosts, and what turrets work on them.\n\n- Sadly, Multiplayer still isn't up to par. Since 1 game can last multiple hours, it's inexcusable to have people randomly disconnecting without chance of reconnect. Also, the lack of ingame trading makes things quite tedious.\n- Game could use more heroes. When team consists of 4 people, 16 regular heroes and 3 Dlc/promotion are just not enough.\n- Some of them would need some balancing work. (Im looking at you Max and Josh)\n- The luck factor. As with all roguelikes, sometimes the game just kills you without giving you even slightest chance. This becomes apparent, when you're on the last level, and game refuses to give you any Dust (resource required to power your defences), and then steamrolling you with first big enemy wave.\n\nLong story short, I still love the game. 130+ hours played, and I have yet to clear the Sanitary pod (hard mode). Update, Sanitary Pod cleared with around 140 hours.\n\nRating:\n9/10\nIf multiplayer ever gets proper patches, I'll upgrade that to 9,5/10.","March 18, 2015","true","168.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had this game on my wishlist from the first time I saw it, and struggled with whether to get it or not as I have been burned by other Early Access titles before. But this game blends several genres together beautifully; roguelike (or roguelite, depending on how picky you are at naming it) along with tower defense and turned based role-playing.\n\nThe story is pretty barebones at this point; you're on a prison ship, and it gets shut down and overrun by monsters, and thus you have to escape. For some reason that isn't explained, you need to take a crystal (presumably a power source?) with you. The crystal serves as your "base" hit points, along with a power source and currency. You start with two heroes out of three to start with, and as you progress you can unlock additional heroes by means of first finding them at random and surviving three straight floors with them in your party.\n\nEach 'turn' is the opening of a door. In between you can build modules to provide one of three resources (food, science, industry) or specific modules to attack incoming enemies, increase attack power, defense, or even debuff enemies. This is where the tower defense element comes in because you have to manage the resources you have to make sure the crystal is properly defended, and your resources aren't unlimited. Once you run out of rooms to open on the current floor, you're out of resources.\n\nThe roleplaying elements come from finding equippable items, and using your food resource to level your heroes. Combat isn't involved, as your hero and the enemies take turns swinging, and while you can heal them mid-battle with food, that's about as involved as the combat gets.\n\nThe roguelike/roguelite elements come from the fact that each floor is randomly generated, so you don't know what enemies you'll find, where the exit is, where any additional heroes are (f any), etc. Also the fact if you lose, that's it. If you meet the criteria to unlock a hero they will be available upon starting a new game but that's it.

Classic turn of all rouge like/lite games was replaced with opening a door. Every time you open any door you receive access to next room. Room can contain different bonuses or monsters. You need DUST to power new rooms. But you have never enough of it to power all rooms at once and every unpowered room can spawn squad of monsters every time you open the door. The more unpowered rooms you have the more monsters can come. So you need to (despite of random nature of labyrinth) plan your advance and do whatever it takes to not allow monsters to owerwhelm you. Once you have found an exit from dungeon you need to transport your power crystal towards it. When you start to moove your crystal rooms start to loose power and monsters start to spawn with extreme rate.

You choose a pod your heroes escaped in, which dramatically changes the rules of the dungeon, and off you go in your emergency landing, deep inside this strange complex. From there on, your only chance to escape the planet, is to carry your crystal from the damaged pod up to the surface. You have to use elevators to do this, they effectively mark the start and the end of each level. The game consists in exploring every floor searching for the exit, but also for resources, merchants, weapons, other survivors or who knows what your next objective might be. In the meantime, your dust reserve is used to power up the complex while you explore, because dark areas spawn monsters, and monsters have a nasty habit of wanting to break your crystal... so what do you do? You build minor modules to protect the path you carve in the complex, you build major modules to help you attain resources every door you open, you research new or upgraded versions of the modules you can build and onward to adventure. As for your heroes, every character has his set of skills, level up progression, statistics and possible equipment slots, which promotes customization and adaptability. The game has two levels of difficulties, one is doable, the other one is pretty tough.\nOf course the game has tons of replay value, everything being randomized except items, modules and heroes, every room and branching is randomized so there is no chance you will have the same game twice, even the merchants sell not only different stuff, but even accept a random resource for trade. The multiplayer is great but I suggest grabbing a friend since this a highly strategical game, more than an action one, but I've met my fair share of reasonable people online.\nIf that wasn't enough, we are talking about the Endless lore, the same you find on Endless Space and Endless Legend, which is really cool if you're fan of the work Amplitude is doing, even the resources represent the FIDS system from the game (Food, Industry, Dust, Science).\n\nOverall I had a blast with this little title, I wasn't even expecting much but it became one of my favorite indie rogue like titles really fast. Not everyone appreciates it though (like one of my friends) though I still can't understand him, this game has everything one could ever hope for, it's original and cheap too!","May 3, 2015","true","104.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I didn't expect as much depth to it as it had.\n\nIt was also freakin' hard! The first dungeon has 2 difficulties, "Too easy" and "Easy", which really rather felt like "Normal" and "Hard mode". I haven't managed to clear it on Easy yet (so, "Hard mode"), but the too easy variant was indeed pretty easy to beat. I never ended up bothering much with the other dungeons, I tried them but in the end the original dungeon was the most fun.\n\nThere's lot of variety in the game. You can go at it from a lot of different approaches (Tower-Defense style or rather Hero-Defense style for example) which isn't explained in the game but you figure it out on your own, or through YouTube videos.\n\nMultiplayer mode adds in a lot of fun and really enhances the game. You have to decide together with someone else which way to go, what to build, which stuff to research and how to spend your resources as efficiently as possible. Also you cannot pause in multiplayer, which saved my life very often in single player mode. That makes it a lot more challenging, but since more players can watch over things it's well-balanced.\n\nMultiplayer mode does have one big downside: it's messed up resource system. It would've been more fun if resources were either shared or something else. Now each player has their own resource pool of which the income is based on a formula that goes (normal resources gained/amount of players), rounded up. Usually I ended up passing all science resources to one player, that would do all research and then I'd do all production so they'd give all industry resources to me. Every round. Super annoying.\n\nAll in all, definitely a fun and challenging game. I'd recommend it to others, both single- and multiplayer. It's easy to pick up, hard to master, and throws a serious challenge at you. It's definitely worth the price, compared to what you get.","May 18, 2015","true","39.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In the same time it is just enough complex to had made me growl the very first 4 times I tried to clear the first level because I didn't figured out yet how to use the towers/turrets.\n\nOnce that is understood, you can start to scheme so much for how you want your game to go and level out your characters, it is amazing.\n\nAnd yes... another of those game without survivability with saves at each 2 seconds at the will of the player.

I had this game on my wishlist from the first time I saw it, and struggled with whether to get it or not as I have been burned by other Early Access titles before. But this game blends several genres together beautifully; roguelike (or roguelite, depending on how picky you are at naming it) along with tower defense and turned based role-playing.\n\nThe story is pretty barebones at this point; you're on a prison ship, and it gets shut down and overrun by monsters, and thus you have to escape. For some reason that isn't explained, you need to take a crystal (presumably a power source?) with you. The crystal serves as your "base" hit points, along with a power source and currency. You start with two heroes out of three to start with, and as you progress you can unlock additional heroes by means of first finding them at random and surviving three straight floors with them in your party.\n\nEach 'turn' is the opening of a door. In between you can build modules to provide one of three resources (food, science, industry) or specific modules to attack incoming enemies, increase attack power, defense, or even debuff enemies. This is where the tower defense element comes in because you have to manage the resources you have to make sure the crystal is properly defended, and your resources aren't unlimited. Once you run out of rooms to open on the current floor, you're out of resources.\n\nThe roleplaying elements come from finding equippable items, and using your food resource to level your heroes. Combat isn't involved, as your hero and the enemies take turns swinging, and while you can heal them mid-battle with food, that's about as involved as the combat gets.\n\nThe roguelike/roguelite elements come from the fact that each floor is randomly generated, so you don't know what enemies you'll find, where the exit is, where any additional heroes are (f any), etc. Also the fact if you lose, that's it. If you meet the criteria to unlock a hero they will be available upon starting a new game but that's it. I should also point out that the only thing that carries over between levels of the dungeon is the hero's equipment and levels.\n\nIt sounds complicated, but it's easy to figure out after spending some time with it. The music and sound is fitting, not really exceptional, but the graphics are very pleasing to the eye. But in this case it's the gameplay that sells the same.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinsaku/recommended/249050/","jinsaku","Jinsaku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinsaku/","1022 products in account","Dungeon of the Endless, to put it simply, does everything right.\n\nAt its heart, Dungeon of the Endless is a relatively generic hero-based tower defense game. You defend your core node against spawning armies of increasing difficulty while building modules to defend and support your heroes. If this was all Dungeon of the Endless was, it would really just be another Kongregate tower defense game.\n\nHowever, the mechanic that Amplitude chose to focus their core gameplay on is exploration, and what a glorious implementation it is.  I've always been a fan of games that use exploration as a resource mechanic. I enjoy puzzle games and this one simple mechanic can turn nearly any game into thought-provoking puzzler.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple. You're on a ship and you crash land. The only thing salvageable from your ship is a power source. You need to protect this power source and drag it through each of the levels until you reach the top and can be rescued.\n\nOf course, it's not that simple.\n\nDungeon of the Endless uses a resource system comprised of industry (for building things), science (for learning how to build things), and food (for keeping your dudes alive and leveling up). You gain these resources by opening doors (exploration). There is also a concept of Dust as a resource, which you find in some rooms or from some monsters.\n\nBy allocating Dust, you can light up different rooms in the level. Lighting up rooms does a few things: powers your devices in the room and prevents monsters from spawning. However, you don't have enough Dust to light every room, so it becomes a puzzle of what rooms to light up and/or occupy to minimize the spawning enemies.\n\nWhen you do find the level's exit and you plan to try to move your power source to it, the fun truly happens. From every dark room, enemies constantly spawn. The person carrying the crystal moves at half speed, so it's up to everyone else to defend that person until they reach the exit and your team can leave the level.\n\nSpeaking of your team, you start with two dudes. They all have different abilities and different stats. Over the course of the game, you can use food to level up your guys (up to a max of level 15) which helps their stats, gives them new abilities, etc.\n\nAll of these concepts work completely and are executed flawlessly. There is a sense of constant panic and dread when you're exploring, particularly when you're short on resources or dust. You want to spend resources to improve your team, but want to save some for emergencies.\n\nIf I have a complaint about the game is that it's a bit too easy. Once you understand the fundamentals of the game and have a good strategy, it pays to just keep repeating that strategy for the entire game. However, the developers very intelligently added a variety of ships that change the rules of the game. This is where the future challenge lies.\n\nOne of the best titles in recent memory. Well worth the low price.","April 29, 2015","true","37.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Opened a door. Monsters pour in the now opened door and two heroes die. After this, I open the next door, and a zillion more monsters pour in. My remaining two heroes die. 10/10 would open two doors of death again.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it, and it spans lots of genres and types of games. Turn-based? Yup, resources are gained based on turns. A turn is completed when a new door is opened. Real-time? Yup, combat, building, and movement takes place in real time. Roguelike/RPG? Yup, you level up your character and collect items to equip them with while running around each floor of the dungeon. Tower defense? Got that, too. You build different types of "towers" in rooms for defense, resource production, or boosting your heroes. You level up or heal characters by using food, build towers by spending production, and when you find a science crystal you can spend science to research new types of towers or upgraded versions of ones you already can build. There is also the interesting element of dust, which can be collected from some types of monsters when they are killed, or some rooms occasionally grant dust when entered. The use of dust is to power rooms to be able to run the towers you have built in them. The limited quantity of dust makes for some interesting decisions as you discover more of the floor, you will never have enough dust to power all of the rooms, so you must make choices as to which rooms to power. Unpowered rooms without heroes in them can also produce more monsters when the next turn is begun, so that also plays into the strategy of which rooms to power. Finally, once you discover the exit to the floor, it becomes a mad dash to take your precious crystal from the entrance to the exit and escape with all of your heroes alive. There is also a story element to it in that the characters have a back story, some of them involving other heroes as well. And it's in the Endless universe, which is quite a clever setting IMO, I already enjoyed the lore from Endless Space. This game continues with the same lore. This game is very fun, if you like dungeon crawlers or tower defense games, you won't be disappointed unless you despise the genres combined in it.","March 25, 2015","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It has elements of turn based and real time strategy involved. It's kind of funny but can be kind of tense and serious. It has a perfectly winning single player and a perfectly winning multiplayer that are virtually identical and don't suffer at all from this. Every choice might matter and it might not matter at all when the next door opens. You can probably play through a few sessions in ten minutes and have a perfectly good time or agonize over a campaign for hours, even yelling at friends in VOIP the whole time.

I'm thankful to the pirating community for being able to try this gem of a game before I bought it. I don't have the best computer so it's a gamble to purchase games, and living in a small town without any place to work has made game purchasing hard as of late. So when I was working I made sure to pick this one up to have support the authors. That's something all of you should do, if you pirate a game and enjoy it, then buy it!\nAnyway, this game is best described as a tower defence roguelike dungeon crawler. I'm not always in the tower defense mood, but when I am I am glad to have this game to go to. My only grief is the same grief I have with most tower defense games. Once you figure out a working strategy the challenge vanishes. Thankfully there are other game modes to play with, some of which don't allow me to do my winning strategy. (Boy did my heart sink once I figured out the strategy to just breeze through the game though)\nI recently got caught up in a nearly 16 hour straight gaming session with this one (which is when I figured out my strategy) and got a little burnt out and probably wont be playing it again for some time. I'm still glad to have it in my library and if any further updates come alone to freshen things up a bit more I'll certainly hop back into it.\nOh, and one more grief is the online play. It's best to play with friends that you know already and to communicate using skype or something. I've never finished to the end on any online play, someone almost always drops out after the second floor, if not the host dropping everyone immediately after game start. I once made it to the eighth floor with someone online. But what started with 4 became 2 after the third floor. If there was a way for the resources to be divided up among the players or something different than the current system it would help a lot. I've had games that quit immediately because someone used up a resource right away or built a module that made the host upset. All and all, unless you have friends like I said before, just don't worry about the multiplayer.\nIn all if anything I wrote sounds appealing then go for it! Especially if it's on sale. I really need to stop getting inspired to write a review right before I go to bed. I've been nodding off while writing this and forgetting what I just wrote. So sorry if this is a bit jumbled. It was written by a very sleepy man who for some reason, decided now is the time to share with the world that I like this game!

A very different game from Amplitude studios; who specialized in 4X games (Endless Space, Endless Legend). And while this game has multiple elements of those previous games and 4X games in general, if you are looking for a 4X Game, this is not your pickup. If you are looking for a good rogue-like, a good tower defense game, or a mix of both and some 4X elements, this is the best pickup for you on the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSettings: The settings are useful and helpful, as everyone has their own preferences. Overall positive. This goes for the UI of the game as well.\n\nStory: There is little direct story in this game, such as in The Binding of Isaac, but much is hidden in the lore and different unlocks you find in the game. These will not be further discussed, because spoilers.\n\nGameplay: Time for the meat of this review. The gameplay is relatively simple. Your characters progress through rooms on twelve different floors, each floor progressing in difficulty. There is always a chance for monsters to spawn, and you will fight them. But the big part of the game is the four major resources that come into play. Here they are:\nIndustry (Gear Icon): Industy is used to build things (notably modules): They can generate other resources, or defend rooms.\nScience: Spend science to research new modules.\nFood: Levels up/heals your heroes.\nDust: Does not generate per floor, but is picked up. Used to light rooms.\nIf a room is not lit, monsters might spawn in that room. So yeah. You're going to need some defenses. There is a crystal in the starting room, once you find the exit, you must take that crystal to the exit. You can't leave until the character CARRYING the crystal enters it. Once the crystal is picked up, in every dark room monsters will spawn.\n\nElements: The rogue-like element is pretty obvious. The 4X elements of resource management and production, and how to spend them is super important. But tower defense is pretty simple. Build things that help heroes, or hurt monsters, so that they can't get to your crystal. When the crystal is hit, you lose dust. When the crystal dies, you lose. When all the heroes die, you lose.\n\nDifficulty: It is an odd game in difficulty. At the start, there are two difficulties: Too easy and Easy. Too easy after a few games to get the hang of things becomes too easy. Easy is brutal, and requires you to scrap for resources, mangage them incredibly well, and then most likely die to some fatass punching your crystal.\n\nReplayability: Yes. It has proceduraly generated floors. And it's a rogue-like. Never heard of a good rouge-like without replayability.\n\nConclusion: This game isn't often what people are looking for, especially fans of previous games by Amplitude. But this is a fantastic blend of multiple genres, including the dying tower defense games, and the somewhat bland 4X games. This revitalizes these elements in a unique blend that requires the player to be smart, quick to adapt to situations, good with spending resources and leveling the hero, which brings some RPG into the game, and not getting too frustrated when that fatass kills your crystal three games in a row because you didn't upgrade those claymoar mines on floor seven to get a HUD module that no matter what you do keeps getting destroyed halfway through the floor because you haven't saved up enough industry or science to buy or research better protection, and now one of your heroes is dead because there wasn't enough food to heal her, and oh my god it's Midnight. I need to sleep. Well maybe let's have one more go.","November 27, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Like other Endless games, the four resources are Food, Industry, Dust, and Science (FIDS). With each door opened, more FIDS accumulate, but dangerous monsters may spawn. Players eventually discover a dungeon floor exit and carry the crystal to a new dungeon floor, continuing on until the game ends at the 12th floor.\n\nCharacters may be discovered in-game and unlocked after completing a certain number of floors with that character. Characters have different strengths as might be expected, including attack power, defense, movement speed, and "wit", which in this game translates into better module operation bonuses. Certain secret combinations of characters lead to different in-game events.\n\nFood, Industry, and Science increase in a predictable fashion with each door opened, but Dust is less predictable and cannot be saved between levels. Dust may sometimes be discovered in new rooms or obtained after defeating monsters.\n\nRooms adjacent to the crystal may be powered (or "lit") subject to a limit based on the current amount of Dust. Lit rooms do not spawn monsters. Given enough industry, different "modules" may be built in a powered room based on the characteristics of that room--not every room can hold a module, no room can hold more than one "major module", and different rooms have different limits for "minor modules".\n\nItems may be discovered in new rooms and are bought and sold for FIDS at merchants which may be discovered in new rooms.\n\nA special Research module may appear in a new room, allowing for Science to be invested to unlock new modules or higher levels of existing modules.\n\nModules may be removed, for example removing an unneeded Research module to make room.\n\nLike any great game, Dungeon of the Endless presents the player with many interesting choices, for example:\n- leave a room dark to spawn more monsters and the chance for more Dust, or light the room to reduce monster spawn and provide room for modules?\n- invest Industry in FIDS-producing modules (longer-term payoff) or defensive modules (immediate payoff)?\n- spend Food to recruit a new character, or save Food to see if a better choice is available later?\n- take the exit as soon as it is found, or open a few more doors to try to gain more Food, Industry, and Science for the next level?\n- invest Science now, or remove the Science module in favor of a different major module?\n\nTactical elements include: positioning of characters when unlocking a door, character movement between rooms during combat, activation of special abilities, healing (which takes Food), and resetting abilities (which takes Science) in combat. Combat may be paused for easier micro-management, but some players will find it more fun to do without pausing (there's even a Steam Achievement for beating a dungeon without pausing).","November 3, 2014","true","34.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's stable and has a great mix of overall game mechanics that work well to produce a coherent game.\n\nTo try to describe this game in conventional terms might just confuse you.  Yes, it has aspects of roguelike games, real time strategy games, role playing games, tower defense games, and board games.  Personally, I think of it as mostly a board game with each "turn" divided into a time before you open another door, which will reveal treasure, a merchant, waves of enemies, blueprints, or something else - you never know!  Then it's a mad scramble reminiscent of a real time strategy/tower defensive hybrid to keep everything upright until the next turn.  When deciding who to level up or equip with gear, that's where the RPG aspect enters the picture.\n\nThis board-game like mechanic can be a good thing because it introduces a lot of interesting choices.  If I assign my hero here, will they be able to make it back to where they need to be if enemies appear there?  Do I spend my industry points on producing more industry points, producing things I need, or do I try to scimp on points now so I have more avaialble to use on the next map?  Do I invest my dust in that great piece of equipment, or is it more important that I power rooms?  These choices are clever in that many of them are just comprimises; there's often not a "right" choice, just a good guess at what might work out in the long run.\n\nI like a game that makes me think.  Yet, Endless Dungeon is rarely ever overwhelming, just rich with important choices to make and requiring you pay attention when your heroes are fighting so they don't get slain needlessly.\n\nIt's quite remarkable they consider this quite-playable product such an early version.  True, you're limited to just three (four?) random map levels per game (which you can exhaust in an hour), there's not yet skills on the heroes, the tech tree systems isn't in yet, and so on.  Yet, the game is more complete than many $15 titles I've bought.  Amplitude studios seems to know what they're doing, and if they call this version v0.1.x, then it's clear this game should be of staggering, epic proportions if they see their plans through to completion.","December 11, 2013","true","7.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltonky/recommended/249050/","waltonky","Puzzlebox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltonky/","318 products in account","Dungeon of the Endless is another entry in Amplitude's loosely connected Endless Universe. The game combines roguelike elements with the dungeon crawler.\n\nThe premise is this: you are among the handful of survivors remaining after a penal transport ship was attacked. Your escape pod crashes into the bowels of Auriga, a planet that's a wonderous hybrid of fantasy and science fiction, Our heroes must tow their escape pod's energy crystal up to the surface, floor by floor, in order to survive.\n\nPlayers accomplish this trek by opening dungeon doors. This is where the game gets its turn-by-turn basis from, as each door counts for one turn. The turn aspect is central, as the vast majority of your resources will be generated in between turns from various resource modules you'll construct. Of course, opening any given door has a chance of spawning waves of enemies which the player must fend off in an effort to protect the energy crystal. If the energy crystal reaches zero, it's game over.\n\nIf this sounds like a familiar mechanic, that's because it is. It's the epitome of the tower defense game and you'll find that there is a plethora of offensive, defensive, and supportive modules the player can research and construct to assist in the effort. As in other tower defense games, each of the many enemy types have different priorities and abilities, so strategic use of these modules is important. Simply slamming down the default turret gun isn't going to help you (and in at least one game mode isn't even an option).\n\nThe goal of each level is to find the exit elevator. When the player finally finds it, they will have to plan for an anxiety-fueled escort mission. One of the heroes must transport the crystal to the exit elevator. Once the crystal is picked up, endless waves of enemies will begin spawning in darkened rooms. To make matters worse, whoever is carrying the crystal will essentially be out of commission for the battle, as bearing the crystal creates a tremendous speed debuff and disables attacks and abilities for that character. Once the crystal makes it to the elevator, the player may leave. Be careful, however, as it is possible to leave without your other party members and they will subsequently be removed from the party.\n\nAlong with the variety of modules, we have a variety of characters each with different abilities and perks. Each character belongs to one of three factions: crew members, prisoners, or natives. This is a background element but it does affect some perks and stat growth. For example, natives are the cheapest to level up but their stats aren't really impressive in their early levels. In this respect, the game is very much like an RPG, as most characters seem more easily fitted toward one role due to their stat growth and abilities. For instance, characters with a high Speed stat make suitable crystal runners because the effects of the aforementioned debuff will be less noticeable.\n\nThe graphics use a pixel aesthetic, although it does not feel retro in style. It has a crisp feel to it and is pleasing to the eyes. Despite the simplicity, Amplitude has managed to create an interesting diversity of environments. Indeed, all the rooms are invariably boxy, but it's clear they put some work into trying to make the floors feel different. There's an actual sense of progress across geographic space by using different artistic themes for the decor.\n\nThe sound quality is excellent. However, while the soundtrack is fantastic you may find it a bit repetitive after a few hours of play. I found myself turning the music off and turning on other sources for background noise after some time.\n\nFinally, the way in which this game unravels its lore is extremely subtle and I love it. Small vignettes explaining unseen stories can occur between levels, but only if you have the appropriate characters in your party. These stories can be simply amusing, explain what a character is all about, or inform on the relationships between our starring cast. The coolest thing about these is that each story ends in a buff being granted to those involved, empowering you for the floors ahead.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game enthusiastically. It's a wonderful blend of many different game mechanics that somehow seems to work. However, one final warning to any potential buyers: this game is difficult at first. Do not be fooled by the two options of Easy and Too Easy. I recommend chewing on Too Easy at first until you get the hang of the game. Some events are high risk/high reward and the choice of whether to take that risk is best served by a judgment cultivated in the crucible of Dungeon of the Endless.","June 2, 2015","true","67.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

I personally think this game is a hard to learn, hard to master type game.  This game is not for the weak-willed who seek handholding, checkpoints or walks in the park.\n\nDungeon of the Endless is a tower defence game that draws RPG, rogue-like, dungeon crawling and resource management elements.  You start each game by picking 2 heroes out of a 24 (with all of DLC and unlockable characters) member cast.  Each hero has different stats that help your team in one way or another (Speed, Power, Health, and Wit).  Your objective is to look for the exit of the floor, which leads to the next floor.  Each floor gets progressively harder and harder the further down you go.  To "win" or complete the game, you have to complete all 12 floors.  You start each floor in a single room and have up to 4 different directions you can go.  Each room you enter has a chance to spawn dust (used to powers rooms) as well as: other resources, merchants, treasure (that can be worn for bonuses or sold for resources), other heroes to add to your team (for a max of 4 heroes per team) and/or monsters!  For each room you enter, any room you do not have powered by dust has a chance to spawn monsters in it.  You will eventually come to a point where the minority of your rooms will be powered and lots of monsters are spawning.  This is where strategy and micro-managing your heroes comes into play.  You have to find the perfect setup where you can defend all your modules and your crystal, without your heroes dying.  This will require quick thinking, quick calculations and quick action to make sure you can defend all directions without losing modules, heroes or resources.  If you lose (from either monsters taking your crystal down or losing all your heroes), you do not start from where you left off, you will need to start from floor one again with a new team.\n\nI’ve read a ton of negative reviews saying this game has way too much RNG to be recommended.  You can definitely be ♥♥♥♥ed over by RNG in this game, but 90% of the time you have that bad of RNG, it’s definitely winnable if you just play your heroes and defence right.  The feeling of conquering an insanely hard floor after getting some bad RNG is pure bliss.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging game or a completely new take on tower defence.  You will lose NUMEROUS times before you finally win (on Easy at least), but that first victory is one to remember.  If you’re looking to start playing this game, I’d highly recommend checking out the let’s play link below.

The interface is intuitive and the style is rich enough to give you an artgasm.\n\nThe game itself has a fairly easy objective - get your dust-filled crystal thing to an exit. But don't be fooled by the simplicity, the game can be punishing. When you take the crystal out of its notch, be prepared to face continous waves of enemies. It's difficult in a sense that it'll force you to utilize anything at your disposal in favor of just making a run for it. It's a game that will test your attention as well as your ability to make tough strategic choices.\n\nIf you're sick and tired of shooters, consider picking up this game.

The gameplay is original, yet extremely challenging even on the lowest difficulty, the art-style is gorgeous and minimalistic, and there is tons of content just thrown at you at every turn. It's also story-lite so there's no walls of text thrown at you constantly.\nThe game has a steep enough learning curve, only giving you a short tutorial on the basics, requiring you to figure out things for yourself.\nYou start with two heroes, but eventually you will unlock up to two more hero slots as you find them in the dungeon, with a total of 16 different heroes available to choose from. Resource managing is key in Dungeon of the Endless.\nIf you want strong characters, you'll need to build food modules,\nif you want tons of laser cannons to stop wave upon wave of enemies, you will need machinary resources.\nAnd if you want access to additional modules ranging from decoys, lasers, bombs, then you'll need to gather science resources.\n\n(Here is the part where I explain how to play this game, making it even more confusing.)\n\nThe game has a unique "turn" system, designated by a door, i.e. when you open a door, a turn will pass, giving you resources based on modules you have built. Anything can happen during these turns. A wave of monsters can surprise you, power can go out, you may uncover a buff crystal or a research post, or a shop where you can spend a specific randomly chosen resource on some neat stuff.\nThe objective of the game is to find the exit in the dungeon, allocate a hero to carry the crystal at the start of the level, and escort them to the exit, while of course, being bombarded by enemy waves.\nRooms can be lit up using "Dust", the primary resource in the game. It's collected from enemies and certain rooms when opened. Dust is also the crystal's health, so if attacked, you will lose dust, thus losing power in rooms.\nLighting up the rooms stops enemies from spawning during turns and the "final" phase, but also allows you to place modules on the dungeon floor at the cost of machinery resource.\nThe game is perma-death, so if your crystal is destroyed, if your heroes die, or if the hero carrying the crystal dies, then it's game over, and back to level 1 again. There is a number of different "pods" you can choose from, all with various difficulties and requirements, so there is plenty to mess around with here.\nThere is so much more to this game, including levelling up your heroes, learning new skills, abilities, picking up or buying/selling items, weapons, armour and accessories, triggering random events and most importantly, taking a whole bunch of risks.\nIt's one of the most perplexing and gripping games I've played in a long time and you should buy it when you can.\n\n(There is multiplayer, however I haven't got around to taking a stab at it yet,  but when I do, I'll update this review.)","December 23, 2014","true","5.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It has a lot going for it in terms of aesthetic and theme.\n\nBut it just loves being a "Rogue-like" so much that it actively detracts from the game itself, and this is from someone who likes Roguelike games!\n\nThe game knows what it wants to be but it's to an extent it's not enjoyable. From the very tutorial it advertises that there's a lot that it doesn't teach you, and to find out things yourself. By dying. Well, that's cool, sincerely. But could you have at least pointed out where to use Research Points? Because it doesn't, and you find out by interacting with Crystals that are randomly found on each floor, an essential mechanic for one of the core resources that is unexplained.\n\nOf course, it uses idiosyncratic difficulty names -- "Too easy" and "easy" -- that older games used for flavor... and most modern games avoid because it's unintuitive to what someone entering a game should expect out of their game.\n\nThe fact is that it blends two very unforgiving genres together, but explains less than it really should. Tower Defense games have walls of text to describe the functions of things for a reason, and the less descriptive a roguelike game is the harder it is by nature. Not a bad thing, but combined with the mindset of a Tower Defense game -- pure strategy, based on what is being given to you -- the difficulty is spiked up because the tools available are less known.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back for me was that it lacks autosave, and it is liable to crashing. Two bad but acceptable things that combined in a modern game becomes unacceptable. Almost every modern Rogue-like game has auto-saving that is of course written over when the game is opened up again, just as a quality of life feature.\n\nThe core gameplay itself is good, but I can't recommend this game as a complete, polished product. And that's not even a railing against "indie" games. You don't see these problems with the current tried-and-true top rated Roguelike games, which offers options for a range of difficulties and self-induced challenges rather than sticking you out with "Easy" as the hardest difficulty. As I played more and understood the game more, the focus became less the difficulty and more the disatisfaction with continuing a tower defense loop that offered minimal room for advancing strategy and thoughtfulness, and instead focused on a slow grind. Games that encourage wiki help don't lack nearly as much instruction as this one.","June 5","false","5.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

(happened once)\nOften times, icons displaying statuses wont appear (like the gear for operate skill).\nNodes that are fully lit, and should allow placement, sometimes get glitched so placement is impossible.\nIf the game closes at any time, EVER, expect to lose progress because of the developers stupid save-scumming prevention. Even last autosave gets lost.\n\nAbove all, the absolute worst part of this game is its saving mechanism. Too often, the game will not detect saves that are present. It will simply ignore them. The developer tried too hard to prevent save-scumming and, in the process, botched it up. It is very frustrating to have a great run and press the save and quit button, only to come back later and find no save. Sometimes after reinstalling the game it will magically reappear and sometimes not. Until the developer can fix the saving mechanism of the game so that it can be quit and actually save progress, I cannot recommend this game.","January 12","false","20.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I bought this game on the strength of the combination of Roguelike / 4E / Tower Defense... except it's not.  It's just another terrible little roguelike, a sadistic RNG that takes the place of creative level design.  The concept is nice.  Open a door, explore your environment step by step, do some research, build defenses... die, lose everything.... Repeat?  Why?  I get the idea that the makers of DotE are confused by the concepts of TD and 4E games, both of which I love, and both of which are predicated on the idea of slow, steady, calculated improvement.  Every time you conquer a level in a TD, you unlock more and more of the game, your skills get better, you gain more towers, and you take on greater challenges.  In 4E, resource gathering and untilization, slowly expanding your sphere of influence... these take hours or days, and garner iterative improvement.  In DotE the floors just aren't big enough.  Your empire consists of a couple upgrades, maybe three or four production units total, and maybe a dozen turrets.  Upgrades you research on one floor and almost everything you built are lost when you move up a level and nothing is gained from game to game besides a slow, inevitable feeling of malaise at the realization you've wasted money on this.  I love hard games.  I love overcoming challenges, but I like to feel like I'm the master of my fate and the utter blithering randomness, the "haha, you lost, now start over from the begining with only your sense of shame!"... that's not what makes a good Adventure, 4E, or TD game.  Not even Nintendo Hard Platformers like Ghosts and Goblins did that.\n\nOh, and everyone who raves about how simple this game is? So what?  Minecraft is one of the least simple games out there and it's massive.  Ditto Fallout 4 and Skyrim.  Ditto Bridge and Chess.  Know what's simple? Hopscotch.  Simplicity means nothing if the core game itself isn't good.  DotE could be good, if each dungeon were dozens or hundreds of rooms spread out across a vast area, which would have to be protected from invaders as you research and level up, battling wave after wave of monsters crawling out of your barely protected lightzone... and then, once you lose, as you inevitably must, you unlock some potential upgrade that you can use to get farther the next time.  Oh... I would have loved to play that version of DotE if it had true 4E and true TD, instead of just stealing "elements".

All the elements are there, apart from something compelling to do when you play it. The concept is original enough, but the execution is in turns tedious, repetitive and unfair. Playing simply involves repeating the same actions, stage after stage, and hoping the RNG doesn't screw you too badly.\n\nUnlike true Rogue-likes such as FTL and Binding of Isaac, this is essentially a very pretty, but basic, tower defence game with occasional difficulty spikes, or loot drops, as its 'random' element. None of these are compelling like Spelunky's altars or shopkeepers, or FTL's story choices, but simple occasional resource gifts or monster waves.\n\nThe problem here is that it misjudges what makes tower defence fun - accurately managing those resources. By tying those into the RNG (level layout strongly dictates your defences and resource gathering) your strategy is always a slave to the RNG, and can often be ruined simply by an obnoxious layout simply starving you of resources, or forcing you to defend more points than is possible.\n\nThis makes the game a case of going through the motions, repeating an optimal strategy with little breathing room for experimentation, until you luck into a good run or are forced into an unfair loss. All 10 stages play exactly the same, but just get larger and contain more damaging enemies. Once you've finished stage 1, you've essentially seen the entire game.\n\nA shame, as every other element is dripping with style and polish, and the mixture of TD, dungeon crawling and Rouge-like works as a proof of concept, but unfortunately all you get here is simply a marriage of extremely shallow reprentations of all three genres.\n\n6/10","September 30, 2014","false","36.4"," 48 of 93 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","48","93","0","5"

There are enough characters and since adding 8 levels an indepth clear is currently around 3 hours of play. Though i have read aot of complaints and they fall into two categories too hard or no diversity.\nIn respect to difficulty there are currently two options, easy and too easy. As their name suggests  neither option is very difficult. However if you play this game and do not consider that is a combinations of many game types and aproach it as one you will lose fairly quickly. Also, aproaching each level with no forethought or strategy will cause a loss aswell. It is of course a strategy game so those who lack it will not suceed. Furthermore, the learning curve is fairly easy and once you get the hang of it is a blast.\nIn respect to a lack of diversity you have to remember this game is still in alpha. if you are buying a early access game looking for a full game experience then you will be dissapointed. The devs are pushing out consistent updates, much faster than alot of the other early access games on steam. They fix bugs very quickly and if a patch is game breaking they pull it so you can still play while they work on it. By buying the game now you can shape development by voting on their website.\n\nThe game itself is quite simple. There are currently 3 resources industry, science and food. Industry is for building modules and major modules help produce those three resources. Minor modules are turrets support turrets and defensive turrets. Science allows you to resource upgrades for your modules and new modules themselves. food allows you to recruit new heroes after your starting heroes, level up your heores(current max lvl 8 due to 8 Floors) and heal them during fights.\nYou use these resources to build a defense network so that when the exit of the lvl is found you can safely bring your crystal(the object that allows you to power rooms so you can build in them) to the next lvl. Each level gets increasingly difficult with new enemies and more rooms.\nHeroes: Heroes come in all shapes in sizes and currently there are four stats, and five weapons types(currently 0.6.1). Stats are health,speed,damage and wit. Weapon types are sword, spear, pistol, machine gun, unarmed. health is how much life you start with and how much life you get every time you level up. Speed is movement speed. Wit is comparable to an intelligence stat but is mostly used for heroes you can operate major modules(Operating is to give a bonus to their production rate or bonus it gives) by increasing the operator bonus. Damage is the amount of damage you do. All of these stats scale when you level the heroe and different heroes are more proficient in different stats.There is no heroe that is useless all of them serve a specific purpose and you can win by using any combination of them.Also, there are armors and support items, most with comical names or premises.\nFinally a great amount of thought has gone into this game from the item descriptions and the heroe backgrounds to the strategies that are available and to the details in each room.

I was hesitant at first, only ever hearing the horror stories of recently dropped games. After seeing this go on sale tho i couldnt pass up, and oh boy, I'm glad I got it. The video promoting this game pretty much describes it perfectly. If you like rouge-like games with rpg elements then you will not be dispointed. for me the tower defence style 'defend the base' element got me hooked pretty quickly. the only downside at all about this game for me was the fact that there is no endless mode 'yet'. It has been highly requested by the comunity and may be implimented in final release (fingers crossed) but dont buy this early access planning on having it. Overall this is a great game especially for the price. On sale it's a no brainer.\n\nTLDR; If you like rouge-likes then this is for you, and there is no garentee of an endless mode as of yet.","June 2, 2014","true","32.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Man, what can I say about this game? This game by far one of the most addidcting games in my game library, BY FAR. First to begin, this game is early access, yet there are slim to none bugs that I have come across. This game is a rogue-like dungeon crawler game, which means, if you die, prepare to throw something at the wall. DotE has an astounding amount of features, for being in ALPHA. This game hasn't even made it into beta yet, and look at all the features it currently has. Now you may be debating on which pack of DotE you should buy, and you may be considering buying the Founder Pack, and if you are, then go for it. Firstly, look at the features they are promising you upon release with the Founder Pack. Secondly, you gain access to the G2G voting system on Amplitude's website (this voting system is to choose what should be put in the game next) and ultimately decides the outcome of the game upon full release.

Lots of variety.  Lots of strategy.  Very rewarding to play and master.\n9 out of 10 (with the potential for 10/10 with further development which is in the pipeline)\n\nStarts off very hard, but you always know why you died/failed.  As you learn how the game and characters work, the game gets much easier and starts to really shine.  If you're on the fence, get the basic 'Pixel Pack' - you don't get much with the upgrade to Crystal (one hero, one game mode).  I play on Linux under WINE with no major problems, although it's not supported.\n\nPros:\n+ Great characterizations, diverse skills which dramatically change the game\n+ Monsters which force you to change tactics floor-to-floor\n+ Game modes, while a little thin, do offer a good dose of variety\n+ Music/Sound is excellent.  even at 100+ hours in, the music is still a welcome addition.\n+ Tactics and strategy matter - a lot!\n+ Lots of replayability and more in the future thanks to continued development\n+ Even if you're an expert, there's still a lot of challenge\n\nCons:\n- Tower defense aspect is really a second fiddle to the heroes, especially in lower levels, mostly due to one enemy type (Zoners) destroying minor modules\n- Multiplayer is still rough (but being improved patch by patch)\n- The music in the first video is not in the game\n- Interface could use a little work (health is hard to see, 'restore skill' is hidden, can't pin heroes to rooms)\n- Characters sometimes don't attack/repair immediately (minor quibble, really)\n- Crystal running is usually trivial\n\nAbout the difficulty: it's hard, yes (and I like hard), but you get to the point where the balance flips and losing becomes a rarity.  It's still difficult and rewarding, but the heal mechanic means you can just overproduce food and heal all the time, so it's actually hard to lose outright.  Many of my first few losses were simply being to skimpy on healing; lesson learned...always top heroes off if you want them to live.\n\nOther tips:\n* take 30 minutes and read a guide or two; it'll save you a few failed runs.\n* start on 'very easy'\n* PAUSE. all the time. assess how the battle's going.  is one hero in trouble?  are enemies going a path you didn't anticipate?\n* don't heavily invest in offense modules; your heroes should be doing most of the fighting\n* change your strategy if you see Zoners (triangle guys which attack minor modules), Dozers (big rock guys which attack major modules), or Riders (can open doors). monsters are set per floor.  if you see one of the above, the level is going to be much, much harder\n* Max is very, very good thanks to his ability to generate dust on door opens.  makes floors 8+ much easier.\n* Controlling aggro is essential, although there are many ways to do it.  the easiest is with Skroig, the necrophage character, and his Red Plume skill - reset (on the character sheet) when necessary; it's cheaper than healing/rebuilding.\n* Floors start at about 11 doors for level 1 and go to about 32 doors. generally, keep building resource generators until 2/3rds through. shoot for two operators at all times. make use of mechanical pals, when you'll be sure they pay off.\n* when dust gets short, have one 'exploration' wing where only one room is lit for defenses (with a combat hero that can control aggro), and one 'production' wing where all rooms are lit.  only open more rooms on the 'production' wing when you have enough dust to light the room you're going to open.\n* neurostun, tear gas, and biotransferrance are some of the best support modules\n* research 'Shop's and put an Operator on any merchants you find post floor 7-8","January 26, 2015","true","110.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Gameplay is Smooth and Entertaining, Resource Management between you and your team is challenging, and Behind every door is the possibility of Life or Death.  This game could easily be played for hours with you and your 3 friends all shuffling around the rooms trying to not Screw up. In this game Teamwork and Communication is crutial and makes the game Entertaining. While you can play Single Player, I highly suggest buying this for you and a friend to play, it is about 10 times more fun with other people.  You have your 4 Resources, Food, Production (Which allows Building Defenses and Production Buildings), Science, And Dust.  Food Allows you to level up, buy items from vendors, heal in the middle of a turn, and even to hire new characters.  Science allows you to Research New Buildings and Building Upgrades, and also to occasionally buy items from vendors although it's more likely to see a vendor buying either Production or Food, And Dust allows you to power rooms for Defenses, Production, and (Most importantly) to stop Monsters from Spawning in a room. The Monsters are pretty Tough to say the least and can make you almost smash your keyboard into the wall which makes resource and power management more crucial to your sanity. To get through a Level you must find the exit and get both your Main Gem and your characters into the Exit Room. This game is Worth the Money and the developers are amazing for this game.

Each new pod you unlock changes the feel and play of the game to a great degree, making multiple playthroughs worthwhile, challenging and fun.

If you're up for a challenge and the twoer defense and rogue like aspects are interesting to you, grab this.\n\nBE WARNED: the rogue-like aspects can mean you hit a floor you will need to play perfectly to beat, and you can lose a lot of progress for making a bad gamble.

The rest of my questions have all been killed out of me.\n\nI didn't think I'd like a roguelike this much. Maybe this and FTL have a secret hold on me. When it comes down to what you like about them, the challenge or the exploration, I think I like this game better as the challenge doesn't rely entirely on totallyrandom generation. Imagine if you could improve your ship in FTL without needingit all to come from shops or random encounters, but also gave you the options of directly influencing the parts of your ship with scrap, reinforcing the hull or weapons by themselves. That's what the heroesin this game fillthe gap on. Mixing it with tower defense makes this game engaging as you try tokeep heroes inbetween monsters and your crystal ala Dungeon Defenders, and executes it with the power sent to each grid. Managing these, your heroes and your defense network makes the game engaging.\n\nI would like to see more ships added. I enjoythe fact you can have certain gains and deficits granted by each pod, but if the developer doesn't make some whacky options available, or powerful ones, then the gimmick is short lived. I may be the only one who wants to see strange and fantastic options anymore, though. The excitement of seeing the doors open (as this is a door opening simulator, not a monster defense game as one would assume) is sadly reduced once you've run the gambit of monsters. I would like to see more happen.\n\nGameplay: 9/10 Polished, well executed, and lacking in only the slightest of refinements. The stats lack descriptions and the tutorial hucks you in after a basic example.\n\nStory: 7/10 Must unlockthe characters and have them gab at one another for the story, but then again, that isn't what you came to do in this game, was it?\n\nGraphics: 8/10 Very pretty in game environments, monsters are varied but fit thesame subcategories, heroes continue to surpirse me in some ways. But the lit rooms sometimes offer little more than the dark ones did other than lack of gnawing death.\n\nSound 9/10: As with games of this nature, sound effects are re-used oftenbut it doesn't grate the ears. Music is appropriate, well done, and generally pleasing.\n\nOverall: 9/10: Would open more doors.","November 7, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dont worry you managed to launch a escape pod and escape death... for now.\nYour only option once landed with 2 survivors is to open the door out the unknown... with a minor hope of a ticket somewhere away from this dangerous place.\n\nEconomy is split between Four things.\nFood to level and heal your heroes.\nScience to remove cooldown on abilites or research new modules that will make your journey easier (to make it possible that you might survive without good luck or being veteran to the game)\nbuilding material (dont recall correct term) That you build modules that increases one of these three or many minor one with offensive defensive or boosts to the room you build them in.\nAnd finally we have Dust...

The option is yours, but know this; To many dark rooms will for certain mean a bigger fight once they come... And they will come for either your blood or powercrystal (your dungeonheart where dust is stored).\n\nThere is currently a bunch of diffrent unique heroes(more being added all the time), you start with a few ones, all being unique. But during your journey you will run into outsiders, good and twisted characters, all ready to join you up to a party of max 4. Keep them alive for 3 levels and your permantly unlock them for your next round... which open up the game depth even more. The levels is randomized, however the number of doors isnt.

There's currently no Coop mentioned, and I have not tried the ships / gametype variants so I will not mention either.\n\nMy GOTY candidate. There's a lot more here than what you see at first glance.\n\nPROS:\n- Hero choices make the game varied, and engaging.\n- Gear and Builds become interesting and somewhat diverse (more on this later).\n- Resource management is straightforward, and easy to grasp. Interesting decision on how you use your resources added in later patches.\n- Level of difficulty is very high (this might be a con for some)\n- Excellent art style.\n\nCONS:\n- RNG can definitely kill your run, hands down.\n- Balance was lacking a bit. There were some OP builds which made the game easier, though some of these have been addressed in patches.\n- The game expects you to learn its ins and outs via investing time. It's not very easy to pick up.\n- Unlocking heroes can be fun, though once you get to the latter heroes to unlock, it feels like a time sink.\n\nOverall:\nBottom line for me personally is that I really enjoy the depth of the game. It took me hours of fiddling around with what's possible, and strategizing and using tactics and a relatively high level of micromanagement to beat the game on its hardest difficulty. Though RNG can make this game a bit more tedious than I'd like, I stil find this a refreshing take on the genre (or mash of genre's in this case).\n\nIt's really the gameplay and the extreme level of dedication and understanding of the systems in the game that make this  extremely fullfilling to play. Few experiences have pushed me that close to the edge and I enjoyed every minute of it. There's definitely some downsides, but compared to most triple A releases this game packs a huge punch for the price. It does offer a large amount of replayability in the form of heroes, and playing to their strengths plus adjusting strategy to come up with new playstyles on the fly. You won't win on the first go, and chances are it will take you some time to even clear a few floors. But if you're like me, you'll really enjoy the experience.\n\nOnce CoOp is added, I'll be back in to spend some time trying to sync with my friends and beat the game for my 7th time.","October 24, 2014","true","184.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a rogue-like and it can be hard and unforgiving at time but that makes it all the more sadistically fun.  The RPG elements including character leveling, equipment, and individual abilities unique to each hero, mesh well and ensures multiple playthroughs which can be very unique depending on which heros the player is using.  As your heros open doors of the dungeon they accumulate resouces which are used to build offencive and defensive turrets in rooms,  power rooms and constructed turrets or generators in rooms,  to level characters and to purchase turret and character upgrades and equipment.   The combination of managing all these elements might first sound complex  but the game does a great job at intragating all the features togather well in a way that makes sense and also makes you think tactically the further you get in the dungeon.\nThough the game is stll in development  it  has been updated regularly in the six or so months that I have owned it and alot of new content has been added.  At my last playthrough there were eight levels to the dungeon implemented and over ten heros (though I have only unlocked 5 or so) with more being planned as the game is updated and gets closer to offical release.","June 20, 2014","true","43.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Along the way they recruited a young burglar named Golgy Phurtiver who, incidentally, thinks she's a spider of some sort.\n\nThings were going relatively well - Nurse Ratchet discovered a woman in stasis, who was revealed to be a bounty hunter named Sara Numas. They did not know that they were effectively recruiting Hikensha's replacement, however, who died tried to defend another survivor from the alien natives.\n\nThe party marched upwards, exploring for every resource they could.

There are enough characters and since adding 8 levels an indepth clear is currently around 3 hours of play. Though i have read aot of complaints and they fall into two categories too hard or no diversity.\nIn respect to difficulty there are currently two options, easy and too easy. As their name suggests  neither option is very difficult. However if you play this game and do not consider that is a combinations of many game types and aproach it as one you will lose fairly quickly. Also, aproaching each level with no forethought or strategy will cause a loss aswell. It is of course a strategy game so those who lack it will not suceed. Furthermore, the learning curve is fairly easy and once you get the hang of it is a blast.\nIn respect to a lack of diversity you have to remember this game is still in alpha. if you are buying a early access game looking for a full game experience then you will be dissapointed. The devs are pushing out consistent updates, much faster than alot of the other early access games on steam. They fix bugs very quickly and if a patch is game breaking they pull it so you can still play while they work on it. By buying the game now you can shape development by voting on their website.\n\nThe game itself is quite simple. There are currently 3 resources industry, science and food. Industry is for building modules and major modules help produce those three resources. Minor modules are turrets support turrets and defensive turrets. Science allows you to resource upgrades for your modules and new modules themselves. food allows you to recruit new heroes after your starting heroes, level up your heores(current max lvl 8 due to 8 Floors) and heal them during fights.\nYou use these resources to build a defense network so that when the exit of the lvl is found you can safely bring your crystal(the object that allows you to power rooms so you can build in them) to the next lvl. Each level gets increasingly difficult with new enemies and more rooms.\nHeroes: Heroes come in all shapes in sizes and currently there are four stats, and five weapons types(currently 0.6.1). Stats are health,speed,damage and wit. Weapon types are sword, spear, pistol, machine gun, unarmed. health is how much life you start with and how much life you get every time you level up. Speed is movement speed. Wit is comparable to an intelligence stat but is mostly used for heroes you can operate major modules(Operating is to give a bonus to their production rate or bonus it gives) by increasing the operator bonus. Damage is the amount of damage you do. All of these stats scale when you level the heroe and different heroes are more proficient in different stats.There is no heroe that is useless all of them serve a specific purpose and you can win by using any combination of them.Also, there are armors and support items, most with comical names or premises.\nFinally a great amount of thought has gone into this game from the item descriptions and the heroe backgrounds to the strategies that are available and to the details in each room. This ia a great product and i am highly anticipating the finished version.\n","May 23, 2014","true","145.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The progression of opening doors to begin waves and shape the enemies' overall path is the perfect way to marriage the Tower Defense and Roguelike geres.  "What you'll find behind the door" is just random enough that you can experience "garbage runs", but it's balanced enough that a run is never doomed before it begins.\nRisk and reward are balanced very well, too, often in the form of continuous decision making on the player's part: "Do I hunker down in this position, or do I spread out my defenses to guard more resource production?" "Do I pay Dust (resource that lasts only one floor) to a Merchant for items, possibly overextend my resources until I'm done with the floor (and Dust is less precious) or play it safe and make sure I can live to see the next level?"\nThere may only be three floors to the game as of now, but Dungeon of the Endless is already worth the price of admission if you're a fan of the genres.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968892800/recommended/249050/","76561197968892800","Hu Xian Naturewalk","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968892800/","114 products in account","An intriguing blend of tower defense, rts, and dungeon crawler, that suffers the foibles of all three.\n\nThe art style is crisp and reminiscent of FTL, while bringing tidbits of lore from the Endless Space universe. Meanwhile, its cast is relatively new, so there's no worries for those who aren't a big fan of the 4x game Dungeon of the Endless is deriving its lore from.\n\nGameplay largely functions in an RTS micromanagement style. Where in an RTS you may be controlling dozens of units in multiple control groups, Dungeon of the Endless plays in a more hero-themed style, controlling only up to four characters at a time. Multiplayer games allow players to reduce the number of units that must be micromanaged, and a four-man band can each have one player, allowing for very simple or very complex micro scenarios.\n\nMain stumbling block of the game is the newly implemented multiplayer. Because turns are based on doors opened, and because certain things, say, research, demand a number of doors to complete--and because there are a limited number of doors in a floor, and increasing threats in deeper floors--playing with new players is an experience in frustration, as they will be compelled to progress turns through a desire for exploration--whereupon overwhelming numbers of enemies can spawn.\n\nAdditionally, DotE suffers from an overdependence on a turn-based resource pool, and thus the management of 'build orders'. While the build order/research dynamic works fine in an RTS, where you're in a technology arms race against an opponent in a sportlike setting, the opposite is the case in a team-based dungeon crawler. Since as many as four people can be in the same party, there's often a pressing urge to 'do' something, when the gameplay demands the players instead take their time and plan for the whole group. Depending on the player personalities, this can lead to an 'Armchair General' type of situation, where one player makes the decisions, while the rest either simply nod and follow along, or stand around waiting to defend against spawned monsters from unlit rooms. Not helped by this is an "Operating" mechanic on many of the characters, which incentivizes players to hold their ground and utilize a resource building to produce extra resources, instead of exploring seperately. Essentially, every move through a door is a collectively agreed-upon move for the team, or else resources dwindle, and monsters become overwhelming.\n\nSome of the spawning mechanics probably need a little tweaking. As much as a roguelike should encourage preparation, improvement, and memorization of what threats do what, Dungeon of the Endless has a bad habit of rolling the dice on what kind of enemies will pop up on a floor, and some combinations are downright diabolical given lack of dust, a resource that itself is RNG-limited. For instance, one run with a friend spawned massive hordes of yellow enemies that attack the floor crystal, reducing light levels--but the floor also spawned rapidly dashing enemies that FLEE combat, to bust open far off doors, to allow for more monster encounters to occur. Making matters incrementally more difficult, the floor also determined it would spawn an enemy that debuffs the PCs attacks, making juggling all three issues together impossible, for our group. While this is of itself forgivable for a normal roguelike (teaching the player that one particular threat must be seperated and singled out, or that preparing the right technology can avert a wipe), the fact that such a well-synchronized set of monsters can spawn en-masse on the roll of a die after hours of gameplay, and without much warning, does not mesh well with a tower defense/rts style. For layman's reference, imagine if Plants Versus Zombies threw hordes of Gargantaurs and Bungee Zombies at you, before even warning you that the upcoming waves would have them, or even showing you what one did, before sending dozens your way. There is potential for a similarly devastating scenario, in later floors of Dungeon of the Endless.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun and new idea, and I'd love to see it refined into something different. Imagine a more straight-forward dungeon crawler that used this real-time, multiplayer mechanic, without the resource climb. Play this game for how it pieces together some diverse, disparate mechanics functionally and attractively, but don't be too disappointed when it starts to grow repetitive in that old, wave-after-wave, tower-defense way, or just pisses you off with an all-in "zerg rush" via AI mob spawns, that makes you want to take a break from it for awhile.","April 24, 2015","true","76.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But luck is a factor in many games considered good, specially in rogue-likes.

The premise is simple: Your prison ship's been attacked and you've crash-landed on an uncharted planet. You and your motley band of inmates, ship staff and exotic natives must navigate the twelve floors of the mysterious dungeon you've found yourself in by finding the elevator on each floor and using the "crystal" generator from your escape pod to power it and move to the next level up. That crystal is also needed to power the rooms of the dungeon, providing a variety of resources conducive to your survival, but it is limited by its supply of "dust", and each room left unpowered has a chance to spawn a wave of hostile fauna whenever you open a new door on that floor.\n\nThe gameplay is an elegant combination of roguelike, tower defence and classic RPG mechanics. It's both accessible and challenging, with a bit less of the luck factor of, say, FTL (you'll rarely be thrown into randomly unsurvivable situations) and more strategic decisions to make rather than a roll of the dice. While plotting your route through the dungeon, protecting the crystal is your primary concern. You'll have a range of modules to install in a dungeon, from resource generators to defensive weaponry, and as your power demand starts to exceed supply you'll have to get clever with which parts of the dungeon you keep powered and where you open new doors. Your heroes' abilities and attributes vary widely. Some are slow but powerful tanks, well-suited to holding a static position; others are technically-minded and can operate or repair the modules you build; others still are nimble speedsters ideal for responding to trouble spots or running the crystal to the elevator. Managing your heroes is therefore crucial to success.\n\nThe understated soundtrack and the pseudo-pixellated, hand-painted graphics are both surpassingly beautiful, and taken with the game lore (which frequently ties in with that of Amplitude's other titles, Endless Space and Endless Legend) they create a truly unique atmosphere and sense of immersion. The heroes will treat you to some fun banter occasionally, and are great sources of emergent stories. The tale of how you brave robotic swordsman sacrificed himself keeping a horde of nasties from his beloved crystal carrier; or how two of your most dissimilar dungeon explorers form an unstoppable monster-slaying, best-buddy team; are experiences that remain with you long after their runs have ended. Some combinations of characters even have unique backstories of their own, which unfold as they ascend the floors with sometimes-shocking outcomes that I won't spoil here. Simply put, the game oozes personality.\n\nWhether you're a fan of the genre, or simply someone who appreciates an old-school challenge or a lovingly-made game, I can't recommend Dungeon of the Endless enough. Keep your eyes on Amplitude, because they've just had an amazing year.\n\n","March 28, 2015","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The basic premise of the game is to explore each dungeon and find the exit. Each dungeon is comprised of interconnected randomly generated rooms. Many of these rooms contain mobs of monsters that attempt to end your game by either killing your heroes or your crystal. As you explore the dungeon's rooms you acquire resources and have the ability use these resources to deploy defenses. Game play is actually a hybrid of real time and turn based strategy in that you have the ability to pause live game play and issue commands if you so desire. The game can also be played in real time mode exclusively. Once the exit is located, your job is to transport the crystal safely there. If you make it you win the round and move on to the next level. If your heroes die, you lose. If your crystal’s dust level (essentially health, power and currency all in one) falls to zero, you lose. Piece of cake right? WRONG.\n\nDungeon of the Endless has a lot of things going on. At its heart, it is a rouge like (hate that term) dungeon crawler. You explore a procedurally generated environment with a small group of  playable heroes. What that means is this: the dungeons and encounters are never exactly the same. Sure you’ll see similarities, but by and large the environments will never be exactly alike. Additionally, your band of motley heroes isn’t invincible. Once they die, they’re dead… FOREVER. Kiss all that experience and loot goodbye! Rogue like game play; check.\n\nSo what else does the game offer? How about some resource management? In Dungeon of the Endless your success or failure is largely linked to your resource acquisition and management. There are four main resources to worry about: Dust (no you can't snort it), Industry, Food and Science. Every time you open a room you receive an amount of each resource except dust. Additionally, you can deploy resource modules in powered rooms (more on that later) that add a modifier to the amount of a particular resources obtained when subsequent doors are opened. For example, an Industry module will provide additional industry every time you open a new door. Heroes with the required skill can even operate the module and provide an additional, additional bonus to the resources. Phew, that sounds complicated. Of note here is that extra resources, except dust, are carried over to the next dungeon.\n\nDungeon of the Endless also has Role Playing and Character Progression aspects. Even though the game features permadeath you have the ability to level up your hero's and outfit them with gear discovered in dungeons. Your heroes have stats which increase as their levels increase. In addition, as you level up your heroes they gain access to special combat skills.\n\nBut wait, there's more...\n\nDungeon of the Endless also offers tower defense like game play. As you explore each dungeon level you "open up" additional parts of the map. Each new room traversed is dark, which means it is currently not powered. These darkened rooms serve as spawn points for mobs of monsters which attack in waves and make a beeline toward your crystal. How do you stop these waves of monsters you ask? Well, you power some of these dark rooms with part of your limited supply of dust. Once powered, you then use your Industry resource to build defenses. As waves of enemies appear, your smartly placed defenses and heroes take them out. Sounds kinda tower defense like huh.\n\nOne of Amplitude Studios goals is community involvement. Amplitude wants the players to take an active part in the game's development and it is facilitating this by utilizing a system called GAMES2GETHER . One of the biggest reasons to play an early access game is to participate in the evolution of a game. Plenty of Steam early access games claim to use player feedback to help shape the final product into what the community wants... and then promptly don't. Amplitude appears to actually be following through with it. By utilizing it's G2G Votes system, the community has the ability to vote on art and game design decisions. For example, the current vote is for creating a new playable character. There is also a standard forum where players can follow the games development and post their questions and comments. The jury is still out on how much the community will drive development however so we'll have to monitor the process and see how it goes.\n\nLike every other game out there, Dungeon of the Endless is not perfect. I'll cover what I feel are weak points for the game first. The game needs a lot more explanation. This is a reasonably complex game and the current tutorial slides just don't cut it. I found myself with more questions than answers after the tutorial and had to stumble into them myself. A proper tutorial level guiding the player through the games nuisances would help to acclimate players better. As this is just the alpha stage, i'm sure the developers will address this in the near future. The graphics are basic. Again, this is by design but worth noting anyway.\n\nAnother issue is repetitiveness. Although the levels are procedurally generated they all look and feel essentially the same. This in addition to the fact that the basic game play remains the same can make the game feel a bit tedious after a while.  Is there an end to the game or is it truly endless? I don't actually know the answer to that question. But if the game had milestones or varied locations to make you feel like your progressing it might help. Its worth noting that in general I usually don't play rogue like games specifically for this reason. As an old school RPG and MMORPG player, I tend to become attached to my characters and devote a good amount of time carefully picking their skills and equipment. The permadeath aspect of these games is a turn off for me. I like to feel that i'm making progress towards a larger goal and I just didn't feel it with this game.\n\nAll that being said, I still really like the game. Dungeon of the Endless is a fun and reasonably deep game. What's most impressive is the games complexity despite its current Alpha state. There's enough depth and strategy here already to keep you playing the game and checking back to see how it evolves. Also, at this point in my life, I tend to be gravitating towards games that i can play in small chunks. Dungeon of the Endless gives players the ability to save and pause games at any time. If your a new parent like me, trying to juggle work, parenthood, and everything else life throws at you, this is HUGE. For the price of entry, Dungeon of the Endless is definitely forth a look.","May 22, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music is bone-chilling, you can tell its a game of about mystery.  Being stranded with no idea what is behind a door, rooms full of darkness, and there things out there that can either aid you, or things that want to kill you and your squad, it makes it really challenging, you have to prepare for the worst. The art in this game is fantastic, reminds me of the great times when 18 bit was the aspect back in the 90's. Love that its brought that feeling back, the 3D pixel tops it off, all i did was stare on how creative it is, once i saw the trailer, i instantly want this game in my grasp.

You took your heroes from room to room and tried to fight back the hordes going after your crystal. It was compelling then and with the features they continue to add, the game keeps getting more addictive.\n\nThe idea is that a prison space ship crashes on an unknown planet. You need to direct your 'heroes' (guards and/or prisoners) to find the exit of the dungeon that they're stuck in. Each room will have doors. Every time you open a door you discover a new room which may have an item, a resource, or monsters. As you open more doors, you collect resourses and power which you can use to power/light-up rooms. Monsters will not appear in powered rooms while they could potentially show up in un-powered rooms.\n\nThere are two phases to each level. The first phase is strategic exploration and tower defence: you can install turrets in your powered rooms to help your heroes fight the monsters. The second phase requires you to bring your crystal to the exit. It's a bit of a mad dash to the finish line. As you leave a room with the crystal, that room loses it's power supply. The two phases keep the levels fresh and keeps you planning ahead.\n\nIf you enjoy strategy games, tower defence games, sci-fi, indie, elements of RPG, or like good pixel art then this game is for you! Even better, as they're still developing the game, more an more features are being added!","March 3, 2014","true","122.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game wasn't on my radar before and I didn't really expect anything from it. However what I found was a surprisingly addictive roguelike that borrowed elements from a dozen other genres put together into a deceptively complex whole. I've only beaten the game once on "easy" (actually the game's hard difficulty) but doing that took nearly a dozen attempts worth of familiarizing myself with the mechanics and each time felt unique and "worth" it.\n\nThe game's art and music style are very nice and the heroes are interesting, if not in terms of personality at least what they bring to the table in terms of options available to you each run. I feel like they'd work well in a more fully fleshed out RPG setting with expanded mechanics.\n\nIt would be nice if there was some kind of persistence between tries outside of which heroes you have unlocked to start with as I do feel that is a barrier to replayability currently. However even with that said I feel like this game is more than worth the admission price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/recommended/249050/","knetic","K!netic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/","300 products in account","I first played this game in Early Access, and discarded it pretty quickly. The balance was off, it felt too restrictive, and didn't really offer me anything fun. I ditched it fast.\n\nBut I've just installed the release version, and now I'm suitably impressed.\n\nThe game operates on the idea that each door you open represents a "turn", a turn where heroes are healed, resources gained, technology researched, and cooldowns ticked. During that turn you might fight monsters, open chests, find merchants, stuff like that. Your main ways of influencing the game aren't to physically control the characters while they fight, it's to position the characters in rooms such that they do the most damage. Or pop their abilities at the right time, swap their equipment, or change which rooms have electricity going to them (and consequently, have light/defenses/resource collection).\n\nUnlike normal RPGs - there is no gold and no experience points. There are four resources; food, industry, science, and dust. You level your heroes up with food, build turrets/resource gatherers with industry, research new technology with science, and power rooms with dust. Each of these resources is crucial in it's own way, and the management of those resources defines if you win or not.\n\nBecause there's no gold or XP, this game really feels different. The incentive structure is completely unique; you don't want to fight enemies, you need to open doors. But opening doors might get too dangerous once you get near the end of a floor, and it might be better to skip it and run. You might spend food on levelling up, or healing your people. There's no global currency, merchants accept a random resource as currency in trade, and each resource gets used every floor, so you never hoard anything.\n\nThe coop is fun, but it also really needs fixes. You cannot save coop games, so you have to be prepared to stick it out for the 2+ hours required to play a round - or abandon the game. Players cannot share items between them (but they can share resources), they need to sell items at the merchant and have the other player buy it - at a loss. Random crashes and freezes during level load completely take down a lobby (which means you need to start an entirely new game, see the "no saving" above). And there is no character sharing. So if your friend's only character dies, and you're left alone with two characters, you can't share it with him. You might as well start over, or wait until a new character appears in a floor. Characters that aren't controlled by you don't get unlocked in your game. So if your friend took a character you haven't unlocked, and plays the game until that character is unlocked for him, you won't get the unlock. *You* have to play the character (probably in singleplayer) to unlock them.\n\nOverall the bugs aren't too noticeable. And it's a neat game that took all the usual formulaic elements of a game and twisted them slightly to make a totally new sort of game, without getting too abstract or weird about it.","January 23, 2015","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As usual with Amplitude, I suffer from 'one more turn' syndrome every time I play this game. It is harder and shorter than a 4x, but keeps me on my toes all throught the game, unlike in a 4x where one starts knowing noone, this game has enemies that scale, change and destroy constantly, from suicide bomb-bugs to wizards to crystaline bohemoths to weird two-legged wolf-like things.

It's like an rogue-like RPG in that you're exploring a randomly-generated dungeon and dealing with the enemies and other things you encounter there.\n\nThe tower-defense element pulls heavily from real-time strategy and role-playing elements. There's a pretty meaty three-resource system that you engage. You build machines to generate more of the resources then use those resources to build all kinds of offensive and defensive weapons or to level up your heroes (each with their own unqiue attributes, powers and weapons to equip).\n\nEvery time you open a door in the dungeon your machines produce the goods. There's also a chance of enemy waves spawning -- that's where the tower defense comes in. You need to build defenses to prevent them from running roughshod over your stuff (and eventually destroying your precious energy crystal). Smart, strategic exploration plays a big role here, creating choke points and making sure that enemies don't swarm you all at once is key to survival.\n\nOnce you find the exit to the dungeon floor there's a final event where you must manually carry your power crystal from the start of the dungeon to the exit -- all the while fending off enemy's. That's where the Left 4 Dead allusion comes into play. These final runs can go horribly if you haven't powered and defended the path.\n\nSince I've been playing there's been constant adjustment to the economy and difficulty of the game -- this is the kind of fine tuning you want from a game that's in Alpha. But throughout I've had fun playing the game. Even when the tuning made the game insanely hard. Even when the game is broken Dungeon of Endless is fun.","June 30, 2014","true","92.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Although keep in mind, this is a rogue-like first, and a tower defense second, if you go in looking for pure tower-defense you might be disappointed.)\n\nIn any case, I love it when developers who push the boundaries of a genre and succeed in creating something new and wonderful.

The game flow is similar to Faster Than Light, but the mechanics are very different. So you basically do an action that advances the game, a random event is triggered (combat, loot, new hero, merchant, etc.), you have to react to it, manage your base and heroes according to the changes in the last round and then go for another round.\n\nThe visuals are pretty nice and this is coming from someone who loathes gimmicky pixel art execution. Somehow the "modern" colors, lighting and 3D modeling of the dungeon blends really well with the 8-bit FX and character models.\nI would also add that DotE is a good example of Early Access done right - a solid concept, design and roadmap that materialized in a very stable and cohesive game.\n\nMy only complaint is that none of the game's aspects is very complex, even if they seem to take a while to understand when put together. Character management is simplistic, combat is very basic, base management pretty much the same. The challenge actually comes from having to plan your moves well and using the least resources possible for the task, because one needs to stockpile for the toughest levels. Going too conservative on your resource usage results in an early loss, while not stockpiling enough results in a loss on the later levels.","October 21, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, DOTE feels much more like a series of tactical and operational puzzles than it gives a feeling of strategy.

Meanwhile, its cast is relatively new, so there's no worries for those who aren't a big fan of the 4x game Dungeon of the Endless is deriving its lore from.\n\nGameplay largely functions in an RTS micromanagement style. Where in an RTS you may be controlling dozens of units in multiple control groups, Dungeon of the Endless plays in a more hero-themed style, controlling only up to four characters at a time. Multiplayer games allow players to reduce the number of units that must be micromanaged, and a four-man band can each have one player, allowing for very simple or very complex micro scenarios.\n\nMain stumbling block of the game is the newly implemented multiplayer. Because turns are based on doors opened, and because certain things, say, research, demand a number of doors to complete--and because there are a limited number of doors in a floor, and increasing threats in deeper floors--playing with new players is an experience in frustration, as they will be compelled to progress turns through a desire for exploration--whereupon overwhelming numbers of enemies can spawn.\n\nAdditionally, DotE suffers from an overdependence on a turn-based resource pool, and thus the management of 'build orders'. While the build order/research dynamic works fine in an RTS, where you're in a technology arms race against an opponent in a sportlike setting, the opposite is the case in a team-based dungeon crawler. Since as many as four people can be in the same party, there's often a pressing urge to 'do' something, when the gameplay demands the players instead take their time and plan for the whole group. Depending on the player personalities, this can lead to an 'Armchair General' type of situation, where one player makes the decisions, while the rest either simply nod and follow along, or stand around waiting to defend against spawned monsters from unlit rooms. Not helped by this is an "Operating" mechanic on many of the characters, which incentivizes players to hold their ground and utilize a resource building to produce extra resources, instead of exploring seperately. Essentially, every move through a door is a collectively agreed-upon move for the team, or else resources dwindle, and monsters become overwhelming.\n\nSome of the spawning mechanics probably need a little tweaking. As much as a roguelike should encourage preparation, improvement, and memorization of what threats do what, Dungeon of the Endless has a bad habit of rolling the dice on what kind of enemies will pop up on a floor, and some combinations are downright diabolical given lack of dust, a resource that itself is RNG-limited. For instance, one run with a friend spawned massive hordes of yellow enemies that attack the floor crystal, reducing light levels--but the floor also spawned rapidly dashing enemies that FLEE combat, to bust open far off doors, to allow for more monster encounters to occur. Making matters incrementally more difficult, the floor also determined it would spawn an enemy that debuffs the PCs attacks, making juggling all three issues together impossible, for our group. While this is of itself forgivable for a normal roguelike (teaching the player that one particular threat must be seperated and singled out, or that preparing the right technology can avert a wipe), the fact that such a well-synchronized set of monsters can spawn en-masse on the roll of a die after hours of gameplay, and without much warning, does not mesh well with a tower defense/rts style. For layman's reference, imagine if Plants Versus Zombies threw hordes of Gargantaurs and Bungee Zombies at you, before even warning you that the upcoming waves would have them, or even showing you what one did, before sending dozens your way. There is potential for a similarly devastating scenario, in later floors of Dungeon of the Endless.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun and new idea, and I'd love to see it refined into something different. Imagine a more straight-forward dungeon crawler that used this real-time, multiplayer mechanic, without the resource climb. Play this game for how it pieces together some diverse, disparate mechanics functionally and attractively, but don't be too disappointed when it starts to grow repetitive in that old, wave-after-wave, tower-defense way, or just pisses you off with an all-in "zerg rush" via AI mob spawns, that makes you want to take a break from it for awhile.","April 24, 2015","true","76.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But luck is a factor in many games considered good, specially in rogue-likes.

It's like an rogue-like RPG in that you're exploring a randomly-generated dungeon and dealing with the enemies and other things you encounter there.\n\nThe tower-defense element pulls heavily from real-time strategy and role-playing elements. There's a pretty meaty three-resource system that you engage. You build machines to generate more of the resources then use those resources to build all kinds of offensive and defensive weapons or to level up your heroes (each with their own unqiue attributes, powers and weapons to equip).\n\nEvery time you open a door in the dungeon your machines produce the goods. There's also a chance of enemy waves spawning -- that's where the tower defense comes in. You need to build defenses to prevent them from running roughshod over your stuff (and eventually destroying your precious energy crystal). Smart, strategic exploration plays a big role here, creating choke points and making sure that enemies don't swarm you all at once is key to survival.\n\nOnce you find the exit to the dungeon floor there's a final event where you must manually carry your power crystal from the start of the dungeon to the exit -- all the while fending off enemy's. That's where the Left 4 Dead allusion comes into play. These final runs can go horribly if you haven't powered and defended the path.\n\nSince I've been playing there's been constant adjustment to the economy and difficulty of the game -- this is the kind of fine tuning you want from a game that's in Alpha. But throughout I've had fun playing the game. Even when the tuning made the game insanely hard. Even when the game is broken Dungeon of Endless is fun.","June 30, 2014","true","92.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics and sound are nice. Gameplay is almost perfect. However, it does have two issues that are difficult to ignore.

There are enough items to get by, but it feels like there should be more. Part of a roguelike game is hoping you do get what you are looking for. I've finished the game three times so far, and it just seems like it should have around double the items so there is more of a variety.\n\n2)  Mob crowding. Especially late game. It really does turn into a fuster cluck to the point where you can't see the fighting. Even early on, when you enter a room, your heros get clumped together. I would rather see a triple powered mob then 3 smashed together. Sometimes it feels like 50 are crammed into a doorway.

The premise is simple: Your prison ship's been attacked and you've crash-landed on an uncharted planet. You and your motley band of inmates, ship staff and exotic natives must navigate the twelve floors of the mysterious dungeon you've found yourself in by finding the elevator on each floor and using the "crystal" generator from your escape pod to power it and move to the next level up. That crystal is also needed to power the rooms of the dungeon, providing a variety of resources conducive to your survival, but it is limited by its supply of "dust", and each room left unpowered has a chance to spawn a wave of hostile fauna whenever you open a new door on that floor.\n\nThe gameplay is an elegant combination of roguelike, tower defence and classic RPG mechanics. It's both accessible and challenging, with a bit less of the luck factor of, say, FTL (you'll rarely be thrown into randomly unsurvivable situations) and more strategic decisions to make rather than a roll of the dice. While plotting your route through the dungeon, protecting the crystal is your primary concern. You'll have a range of modules to install in a dungeon, from resource generators to defensive weaponry, and as your power demand starts to exceed supply you'll have to get clever with which parts of the dungeon you keep powered and where you open new doors. Your heroes' abilities and attributes vary widely. Some are slow but powerful tanks, well-suited to holding a static position; others are technically-minded and can operate or repair the modules you build; others still are nimble speedsters ideal for responding to trouble spots or running the crystal to the elevator. Managing your heroes is therefore crucial to success.\n\nThe understated soundtrack and the pseudo-pixellated, hand-painted graphics are both surpassingly beautiful, and taken with the game lore (which frequently ties in with that of Amplitude's other titles, Endless Space and Endless Legend) they create a truly unique atmosphere and sense of immersion. The heroes will treat you to some fun banter occasionally, and are great sources of emergent stories. The tale of how you brave robotic swordsman sacrificed himself keeping a horde of nasties from his beloved crystal carrier; or how two of your most dissimilar dungeon explorers form an unstoppable monster-slaying, best-buddy team; are experiences that remain with you long after their runs have ended. Some combinations of characters even have unique backstories of their own, which unfold as they ascend the floors with sometimes-shocking outcomes that I won't spoil here. Simply put, the game oozes personality.\n\nWhether you're a fan of the genre, or simply someone who appreciates an old-school challenge or a lovingly-made game, I can't recommend Dungeon of the Endless enough. Keep your eyes on Amplitude, because they've just had an amazing year.\n\n","March 28, 2015","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The premise is simple: Your prison ship's been attacked and you've crash-landed on an uncharted planet. You and your motley band of inmates, ship staff and exotic natives must navigate the twelve floors of the mysterious dungeon you've found yourself in by finding the elevator on each floor and using the "crystal" generator from your escape pod to power it and move to the next level up. That crystal is also needed to power the rooms of the dungeon, providing a variety of resources conducive to your survival, but it is limited by its supply of "dust", and each room left unpowered has a chance to spawn a wave of hostile fauna whenever you open a new door on that floor.\n\nThe gameplay is an elegant combination of roguelike, tower defence and classic RPG mechanics. It's both accessible and challenging, with a bit less of the luck factor of, say, FTL (you'll rarely be thrown into randomly unsurvivable situations) and more strategic decisions to make rather than a roll of the dice. While plotting your route through the dungeon, protecting the crystal is your primary concern. You'll have a range of modules to install in a dungeon, from resource generators to defensive weaponry, and as your power demand starts to exceed supply you'll have to get clever with which parts of the dungeon you keep powered and where you open new doors. Your heroes' abilities and attributes vary widely. Some are slow but powerful tanks, well-suited to holding a static position; others are technically-minded and can operate or repair the modules you build; others still are nimble speedsters ideal for responding to trouble spots or running the crystal to the elevator. Managing your heroes is therefore crucial to success.\n\nThe understated soundtrack and the pseudo-pixellated, hand-painted graphics are both surpassingly beautiful, and taken with the game lore (which frequently ties in with that of Amplitude's other titles, Endless Space and Endless Legend) they create a truly unique atmosphere and sense of immersion. The heroes will treat you to some fun banter occasionally, and are great sources of emergent stories. The tale of how you brave robotic swordsman sacrificed himself keeping a horde of nasties from his beloved crystal carrier; or how two of your most dissimilar dungeon explorers form an unstoppable monster-slaying, best-buddy team; are experiences that remain with you long after their runs have ended. Some combinations of characters even have unique backstories of their own, which unfold as they ascend the floors with sometimes-shocking outcomes that I won't spoil here. Simply put, the game oozes personality.\n\nWhether you're a fan of the genre, or simply someone who appreciates an old-school challenge or a lovingly-made game, I can't recommend Dungeon of the Endless enough. Keep your eyes on Amplitude, because they've just had an amazing year.\n\n","March 28, 2015","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its uniqueness of being a roguelike combined with a tower defense is what drew me to it. Initially I didn't know that was what this game was, becaues the trailer didn't show much of how the gameplay works.\n\nThe premise is that a ship crashes and you are in control of up to four people who escaped in an escape pod. The escape pod buried itself deep into this planet which you landed on and there are thirteen levels in this "dungeon" which you have to go up. Each level has a certain amount of rooms, and when you open the door to a room enemies may spawn. You also collect Food, Industry, and Science (FIS) each time you open a door. Rooms can have up to 1 slot for a major module like a FIS Creator (one type for each resource), but may also have none. Rooms can also have several minor module slots which can have laser turrets which are the starting minor module. Industry is what is used to build modules and different modules have different Industry costs. Throughout the game you can use science in certain rooms you find to research new modules. There are minor modules that heal your heroes, slow enemies, and much more. However, only powered rooms can have working modules. Rooms are powered by Dust, something that you can collect when you open new rooms and kill enemies. Unpowered rooms that you have opened may spawn enemies each turn, but not every turn.\n\nThere is a room on every floor that has an exit, and you have to bring the crystal from the first room of the floor to the exit via one of your heroes. This starts a turn and enemies come from every unpowered room. If you successfully get the crystal to the exit, you get onto an elevator and are done with the floor.\n\nHeroes are used to attack enemies, increase output from modules, and carry the crystal at the end of the floor. Food can be used to instantly heal them whenever you want, or to level them up and make them more powerful. In some rooms you can find a chest with an item which you can give to one of your heroes, or you can find a merchant which will buy your items or let you buy theirs for FIS or Dust. There are three types of items: weapons, armor, and equipment. They can improve your heroes stats in speed, damage, or defense, or also give them bonuses for fighting with other heroes in a room or alone. There are 16 heroes (now 20 with the latest update) and each one is unique in the type of weapon they use, and the abilities they have. You have control the heroes in your game and can move them to different rooms as you please. They will attack enemies on their own and focus certain enemies over others. I didn't realize this from the trailer but found that it works well instead of having to manually attack enemies. Heroes also unlock active abilities as they level up which you can use for various effects.\n\nI've played a ton of this game since I bought it a couple months ago and I love it. The multiplayer is fun, but there are rarely people hosting matches. If you want to play multiplayer then get this game with a few friends. The multiplayer works well and doesn't require any server hosting or anything. For single player the abilitiy to save the game and come back to it later is great, but there is only one save slot. I would highly recommend this game as it is quite cheap for how good it is, especially so on sale! Also it seems that the developers still work on this game, as shown by this latest update today which added new heroes and items. If you enjoy roguelikes, tower defenses, or strategy games, I would highly recommend this game!","June 8, 2015","true","52.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, they have since gone into Beta, and I can safely say that this is worth every cent.\n\nDotE is best summarized as a mix between a roguelike, turn-based strategy game, and a sort of tower defense. Your goal is to open doors in the dungeon so that you can find the exit and then you have to carry your power source (a crystal) to that exit without it getting destroyed by the various monsters that inhabit the dungeon. The learning curve is a bit steep at first, but once you figure out how everything works, this game becomes incredibly fun.\n\nThere are some drawbacks, such as the technical glitches, occasional crashes (at least for me), and some balance issues, but the devs are highly involved in the community and are taking steps to actively address these issues - more than I can say for other Early Access games.\n\nYou can find yourself sinking a lot of time into this game if you take the time to enjoy it.

Maybe I shoulda saved that for the tl;dr.  And yes, there is a tl;dr, so scroll down if you hate words.\n\nSo after like a 30 second little intro, which you can totally skip, you get thrown straight into the game.  Which is nice because when you die, restarting takes like 0(thats a zero) time at all.  And oh yes, there will be much death.\n\nNow normally, when you play a game, and you die a lot, you aren't usually having a lot of fun.  Well thats totally not the case in this game.  Although the game is still in early access, that means it might be 30% completed if we're lucky, it still manages to entertain.\n\nWhen you die, you start over, and you take what you learned and apply it to the new run.  In all honesty, I have only made it past the 5th floor once.  And... the 4th floor once....  And the 3rd floor twice... on the easiest game setting.   XD\n\nWhen you start the game you pick two heroes you want to take with you, considering right now you only have 3 to choose from, it's not that hard of a choice.  As you progress through the game you'll meet other heroes that can you hire with food, so try to keep a surplus at all times because you don't want to miss out on adding a massochistic marine, or a crazy short guy with a sword twice his size to your team.  I've only managed to unlock two characters so far personally.\n\nOther things you will run across are artifacts which for research points, you can add new modules to your list of goodies, or even upgrade existing ones.  Really awesome, hope to find these early on in a level.  In rare cases, you can even find two in the same level, which when that happens, is like winning the god damned lotto.\n\nAnd without further ado, lets get down to the nitty gritty of this review.\n\nThe Good:  This is the most awesome sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game I have ever played.\n\nThe So-So:  This is the only sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game I have ever played.\n\nThe Bad:  It is not a *multiplayer* sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game.(yet)\n\nLets expand on the Bad:  There is no multiplayer, there is no story, there is no tech tree, and thus is no substance.\n\nLets expand on the So-So:  Mulstiplayer is grayed out, the tech tree is grayed out, the story has not been added, the substance does not exist yet.\n\nLets expand on the Good:  There WILL be multi-player, there WILL be a story and quests, there WILL be a tech tree like thingy; and what does this add to this already awesome sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game?  The most badass thing I have bought in years, duh!\n\nAll in all, even if you don't like sci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl games(You sick of me saying this yet?  I'm not!), you'll still probably like this one.\n\nOh, and incase you are wondering why I didn't review things like music, graphics, gameplay, or anything else like that, that normal people review, well lemme sum it up for you.\n\nGraphics:  It's pixelated.  What more do you expect?\n\nMusic:  It's very ambiant, changes when things happen, all in all, not the best or the worst, though not sure how it could be better.\n\nGameplay:  It's in Early Access, gameplay is subject to change.  Duh.\n\n\nSo to sum it all up, for those of you who hate words, I present:\n\nThe TL;DR: Buy this game.\n\n[Hint] I said it earlier in this review.\n\n\n\n\nSci-fi rogue-like turret defensesque RPG squad based retro dungeon crawl game!

I made it through on my 5th or 6th try, at least as far as the early access would allow (level 4 I think?). I can tell I'm going to love this game though. The two negative things I have to say about it are that occasionally it'll seem a bit unfair and loot will only rarely spawn that you can use if you don’t have a diverse team (something you can't choose). Once I started a new game died after I opened the third door. There was nothing that I could have done to prevent this and was a clear case of the game killing me instead of me dying. Many times, starting out, you'll find that any gear you stumble across is only good to be sold since neither of your two people can use a pistol, for example  (despite one of them being able to use machine guns...?). Whether the latter issue is problem with the loot drops or the gear system is subjective I suppose.\n\nAll that being said though, I love this game so far. I love the genre bending mechanics and the not-quite-shadowrun and not-quite-fallout world. I love the art and sound. I love the droplets of story you get with each random party and each piece of gear you stumble across.

I'm not going to mention them, but they strayed from the "norm" of today.\n\nVideo games have evolved from simple exciting point grabs, to things where you actually had to put some thought into the experience, back to being needlessly simple point (now known as achievements) grabs.\n\nI highly suggest this if you want a game that actually challenges you to use your brain, gives you a proper sense of accomplishment when you complete something, and doesn't hold your hand through the process.\n\nI don't suggest this game if you have a difficult time with failure, an issue with perma-death, and an issue with learning a games mechanics on your own.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nGet this game if you want a challenging video game; Don't get this game if you prefer todays interactive storybooks.","June 10, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All of the seemingly disparate genre elements are tightly and smartly woven together in a package that seems greater than the sum of its parts. Dense with information at first, you're given a lot of room to learn and grow. There are some random elements at work, but as you learn how the game works you will eventually be able to handle what the game throws at you. Difficult for sure, but not unfair or unmanageable.\n\nIn addition to the rock-solid gameplay, Dungeon of the Endless is both an aural and visual delight. The soundtrack is excellently paced and fits in with the game incredibly well, and I'm grateful that the soundtrack is included in the game's files already in MP3 format. Graphics are nicely stylized pixel art with some decent lighting and particle effects layered on top. It's always clear to see what's going on and who is who when things get hectic.\n\nDungeon of the Endless also has a nicely balanced sense of dread about what's through every next door, but also a good amount of humor to break up the tension. Not to mention the growing sense of satisfaction and glee as you make it further and further, overcoming steadily greater obstacles. Besides the initial, steep difficulty curve of learning how the game works, each dungeon has a steady - but fair - climb in difficulty as you progress. It's also highly replayable, further adding to the game's value.\n\nI'm amazed that the developer even tried to make an RPG/Tower Defense/Roguelike/Strategy hybrid, and even moreso that they actually pulled it off so well. I already know that this is a game I'll be coming back to for years.","July 22, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Who put Tower Defense in my Rogue-Like?\nA. Don't question it it's good for you!\n\n2. Why are these monsters so nasty?\nA. They want your sweet Dust! Or your sweet butt. They may want both. Therefore you must defend yourself with pointy objects, shooty projectiles, and most importantly, TOWER DEFENSE!\n\n3. What? How do I Tower Defense?\nA. Get lots and lots of Industry, a good bit of science for researching stuff... THEN PLOP DOWN ALL THE NEUROSTUNS! ALL THE TEAR GAS! ALL THE PEPPER SPRAY (disclaimer: actually only one pepper spray per room is necessary)! AAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA... Or whatever works for you really. That's what I like though.\n\n4. And what about my Squad?\nA. Explore the sprawling xenobiology research laboratory of the Endless with your ragtag party of guards, prisoners and natives to the world of Auriga! Let your Tower Defense onslaught whiddle down your foes, then have your heroes eliminate the survivors in a few well-placed pokes! Also use some of them to operate resource generators for EVEN MORE RESOURCES which means MORE TOWER DEFENSE!\n\n5. Who should I recruit?\nA. Ignore the naysayers, get Lady Joleri, for she is your tanky Broken Lord savior! Also her Dust deficiency-causing honestly isn't a huge deal. Pretty much everybody can be good too. SO FIND THE RIGHT HERO FOR YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!\n\n6. Should I play the game on Easy or Too Easy?\nA. EASY IS FOR MANLY MEN! TOO EASY IS FOR MANLY MEN TOO, WHO ARE ALSO MANLY MEN, BUT NOT MANLY ENOUGH FOR NORMAL EASY. BUT DON'T WORRY YOU CAN BE A MANLY MAN (OR LADILY LADY, EQUAL IN POWER, DETERMINATION AND FLEXY SEXY MUSCLES TO ANY MANLY MAN) REGARDLESS OF WHICH DIFFICULTY YOU CHOOSE AND YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL IN YOUR OWN WAY. Just do what feels right.\n\n7. I beat the game, am I a cool dude now?\nA. You were always a cool dude! But keep doing it to unlock more stuck and be THE COOLEST DUDE!\n\n8.

It mixes turn-based elements and real-time play, so that it's not one constant unbroken action sequence - you get downtime after each room unless you get overrun. The premise is simple: Open doors to explore the level, and beware of enemy spawns in unpowered rooms after you open each door. Find the exit, and carry your crystal from the entry point to it - but as soon as you pick it up, monsters will spawn until you escape.\n\nThe lowest difficulty mode is tough, but reasonable - and there's one more above that if you're looking for a serious challenge. The descriptions of the items are humorous, the game is easy to understand, and offers a good challenge without being punishing. And it's fun on your own, but even moreso with up to three friends you can collaborate with.

The game flow is similar to Faster Than Light, but the mechanics are very different. So you basically do an action that advances the game, a random event is triggered (combat, loot, new hero, merchant, etc.), you have to react to it, manage your base and heroes according to the changes in the last round and then go for another round.\n\nThe visuals are pretty nice and this is coming from someone who loathes gimmicky pixel art execution. Somehow the "modern" colors, lighting and 3D modeling of the dungeon blends really well with the 8-bit FX and character models.\nI would also add that DotE is a good example of Early Access done right - a solid concept, design and roadmap that materialized in a very stable and cohesive game.\n\nMy only complaint is that none of the game's aspects is very complex, even if they seem to take a while to understand when put together. Character management is simplistic, combat is very basic, base management pretty much the same. The challenge actually comes from having to plan your moves well and using the least resources possible for the task, because one needs to stockpile for the toughest levels. Going too conservative on your resource usage results in an early loss, while not stockpiling enough results in a loss on the later levels.","October 21, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's like an rogue-like RPG in that you're exploring a randomly-generated dungeon and dealing with the enemies and other things you encounter there.\n\nThe tower-defense element pulls heavily from real-time strategy and role-playing elements. There's a pretty meaty three-resource system that you engage. You build machines to generate more of the resources then use those resources to build all kinds of offensive and defensive weapons or to level up your heroes (each with their own unqiue attributes, powers and weapons to equip).\n\nEvery time you open a door in the dungeon your machines produce the goods. There's also a chance of enemy waves spawning -- that's where the tower defense comes in. You need to build defenses to prevent them from running roughshod over your stuff (and eventually destroying your precious energy crystal). Smart, strategic exploration plays a big role here, creating choke points and making sure that enemies don't swarm you all at once is key to survival.\n\nOnce you find the exit to the dungeon floor there's a final event where you must manually carry your power crystal from the start of the dungeon to the exit -- all the while fending off enemy's. That's where the Left 4 Dead allusion comes into play. These final runs can go horribly if you haven't powered and defended the path.\n\nSince I've been playing there's been constant adjustment to the economy and difficulty of the game -- this is the kind of fine tuning you want from a game that's in Alpha. But throughout I've had fun playing the game. Even when the tuning made the game insanely hard. Even when the game is broken Dungeon of Endless is fun.","June 30, 2014","true","92.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game offer's so much variety in toughness\namongst your level's and choice's actually play a factor as they set what your able to do\n+ Tough but Easy is what to expect and you have some difficulty option's but still you got\na challenge on either one and it definitly give's a good experience\n+ Variety is abundant in both items, characters, story, and level design which is never the same\n+ Level's offer wild factors which can be unexpected so it gives a experience for those who\nlike strategy and improvisation.\n+ Be quick on your toe's or die because those situations are abundant but formiddable if you\ncannot set yourself on the path to victory with the right manuevers\n\nNow for the few flaw's which some do have but can be there;\n\n+ Tough for those who are not willing to adapt easily\n+ You must defend your core and if that is destroyed at any point you have to redo all you've come to\nand just retry with a new crew and such\n+ Two option's of difficulty make's it seem very limited on choice for difficulty because 1 is relatively a challenge\nwhile the other is a decent bit harder ( The ratio is basically "Easy [ 1 ] : [ 2 ] Hard" and there is now medium"\n+ Option's for customization of the hud and other setting's are limited to some degree but will not expect much on graphic option's except lighting and other's which would be nice to have\n\nOther than that this game bring's tons of gameplay and huge amount of replayibility if you like playing game's you've beaten already but wanna have some fun or a go at again. I'd play this game several time's and have a blast and would keep it for a long time and cant wait to see more content or update's in the future.","June 22, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can power the rooms up, allowing modules (essentially towers and resource generators) to be built inside of them, and preventing monsters from spawning inside of them. Every time a door is opened, you receive your allotment of resources per door opened (depending on your generators) and there is a chance that waves of monsters will spawn from the unpowered rooms, who will attempt to attack your core.\n\nUpon finding the exit to the next floor, you must have a hero carry the core to the exit, each room you pass through losing power as it is disconnected from the core, with monsters spawning non-stop from unpowered rooms.\n\nIt's a pretty unique game, and despite balance issues (hopefully due to the game's incomplete beta state), is quite fun. 4-player co-op is up soon on their roadmap, so it'll be interesting to see how that works, or if it'll be a hot mess with people accidentally opening multiple doors at once due to poor coordination and getting everyone killed.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that the developer has handled this game's early access in an extremely professional manner, and that development has sped along at a steady clip.","June 26, 2014","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm referring specifically to the turrets that grant hero bonuses to armor, strength, or heal the hero.\n- When the world becomes larger it can get quite tedious to manage heroes on oposite sides of the map. Perhaps a minimap might be useful.\n- Switching between heroes can get a bit wonky and it's not always terribly obvious which one you're controling.\n- The 'you found the door, there it is!!!!!' pointers are insanely annoying.\n\nThe obvious:\n- Currently not a whole lot of content is available - early alpha.\n- Game won't be for everyone and you might hate it.\n\nAll in all, I really like this game and hope it manages to accomplish what it set out to do without needing to get dumbed down or glittered up.\n\n","December 18, 2013","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was hesitant at first, only ever hearing the horror stories of recently dropped games. After seeing this go on sale tho i couldnt pass up, and oh boy, I'm glad I got it. The video promoting this game pretty much describes it perfectly. If you like rouge-like games with rpg elements then you will not be dispointed. for me the tower defence style 'defend the base' element got me hooked pretty quickly. the only downside at all about this game for me was the fact that there is no endless mode 'yet'. It has been highly requested by the comunity and may be implimented in final release (fingers crossed) but dont buy this early access planning on having it. Overall this is a great game especially for the price.

The goal is to find the elevator exit for each randomly generated floor, then grab your crystal and high tail it to the exit before the horde of aliens murder you.\n\nThere's also a tower defense and resource management aspect to the game. You can plop down some mini turrets that either damage/debuff enemies, or buff your heroes. Opening a door to a different room is considered a turn, which grants you more resources, but also has a chance to spawn waves of enemies.\n\nThere's a lot more to the game, but I recommend not looking at any guides since most of the fun comes from honing your strategy (dying over and over again) and finding out which playstyle works for you!\n\nCon:\nI would hold off on multiplayer until a save function is implemented.

In the meantime, have fun in single player, still definitely worth the money.","January 6, 2015","true","81.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It mixes turn-based elements and real-time play, so that it's not one constant unbroken action sequence - you get downtime after each room unless you get overrun. The premise is simple: Open doors to explore the level, and beware of enemy spawns in unpowered rooms after you open each door. Find the exit, and carry your crystal from the entry point to it - but as soon as you pick it up, monsters will spawn until you escape.\n\nThe lowest difficulty mode is tough, but reasonable - and there's one more above that if you're looking for a serious challenge. The descriptions of the items are humorous, the game is easy to understand, and offers a good challenge without being punishing. And it's fun on your own, but even moreso with up to three friends you can collaborate with. Highly recommended if you like Roguelikes and want to get your friends in on the action.","September 24, 2015","true","70.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pick two heroes and a game modifier (the type of pod you crash into the dungeon in) and you can recruit an additional two heroes for a maximum of four (if your original two survive) characters with special powers that can level up and equip with items. You get resources by building generators for Industry, Science, and Food and protect them with a host of 'modules' you research throughout a dungeon. (and personal interactions in single player depending if you have two specific characters.) I bought the game on sale and the multiplayer was broken for about 3 weeks until they released a new update but now it seems to be working well for most people. So I guess keep in mind the game studio developing this game is busy with all the other games they are working on at the same time, multiplayer tends to still have an occasional bug. The multiplayer is fun but you need good communication at the end to succeed. Also if you happen to play the game please know this game seems to be taking the ♥♥♥♥ out of FTL by stepping up their naming of difficulties - there are two; "Too Easy" and "Easy." don't be ashamed at ALL to play on too easy, especially if you're on multiplayer with new people.

Don't see that everyday.\n\n(Right now, with the cheap price, I highly suggest you nab this, its pretty cheap as it is)\n\n\nWithout giving too much away, I this game is the type of game that is easy to learn, but hard to master. It's really hard. But that just makes every win very very worth-while. The visuals are just beautiful, the colors are vibrant and the pixel art is simply swell. Plus, it has multiplayer, I've tried it, and it's very unique and cool. You can say it needs cooperation. A lot of it. The game play is cool, the Dust system is nice, the towers to combat enemies are cool.\n\nOnly problem with it is that if you buy DLC, you need to earn what you bought in-game, you don't get it right away.

All of the seemingly disparate genre elements are tightly and smartly woven together in a package that seems greater than the sum of its parts. Dense with information at first, you're given a lot of room to learn and grow. There are some random elements at work, but as you learn how the game works you will eventually be able to handle what the game throws at you. Difficult for sure, but not unfair or unmanageable.\n\nIn addition to the rock-solid gameplay, Dungeon of the Endless is both an aural and visual delight. The soundtrack is excellently paced and fits in with the game incredibly well, and I'm grateful that the soundtrack is included in the game's files already in MP3 format. Graphics are nicely stylized pixel art with some decent lighting and particle effects layered on top. It's always clear to see what's going on and who is who when things get hectic.\n\nDungeon of the Endless also has a nicely balanced sense of dread about what's through every next door, but also a good amount of humor to break up the tension. Not to mention the growing sense of satisfaction and glee as you make it further and further, overcoming steadily greater obstacles. Besides the initial, steep difficulty curve of learning how the game works, each dungeon has a steady - but fair - climb in difficulty as you progress. It's also highly replayable, further adding to the game's value.\n\nI'm amazed that the developer even tried to make an RPG/Tower Defense/Roguelike/Strategy hybrid, and even moreso that they actually pulled it off so well. I already know that this is a game I'll be coming back to for years.","July 22, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It can take 3 to 4 hours to beat it. This makes trying out new chars and tactics a bit tedious.\nThere is still quite a narrow range of strategies to have success in a playthrough.\nThere is no proper tutorial.\nThe multiplayer is a mess.(The gameplay is simply not compatible for multiplayer, you're better off alone)\nThe thing that changed my mind are the free DLC and the welcoming tweaks to the balancing. Random scenarios are more common and more "friendly", so now you actually feel lucky from time to time. A mistake early on can be resolved later (it didn´t used to be like this).\nBut hey, it costs between 12 and 20€ so I can forgive the mentioned cons.\nSo I'm safe to say now that, if you are into these types of games, you'll get entertainment worth your money.","March 12","true","43.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your escape pod crashes in to a dungeon, and your objective is to clear all twelve floors and get the hell out. You start with two squad members, and can pick up more (to a max of four) as you go along.  The gameplay itself is very in-depth, and would require a windy explanation.  There are plenty of reviews that have done that, so I'm going to keep it short and let you know just what kind of game this is.\n\n\nGame elements that Dungeon of the Endless does well:\n\nRoguelike (with permadeath)\n\nTower Defense (a variety of towers that you'll need to complete each floor)\n\nRTS (with pause, research and resource management)\n\nRPG (character leveling and equipment)\n\nSquad-based Combat\n\n\nEach of those elements exist here, and they're all handled perfectly.  The closest thing this game has to a failing is the weakish story, and limited dialogue.  Some of the dialogue is a little poorly written, as well.  The characters are crazy cool, though.  And there are lots of them to unlock.  Don't buy it for the story.  Buy it because it's a jack-of-all-trades video game that masters every job it sets out to accomplish.\n\nWarning:  This game is hard.  The two main difficulties are Very Easy and Easy.

You'd get this game.\n\nReferring to it as a roguelike/tower defense doesn't do it justice.  As an afficionado of turn-based games, I was concerned that this would be too 'realtime' for me.  Not to worry.  The developers refer to it as 'door-based', and only when you open a door does it shift to a quasi-realtime game.  Very similar to FTL when choosing to jump to a new sector.\n\nAlso similar to FTL in the sense that you want as much of the primary currency as possible but never ever seem to have enough (scrap in FTL is roughly analagous to dust in DotE).\n\nThe player is still subject to the whims of the RNG in terms of dungeon layout, shops, item availability, etc., but never punitively so.  Clever play almost always compensates for any randomness in a given run.\n\nDungeon levels take about 30-45 minutes of thoughtful play, which is a bonus for those with real-life time constraints.\n\n\nIf you're a fan of roguelike and turn-based games in general, and enjoyed FTL - I heartily recommend this title.","November 28, 2014","true","52.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Whether solo playing or online multiplayer, "DotE" will give most players a hard time; either by high blood pressure, rage, and/or suicidal thoughts. Theres a few easter eggs you'll catch here and there, and i'll not add any spoilers, but you'll get a chuckle or two from finding them out. Replayability is high (for me atleast). And we cant forget about that futuristic and highly advanced melodic elevator music\n\nI've noticed a few bugs here and there, like heroes getting stuck in the animation for opening doors, which is gamebreaking more or less(if you can risk a hero taking one for the team). Or your tactical map not working, and you have to manually click and drag on the map just to see whats going on. On another note, the servers arent exactly...perfect with connectivity. This game also has its fair share of "THOSE GUYS" who immediately kick you from lobbies without giving you an excuse or even saying hello. It happens ALOT, and its a bit rude and repetitive.\n\nOn the plus side, by having Endless Legend and/or Endless space, you will start seeing a few monsters and races from the other Endless titles. Brings back some decent memories, especially the broken lord Hero, and her impressive defense.Theres different Passive and Active abilites for heroes ranging from typical damage and defense boosts, highly resourceful aggro's, and turret/module upgrades. I believe this is the first game i've witnessed take advantage of hero's gaining or losing power due to thier personality and teammates within the same room as them on the dungeon floor.\n\nBoth Endless Legend and Endless Space (great games by the way, leaning more toward Endless legend) have modding options and tools except for this installment in the Endless series. Hopefully that will change in a few months time BECUASE i'd like to see more heroes, abilities, and possibly monsters and multiple factions from the other games.\nBy getting Emporer and Crystal packs from the other titles, it unlocks characters, ships, and artwork, music etc for DotE.\n\nIt doesnt take a genious to figure out the uses of Food, Industry, and Science (no excuses for those of you who played the previous titles), although theres a slight exception for Dust as the tutorial deosnt exactly teach you how NOT to get your ♥♥♥ kicked the first few playthroughs.\n\nAny way, im out. So good luck and add me if you need a companion or opponent in any of the Endless games. I also recommend Endless Legend for those of you who who like hexagonal turn based strategies like "Michael Meyers" Beyond Earth.","December 3, 2014","true","38.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As soon as I hopped in my first game I noticed the lights and animations that add a level of... depth persay? It immerses you into a world (or dungeon) of mystery. It's ominous dark corridors and glowing lights attract you into a blood bath of creatures and survivors.\n\nAlthough I am waiting for most of the ACTUAL mechanics that will get me to fully embrace it, Dungeon's alpha is no doubt fun.\nI am waiting with a delighted anticipation.\n\nAfter a couple of updates I am inclined to add that the previous statement of 'depth' is ever-changing.  It is increasingly diving deeper and deeper into my heart.  Dungeon of the Endless presents a glimpse of the array of mechanics, visuals and personalities which every consumer was hoping for when purchasing the illusive 'founders pack,'   or the alpha stage in general.\n\nUltimately,  (Finally, Jesus!)   this game is a must-by for ANYONE who loves the 8/16 bit retro games, adventure games, the Endless games, or simply any rogue-type game. (FTL, Binding of Isaac, etc.)\n\nEdit:  So with their new update, my PC can no longer run Dungeon of the Endless without lagging.  Hope they fix this by optimizing better..

As you enter new rooms/areas waves of creatures attack and attempt to reach the crystal you are safeguarding. One problem you have is that power is limited (dust - from the endless series of games)  and can only power a limited number of rooms prompting some tough decisions at times. Unpowered rooms equals spawn points for the enemy.\n\nFinding the level exit brings about a mad dash escorting the crystal being pursued by endless spawns of creatures.\n\nIt can get a little repetitive which I suppose is the nature of roguelikes. But it also manages to capture that one more turn feel. So if you like roguelikes it will probably be your cup of tea,\n\nGenuinely original mash up attempt from a company that tries to innovate and not emulate. Well Done.\n\nA bargain for the price.

This game combines aspects of the MOBA genre with a genre from the roots of MOBA, tower defense. Maybe I'm overexplaining it. This game is a tower defense game that requires your to manage 3 different resources, a team of heroes, and base construction/map exploration. It allows (and forces you) to build structures to increase your resources and defend your buildings, and a hyper-important power crystal. Resources are throttled tight, forcing the player to be proficient at economy, construction, and hero manipulation. The game features a rogue-like model of character growth and map randomization. This is the first game I've ever played that can be considered primarily rogue-like, and it is a blast. It's really hard, but it's still fulfilling when I get overzealous and open too many doors (Opening another door typically activates a wave of combat. It's a simultaneous unstap step/entering attack phase) in an effort to replenish enough resources to upgrade in time for the first wave.","January 6, 2014","true","11.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's one of those games that requires you a few tries to finally get it. You'll likely die on the very first floor on your first attempt, but as you play again and again, you start to witness how much strategy and team micro-management is actually required to succeed.\n\nThe premise of the game is as follows: There are 12 floors in the dungeon. After every 2 floors you're in a new type of zone with new types of enemies, each time getting harder and harder. There's a wide choice of heroes to pick, though most are locked at the start. You can pick any 2 to begin with, and over the course of dungeon crawling you'll be randomly coming across others and able to recruit them to make up a team of 4.\n\nNow here's where you have to get tactical. You have a crystal that is your power source, which you must protect at all costs, and as you make progress through the dungeons, you find Dust, which is used to power up the rooms. Rooms where you've restored power allow you to build researched modules that generate resources for you or act as buffs, whereas rooms without power are dangerous and can randomly spawn mobs every time you open a door anywhere on that floor. The goal is to find an elevator on your current floor and to bring your crystal power source there.\n\nSo the game involves a lot of planning, strategy, tactics, and team management, as well as a bit of luck. As with most rogue-like games, if you lose at any time (team gets wiped out or crystal gets destroyed), you have to start over from the very beginning again. Losing in this game can feel rather demoralising if you've gotten far, since a single dungeon run could take a few hours rather than half an hour that many other rogue-likes have.\n\nA bit of trial and error is required to grasp the mechanics of the game and learning from one's mistakes, particularly where hero combinations are concerned, as some can result in unexpected cutscenes in between levels where one of the party members gets killed off by another.\n\nThe gameplay is really addicting if you like tactics and turn-based mechanics, but as I mentioned, it is hard, so be warned. There are two difficulty levels - 'Too Easy' and 'Easy', but they're more like 'Normal' and 'Hard', so don't be fooled by the wording. If you don't mind the challenge, then this game is definitely worth getting. You can play it both solo or multiplayer co-op.","December 18, 2015","true","22.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","19"

So many roguelikes just create "difficulty" with brute force randomness, but this game actually has a lot more strategy and a lot more interesting decisions to make. I especially like how the light switch mechanic works to shift the monster spawning around, and the fact that you can switch it up on the fly. Sort of reminds me of Desktop Dungeons where exploration itself is a resource. Similar principle at work here, which is very interesting. Even though escort missions tend to be an infamous no-no in most games, it actually serves a fun and interesting purpose here.\n\nUltimately, though, I still don't think this game is for me, so I won't be playing it any further, personally. Because as much as there is a TON of stuff in here that I like, it still has those classic roguelike annoyances, such as opening a door and getting insta-ganked because randomness. Don't get me wrong, some people LOVE that, but it is one of the main reasons why this player specifically does not care for roguelikes.\n\nTower Defense? Yes.\nRTS elements? Yes.\nTurn-based strategy? Yes.\nSquad-based tactics? Yes.\nResource management? Yes.\nSurvival? Yes.\n\nRoguelike randomness + permadeath? No thanks.\n\nBut even as a person who has no taste for most games in the roguelike genre, I have to say that this game is really really interesting and worth checking out. Even though it's not for me, I can tell it's something special.","April 18, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My friends and I were on the last floor of the first ship (Floor 13) and we were about to beat it until all of a sudden everything paused and no one was moving but us. None of the enemies were moving, they werent dying but just standing still, until a few seconds later,I tried saving and exiting the game so I can restart it but it wouldnt let me either, then I died for some reason and then the enemies were moving finally but the two of my friends were still alive so I told them to quickly get the crystal and go to the exit. After getting the crystal and arriving almost at the exit they go into the exit, both of them of course (again to remind you I died) and they tried placing the crystal and it wouldn't do it and thus they died because of this stupid bug. Also this one time my same friends plus one more to make four people were playing and we were on floor 11 and once we moved onto floor 12, we spawned in..... but only three and my friend couldnt join back and we tried saving the game and restarting the save file but they were just dead suddenly. This game is great overall, in fact I love it but there some things that need to be worked out and troubleshooted, We hope in the future that this game is well formatted and ready to play without any problems so my friends and I could enjoy the gameplay for hours and hours again.

The pixelart is gorgeous, the enemies are brutal.

I've played the final product now.\n\nI must say that I didn't think they could have improved it, but they did. This is a great game.\n\nThe balance between tower defense and dungeon exploration is excellent. Both paths are equally viable. If you wish to set up a series of traps that monsters have to crawl through to get to your crystal, you can. You could alsomanage your heros, and set up buff rooms that make them over powered in choke points. Combining both is reccomended though since sometimes enemies might slip through, or you might want to thin the herd.\n\nEvery floor introduces a different enemy set. They start off rather straight forward, stopping to kill your heros if they see them and destroying your major modules. Later on, you get ones that will seek out your crystal, rip apart your fixed defenses, suicide bomb, or even worse they will open doors for you.\n\nThe last is bad for you because opening a door can spawn a new set of waves while you are already dealing with them. It could be a chain reaction resulting in a wave of creeps that you just can't win against.  This forces you the player to seek out these enemies and kill them before they can reach their destination. Have fun :D\n\nThe characters now interact with each other. Some complain that it's too much, but I feel that it sets the atmosphere pretty well. These interactions could even result in you losing a character, so watch out, and pay attention to what they say. If it looks like it might happen, it might be best for you to pick who to sacrifice, and offer him/her up to the darkness before one gets killed out of your control.\n\nFinally, it isn't bug free. However I have yet to find a bug that prevents me from completing the game. I am certain that they are working on the bugs.\n\nIn short, what are you waiting for? Buy it now!","October 30, 2014","true","72.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacebowser/recommended/249050/","spacebowser","SpaceBowser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacebowser/","357 products in account","Games can teach us many things. This game, teaches us that if we’re ever marooned on an alien planet after our space-ship crash-lands there, you should definitely go open every door you can find. It might kill you, since there are obviously aliens behind the doors that want to eat you. But if you don’t open doors, you can’t progress. Deep right?\n\nDoors of the Endless is a great game, with a very refined core concept it loops through. You use your rag-tag band of heroes (up to four) to open doors and reveal rooms. If there are bad things in the room, the heros will automatically engage and fight. You can assist by healing them or triggering their special skills, which get better as you level them up. Each time you open a door, you gain resources - making the act of opening a portcullis much like taking a turn in a strategy game. The amount of resources you gain is determined by what generators you’ve built  in the rooms that can support them. There are three: Industry lets you build turrets and more generators, Science lets you research upgrades, while Food lets you heal and level your heroes. As you reveal rooms, you also gain Power which lets you power rooms, toggling them on and off as you see fit. A room without power is dark, turrets built there won’t work, and worse of all: aliens might spawn there the next time you open a door. Once you’ve found the exit, you need to go back to your ship, pick up the power core, and escort it to the exit. Aliens will spawn non-stop until you either escape, or die. If you make it, you go up to a new randomly-generated floor, things get harder, but you might uncover new things like heroes that unlock for the next time you play.\n\nLike Rogue Legacy, Spelunky, Binding of Isaac and other games in this style, the main draw of Dungeon of the Endless is to play the game enough until you discover little tricks and techniques that are reliable. Then using those techniques, you get further in, unlock more content, and push on until you hit your limit (or the random-generator just decides to screw you over with a no-win situation, which is always possible). There’s great fun in using a game as a game, and Dungeon of the Endless has plenty of game with which to play.","November 29, 2014","true","8.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is divided up so whenever you enter a door, it is like ending a turn, meaning it is split up nicely and gives you a second to breathe, a calm before the storm if you will, and then immediately gives a 30 second push of hardship.\n\nAll of this combined with beautiful graphics and a fantastic difficulty balance and character pool makes this a wonderful game that I would certainly recommend.","November 23, 2015","true","14.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I originally got it before official released and loved it then, and love it even more now.\n\nThe only way I can explain this game is it is almost like a very fast pace 4x game.\n\nYou explore the dungeon, finding rooms, loot, and other characters\nYou expand by claiming rooms as your own using dust to power them.  (And surprising choices on what you claim and don't claim can change you from winning to utter defeat)\nYou exploit by taking a whole wing of the dungeon and build up all your building there and stockpiling resources for the next floor.\nYou exterminate, because if you aren't opening every door and killing everything that moves, you will not be leveled, you won't have tech and you won't have resources to make it through.\n\nAnother thing I love about this game is you will never stop being surprised.  I am 60 hours of game play in, I just had a combination of characters in my team that caused a major event to happen between floors to the point I am standing up walking around the room like, crap, crap, crap, now what am I going to do.  This never happened before, why why did this happen to be 2 floors before the end aaahhhhh....\n\nPro:\n-Quick action\nYou can load up and play through a floor in 10 minutes, or play through a game in under 2 hours (If you live 2 hours :) )\n-RPG Elements\nYour characters don't really get experience, but you can level them with food.  There are a lot of characters each with unique skill sets that are all kinda fun.  If you are like me, you even end up having teams you like.  Ultimately, the only thing you must have in you party is a fast hero, and there are plenty of them.\n-Building Elements\nYou might have to unlock them all, but there are choices for every play style.\n-Replay Value\nEven with just the variate of characters the game has massive replay.  Then, they added different pods before release which add a whole new level to the game by changing the core rules.\n\nCons:\n-Difficult\nIt is just unforgiving.  One mistake and your game can just be done.  Two mistakes and you are a better man then me if you survive.  (Many people will call this a pro)\n-Monster and item variety\nThere just isn't a lot of options for monsters and loot.  You get better version of the same gear and there is some variety in monsters, but I feel it is a bit lacking.\n-Cost\nHow can this company stay in business and make me more totally awesome games if they only charge $12.  They should raise it to $30 ;)\n","November 27, 2015","true","62.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It isn't the big graphics hog that I am used to these days with the Mass Effects and Fallouts, but has a great old school vibe that gives it a great flavor.\n\nGameplay is a combo of dungeon crawl and tower defense, and is accomplished very successfully.  The humor is a nice touch, and is funny without being too cheesy.  (The description of the Energy Bar really made me chuckle.)\n\nI grabbed it on sale, and call it a great bargain.

You'll be confused, lost, sad, and alone at the beginning. However, as you progress through the game, you learn that life isn't so terrible, and that there may be a chance. Then you die and have to start over. Everything is different now; the randomized maps make predicting what your up against impossible. One thing is still the same though: you learned a little bit about how this game works now. You go through and get a bit farther, then die. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Eventually, you find out that there is a backstory if you are so inclined, otherwise you can continue to treat it like an evil arcade machine. This game has a lot of surprises in it that really make me happy: quite a bit of work was put into it and the fact that the creators cared is evident throughout.\nI would definitely recommend this game to anybody that likes being challenged and having to figure things out the hard way on their own. There is nothing quite so satisfying as making it past a level that maybe you shouldn't have, or trumping the unstoppable forces with sheer cunning.

The pixel art is charismatic and the dialogue is quite funny. I really liked the interface of how the game switched between. It feels very fluid and natural to switch between the two fields of view on the fly. The co op mode is also a very fun addition as you discuss and elaborate upon decisions with friends, as you can spend as much time as you want between battles talking over what you want to spend resources on, which is very fun, and the single player game is equally as enjoyable. There are a large variety of escape pods, heroes and modules to unlock and discover that keeps the game fresh and enjoyable and the gameplay is also very innovative.\n\nI definitely feel there should be some gameplay adjustments though, as I really enjoyed the gameplay at its core but some of the rougher edges bothered me. One of the things I felt was missing was the lack of any sort of final boss of any kind, either a single tough monster or a horde mode could have helped, you just beat the 12th floor and the game just ends. Its very anticlimatic and it negates a lot of the choices you've made in terms of building your characters and unlocks. Why does it matter which modules I research and unlock and what researches I grind if I never have to use them in some sort of final battle? So you can simply stumble into victory without really earning it. This is one thing I'd definitely like addressed if the developers make a sequel to this game. Later on, it definitely feels like your victory is determined by which direction you pick. On my first winning co-op game, we picked to go right from the You kind of have to just, so some of the deaths feel quite cheap. The game also has only two difficulty settings, one of which is too easy and the other is too hard and is in desperate need of an intermediate "normal" difficulty to balance out the game a bit. The easy mode is so easy that there's no challenge and you'll have maxed out heroes in no time and thus the game becomes boring and in the harder mode felt like the developers couldn't figure out how to balance the gameplay for higher challenge so they simply spawned a ton of monsters so it becomes frustrating and not in a good way, and it becomes too random, even for a game with RNG.\n\nOverall, the game is quite enjoyable and there is a lot to explore and discover in the game, experimenting with different characters and modules is satisfying, exploring the dungeon is very fun as is weighing up, co op mode is also a lot of fun where you can discuss what you want to upgrade with your friends, however overall the gameplay should have some adjustments in order to make it great.","March 9","true","33.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I've poured countless hours into Torchlight, Diablo, Isaac... so on. Similar to The Binding of Isaac, this game has a very steep learning curve. Unlike BoI, there doesn't seem to be any 'reward' to dying. From what I gathered through a fair amount of Google, you need to luck out to gain enough floors to unlock a hero, every time you want to unlock a hero. Now, this isn't bad, except...\n\nAll the upgrades you purchase - new towers, tower upgrades, so on - only apply to your current run. This game is essentially RNG taken to the extreme. Unless you're the luckiest space marine this side of the galaxy, you're gonna die repeatedly. I get that some games can't just be picked up and played, that you need to sink hours into them before you're going to win, but when winning is locked behind random rumbers and not skill, it becomes a tedious grind that loses all sense of fun very quickly.\n\nThe graphics are cute, the soundtrack isn't bad, all in all, it's a decently polished game.

Dungeon of the Endless has so much to offer once development has finished, and is already offering so much in its current form.\n\nTrying to balence your heroes who are defending with those exploring takes much trial and error, a number of game over screens facing you before a rhythm of sorts is developed. Finding which heroes work better against which enimies, of which there are a number, also takes time. Once again, it may take several game over screens for a rhythm to develop.\n\nAll in all, a game well worth your $10-15 to play as it develops.","December 16, 2013","true","32.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It even adds a tower defense element to the game which is actually very well done and vital to becoming victorious!\n\nIf you are a sucker for rogue-likes like I am, then you'll love this game for hours and hours as these sorts of games have amazing replayability. I only bought it a few days ago and I already have enough hours in it to make my money very worthwhile! I did get this on sale for £3 to be fair but even the base price is great for the amount of hours you'll get out of it.\n\nAnother great thing about this game is the multiplayer. I heard that it was a lot more buggy and a bit underwhelming at launch, but now they've improved it (like separate saves from single and multiplayer) I can say that it's definitely worth telling a friend or 3 to pick it up with you for these instense 3+ hour games! And of course, because it is randomised, it's a different experience everytime, so you'll never really master the game enough for it to become too easy.\n\nThe only real cons I can think of with this game are the few bugs that I've come across, one being as insignificant as sound glitches online and another being gamebreaking if you suddenly disconnect or crash and lose your save file. However, I'm sure this is being worked on and will most likely have a fix sooner or later. One other con I will mention is that the mechanics are a little hard to pick up at the start because the tutorial doesn't give you much to work on, but an hour or two later and you'll be fine.\n\nAll in all, I can say that this game is definitely worth your money! It's a little hard to pick up on all of its mechanics, but once you do you'll be thinking of all sorts of tactics to keep your team alive through each horrifying floor. It's really fun online AND on your own.","December 2, 2015","true","44.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I believe it is. Dungeon of the Endless is the perfect inbreed offspring between some aspects from a rougelike and a tower defense.  It is also challenging and every character is unique in their own way.  Your only goals while playing are to unlock characters and conquer the dungeon. Play it solo or with friends because I believe it is a game that is fun while playing solo and multiplayer.  The updates to the game are also nice and allow you to play as even more characters like Kreyang or some of the TF2 characters. You can get a lot of enjoyment and fulfilment while playing.

Easy feels like Hard Mode until you sort yourself out. Addictive if you like Rouge-like Tower Defense. Many heroes to unlock and use. A lot of similarities but individual strengths that outshine others in their own perculiar way. Like every other Endless game, FISD (Food, Industry, Science, Dust) is a major factor. Learn to keep your eye on it so you don't shoot yourself in the foot. You start off with one pod and it is ♥♥♥♥. If you manage to win with it, you will be rewarded an easier and more fun alternatives. Until then have fun dying till you finally succeed.\n\nReplayability: There are about 7 escape ships/pods and all have their unique playstyle. All very similar but certain changes can have a major impact on what you can do and what you start with. Playing every one of them certainly is more exciting than playing one and only one. Because escape pod sucks. OH MAN DOES IT SUCK. Infirmary and Armory Pod is my favourites so far. Just easier and more enjoyable, which is good because you get one by winning once. I can see myself coming back every so often to have another crack at a duo or squad and see how far I can get before I get eaten.\n\nSoundtrack: Good lord all the Endless games have a beautiful track to go with it. I find it hard to decide which is my favourite or most preferred soundtrack out of the games. This one suits the dungeonesque feeling of it all. I don't really know any of the tracks to not suit a certain situation. I have however feel that this game's music is lighter on the ears despite the tension this game gives me. While Endless Space has a more overall relaxing undertone to its sound due to the spacial atmosphere and the type of game it is. Endless Legend sounding more expressive and folkish due to being on a fantasy planet. Due to that and the factions it requires a lot of culture and different sounds to make it not sound boring. Would either soundtrack work with the other games? I don't think so. It just would feel odd, so AMPLITUDE did a fantastic job. Dungeon's soundtrack suits it just fine for the type of game it is.\n\nCo-op/Multiplayer: Like the other Endless games I found it easy to join. The game changes to account for someone else controlling a hero or 2 with you. Resources when playing solo would give you around ( 3-5 or so per turn for Food and Industry. Science being like 2 while Dust you have to find by exploring rooms.  Playing with a friend means that the resources you would have gotten is halved between you. You can trade resources and even give each other heroes if you look for the button at the top left of the screen (which is helpful if you died and your friend managed to find another hero to join you). So it really encourages you to communicate and work together. If you just build things randomly, you won't have anything later on and especially to give to your friend if the situation occurs.\n\n8.5/10\n\n-1 For the bugs I've encounted that prevented me from escaping a floor. Like going to a door to have the room not spawn leaving you 1 door/room. What would make that worse is if that room happened to have the escape point and it had only one door entering it. Yeah, that happened.\n\n-0.5 For the difficulty it gave me initially and have the nerve to call it easy, so selecting "too easy" makes me feel like I am a baby. THEN have me unlock the Sanitary Pod that is called Hard. I understand it is a rouge-like game and it is naturally unforgiving, would have taken a full point off if it weren't for that. I just find it hilariously cruel.","July 3, 2015","true","60.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I personally love roguelike games and tower defense games, but this game doesn't just combine those genres, it takes them both to the next level. With great multiplayer, albeit tedius to organize, Dungeon of the Endless breaks the trend of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and or unbalanced multiplayer in top down roguelikes. (Binding of Issac:Rebirth/Afterbirth, I'm looking at you buddy). This beautiful game also has great characters, from their design, to their  bios, and even to the small blurbs of diologue they make, my favorite being Skroig saying “Shall we dance, Mademoiselle Christelle?" which brings me to the most interesting part of this game: The Crystal. Yes you will lose if all your heroes die, but you also will lose if you run out of dust when enemies attack your crystal. The blend of roguelike and tower defense is prestine and I reccomend this game not only to people who are fans of one or both of the genres, but also to people unexposed to amazing roguelikes or amazing tower defenses.","January 30","true","28.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Go through 12 floors filled with monsters and crystals, finding other survivors building supplies as you go in this semi Tower Defense mostly Rogue-like. There's something like 16 characters you can pick from, and you can always bring 2 (finding more as you go) to fit your playstyle. There's unlockable modes that alter the mechanics of the game, like 4 starting heroes or Endless mode, but it's all basically the same gameplay. At 15 hours of play, I started losing interest so I'd recommend trying it during a free weekend or demo.\n\nThe major reason I am saying I do not recommend this game is the game is rather buggy, and these bugs are almost exlcusively run enders. Of my 15 hours of play, I ran into 5 seperate bugs that prevented me from both save+quitting (a feature exclusive to singleplayer) and progressing further to "beat" the game. These range from being unable to access a room, monsters having invulerablity and inability to move past them or even being to get the cleared floor menu to appear. These bugs were -extremely- obnoxious to encounter, and ultimately killed my interest in purchasing it.

Just when I thought I had "easy" down, some a-hole monster opens the door by himself, spawning zergs from all directions, while I was buying equipment. My strongest team yet was mowed down in seconds. I had no idea what hit me, thought it was a game bug until I googled what happened.\n\nImagine playing witcher with no saves and some special monster spawns and kills you while your in the middle of leveling Geralt. Clearly these devs are a-holes who have no respect for standard gaming conventions.\n\nThe game is fun, novel, addicting and very challenging. My biggest issue is the huge swings in each level's difficulties. Your team's life is dependent on the whims of the level generator. Depending on how many rooms you can "power up" and how they branch out from the crystal room, any given level can go from a cake walk to extremely difficult. A "low dust" level with 3+ deep branches connecting to crystal room directly is going to be very difficult to complete.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinBrett/recommended/249050/","JustinBrett","Justin_Brett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinBrett/","786 products in account","This game looked like it had a lot of promise, but after playing it for a while the curtain has been pulled back for me, and I'd have a hard time recommending it as a result. It's perfectly fun for the first few floors, and then the game starts pulling out things just to limit what you can do. Want to put turrets leading up to your main defenses? Have enemies that attack and destroy them, wasting your resources. Want, or have to put the big modules in places outside of a dead end? There's enemies that will attack them, too, and are strong enough to blow them up in a couple hits, wasting a lot of your resources. You can't repair that damage unless you have someone with the repair skill, and it seems pretty often you'll have a party that doesn't contain one of those people.\n\nIf you have a good enough set-up to get past those, the game will also start throwing in monsters that will smash open doors, which can spawn more waves, quickly forming a no-win scenario. If that monster is going for a door in an unpowered room (something that becomes more and more common as you progress, since you receive less and less Dust every floor), you'll need to send a hero in to kill it. Don't have one that's capable of doing that without getting killed by monsters that target them? Tough.\n\nBetter hope you get one if you get up to the later floors, because another enemy appears that only spawns in unpowered rooms. It's stationary, but is quite strong, and will make enemies on that floor stronger, and since it's an enemy you need to get rid of it to actually get the after-combat regen. It's easy to kill when it first appears, but since it does along with other monsters in a wave, you again need someone who can run in and kill it quickly without dying themselves.\n\nYou have your pick of two heroes at the start of the game, but it feels like no matter what you'll have some hole the game can exploit, which you need to rely on what heroes you'll encounter to fill. Since some are just straight up better than others, due to Repair and Operate being so important, it can be quite annoying to run into a combat hero when you need another person with those skills, or someone squishy when you needed someone else to work a choke point. Lots of Tower Defense games have dangerous enemies, but I found the ones in this game brought it down a lot.","March 24","false","27.6"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/succinkhtstatement/recommended/249050/","succinkhtstatement","succinkhtStatement","http://steamcommunity.com/id/succinkhtstatement/","52 products in account","After having played this game for over 500 hrs, I have to conclude that this is a bad game.\n\n===\n\nEdit for the comments section:\nI spent a lot of time on the game, but that doesn't make it good.  It means that there was a lot of content.  Walking simulators can have a lot of content, Fallout 4 had enough content to fill several hundreds of hours but it doesn't mean it was a good game.\n\nWhat I believe makes a good game is challenge, with which Dungeon of the Endless does not give.  It attempted challenge, and did well, but a game can only be a challenge if it is not impossible.  With which Amplitude Studios hasn't addressed some edge cases that make the game so.\n\nI played the game thoroughly for the 90% case of winnable scenarios, the idea is good, the execution is just something I can't condone.  Please understand.\n\nIf the game is only 90% winnable, it's a slot machine.  Not a game.\n\nAnd just as we can waste many hours on television or a slot machine, or reading clickbait articles.  The amount of time we spend doesn't make it a game.\n\n===\nA lot of Love went into this game, and I did like it, however it has a few glaring flaws that have not been resolved and I don't see them being resolved in the future.\n\nAmplitude Studios shares it's notoriously buggy programming, with simple issues like forgetting that an array starts with 0, causing very reproducible bugs.  Perhaps it's because they're spread so thin among several clever but poorly implemented games.\n\nBugs aside, the problems are rooted in gameplay ..  But first, what the game does well.\n\n===\n\nAlso, like Amplitude Studios, Dungeon of the Endless mashes up several genres together and does it miraculously.  If it's one thing I would like to credit them for, is that they aren't afraid to innovate and then put it into game form.  This studio is what the indie scene is all about.  Bringing truly new ideas into existence.\n\n+ The Cast, all the Prisoners, Guards, and Natives are beautifully illustrated and designed.  Animations are so immersive and dear to me, and the back stories are interesting and tease of story.\n\n+ Good meta gaming for deciding on doors together.  The game is a board game sometimes, sometimes it's a timed board game, sometimes it's a moba / tower defense.\n\n+ Great unique ideas.  Leveling up is based on Food, not how many mobs you kill.  Science is used to Research or to replenish your character's skills.\n\n+ A lot of random conditions make for stressful challenges, all of which can be arguably survived, some of which you can win.  Stress is good, it means you're being pushed to a limit\n\n+ Monsters are very varied and each have unique abilities.  None of the mobs are simple variations of HP and attack.  They all behave and target different things.\n\n===\n\n- However, where it suffers truly is in gameplay.  Like Dungeon of the Endless, the game is rather flow-chart-esque.  Random Scenarios don't really ask for varied solutions.  It's like being faced with an Apple and an Orange, but they both do the same thing. What's the point ?\n\n- There is no targeting mobs ..  At first this disappointed me.  Then I recognized it as part of the game.  Something that felt unique and perhaps confused for innovation.  After beating the game several times, and trying out several things I realize it as a glaring flaw.\n\nImagine so, you have a character with a gun.  Yes ?  Guns are good at shooting things at a range, which it does.  However, your character is dead set on shooting ( at a range of course ) a mob he's predisposed to target all the way in the back.  So he runs into crowds of melee monsters just to get in range of shooting a mob that poses no threat.\n\nEffectively making ranged combat useless.\n\nOr perhaps, you've got a Dozer + Hurnas combination ( A testament to the game, I've memorized all the monster names and abilities )  The hurnas do a lot of damage to heroes, and the dozer attacks major modules ..\n\nBut if you've got heroes in the game, they won't kill the Hurnas while it's killing them ..  The heroes will tap away at the Dozer which has more HP while they get killed by Hurnas.  That may be part of the game design ..  But it's awfully unimmersive.\n\nIt's just bad game design, plain and simple.\n\nA possible solution would be to toggle the types of tactics characters use, it doesn't have to be true RTS, just choose things like ..  " Target Anti Module Mobs " vs " Target Anti Hero Mobs " and etc.  Maybe even make a little game of it ..\n\n- There are monsters that render your heroes entirely useless.  Which seems neat, and would seem to be asking the player to be challenged by having to build towers.  But there are also monsters that render your towers useless too ..\n\nAnd here is how this design flaw got past QA ..\n\nYou see, in the game, there are random items that allow you to circumvent this issue.  Like an item that allows you to be cloaked from monsters so that you don't get targeted, so you can take out the monsters that render your towers useless ..\n\nThe problem is ..  This item is completely random ( which is an example of a poor use of RNG ).  Effectively, you CAN be placed in unwinnable scenarios.  This is a big Rogue-like no-no.\n\nIt's easily confused for " difficulty ", but there's no challenge in it.  Because there's no win scenario.  You essentially get to choose whether your heroes die valiantly or your crystal gets destroyed.\n\nThis issue would also be arguably circumvented if you could pick up your crystal and go but ..  You can't pick it up until you've found the exit.  So there are situations where you simply can't win.\n\n- I have played with all the characters in and out ..  There is no balance scheme whatsoever.  All of them basically fit into four categories : Nuke, Run, Operator, Combat.  Some characters can fulfill three of these roles at the same time ..  Some characters literally do none of these well.","May 26","false","675.1"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","15","31","0","11"

Tactically, the difference between a hero and a tower is that the hero can move around the map. That's about it. With 20+ rooms on each of 12 levels, it gets repetitive rather quickly once you have an approach.\n\nThere are a bunch of items and abilities, but the vast majority of them are minor stat boosts, with the most game-changing of them being a basic taunt. One of the more common abilities gives you more money for parking a hero in a room with an econ tower, which is about as boring as it sounds.\n\nUltimately I'm glad I didn't have to spend money to find out this game isn't for me.","April 17, 2015","false","4.4"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

It only has 12 floors, and while the difficulty does increase, it's an incredibly short and repetative game, There's very little depth and the dynamics are for the most part the same. Items are not diverse, it feels gimmicky, and unpolished. The graphics are appealing, the 8-bit remakes are everywhere and the nastalgia makes it high demand, and I feel for a 2013 title, the game was clearly trying to capitalize on it.\n\nThat brings up my next point, the bugs. This IS a 2 year old game, and  the multiplayer is full of bugs. Heroes will randomly stop attacking, the movement is clunky, and it has a chance of freezing every 3-4 rooms, requiring a complete restart. Luckly it does have an auto save feature, but if you're not playing with friends, it's incredibly unlikely they will return to continue the game. This should not happen to a 2 year old game, period. This game was obviously rushed and unrefined, the dungeon is obviously not endless, and neither is my patience for this game.","December 20, 2015","false","8.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The Playable Carachters however, did not have this feature. There were times when I had to take a double take and ask myself, "What exactly is that supposed to be?". With the human PCs, you can tell by their shape that they are human, but with the Alien PCs, If it wasnt for the portaits I would have no idea of what they were in the slightest.\n\nThe gameplay\n\nWith all the different labels this game has, I figured it would be a fresh and interesting experience. Dont get me wrong, this game is unique, in a sense... The tower defense is minimal honestly, and pretty useless. when you actually need it, the monsters will get through and murder you. which brings us to my next point on the gameplay, which many of you will dissagree with.\nTHIS GAME IS HARD. and I dont like that. Im the kind of gamer who wants to sit back, have some fun and watch action happen. I know games need challenge, and I can deal with that, but this game is nothing BUT challenge. the ships you get after completion with other ships, what do they do, change up your experience by perhaps changing the levels? No. Give more unique PCs? No, you find them in-game. Change the objective to say defending the shuttle untill help arrives VS periodic waves on enemies? No. all they do is make the game HARDER. as if it wasnt hard enough getting through 20 sections of huge dungeons with only 4 guys, and very limited resources, boom, now for all you people who love to play video games that make you sweat, scream and cringe can take the difficulty as much as you want.\n\nThe PCs\n\nThey are all unique, and I didnt play enough to become a pro (cause not only is it hard, its complicated. Its one of those games that, at least I, look at and go, "wait, what?".) It not only has tons of stats, but debuffs, Tons of items that, although they look like they would do X, they cant do X or fit in Y because they are the wrong type, It also has tons of enemies with specific things, Tons of Events to encounter, and lots more stuff that I cant even begin to explain. And also because it would take me AGES to understand half of the stuff in this game.\n\nTo recap\n\nIf you like not-so pulse-pounding heat of the moment action, tons of complicated content that will take ages to understand, near impossible difficulty requiring lots of retries, and unforgiving die=complete restart components, than this game is the game for you. If you are a casual gamer who just wants to roll up, shoot some stuff and have fun, this is not the game for you.\n\nLike if you found this helpfull, and please try not to flip out on me for not reccomending it.\n\nEDIT: Its also kind of sad instead of changing the gameplay or ANYTHING, they just shove out an Ipad version to make some more bucks.","June 22, 2015","false","2.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"
