Reminded me of Legend of Zelda.\n-Great graphic/art style. Voxel based. Kind of like Minecraft but far better.\n-Animations...enough said.\n-Enemies\n-Crafting system (Extremely Easy, perfect for streaming or for someone who just wants to chill)\nSo many more pros but I really have to get back to the game.\n\nNow the game sounds nearly perfect right now, right? Well, everything has it's flaws.\n\nCONS\n\n-Cannot change resolution settings. In the game you can choose your resolution (1920x1080) but there is also a resolution option that is kind of like what you would find in Battlefield 4 or Battlefront 2015. I am unalbe to put the resolution scale to "High" or the highest setting that they have available.\n\nHere is a link for what you see when trying to change the RESOLUTION settings http://prntscr.com/acvz9r\n\n-Few customization options. Those three words say it all. If you were looking for a game to customize your perfect hero then this game is not for you (For now). I have been informed that there is an update coming soon that will contain MORE customization options which is good news.\n\n\nOverall this game is almost perfect. It makes me feel like a little child again when I was reading my fiction books about heroes battling monsters and other evil creatures. The artstyle reminds me of a Disney or Pixar animation. And the gameplay/combat is beautiful.\n\nFor now, I give the game a 8/10.\nIt is not a 9 or 10 because of the lack of customization, and the inability to improve my graphical settings.\n\nP.S\nTHIS IS FOR THE DEVOLOPERS IF THEY DO EVER READ MY REVIEW.\n\nPlease add a workshop for this game. The Steam community is filled with creative minds that need to be noticed. It will not only save you guys time on creating content, but it will allow us to create what we want.\n\nAlso, do not make this game Free to Play. I love the price it is now. 15 dollars is a perfect price. Do not add any Downloadable Content or anything along those lines. THE GAME IS NEARLY PERFECT right now. Please do not screw up this game.\n\n\n\nThank you to anyone who has took the time to read this review and hopefully I have influenced you to Buy and/or add this game to your wishlist. The developers deserve it.\n\n__________________________UPDATE_________________________________\n\nThey have fixed the resolution issues that I have stated earlier.\n\nAlso, I AM NOT trying to sell you this game. I am trying to inform everyone on what this game is to hopefully interest you into perhaps purchasing the game, or even ignoring it and saving your money and buying  a different product. I say this because I got messaged a lot of people calling me a "Sellout" and a "Paid Reviewer". Just putting this out there.","March 8","true","9.1"," 189 of 201 people (94%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","94","189","201","20","6"

Though, I have played many, many games in my lifetime. So, Here is my day 1 review - First 7 hour block of Portal Knights.\n\nThe basics\nThree classes, Ive only tried the Mage/Wizard class so far. So, I cant speak of the other classes. However, Ive died a few times. Mistakes happen. It takes a minute or two just to get used to the combat camera. Once you get over that little hump the game plays really well. Day and Night cycles are nice. The sun looks great rising. Very animated and pretty.\n\nCharacter creation is alright, limited but the game is new and under development so No worries there. Monsters are of a low IQ, But fighting 8 or so at a time is still tricky.Some hit pretty hard too. A few trickyones early on.\nThe game itself concerning the quests and exploration are really nice. Basic tutorial that gives you an idea of how it works. Quick and simple. I liked it.\n\nThe islands start really small so far, but they clearly grow larger and larger every island you jump to. Different climates and resources on certain places, very nice touch. Its not a linear path either.You can find advanced materials long before you can use them if you explore. There are hidden caches of exp and useful blocks as well, but they require some cunning to find. I truly appreciate that in this game.\n\nThe dungeons you find make you explore, the lighting and setups are very awesome. Great scenery you can borrow from them too. Fought the first boss, not too difficult but you will appreciate the combat system so much more when you fight the boss.\n\nI see some of the other reviews dog on the crafting system. Its perfect. Gamers are extremely lazy these days and I truly appreciate the way this crafting system is. Its not too hard (Think EverQuest 1999) and its not too easy (Minecraft/Terarria). Ive come across some recipies and those are awesome too. Looking forward to finding more.\n\nBasically, The game gets a solid 8/10\n\nThe only cons I have are as follows:\n\nSplitting stacks. Cant do it yet.\nRebinding Keys. Cant do it yet.\nGraphics adjustments. Nothing to adjust. (NOTE: Its 2016. This game isnt groundbreaking graphically. May not be needed)\n\nI am looking forward to getting further in this game and updating my review. for now its solid. Esp for 12 bucks.\n\n-Trounce\n21 Years of gaming experience and counting.","February 25","true","13.9"," 146 of 165 people (88%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","88","146","165","16","0"

I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nPortal Knights has an interesting and good mix and RPG, exploration, and sandbox elements within its gameplay. For me it felt as if the controls were a bit odd especially in combat, especially since you are unable to jump while in combat mode. Its controls definitely feel odd at first and first person I feel is only useful really useful for building as combat in that view can be tedious. The different recipes that can be created and the idea of upgradable workstations is great. The inventory/ backpack however feels a bit incomplete as some items do not automatically stack in it when you find more of them. You also are forced to click, hold, then drag items from your inventory and are also unable to quickly move them like you can in other sandbox games.\nThere is no pause option in single player/offline mode which is a tad of an annoyance if you quickly have to go do something and then you die since there is no pause. There are three classes to currently choose from and from what I see there are no specializations in weaponry or armour for any class as you can just equip the other classes armour and are able to craft it. It’s good to make classes stand out to really make them specialize and have special items.\nFrom what I have seen the single player gameplay consists of going from island to island advancing through portals and eventually fighting bosses and being able to settle on of the islands. The first island or the tutorial island is interesting in how it gives objectives and little quests for you to do, but that is not seen in other islands. Perhaps even a kill X amount of creatures quest would be fun if you are allowed to manage your active quests/objectives.\nAnother cool feature is that the universes where the islands are contained and characters are compatible with each other, meaning that you can start your high level character in a new universe or start your new character in your old universe. So far the gameplay is enjoyable and refreshing and the multiple islands is something of interest and uniqueness to associate with Portal Knights along with its RPG and adventure elements.\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nThe graphics in this game are cute, just really cute. It helps to add to a more laid back and relaxing experience but it’s also beautiful when you look upon the land or your own creations. The art has been done well and the music fits with an adventurous spirit.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ 44 islands to play through\n+ Good mix of RPG and Sandbox elements\n+ Graphics are cute and helps to give a relaxing nature\n+ Easy to pick up and play\n+ 4-person multiplayer\n+ 5 chracter slots and 3 universes slots (saves/world progress)\n\nCons\n**Note since this is an Early Access title Cons and other parts of the review as well are viable to change as the game continues to develop**\n\n- No real class specializations\n- Quests are gone after tutorial island\n- No real challenge (From what seen so far, just really easy to go to next islands)\n- Combat is odd and removes jump ability\n- Some items do not auto stack when you already have the item in your inventory creating two stacks of the same item and forced to click, hold, and drag items to move them\n- No quick move from inventory to hand or chest\n\nSuggestions\nHere are some suggestions I feel would improve the game\n\n- Quests on individual islands not just the first\n- Ability to pause in single play/offline mode\n- Ability to keep jump when in combat\n- Class specialized clothing and weaponry (Only one class can craft/use)\n- Pets\n- New class Necromancer (Ability to harvest enemy souls and craft specialized weaponry which will allow summoning of one undead or the ability to set an automatic undead guard for a certain area like the house. Can be added as a specialization of the current mage class available after a certain level to unlock more specialized gear and abilities.)\n- Quick move (such as Shift+Click) to move items more efficiently from hand to inventory or to a chest\n- Adjustable keybindings\n\nFinal Thoughts\nPortal Knights is fun and easy to get into, but like any game in early access it has its share of annoyances. I was able to enjoy it so far in my playtime and I hope to beat every single island. I was able to enjoy my time and relax within Portal Knights and I would definitely say it would be a great title to play with friends. The islands however are a thing of taste in my opinion as some people like open world exploration and being limited to islands which you have to teleport to and from is odd. It took me a bit to get used to it, but it’s also a charming feature that allows you to simply go somewhere brand new every time to kill, mine, or build. Overall I enjoyed Portal Knights except for some snippets here and there and I say that the developers have a really good chance to make this a great game.\n\nTL;DR\nPortal Knights is an adventurous sandbox RPG title with interesting gameplay. It consists of individual islands you can teleport to rather than a huge open world (from what seen so far). So far it has good gameplay and cute graphics. Overall I would say it’s a fun casual game which can be easily picked up and played solo or with friend.

I don't have a lot of time invested, but so far I really like it.\n\nHOW THE GAME WORKS:\n1. You can choose from 3 different classes. Essentially a knight, archer and mage. You gain abilities, weapons and armor sets as you lvl up and progress through each world level.\n2. There are 44 worlds to progress through. each have their own theme, enemies and resources. (There are also boss worlds.)\n3. The idea is to explore an area, mine its resources then find and repair the portal to the next realm (Sometimes more than one portal.)\n4.You can build homes, various workstations, tools, weapons, armor, spells and potions.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say, (And this is my opinion.) is that each realm is very small. It takes 15-20min to explore each one. That being said, there are 44 realms and you have to go back to previous realms for specific resources at times, so you get decent use out of most realms. And to be honest it is kind of exciting trying to hurry and get to the next area, because you have no idea what it is!\n\nAlso take into account this game is in testing. I personally think this game has a lot of potential.\n\nPROS:\nNice visuals.\nGood progression system.\nEngaging gameplay.\nReally fun co-op play.\n\nCONS:\nSome bugs and crashes. (To be expected.)\nSmall areas.\n\nI like this game a lot and think its worth $15.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MafiaManatee/recommended/374040/","MafiaManatee","Mafia Manatee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MafiaManatee/","47 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst off, let me say this is an absolutely stunning game with so much entertainment value. The price is absolutely worth it. I'm currently trying to encourage all my friends to get this. This game is great thus far. However, there is much room for improvement at the same time. I think with the right development this game could contest minecraft and terraria.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n\nClasses and Perks:\nI'm a huge fan of games where you can play with your friends and everyone has a specific role. As it stands right now, there is much variety for classes yet. The three basic classes are a good foundation, but for this game to truly take advantage of players having roles, you should add subclasses to each of the classes.\nie\nMage:\n-Battle Mage\n-Support Mage\n\nRanger:\n-Sniper\n-Infantry\n\nWarrior:\n-Brute\n-Assassin\n\nThose are just a handful that i could think of, but i'm sure you guys could think up more. And their should be crafting that caters to each of the sub classes. Which leads me to my next suggestion.\n\nLooting/Crafting:\nThe crafting system itself is near perfect. I LOVE how you have to upgrade your stations in order to achieve the ability to craft better gear. There should however be a lot more to choose from for every level. (also having a crafting level would be a fun addition) Not only should their be more variety withen the crafting, there should be more variety with random npc drops. I personally would find more pleasure in traveling to different biomes to grind if there was a chance of a particular monster having a 3% chance to drop a certain weapon, or armor, or item that in turn could be crafted into a very rare item. Bosses and uncommon monsters should naturally drop better loot. I gain so much more incentive to put hours into a game when i can finally get an item that none of my friends have. and there should be 100's of legendary items like that. Games like these are best when you can show off. The crafting for the most part is okay, but i think a complete overhaul of the loot/drop system is in order. ( i think a lot of inspiration should be drawn from terraria for this specific area of the game.\n\nStealth/NPC pathing:\nFirst off, a stealth system would breath more life into the world. Sneaking through dungeons, Hiding from enemies while recovering health. Right now there is zero stealth and approaching mobs feels so direct and boring. Being able to sneak up for additional damage would be amazing, and could allow for you to add classes such as the assassin and sniper.\n\n\nCompanions/Mounts:\nConsidering the maps are pretty easy to get around on foot, the idea of having a mount is a merely for entertainment over functionality one. Unless there were flying mounts that could fly to floating islands. And Companions are an excellent addition to ANY game. Perhaps make companions or mounts a extremely rare drop.\n\nRandom Events:\nEvery biome should be subject to several rare random events. The thought of a random mini boss or waves of monsters breaking into your base would add a little spice to staying in one place for a while.\n\nEthetics/Materials:\nAdd way more furniture and a variety of color in wood and stone blocks.\nWater blocks... that should be absolutely mandatory in any game like this. Even add an oasis to desert maps. The main reason i want water blocks is for ethetics at my base. I'd like the option to build a classy fountain in my town square. Furthermore, it could be used to make the farming process a bit more complex. Also, in the current game farming isn't that useful. I think adding a hunger bar would make so much since for farming. i mean you can't really have one without the other. It would also add more challenge which this game desperatly needs.\n\nDifficulty:\nI appreciate this game for what it is, but it's incredibly easy. I would love to see this game include a revival system for downed allies. Currently there are just no repurcussions to dying other than losing a little health which is so easy to get back. Or at the minimum a respawn timer. This entire game is just low risk high reward. I need a deterant to jumping off a high cliff to reach an edge in a canyon. I should think twice about most my decisions.Perhaps losing a little experience upon death would be a good system as well. Also, level zones should be more relevant.\n\nMage spell revamp:\nThis is my most passionate area of the game that i'd like to see improvement in. As it currently is spells have A LOT of power, but they all cooldown at once. What i desperately suggest is, nerf all the spells and make them cooldown individually, so you can chain spells together. I should be able to buff myself then immediately use an lightning attack. And what would balance this change would be the mana consumption. The mage class just doesn't feel like it utilizes the spells enough.\n\nAnd............... An in game chat system. I don't believe i have to explain why a multiplayer game needs this.\n\nOverall, this game is spectacular and i love it for how it is, but i know with adding new features you could increase the replay value by so much.","March 19","true","57.9"," 93 of 110 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","93","110","3","0"

Beyond the aesthetic, this is a completely different game. Ultimately, for an early acces game, this is great, especially for a younger market that are showing interest in RPG style games. There is room for improvement, but on a whole it feels like more than you normally get from early access with a lot of meat on the bones and I'm looking forward to seeing the updates. For 15 bucks, get around it.\n\nObviously targetted at a younger market, the combat is a little reptitive and the only real objective is to upgrade your gear through a crafting system which is admittedly quite deep, but the pacing of the game is a little slow. There are a number of different armours and weapons that you can craft and use, regardless of your class, which is great, but farming the materials for these items can be quite laborious, bordering on tedious.\n\nThe RPG elements aren't that deep. Character progression is rather linear, with only minor choices at certain levels with a "this or that" perk choice. The creative side of the game seems irrelevant to me, comparing to Minecraft, I see no reason to really put time into building a base in this game as you're jumping worlds so often that you'd never have time to appreciate your work. Chuck the tables and workbenches down, and that's all you'll need.\n\nThe combat is very - spam click, dodge roll, spam click - at least for the mage. The dodge mechanic can be very clunky, and the TAB targetting is absolute trash. That being said, there's still something rewarding about going around kicking enemy heads in. The enemy models are really nice, everything in this game is lovely to look at. When the dodge mechanics work properly, the combat isn't very challenging. They encourage you to play with friends, but I honestly can't really see how local multiplayer would work outside of boss battles.\n","February 27","true","8.0"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","50","54","2","1"

His whirlwind was hitting me for like 80 each assuming it even touched me as it was slow and easily avoided.\nYou might ask, how did you get to the final level 30 boss at level 17? Well, you simply need to equip a bow and you can kill any normal mob in the entire game. The pathing literally has the units running directly at you and if there is a gap in the middle or you are above them they just stop. "If I keep going I will fall off the cliff, Guess I should stop and not find a way around this hole"\nIf the game never gave you experience I am 100% confident you could do the entire game at level 1 with a starting bow, with ease.\n\n2) There is basically no difference in classes.\nOnce you hit level 15 or 20 you can be 5% worse (in the same gear) than any of the other classes. (Warrior 5% worse than a Wizard for instance). Every level you increase all 3 of your stats.. there is no picking and choosing what to get better at to actually bridge the gap between your class and any other class.\nHonestly, based on one of the talents that reduces magic damage taken by Wizards I consider them the BETTER TANK than a warrior. What?!\nThere is no gear or weapon lock outs. So while I'm not totally opposed to this it makes the lack of talent / class differences mean that a mage wearing plate + a melee weapon is the exact same thing as a warrior (and based on my previous point, probably better).\n\n3) The game has no challenges and/or different experiences **Not to be confused with #1**\nTo progress through the worlds you just need to collect 'Shards' which combine to unlock the doorway to the next area. How do you get these shards? Just kill stuff or mine... So for 20 something different worlds you just grind mobs basically.\nIf you grind mobs for long enough on world 1 you can progress right on through to world ~6 until you hit the next 'Shard color'. (Blue -> Yellow -> Green -> Red(Only 1 door) )\nThis is something I accidently did... just happened to collect 12 blue portal cubes and after porting through the first world I just walked over to the next portal and dumped in another 6... so yeah you can just skip entire 'worlds'.\n\ntl;dr This game isn't what you might think it is... they want you to just mine like crazy and the classes / bosses / enemies were a total afterthought while making the game.\n","March 1","false","22.9"," 238 of 369 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","238","369","12","46"

(also building things if you so desire). The game isn't an infinite world like Minecraft. Rather it's a bunch of randomly generated bite sized worlds strung together with portals. When you enter a new world...island.....shattered land...place, you'll have to explore and find the portal gate. The gate starts off empty though, so you'll have to fill it with "portal stones." You get these stones by doing basically anything. Killing enemies, mining things, and finishing dungeons will sometimes land you some portal stone fragments. When you fill the portal with said stones, it opens up to another island. The islands are really small. I've only had one that had any kind of underground network. I think they could do with being a bit bigger.\n\nAtomphere and AestheticThe game has a very light hearted adventure atmosphere with a "cute" aesthetic. This is no voxel game though. The only thing that's square is the ground (and structures). I feel the ground has enough little details like grass and rocks to make it not stick out like a sore thumb. Worlds range from the usually foresty plains and deserts to toxic mushroom lands and tundras. The biomes are all filled with appropriate enemies and vegetation. The lighting is very nicely done, giving things a warm look in light. Overall it looks pretty nice. Dungeons can be a bit samie though.\n\nCombatThis is a huge part of the game, so I'm going to split it down further.\n\nGeneral Combat\nWhile looking for portal gates, you will be fighting whatever monsters are on the world. Combat is very zelda-esque. When you hit an enemy, the camera locks on automatically. While locked on, the jump button turns into a roll button, which is kind of a pain. What if I want to jump in a fight? Well too bad. You can't fight with the camera unlocked either. You CAN unlock the camera, but as soon as you hit something again it will re-lock. Sometimes the camera will lock onto the wrong enemy if you start by using a ranged attack.\n\nCombat Problems\nTHIS GAME IS TOO EASY. That's the biggest problem with the game.\nMost of the fighting so far is just holding the mouse button until things die, with the ocassional roll. If you have a ranged weapon then its all over, you've won. Melee enemies can't jump or find a way up a 2 block height, so you're free to wail on them until they die. Even if you're on even ground, they slowly walk at you while taking hits. Your melee hits push foes backwards, so sometimes you accidentally hit them out of range. This can be annoying if the knockback lets them get another hit in on you.\n\nEnemy Types - What Do You fight?\nBasic melee enemies that run up and hit you. Sometimes they have unique attacks like turtlemen popping inside their shell and spinning at you like Gamera(or Bowser).\nSpellcasting Enemies that will launch their spell.......and then run up and try to hit you, until their spell recharges. Spells include AoE spots on the ground that do damage or basic elemental projectile attacks.\nUnique enemies/MiniBosses that usually run up and try to hit you. sometimes they have special elemental effects on their hits.\nAnnoying Flying enemies that ram you from the sky. So basically they run up and hit you.\nFlying Eyeballs that have unavoidable attacks. no matter when you dodge, they WILL hit you. Screw those things. Run up and hit them....but with ranged. Good luck hitting them with melee.\nBig Bosses that have their own stage an mechanics. The one that I fought was a pretty fun time.Combat Stlyes - How Do You Fight\nAt the start of the game you can pick between 3 classes. Warrior, Ranger, Mage.\nThese classes only change the passive spells you get when reaching certain levels. The only semi interesting one is at level 30. Every class can use every weapon, there are no stat requirements for weapons. There are basically 3 ways to make things' hp bar go to zero. Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, and Spells.\nMelee Weapons are everything from Swords, Clubs, Axes, etc. Good luck hitting flying things with melee.\nRanged Weapons are Bows, Crossbows, Slingshots, Magic Wands, ect.\nSpells.....well in the first tier of the game's crafting the only offensive spell you can get is a Lightning Bolt. The other 2 spells you can get are a healing spell, and a battlecry damage buff spell. Spells have mana costs and cooldowns.\n\nYour Armor also plays a part in your damage dealing, giving you passive bonuses such as critical hit chance or bonus melee damage.\n\nPhat Lootz\nKilling all this stuff must give some good loot right? Special Armor, Rings, or Weapons.\nNOPE. Killing things gives you crafting materials and XP. Speaking of Crafting Materials...\n\nCraftingCrafting is the other big part of the game. You mine ore, kill things, and then make items from it. Craft armor, weapons, spells (yes you have to craft those), and decorations. The only problem I have with crafting is that sometimes you never find some of the things you need. I needed something for a spell that I just never got any of. This could be due to the random nature of the game, but when the one offensive spell that I can use sucks and I can't find the materials to upgrade it, I'm gonna throw off the wizard hat and go run up and hit things. When an item finishes crafting (sometimes it takes a few seconds to craft, sucks if you need to make a lot of that thing) It just sits in the crafting statioin. You have to manually click the finished item for it to go into your inventory.\n\nBuilding Things?You can change the land block by block to get it how you want, there's a few decorations and a lot of different plant life to decorate gardens with. Didn't mess with this much, but it's there....\n\nClosing ThoughtsThe game is pretty good right now. Here's a quick Pro and Con list because those are fun.\nPros\nGame looks good\nLots of Weapons and Armor to Choose From\nSense of Adventure is Pretty Good\nBoss Was fun\nDifferent Envirnments and EnemiesCons\nEarly game Spell Options Very Limited....and by limited I mean they kinda suck\nIndividual Worlds Are Very Small\nCombat Problems. Mainly the Lock On\nTOO EASY!\nI feel like most of these Cons can be fixed though. The foundation for the game seems pretty solid. I look forward to how it will develop. Hopefully it WILL develop.","February 25","true","10.3"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","43","54","6","3"

Shadows are rendered magnificently, bloom effects and ambient lighting are done perfectly, though the different levels of Anti-Aliasing appear to have less of a change than one would expect.\n\nMultiplayer through Steam was done well, and provides a nice and easy time connecting with a friend.\n\nThe game is fairly graphics heavy, though you can turn off many of the effects that can weigh down some weaker graphics cards.\n\nThe game was well designed up until this point, and I have seen absolutely no glitches or bugs occur in game. Perhaps I'm just not far enough, but everything so far appears extremely well designed, as if this was the initial release of a game, rather than an early access beta.\n\nAside from a few features I would like to see in the game, such as inventory stack manipulation (splitting stacks), this game has met my expectations, and blew them out of the water. But then again, those missing features... isn't that what Early Access is for?\n\nIf you like those sandbox building/exploration games like Minecraft, Terraria, TUG, and so many others, this game is certainly one to put on your wishlist. Already, I'm pleased with the game, and believe that it's worth every penny of the $14.99 it costs. Of course, if you're not sure, just give it some time until it reaches its official release.","February 27","true","10.0"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"

It's interface feels like you're creating a Nintendo Mii rather than creating anything complex and the characters have a rounded Lego look to them. Each class has abilities that they learn as they level up although some choices are somewhat confusing: the warrior uses STR as his primary stat so at level 15 he can increase his agility or int which are both pointless for him. The archer can increase STR (melee damage) or Int - again, both pointless?\n\nOnce you've created your character you're dropped on the starter world and given a series of quests to handhold you through the learning process of how things work. Once those have been completed the quests vanish and you're on your own from there to do what you want.\n\nOnce on an island defeating monsters (and, to a lesser degree, mining) gives you portal shards and these are used in the creation of portal stones via the crafting system and six of these special stones placed in one of the defunct portals around the island will power it up and permanently re-enable it for use. This gives you your gateway to another island and is Portal Knights method of progression.\n\nThere are 4 types of Portal stone that you can create and each colour stone takes a differing number of shards - the early starter worlds are accessed using blue portals and blue portal stones only take two blue shards to create each stone. Yellow portals start to appear around level 10 and yellow portal stones take 3 yellow shards so higher level portal stones take more materials to make. A portal will need 6 stones to activate it.\n\nTravelling to another island opens up new blocks, ores, plants and mobs and each island can have multiple portals dotted around it. There's usually a dungeon too and these start off quite small but grow to a decent size on the later levels and are wonderfully lit. Mob variation within the dungeons seems a bit restricted though as far as I've seen - there's flying eyeballs, skeletons and..well, thats about it really.\n\nOnce you get to a certain point progression-wise you'll find one of the portals will take you to a special island. This only has a single mob on it and is a good, old fashioned boss fight. No spoilers here but its an interesting mechanic to drop in between the island exploring and isnt just a straight forward hold-fire-until-its-dead fight.\n\nCrafting could probably do with a mention too. It reminds me somewhat of Starbounds crafting system in that you need specific machines to make different bits and those bits are used in other machines to make items (ie use a furnace to smelt ore > bars then use the workbench to fashion the bars into weapons).\n\nWhen you craft something though it stays in the machine until you click it rather than going directly into your inventory. This is somewhat annoying but Im guessing this is so you can set up large batches of things that take a while and then go do something else while its crafting.\n\nOverall its a very pretty game thats quite polished considering its just come into early access but obviously it still has its bugs. Quite a few people have had crashes/startup errors although the only ones I've personally seen have been a placement graphic bug (it was showing a doorway instead of the correct graphic when trying to place a chest) and a crash to desktop when I used a grenade to blow up a wall because I was too idle to mine it manually.\n\nTips:\n-  Press M to get the map up. On the map screen clicking on a world will let you set that world as your home world or travel to it allowing quick travel to any world you've opened up. Clicking the tabs at the top of that screen will show you what mobs, plants and ores that world has. Useful if you're looking for something specific.\n- On the map screen pressing the icon at the bottom right will port you to the entrance zone in point. Useful if you're stuck down a mine/on a cliffside and cant get back to the surface. Clicking the icon on the bottom left ports you to your home world (home world can be set from the map screen too).\n- Things like doors/windows/furniture/statues in dungeons can be destroyed and picked up for use in your home. I found it particularly useful to rob the nearest dungeon of its doors to keep the drafts out of my new house.\n- The level of the crafting machines define the number of recipes it has access to. Get the materials and upgrade them (up arrow icon at the far right of its interface) to get access to new, higher level stuff.\n- Armour isnt class dependant. Any class can equip any armour/use any weapon.\n- If you're a Warrior and having problems with flying things, carry a bow around as well as your main weapon.\n\nPros\n+ Graphics engine is very pretty especially its lighting.\n+ Music is also very good.\n+ Crafting is in, working and already quite evolved.\n+ Boss fights!\n+ Leveling up and selectable skills for your character.\n\nCons\n- Islands are miniscule and need to be considerably larger. This is my one major gripe about this game - there's hardly any exploration as you can pretty much see from one side of the zone to the other and cross it in about 60 seconds.\n- Islands are also somewhat samey. So far I've seen 1 desert biome, 1 snow biome, 1 swamp biome and 11 green/leafy biomes. Hoping that gets a bit more varied in the terms of ratios of different types.\n- The combat lock-on is annoying. I *know* I can hit tab to retarget. I dont need to be told every single fight.\n- Cant rebind any of the keys.\n- No real graphics options other than resolution,Window/Fullscreen and AA. There's also a Screen border x/y slider but I couldnt see that do anything?\n- No run button. It feels odd to get attacked by something and then just nonchalantly wander away from it.\n\nTLDR;\nVery pretty game in the Cubeworld/Trove/Minecraft family. A few aspects of it are still buggy but overall its quite slick. Worth picking up if you're into those types of games (especially with the 20% off this week).\n\nIts buggy (which is to be expected in an early access title) but its building a solid foundation for a great game.","February 28","true","39.5"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","35","44","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/falconfine/recommended/374040/","falconfine","falconfine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/falconfine/","235 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo after playing about 14 hours of this game, I can say I have a really good feel of this game.  I am very mixed on it.  The game is like  a mix of Zelda, Minecraft, and harvest moon.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThis works OK.  My biggest issues is that everyone has to be in the same portal as the host of the game.  This is really annoying when trying to get mats from different portals.  The only fix we have come up with (my three friends who played 14 hours with me) is that each person who needs different mats leaves the game and goes into their own game to farm. Once they have the stuff they need they can then come back and join the host in their "main server".\n\nVisuals:\nThe game is visually appealing. It runs very well in 1080p, but anything above that it starts doesn't translate properly.  Also has problems with alt tabbing out.  The screen goes to windows screen and cannot change unless you completely reload the game.  I also had some friends who couldn't even play the game because the graphics were stuttering or broken. The game needs major optimization.\n\nCombat:\nThe battles and the monsters are pretty awesome.  I like the range of weapons you can use and how the combat flows. By weapon of choice by far is the bow and the sword.  The bow is good for long range and not taking a lot of damage.  The sword will make quick  work of a group of monsters. The diversity of the monsters is pretty cool changing from day to night.  I would like to see more.\n\nPortals:\nEach portal is pretty cool. They change in vegetation and the monster that inhabitants them.  They also seem to get progressively bigger as you go through each portal with is cool. The first portal is my base and house I have built up.  I would like to see this area changed so it is bigger.  Right now it is pretty small and if you get a number of farms going you run out of space quick.  I have had to clear and add extra blocks to the outside of the portal zone areas to fit stuff.\n\nControls:\nI use a piece of software and have mapped my controller to play the game. I don't know why they haven't mapped a controller to the game.  It works perfectly with controller.\n\nAction bar:\nI have a love hate with the action bar.  I am not sure why potions or sharpening stones when placed on your action bar become circles??? I can select them when scrolling through with my mouse or using my quick key scrolls on my triggers that I have mapped on my xbox controller. They need to get rid of this.  It also took my buddies and I about 4-5 hours of game play before we figured out you have to have your weapon selected and click the hot key that you have your sharpening stones on to repair it.  We tried finding this information on the internet with no luck.  They need to make this more aware of how to do this or change how this mechanic works.\n\nBuilding:\nI love the range of the pickaxe.  One of my biggest gripes with Minecraft is that your hit box was so short. This game makes it very easy to mine/clear stuff that is far away or above your head.  Keep this up! It is very easy to build and create the different items you need to do this.  I have so far built a house and a castle.\n\nFarming:\nFarming works awesome in this game.  You can plant seeds and within an hour they are ready to be harvest. I have a beautiful garden going by my house that I have collected seeds from all the different portals.  My favourite are the cool big mushrooms.  The only other thing I would like to see is possibly pets or animals?  I don't know how you would integrate  them in the game.  Maybe as mounts or as a way to clear/collect stuff?  Maybe unleash a goat in your garden to collect all your cotton :)\n\nMining:\nMining works pretty good.  The only gripe I have with mining is that some of the items you can use to do special mining are junk. I keep going back to my copper pickaxe.  It mines the best and does the best job all around.  The mining claw is junk and the drill is junk.  It would be cool if the drill took out 8-10 blocks at a time for clearing big areas, but it doesn't.  The claw also doesn't seem to really have any big benefit over the copper pickaxe.\n\nCrafting:\nCrafting is very easy to use. You can see what mats you need and get the gear going. The only thing I would really like to see is enchant able or magical gear.\n\nDungeons, spelunking, and Bosses:\nThis is my biggest gripe. My friends and I were so excited when exploring dungeons and caves. Nothing was more of a letdown when getting to the bottom of a cave and breaking open a cache. What's in the cache you ask? Gold? Treasures? New items or equipment?  NOPE.  You got some potions and some mats that you can easily farm by yourself.  They need to change this greatly.  There is literally no point to exploring caves, spelunking, or beating bosses.  They need to change this.  They need to add more mini bosses that are harder to beat and that have a chance of dropping something that is RARE.  Not a potion of health or mana (which I rarely even use) or some mats that are easily collected by yourself.\n\nConclusion\nThe biggest draw to the game is the building/farming  and somewhat crafting side at this point. I have enjoyed those so far, but I find based on what they currently have , it will get old quick. The monsters and boss loots need to be beefed up and better gear drops need to be added.  Also gear needs to be upgraded a bit more.  It needs to be enchantable and a bit more variety to it.  Gemming would be a pretty cool feature.\n","February 29","true","18.7"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","28","33","3","1"

I just go from the heart and write as if I was leaving a message for a friend asking for an opinion.\n\n\nIf you like exploring, crafting and rpg elements its a fantastic game.\nOver all for an Early Access it feels really complete. I think its a pretty casual game at this stage which I hope never turns into a grind-mare like Trove after their full launch. It's similar to other voxel sandbox games such as: Creativerse, Sky Saga, Trove, Oort Online now renamed Boundless. But I feel it's not geared towards building as some of those without time spent terraforming. =)\n\nYou can create 5 characters and 3 worlds and each character can enter any of those worlds and carry their inventory with them. Not sure if this is the case to enter friends worlds. But this would allow you to take a geared character with extra portal gems to a new world and unlock it all relatively quick. Be it for exploring, or harvesting, or just total destruction to farm out and delete. :D:\n\nOn the (M)ap you can fast travel to any island you've unlocked, your set Home or back to the starting point of the island you are currently on.

You also can choose to set any island to be your Home, just remember you'll have to move your storage.\n\nStorage boxes can be made to allow for hoarding the world. Each tier allows 4 more slots from the last. Inventory itself is a little small considering you have many tools, spells as well as weapons to put in there.\n\nPro tip:\nOne of the complaints I saw a lot was lack of resources, and the first couple days I thought so too until I saw the resource locator you can craft. There are SO many resources buried in the islands.\n\nThe bottom line to me, in all honesty..\nThose of you who knew how exited I was for Oort...I feel its what I wanted to see from it when I bought in at $53 last April. Which left me disappointed in everything including support that did not reply after 3+ months. On the flip side with Portal Knights, a member of their team actually commented on my screenshot which gives me warm fuzzies if i needed to actually contact them for support.\n\nI know I forgot to mention some things I thought were cool, but such is life.

Make a pick axe, kill some mobs, create a portal.\n\nThe point of the game is to go to all the worlds and then kill the boss at the end, I guess. The systems in the game are very clunky and strange. Anyway, to the nitty gritty.\n\nThe Good\n1. The game is very pretty and is visually impressive, for what it's worth.\n2. The crafting holds promise for the future, but there is really no point to it other than upgrade your equipment and forget about it.\n3. You can customize your character differently, so there's that.\n4. There are 3 different classes, I'll touch on this later.\n5. Can play first person or in third person mode, which is really nice option.\n\nThe Bad\n--  Combat --\n\n1. Auto Targeting is awful. It is a Tab-Targeting oriented combat, which doesn't really work out very well.\n2. Can't move while attacking. You swing your sword/axe/mace and it moves you toward your targeted enemy a small distance, hopefully so you stay within hit radius.\n3. Camera Locks in combat, and it's very bad. It zooms in and goes into a letterbox mode.\n4. Automatic. You just right click and wait for the enemies lifebar to go away.\n5. Clunky mechanics. You can't Evade attacks midswing, and must be standing stationary in order to execute an Evade.\n6. You cannot attack a mob on a block higher or lower than you in melee.\n\n\n\nNow, the combat could be worse, but it's also nothing special. It's extremely basic and feels very automated to the extent where you literally just hold Left Click and drink a potion once in a while.\n\n--  Exploration/Sandbox --\n\n1. Nonexistant. The "Worlds" you go to are nothing more than tiny floating islands. By tiny, I mean depressingly tiny. Small enough to where you can explore the entire thing in 3 minutes.\n2. Uninspired. The worlds are all disconnected and isntanced chunks of land. There is no reason at all to ever stop and build, because you will leave the island in 7 minutes and be on your way.\n3. Linear. There is no need explore anything, you kill some mobs, get your portal made and then leave the island. There is nothing noteworthy to find and it leaves the adventure feeling dead and bland.\n4. The entire world is made the same every time. Same mob spawns, same layout, everything.\n5. This game feels like the sandbox was an afterthought. You could play the entire game without ever crafting or building anything other than a crafting table.\n\n\n--  Other  --\n\n1. You cannot allocate your stat points when you level up manually, they are automatically allocated, and the Skill Talents are boring and very dry.\n2. The inventory/menu is tragic.\n3. You cannot drop items or trade items. The only way to give another player an item is to put it in a chest for them to pick it up.\n4. No Sprint/Run ability. Can't jump in combat, can't look around in combat.\n\nThis game leaves much to be desired.\n\nSuggestions\nAdd purpose\n\nIn order to progress to the next world, require you to perform a task or defeat a mob, complete a puzzle, something in order for you to feel you are progressing towards something, not just killing some mobs to get your portal crystals and leave.\n\nSeemless World\n\nNo portals. At all. The system is dumb and doesn't make sense in a sandbox game. Sandbox games are supposed to be an open world, not a series of instanced islands (extremely small islands, at that). Give a reason to build a base and crafting station. Perhaps create a "Peace Zone," that instead of "Portal Crystals" you get "Purity Crystals" that you can create a beacon of sorts to cause mobs not to spawn in X radius, and allows you to build Peace Zone only items, such as beds to spawn in or teleport to, crafting stations to upgrade armor and weapons, things of that nature.\n\nThe game desperately needs a large seemless environment, it's the biggest hinderance to the game in my opinion. I had little to know satisfaction running from island to island mindlessly killing mobs for portal crystals. It's a shame, because the game could be great.\n\nCustomization\n\nAllow custom stat allocation. Let me put my points where I want them. There needs to be many more Skill Traits, and better ones too. Seriously, 30% increased mining speed? 15% Reduced Mining Durability damage? What the actual hell? Where is the "build your own story" part of the game at? You aren't given any tools to do this with. There are no quests other than the first 3 on the first world that is more of a .readme file.\n\nAction Combat\n\nRemove the Tab Targeting system entirely. You should not be tab targeting in an action combat game, it should be hitbox swing radius based. You should be able to cancel attacks with dodge roll, and be able to RUN ffs. Enemies are only dangerous in large packs, and melee is horrifically imbalanced and bad. Warriors are useless.\n\nThere is a lot of things I could suggest, but it's 6am and I need to go to bed.\n\nAll in all I feel very ripped off. This game should not have the Sandbox, Survival, Crafting, or Building tags. There is literally not a single Survival based element in the entire game, other than "don't take too much damage because you'll die."\n\nIt is in early access, but I feel that if they don't change a vast majority of the games systems, it won't do well. In its current state it is barely enjoyable. It was good for the first 40 minutes until I realized that there is no point in the game and nothing felt rewarding or exciting.\n\nDo I recommend this game? No. Absolutely not. There are many other great voxel sandbox games out there to play.\n\nOverall rating   4/10","February 28","false","1.4"," 85 of 135 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","85","135","0","8"

I;m not going to say that this is God's gift because yes, some improvements are needed, but again, not even a week in and it's already been addictive and enjoyable.\n\nA lot of people complain that the maps are too small or that they don't see the point of setting up a base but I disagree. As you move through the game the enemies become stronger and it really calls for upgrading your equipment which can only be done at certain workstations after they have been upgraded. As for the maps, yes, they are small, but this is somethign that the devs can easily resolve, but the current state doesn't hinder the game.\n\nThe combat system has a familiar Legend of Zelda feel to it, which is great but definitely needs work.\n\nAll in all, the game hasn't been out a week but there is plenty to do and worth picking up with the 20% discount right now, definitely something to enjoy now and also keep an eye on for the future.","February 27","true","8.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

With that and adding a more RPG aspect to it, it makes this game great for people who want to get into RPG games.\n\nThis game is wonderfully detailed, the aspect of the portal jumping takes a real spin onto the basic game it could of been, this feature adding in an unknown travel as each portal goes to different places, where each zone is its own biome, has own creatures, and its unique recources. The classes are simple, easy to grasp but good, admittedly they could do a more detailed skill line, or add in a variety of new classes.\n\nThis all being said however, the game is simple easy to complete. The whole fact of the AI creatures not knowing how to go around a deep hole makes it easy for mage and archer players to just "Kite them and shoot them over the hole", it's been said and done that the game can be completed with the first bow of the game.\n\nThe games Multiplayer, yeah, want to play with friends? Don't think so buddy, their Multiplayer is broken, and 505 Games are giving vague answers if they are actually fixing it.\n\nAll in all, as of right now, a good SOLO game, updates are required.","March 5","true","11.6"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","24","31","2","0"

A lot of areas need fine tuning to push this game up into a state where it's worth buying.\n\n\n1. Gets too grindy mid-game, after the second boss it's rushing to new islands JUST to grind ores to upgrade your gear. And the ratio of material to refined doesn't help. 16 gold ores for 1 gold ingot and 10 Wonder Wool for 1 Wool Cloth is just pointless fluff.\n2. Needs UI improvements (auto sorting and the like)\n3. Some balancing issues\n4. The islands quickly become stale with no real reason to explore each one, just grind the important resources you need then move on.\n5. The skill tree is unimpressive, just basic passive bonuses every 5 levels.\n6. You can't assign stats upon leveling, it's automated to give 3 points in each plus 1 extra stat based on class.\n7. The game would greatly benefit from some kind of recycling system. I'm sitting on all kinds of resources and items that I no longer need and there's nothing I can do with them, just throw them away to save chest space.\n8. Needs more 'unique' content on islands to keep you exploring them, like minibosses, dungeons, events or quests.\n9. There's several destroyed or damaged structures you find like houses and towers, but they only serve to have some crates to break or get some extra brick blocks. It'd be more enjoyable if they served a larger purpose.\n10. I'm not enjoying the portal fragments, I was swimming in them because I had to spend so much time grinding materials to upgrade my gear I had the option to skip multiple islands.\n11. Old islands resources become obsolete the further you progress into the game, making stocking up on cotton, copper, iron, stone, plants, etc pointless.\n\n\nThe pieces are all there, it's a just a matter of putting them together efficiency. I'm hopeful the Devs will continue to update the game and make this worth buying.","May 20","false","18.5"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","33","47","0","0"

It's one of those games that time disappears. I've really enjoyed the game so far. The game is designed to be a coop experience but so far I've played it only solo and I've still be having a great deal of fun.\nThe combat seems similar to Zelda games with the lock on camera when you attack an enemy and then using this camera you can dodge away from attacks etc.\nBosses fun but simple, again reminding me of Zelda type bosses where they have one set weakness that you just need to exploit until you win.\nThe worlds are small chunks of floating biomes with different resoruces to be gathered in each one.\nThese environments look great and are stunning.\nThere are currently 3 classes to choose from near the start which so far I've only tried the ranger/hunter type character which I'm pretty fond of right now.\nTheres no limits though from what I can tell towards using other weapons, my ranger has magic as well as his bow so there is room to customise your character as you wish.\nYou craft weapons, armour, tools and about anything else you wish to build from castles to simple cottages.\nSo far a great game and well worth its price.

I mainly did Space + A or Space + D. I did get it to work sometimes.\n\n2) While crafting a wooden stool to retore the workshop or w/e it's called, After I clicked craft but before it was done crafting, I exited the craft window and then the workbench completed and had a red "!" hovering above it, the game UI froze. I can look around but cannot interact with the world. I can't move, I can't click anything, I can't open up the menu, nothing. All I can do is scroll up and down on my action bar and look around, but I cannot use anything on the action bar and cannot move, nothing. I even tried clicking X on the game to close it and it won't close, yet I can still look around and stuff. Weird. I'm assuming it's not autosaved so I'll have to start completely over.... :/\n\nThere were some more bugs but I forgot what they were. I'll try to keep this review updated.\n\nUpdate:\nTurns out it is autosaved! I restarted the game and picked up exactly where I left off, wooden chair waiting for me in the workbench! Awesome! I was not expecting that at all.\n\n3) Cannot change graphics settings in the menu, and really none of the options work. Clicking Fullscreen doesnt work, it's always windowed, and whether you select "Windowed Fullscreen" or "Windowed" doesnt matter because the game is always in windowed mode. So you have to maximize the window to get the closest to fullscreen. Resolution settings are on low and there's no option to change them to anything else. The button is broken and 1/2 of it turns black when you click on it.\n\nAudio settings all work!\n\nTurning the camera sensitivity all the way down feels way better to me. But maybe that's because my mouse DPI is set to 6250 on a 1080p monitor?\n\n\nI'll keep the review updated with more bugs & gameplay.\n\n\nUpdate:\nAfter 3.5 hours I'm going to take a break. Currently made it to level 4. I'm not quite sure yet how the game works as far as "levels" go, but I'm able to travel back and forth between levels from anywhere on the map. Some levels have different resources than others, and there's no clear objective to each level, so what I'm doing is gathering resources from various levels (1-4) and taking them back to level 3 where I'm building my house/fortress and crafting new items. I'll play more later and continue updating.\n\nUpdate:\nI never came back to play this yet because all of these other games came out on Steam and other platforms that captivated my attention more than this lol. But I do plan on returning to this eventually and I will continue this review when I do.","February 25","true","3.5"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","29","45","2","0"

I will make this a postive review, because I support these devolopers and the game.\n\nFirst of all, the game has crashed like 4 TIMESS ON ME! Please... fix...\n\nThings I noticed that need to be fixed a little:\n- Give death a bigger penatly, because I have no fear of dying because you keep all your items and you just respawn 2 seconds later.\n- Each block pretty much has the same noise when you break or place them\n- The camera angles are odd at times, but for the most part okay\n- Things get repetitive reallly quickly, and the worlds biomes/terrain are mostly the same\n- Adding different types of tools or weapons (obviously that will come over time) i'm looking forward to that\n- Make locking on to enemies disabled, or tweaked because its O.P\n- Give enemies faster walk speeds, or high jumping, or being able throw object at you. Because when you're archer or mage you can just stack 3-4 blocks up and kill everything without getting injured at all, besides fire and lightning knights.\n- Making islands bigger, with some more underground dungeons possibly.\n\nThose are just some of my suggestions to the game.

It got minecraft(y) feeling in it, especially if you have been whooping around with Technic and its mods. I loved the looks of the game every minute I played it. But almost as any other early access game it has its flaws. I hope I don't repel any possible buyers, the game has really big amount of potential in it, at least after they got good multiplayer work in it. The review is mostly composed for the creators of the game (if they ever read them). I would say that you should buy the game, if this was the final product, but really, if you need that money somewhere else, don't use it on this game, at least not yet. Make the developers need to develope the game way farther and beyond (even it's just 15€).\n\n- COMBAT SYSTEM: Even though I loved it, I kinda hated it as well. I played only 12.8 hours the game but got really bored as wizzard class. The combat system doesn't offer much anything to you, since you kinda dodge or just spam icy balls from your staff. Most of the times it helps you to avoid any direct combat expect jumping away from some lil dragons balls. Spells costs too much mana or they are way too weak (THE COOLDOWNS, OH GOD!), cooldowns match one for all spells. That makes spellcasting really inconvinient and frustrating and meaningles and annoying and... yerh.. I was thinking that maybe it would be much more fun with lots of online friends but after defeating the last boss without it even touching me, I was like "Meh."\n\n- SOUNDTRACKS: Soundtracks were really cool - At first. After a few while or so, at least I noticed that they just started repeating (I KNOW, it's still early access, really big time thank you for making even that few)\n\n- CRAFTING SYSTEM: Woah. This one. I was kinda okay with the idea that I have to get more resources for every new tier, but enough is enough. Titanium bar worth of 40 ores? Seriously? Maybe I'll just keep my iron staff which still kills the monsters easily. There isn't much point in hording 40x8 ores for one anvil, then way more to get armors and weapons, it takes ages and doesn't get you anywhere. The ore-finder-stick-thingy was great invention, even though there should be one for portals as well. I mean, its small island but I haven't found 2/3 portals, even I have gone the island round 10 times and the tower upside down? I like the challenge but please, that makes me just crazy.\n\n- ADVENTURE: I was kinda hoping something more epic, I mean you got really nice subject here. But the problem is now, that the adventure is basicly only grinding, going towers from up to down, and mining. That isn't really much to keep players playing. I loved the idea of the quests first it got me that classic "oh boy, oh boy, oh boy" feeling. But I was kind of disappointed that it just stopped after I got one block put into the house. I really hope you are going to develop some nice backround story for players which we could follow. That or you really need to make 4 p worlds bigger or dungeons wider and to contain something other things but monsters only.\n\nI want to congratulate you for making this far, but to get nice amount players talking and playing this game, that "far", you have just reached, is only a beginning.","March 5","true","13.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Yes the game resembles minecraft in some ways, BUT is very different and much more of an rpg gameplay. Character customization is actually pretty awesome, and can choose between male/female *finally playing like the girl I am...yes!* I will have to say that this game, I would imagine, would be better played with friends. Me being a loner with no friends am forced to play it alone, and it can seem pretty lonely (maybe if they add quests it might help?? ) But is still pretty fun. There is a lot of different resources to be mined and many different things to be crafted. Kinda excited to see where the game goes in the future.","March 14","true","11.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Some of it was spent with me AFK making food or tending my kids lol.\n\nSo far, the game is fun and enjoyable considering it's an Early Access game there are some flaws and bugs here and there obviously. You have 3 classes to choose from: Warrior, Mage, and Ranger / Archer. As of right now, I feel the Warrior got the short end of the stick from the 3. Since he's CQC and with the current combat system, the whole not being to move while swinging your weapon doesn't work too great. Now, going forward... The game starts you off on a small island with barely any monsters to fight so it's an introduction to the game.  Get some wood, make a workbench, kill a skeleton, grab some blue crystal shards and then form blue crystal cubes and rebuild the portal. That is practically what you will do to progress further into the other islands. For accessing the boss islands from what I've seen, instead of blue shards, they're yellow shards. The shards are relatively easy to farm but, I try not to rush through each island considering each island has it's unique resources to farm. The game is not difficult for me, for others I don't know but, I enjoy it because I play it to enjoy the scenary and explore each island and find the hidden treasure chests that they have. So for those who have been rushing through, you probably missed a few. I won't say it's a mandatory thing or the reward from the chests is something amazing but, it's something to do instead of just rushing through to reach the final boss and say... oh well, now what?\n\nI just had my first co-op experience today with a buddy of mine. So far, I feel there should be a trade function or a drop item button, because as of right now... the only way you can give an item to a friend is by placing it in a chest and having your friend get it from the chest. That can be really annoying especially if you pick up some loot that he or she was getting from a loot chest and you happened to be close by and it goes to you instead.\n\nFirst boss was nothing too special but, I will say I died the first encounter because I wasn't sure what to expect lol.\n\nCons:\n\nAuto-lock camera combat needs work.\n\nProgression to other islands are too simple (reduce the drop rate on shards to where it's not so easy or... add a mini-boss spawn when you are opening a new portal to the new zone... something along the lines).\n\nWarrior needs some work, seems slighty weak for the current combat style.","February 28","true","39.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I'm usually really hesitant about opting into Early Access games but I was pleasantly surprised with this one.  I'm at about level 13 and so far the single player has worked fairly flawlessly and I'm loving it.  I've definitely gotten my $11 dollars worth from it and I intend on playing it much more and updating the review as I go.   If you loved Minecraft you will probably enjoy this one since it feels to me similar but improved. The graphics are updated, the level music is great, the rendered levels are small but really cool (one thing I hope going forward is they make them a bit larger so you can really get lost in each one.)\n\nFinal Early Access Update (Having Unlocked All Worlds and Reached the Gate)\nI would still recommend this game especially at the price as it's giving us a sandbox minecraft style block construction here on steam. It's a great base and I'm hoping to see more great additions in play mode to the game as it gets developed.  Right now there is a decent start and I'm having fun with it and I've already gone away from it and decided to come back and build or play a bit more.  The development team has been really interested in taking player suggestions and listening to complaints in the community and I feel they are really trying to create a friendly player base for the game so I'm very hopeful that this game will continue to grow it's player base and get better in the future.","March 1","true","34.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

There are some great concepts here, but the worlds are WAY WAY too small. If they were larger and offered more exploration, then it might be worth it. The crafting system and bosses are interesting, but just such a Massive lack of world and world building, and super small enviroments. They take an element completely away from the game that could be fantastic.\n\nThe RPG element to this game is also extremely minimalist. Everything basically auto-levels for you, and the skill tree is very small and bland. Abilties are built and take up inventory space, as well as weapons. There are no shields and blocking, so having a "warrior" is pointless and you can't really Tank things, everyone pretty much has to dodge.

I saw the title and pretty much blew it off but one day I clicked it, watched a video, and instantly bought the game. It's butter smooth and is well made. There's 3 different classes (typical mage, archer, knight). You can take your progression on any character and join any friend or start a new world. Each world has many different locations you can go through by entering the portals you complete which advance in level (eventually you'll find multiple portals on maps). Each location is a good standard size but what's really cool about this sandbox is every location has different enemies, materials, build, etc. It seems like the farther I get the bigger the locations get also.  You can set any main location as a home world and travel between the locations (each location has a landing pad where you spawn, you can also craft these). On top of that, all the items you gather and craft, you can shuffle around to other locations and continue to build upon that location in your world to expand it, giving it that sandbox quality. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING can  be destroyed and built.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat reminds me of The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker. It has the widescreen focus lock effect and you can roll and dodge. I'm hoping they give players the option to turn it off. I don't enjoy using it with the archer but with mage and knight it works great. You can roll in combat. Each weapon attacks differently (by arc, speed, damage, etc). I have a knight and health + mana bar. Spells are crafted and can be use by any class.\n\nLoot/Craft/Items:\nSo far I've noticed potions, materials, ingredients, misc, etc when looting enemies. You can loot objects like in minecraft by attacking them, broken items are salvaged. Weapons and armor are made by crafting and also have different stats and effects. ONLY weapons have durability and lose full power when depleted but can still by used. So far I've noticed the more you hit with an item the faster the  durablility depletes. There is equipment/talens that gain durability back and help not deplete durability. I've noticed  that slower weapons (typically stronger than fast) SLOWLY deplete durability yet hit very hard. These types of weapons seem to be the best for keeping durability high or by running equipment with durability stats.\n\nLeveling/Stats:\nWhen you level up, you click the add stats and it's automatically done for you depending on your roll as of now the current state. You can unlock a row of talents and switch between them once the level has been reached. It's impossible to mess up your character stats. Your equipment plays a huge roll depends on your survivability which I kind of like but leveling does increase stats. Stats range from STR, DEX, INT. As for equipment, you'll see crit damage, crit chance, dodge/evade, speed, mana, health, regen, and special stats like mining, durability, and so on.\n\nIn it's current state, I feel like the game is completed to be honest. The art style is grabbing and the combat is very fluid. It's very afforadble and very fun in its current state, I HIGHLY recommend it. It's only $15 (I'd pay $30 for it considering most games made today are terrible).","April 30","true","4.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

The crafting system is neat and easy but I've yet to find a reason to craft much of the items. You can blast through levels in under 10 minutes and move on to the next level, so why bother building a settlement?\n\nAfter moving on from the tutorial the quests stop. I often wonder what the goal is... or what am I supposed to actually do? There has to be more purpose than getting the portal to work to progress..?\n\nI agree with much what is said about combat.

O... this is awkward... this games not related to minecraft by any means other than genre. I really can't express how good this game looks and feels. Even tho beta (March 5, 2016) I haven't run into any problems, and honestly can't see too much to be added. That's enough about looks, we can all go back and stare sometime after we get through the game. And it looks like we all can, weird right?

At first it was a bit awkward and there were a fair few bugs (it's early access so that's expected), but it's certainly fun and has even more potential. We played for about 18 hours before we kind of got bored of its problems and wanted to wait for an update to fix them. And here it is! We're going to play it again now, and I thought it'd only be fair to recommend it now while it's on sale. It's worth sticking with this game, especially if the developers are going to stick with it too; this update has certainly addressed a lot of the problems that we were having at the start, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes in the future.\n\nEDIT: after playing it for some time with the newest update, I think that it has improved massively. It feels more like an RPG, with better loot and harder enemies (the ghost island gives you the opportunity to fight hard enemies and earn some loot way ahead of your level), and it's still beautiful as a sandbox. There are still some bugs, being early access (but the auto-save seems to work well, as it's crashed a few times and I've never lost anything), but it's less buggy than it was.\n\nAt this point, there are good points and bad points, which I think it's only fair to list, if only to put forward my opinions on the early access:\n\nPROS:\n+Beautiful game, great design and lighting.\n+Fun fighting mechanics and great variety within classes (although Melee still seems at a bit of a disadvantage).\n+Fun to farm for resources and loot. Incorporating more random drops in the last update, having to search for certain recipes and armour sets, has made playing much more rewarding.\n+Good progression. You always feel like you're going somewhere, making your way towards something, a new weapon, or a boss, or some rare armor.\n+Events in the latest update completely changed the feel of the game. It's a chance to test yourself against harder enemies and get worthwhile rewards. This update came with better loot drops as well, so certain enemies will randomly give you great stuff.\n+Island size. I'm putting this in here because some people say (or used to say) that the islands are too small. I don't think they're too small. Some of them are very large. I think that they're the perfect size (and depth) for this type of game - you need to explore them and move on, not get stuck on one island for too long wondering if you've missed anything.\n\n=Variety. This is a pro and a con. The variety of islands is really good, overall - there are several islands types in each section of the game (between bosses). Finding a new type of island is exciting, and exploring the first couple of that type is good because they do have slightly different resources. But there are too many of some types in each section, and eventually, you portal into a new island, realise that it's got the same resources and enemies as the last two, and don't bother to explore it. This is usually only for the last few islands before the boss, after you've already got all the resources you can get in that section of the game, but I'm sure that as the game develops the variety will, inevitably, improve.\n\nCONS:\n-Some bugs, getting stuck in chests, crashes, but it's to be expected in early access (and nothing gamebreaking).\n-Repeated islands, as aforementioned.\n-Dungeons aren't great; the first time you do a type of dungeon, it's fine, but there isn't much variety (much like the islands they're on), and the loot isn't really good enough to make it worth going through one.\n-Sandbox controls. Block placement and breaking isn't always smooth, and items have a tendency to bounce around into odd places; it needs some tweaking. But variety is good so far and you can build some cool stuff.\n-Poor wiki. I know that this isn't anything to do with the game, but as the game becomes more like an rpg, with things like random drops, it's harder to know what to look for without a decent wikipedia or forum to help you out (think: Terraria). I suppose it depends how much random drops come into it, but to develop as an RPG it's probably going to get more complicated, and looking things up to do is part of the fun.\n\nTL;DR: before the update this game was ok, neither a great RPG, nor a great sandbox. Now it's really showing us what it's capable of, and it's pretty good at both. I hope it continues to get better, but it's worth playing NOW.","April 28","true","50.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Just watch any video, not much more to say.\n\n\n\nCharacter classes:\n\nSomewhat limited, melee is really underwhelming, almost pointless, choose a warrior and just use a bow was for me much better than swords etc. Have not tried mage.\n\nLevels go up to 30 currently, this game is less about levelling though and there is virtually no customisation options for levelling up, just more health/stats etc with “perks” every five or ten levels.\n\nThis are could do with a little more fleshing out but it is minor as it is not that kind of game where levelling up is paramount.\n\n\n\nMonster variety\n\nPretty good, different “Biomes” have different monsters including night time harder monsters, bosses are somewhat easy although I struggled on the last boss a lot, currently 3 major bosses, again for me this game is not about a massive challenge against uber bosses instead they are gate keepers to further regions.\n\n\n\nBiomes/Regions\n\nAround five or six different types of regions currently, the worlds are relatively small but there are a lot of them (44 out of 47 for me IIRC) I do not find the small worlds an issue personally\n\n\n\nCrafting\n\nSo many different options of crafting, if you are a mage I think you will need to rely on mining/crafting a fair bit more than melee/ranged but have not tested this. Quite a few different types of tools weapons and armour can be created.\n\nThere are many types of blocks to create homes/buildings etc but the higher level blocks need a considerable amount of mining to create large dwellings\n\n\n\nFarming\n\nThis is one area I really hope gets fleshed out, there are loads of seeds to forage and plant but honestly there is at the moment little point in doing so as I comfortably “completed” the game so far with almost zero need for farming, the potential for this side of the game could be great though and plants/tress seem to grow in real time.\n\n\n\nEndgame\n\nThis is what interests me, I am level 27, comfortable enough to go anywhere and defeat anything without too much difficulty leaving me free to now play the way I intended to play, I love building homes and farms and crafting the land around me, this aspect of the game is almost limitless in that respect although interior decoration cannot be “used” by your avatar and again currently is somewhat limited\n","May 21","true","89.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

So if you want to support these type of sandbox games then I'd strongly suggest playing and supportting these developers to see more of these games.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing graphics and style\n-Very good crafting system for an early access game.\n-Building in this game could use some more options but so far so good.\n\nCons:\n-Combat could use some work.\n-Crafting lacks some complexity but its expected...\n-The map sizes are small.\n\nSo overall if you caught any interest in the game it is on the sale still as of the date of this review and would recommend it. Going back to the pros the game offers so much for just entering steam and it has so much mmore potential to become of the top games but this is why. Sandbox. It is a sandbox game and has the opportunities to expand on any aspect of the game. While the freedom of a sandbox game is already there. there are many options missing like a trading system for co op/multiplayer. Also, the lack of a skill tree or rather a more complex combat system pulls the game back a bit. Moreover, it feels more generic as the map sizes tend to all be small so it takes a bit away from the exploration aspect of the game.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nI'd recommend this game as of now it still offers plenty to satisfy its price value. The crafting, combat, and map size can all be fixed and improved over time. I have faith in this developer and hope to see great updates very soon. Hop into the game now and see it grow into an amazing game!","February 27","true","13.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The item art and graphics in general are top notch, and the game has a lot of interesting areas to explore. Most of the improvement that needs to be made is in terms of the interface and the RPG mechanics, such as adding more skills or stat variations, as currently the major benefit of leveling up is the boost to stats (the skills are mostly minor passive benefits.) You can craft usable skills as well, but there is also a low amount of variety here. I'd like to see debuffs/buffs and auras that reserve mana, etc. Perhaps these are unlocked later on, but I'm 10 hours in and have yet to see them.

Not asking for a Minecraft Style one, but they need a size increment. Resources don't get refreshed so you'll find yourself running out of them very frequently.

The combat isn't the most in depth and yes, I made a warrior character and I realize that they are practically useless when compared to the mage and archer class, but that adds a challenge right? A lot of people point out these among many other things you can complain about the game saying the game is bad, or it doesn't have enough content, as far as I'm concerned the only thing that they really do have to do something about is the lack of it really being a sandbox game. What makes a sandbox game a sandbox game is when you have the freedom to build whatever you want however you want, and while it does have this, the fact that you don't have a hub world that you can travel back to, and the inability to travel back to previous worlds, does kind of reuin that experience for me. However, what I think most people are overlooking is the price, at the time of writing this review and when I bought this game, the game is $13.59 CAD which is pretty damn cheap for me, I don't expect much out of games fairly inexpensive and still in Early Access, which means they'll improve it, so far I've been having a lot of fun and have had a seemless experience in Co-op.\n\nIf you are someone who feels like they need a perfect game no matter what the price is, you shouldn't be looking into early access, and to everyone who has already bought the game and is upset, it will  improve, look at Ark, it has undergone massive changes and is one of my favorite games on steam *despite the horrible optimizations* so just wait it out if you think you might not enjoy it.\n\n*Side note*\n\nThis is my first review, I don't really know what I'm doing XD\n\nUPDATE: They have fixed the stuttering issue with monitors with a refresh rate over 60hz, as well as the graphical error I was getting where I could only select low for textures. There are few things I feel that need to be fixed now, the only major thing I really think of right now is the lack of ability to return to previous worlds.","February 28","true","2.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

What I would suggest though is a stamina bar that reduces the amount of times you can roll.

Minecraft + Zelda / Banjo Tooie Aspects = Great Game\n2. Cute, Fun, Interesting Game with lots of potential\n3. Seeing the possibility of spending multiple hours in this game if...\n\nCons -\n1. No Sprint\n2. Camera Locking in combat, awful experience\n3. Warrior is the equivalent of being a handicap parkisons patient who can't survive most encounters.\n4. Inventory is bad, and I mean bad. Your backpack has a decent amount of slots, realistically, but early on chests are depressing.\n5. There is no taking over the generated amazing dungeons in the game because there is no prevention for the monster spawns.\n6. The lack of acknowledgement for issues from mods like the.....Co-Op... good god.\n\n\nIt's almost like they are aware of the issue where some may connect to Co-Op but others can't and they don't address it. They claim it's working.\n\n\n7. This is the greatest fault, So let me elaborate.\n\nThere is two buttons on the character menu you select\n\n[ Join ]   =  Opens a browser where you can check for Local and Friend's games which works as often as the lottery does.\n\n[ Settings ] = This is more of an ambiguous piece of trash, there are 3 tiers which were originally defaulted to "Local" Local obviously meaning LAN, so if anyone in this day and age do play a building game for hours with friends in their home, boom lucky dog. They then switched it to one of the other two settings deemed "Friends" in the most recent update. This boost of optimism made me go check the possibility of playing with my friend, for we purchased on launch. Nope, same vacant lot of a browser as before. So of course the last option is "Private" which is for you introverts.\n\nNow we take a look at my poor attempts of fixing my major issue which has caused me to lose more hairs than ripping through 17 year old hair with a comb. So for hours I had looked through posts upon posts in search of a possible fix but I'd rather be searching for God at this point. I won't go in detail about my attempts but just know I've tried everything on top of two different port forwards and even DMZing my router, yeah. AND NOTHING!\n\nTheir response to this is "Yah gotta set settings to "Friends" rather than "Local"   like a broken record, even though they set that yesterday.\n\nBut... Co-Op does work for SOME people, consider yourself lucky.\n\nDid I get my 12 bucks worth when it's on sale, Yes honestly, I love the game but I'm through with Co-Op. There are some issues but no working Co-Op for me kills it.\n\n\n\nTLDR :  Co-Op is a gamble, game needs some more features, worth the 12 bucks but im ♥♥♥♥♥♥ so writing a review.","February 27","false","39.2"," 78 of 151 people (52%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","52","78","151","15","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WizardJeremy/recommended/374040/","WizardJeremy","WizardJeremy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WizardJeremy/","127 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA Brilliant 3D Cartoony RPG, Fantasy, Magic, Action Adventure Randomly Generated World game in which you can play as one of the three typical Medieval RPG Fantasy classes, Warrior, Ranger and Mage. Fortunately you can use weapons and abilities of other classes allowing for fun creativity, however the class effects your focus combat style.\n\nOne thing to note is this game is sandbox, so you can do the standard dungeon crawling, monster battling or you can be a village builder, explore all the worlds, or even start a little garden to grow things.\n\nThis game is very fun and pretty, it's timeless cartoony graphics give it a beautiful yet ageless look and it's gameplay allows for alot of fun. Worlds are different from the universe you make and spawn in, each world brings in new biomes, resources, enemies and structures with over 50 worlds to explore. The Combat is very exciting, when entering in battle while in 3rd person mode goes into this cinematic camera mode in which allows you to dodge and dash around your enemy as you attack them. 1st person mode makes it a standard first person hack and slash.\n\nThe classes are really fun to play as, a great thing is that weapons and items aren't class restricted however if they are not your ideal class they won't be as strong as they can. Warriors do the standard epic sword swinging, shouting and brute force, Rangers do the standard bows/crossbows from a distance or up on top of structures as they pick off their enemies one by one, using agility to their advantage, and Mages do the standard Wand attacks, spells and potions in which Mages can have a large array of epic spells like lightning, fireballs, healing etc.\n\nA great thing about this game is that you can jump to new universes to start in new generated worlds again and keep leveling up your character and getting new resources so it easily has endless fun. Co-op Multiplayer is intergrated into this game so that you can play by yourself, with a friend or on a public universe if you wish in which you can do what you can but with your friends/posse and become efficent monster battlers, structure builders, explorers etc.\n\n","March 5","true","120.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Really enjoyed it, and honestly cannot wait for more content to come out!\n\nQuick tip for the developers from a co-op experience standpoint over 16 hours of gameplay: We kinda struggled to get enough bars for gear, weapons, tools and so on. We haven't even crafted decorations or anything really aside from gear! We scavenged it all from dungeons, and upgraded everything apart from the work bench to max iron tier. I can't imagine what it would be like if someone even wanted one of the larger storage chests. Playing as a duo was challenging, especially since the worlds and therefore resources are extremely limited, so maybe lowering the sky-high costs of crafting bars would help in the end game. (Possibly using bars stricktly for gear, tools and weapons, and ore itself for everything else?). I can't imagine what will come after titanium and how many hundreds it will cost to craft a single bar! :D\n\nOther than that... Love it!

I've played some 'finished product' / release version games that weren't nearly as polished as Portal Knights is in Early Access.  The production design, artwork, UI elements, sound design and the scarcity of bugs or issues here are all better than you'd expect in any "Early Access" game.\n\nAnd it's not just the polish - the concept is great, too.  The video here on Steam is an excellent representation of what the gameplay is actually like.  Imagine if someone took Minecraft, made it look twice as nice as it does, expanded on the combat systems (including adding character classes, magic spells, wands, etc.) and put it all to a really terriffic soundtrack.  If you could envision how cool the total package might potentially be, you'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect from Portal Knights.\n\nGet some good speakers or a nice headset to fully appreciate the sound design, including excellent sound effects and a fantastic soundtrack that could stand on its own.\n\nHow they managed to package all this together neatly and cohesively for $15... it's damned impressive.","April 9","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This is everything an early access game should be! It's playable, engrossing, relatively stable and complete in that no content needed to play the game is missing.\n\nThe most common gripe I've been seeing is that there is a lack of purpose and I think those people are confusing progression with purpose. Unlike Minecraft, you don't start the game with the ability to collect and use various materials. The purpose, however, is exactly the same - do whatever you want. The progression determines what you can do and how long you have to play before you can do it but the purpose is the same. The system of progression keeps things fresh! You collect new materials to build new weapons and armor to fight new enemies and bosses to find new materials. Please just keep in mind that the progession is to keep the things that are normally very mundane about Minecraft new and exciting but that the progression is not the purpose!\n\nAnyways, I just thought I'd say my piece on the matter and really hope that the developers keep at it!","March 2","true","35.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Nintendo style graphics with a fighting system that copied Zelda.\n\nFun to explore Voxel sandbox maps. They arn't huge but they are big enough to be satisfied and the different worlds have different terrain, giving the game a different feel each time. I love the snow ones!\n\nYou can portal back and forth the worlds with no penalty or cost. No penalty when you die either.\n\nRPG element is fine and addictive. You level up, craft better and better gear, weapons, and can build your own house and settlement. Different worlds within portals have different materials. This makes you jump between them ever so often.\n\nThe first two bosses were fun and reminded me again of playing Zelda (I haven't gotten to later bosses yet).\n\nDifficulty is at a good level, not too hard, not overly easy.\n\nCons:\nIt can feel a bit repetative or grindy at times, especially later on in the game. Not enough to detract from the fun gameplay though, except in the last stages of the game. The final armour set is very grindy. You will have to invest quite a lot of time mining materials if you want the most powerful gear end game.\nNot much point to keep playing once you reach max level and killed all the bosses.\nNo friendly NPC characters. Would be cool if there are a few worlds with NPC villages. These NPCs could also give out quests that reward you with a large amount of building blocks.\nFeels a bit like it's targeted at a younger audience.\n\nOverall:\nI am happy with my purchase.\nI can't wait to see further updates to this game and how this game develops.\nSo far this game has had me glued to my computer. Really absorbing.\n\nUpdate: 12 hours in I killed the final boss at level 23. I did not craft the final set of gear and weapon. I ended up skipping quite a few worlds. The final boss was way too easy and disappointing. I was expecting an epic battle. Nothing much to do now but to wait for updates.","February 29","true","12.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's very small though. The islands aren't nearly big enough for my liking. There are 44 islands broken up into individual stages which is fine but the islands are all too similar structurally. Towards the end of the game, they're broken up a bit more but still fairly solid. There are 3 islands dedicated to boss fights which is cool but the boss fights themselves weren't especially interesting. Just your normal boss battle fodder.\n\nThe combat gets repetitive after a while. I can only speak of the mage class as that is all I've played. They tried to break it up between a few different playstyles but ultimately, you're just mashing the same few buttons and/or holding left click until everything is dead. You get your main attack and then you can craft some spells but those are ultimately useless except the healing spell. You end up doing more damage with your wand/staff if you match it with the weakness of whatever you're fighting.\n\nThe gathering/crafting mechanics are solid though could use a bit of work still. An example would be after you've moved on from your first set or two of armor, you'll no longer need the materials used to craft those for the next sets however mobs all the way to the end of the game drop materials used to craft the lowest set of armors for no reason other than to fill your inventory. Each new set should require materials from previous sets to make the gardening mechanic actually worth while. Mining is great and works well here as you have to be mindful of the danger of falling off the island if you dig too deep. I would however, like to see the multitude of tools go away. Just have a pickaxe only and maybe the drill. There's no reason to have that many tools for such a small game.\n\nThe building aspect is something I didn't really get into because I just didn't really appreciate the small nature of the islands and the fact that I couldn't keep mobs away from me and my build. I tried to build but ultimately just stopped as I got annoyed that mobs would still spawn in and around my home. It's nice that it's there but there was no real benefit to having it in my opinion.\n\nFor what it costs, it's not a terrible game but it definitely has a ways to go before I'd ultimately recommend it to anyone.","March 12","false","18.7"," 32 of 61 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","32","61","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ceigee/recommended/374040/","ceigee","Ceigee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ceigee/","160 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI find this game hard to recommend. I came to this game expecting a minecraft clone with a bit more direction and better combat. I was very quickly disappointed. I have played this game for almost 3 hours per class (9 hrs total) I've gotten all to level 10 starting a new world each time.\nAlthough the game looks like a hack and slash, it's nothing more than a tab targetting with a few dodge mechanics. You don't get to aim where to shoot. You aim what to hit. Then it locks and you can look where ever you want it will still shoot that monster. press # for your spell cast it then go back to your main weapon... This becomes a real issue when fighting multiple monster, You have to spam tab to switch targets or right click to untarget. And once you're not targetting an enemy, you can't roll... you can only jump, which unfortunately doesn't make evading easier.\nAdding on to the tab targetting, some weapons (staff) has very slow projectiles. So you'd want to aim where the monster is going instead of where they currently are. Unfortunately you can't do that because it's locked. So smaller monsters that move side to side can easily dodge your attacks and you have no way of hitting them unless they stop moving or use an entirely different weapon, either melee or a faster projectile weapon (wand/bow).\nWhy does the screen turn to wide screen during combat? I don't know if they do it for aesthetics or to save GPU resources but it's a pain to deal with. Especially when you have to right click repeatedly to target other mobs. This makes your screen so annoying. And on that note, I get a bit of frame drop during combat. This only happened when I started using staff on my mage.\nBuilding is ANNOYING. Building in 3rd person is absolutely horrible, misplaced blocks everywhere. Building in 1st person is pretty bad too. For some reason, I feel like I'm crawling on the ground when I'm on 1st person. The block you're holding at first person is far too large and blocks a lot of the screen.\nI didn't get to unlock a lot of the portals. But from as far as I've travelled, the maps are relatively small. You dig for a few minutes and you'll fall to your death. You walk straight nonstop and you'll fall to your death again, in a few minutes. Exploring has become nothing but Look at your map, count how many portals there are, and find them. Once you do, you can instantly teleport to what ever destination it has. Worlds are only there as a resource. Once you've exhausted the easily accessible resources (iron, emeralds, coals, etc.) from the surface, there's not much point in digging deep to search for them since there's probably another planet that has them.\nCrafting takes an unnecessary amount of time. It's unrealistic to expect something built instantly. But it's a game, in my opinion, there shouldn't be any need to have to wait 2 minutes to craft 9 copper bars.\nWeapons only differ slightly. The only difference between weapons are appearance, damage, and attack speed. As a warrior, I've tried all the copper weapons (knives, long swords, axes, scythes, etc) Knives are just long swords that swing faster. And scythes are just long swords that swing slower. Axes are just over head animation with slightly more damage and slow swing speed. If you hold your attack button, then use the hot bar to switch weapons, the animation will persist while swinging at a faster/slower speed with the new weapon. Mages have staves and wands. Staves attack slow and wands are fast. Wands deal less, staves deal more. Oh and one more annoying thing, is when staves miss, they hit the ground and they break them. That leaves a lot of holes on the ground. And a lot of dirt in your inventory. The spells are boring. They're all very similar. Use them when they're off cool down to make the battle slightly more interesting to either deal more damage or heal a bit. Then switch back to your main weapon to continue attacking. Spells are easily craftable but use up mana far too quickly even as a mage. Regardless of the class you play, the playstyle is more or less repetitive. Left click until the enemy starts their attack animation, then you roll to the side. Issue comes from when you're attacking multiple mobs, then the difficulty ramps up, not cause of the game, but cause you'd also be fighting against the interface.\nFreedom to customize the character as you wish would be a great addition. Leveling up is just you putting a skill point to a predestined allocation. There's hardly any customization with character builds. Skills you get every 5 levels are boring (at least lv 1-10)\nThere are probably a few things that peeved me about this game but I can't be asked to write any more. The first few hours of this game was definitely enjoyable. But then it falls into the same boring repetitive thing that you'd need to do to progress. Grind. Mine resources. Move to the next portal.\n\nThe game shows a lot of promise. I would prefer to be able to fight more freely instead of having my hand held so my attack would always hit. A few more attacking animation would be great, have it randomized so the combat doesn't get too stale too quick. Spells are extremely lack luster. Would like to have more customization with builds and have actual skill tree that has branches for a more unique character build.\n\nBuilding houses are generally pointless. First person mode feels like you're crawling in the ground. Building is a chore.\n\nFix those problems or even some of them and I will change my review to a more positive one.","February 29","false","9.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

A very polished and appealing version of Minecraft, basically - I'd probably rather play this than Minecraft, which should be a good thing, but I have already played Minecraft (and Trove and Terraria, etc.) so this adds nothing new really.\n\nI did one 'boss' fight in a world 3 levels higher than my character without any issue.  Haven't yet even looked like dying.\n\nI can't really recommend unless you're desperate for another version of Minecraft/Trove (which were better).  I'll come back when it's out of Alpha and see if there have been any additions and tweaks to content and difficulty.\n\nI really wish there was a 'neutral' answer to the "Do you recommend this game" question.

This game is fun, has minor bugs but they can be over come with some patience. The worst bug I found while playing was the fact that my character would continue to run forward after I had stopped holding down the W key, which then led to me running through a mountain into a dungeon surrounded by Fallen Squires. Exciting. But for all these fun mishaps that happen there is only one major flaw in this game I think. That is the fact that it takes 20 gold ore to make one bar when it takes 10 for iron and like 5 or something for copper. 20 ore is ridiculous . It takes about 20 minutes lets say, to find enough ore for one bar. You searched the map found a big deposit, it had like 23 nice start right well now your running looking for more, wait a minute you cant find any. Well you start fighting a mirror golem and bam you see a couple of gold ore in the ground. You kill the golem and run over there to get that gold. You mine the top 3 and realize thats it. Unless you are ready to mine out the entire world I recommend getting one character. So the classes are Mage, Ranger, and Warrior. They are pretty self explanatory and all have special talents and uses. The system for leveling is quite easy to understand and amazing to say the least. While playing the game you collect portal shards to travel the worlds (great idea on the game devs parts). With new worlds comes harder foes, cooler castles, better portal shards, and most of all resources. Also multiplayer is only on LAN servers. I hope that gets changed to online. Also if the developers could make a trade system like a world market where players can sell items for coins that would make a great twist and allow them to forever change the world of portal knights. :D\n\n10/10 would review again!!!!!!","March 13","true","28.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They have funding to finish the game and finish it right.\n\nRight now there's around ~20-25hrs of gameplay from 1-30, assuming you discover all the islands and get end game gear. After that it's a block building and alternative character game.\n\nConsidering that most $60 AAA titles only have <10hrs of gameplay through the whole game, I would say $15 is a hell of a good deal for a fun game.","March 12","true","54.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have not played hours of the game ,because it did not need that kind of time investment to get an idea of what shape it currently is in. Now with that out of the way  I'll put down some pros & cons.\nPros\n+ Combat system is fun ,and is clearly akin to that of 3d Zelda games which given the graphical style of the game fits perfectly.\n+ Classes though not need are a nice add on to this style of game ,by which I mean the whole Minecraft trend.\n+ Crafting is easy to access ,and doesn't require any guides to makes items as the recipes are listed in the crafting  stations.\n+The leveling system was a nice touch that when completely flushed out will add something more to the game ,and helps give a better blend of RPG & Voxel games.\nCons\n- The maps are extremely small to the point that you can travel one end to the other in seconds.\n- Though it doesn't make or break the game everything being blocky could hurt the game when compared to other voxel games moving away from it.\n-As mentioned in the pros the leveling system needs to be worked on ,but I'm sure it will be (or at least can be since it's still an EA game).\n- Game will need more things to craft in the long run which includes armors/weapons.\n- Not being able to be on different maps while in multiplayer needs to be addressed as well\nIn conclusion the game does show great promise if you're looking for a fantasy based voxel game ,but being Early Access ,and  only recently coming  out on steam  time will tell if it gets the treatment it needs.","March 14","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I decided to get a Steam card and get this game.\n\n\nThis game is easily becoming one of my favorite games of all time. A definite 11 on my top 10, maybe higher.\nHonestly, I loved Cube World in its time and always wanted them to keep working on it. It could've been amazing. The same can go for this game. Now, I'm not saying this game had no work put in to it, but with perserverance and some candy, this game can be great.\nThere are a lot of small negatives and nitpicks I have of this game, and while it certainly isn't the best game, it has its charms.\n\nPros Beautiful graphics and menus.\nAmazing soundtrack.\nEasy to start, yet keeps challenging later in the game.\nEasy to navigate menus, with hotkeys even shown on each tab for quick access.\nAdorable characters with plenty of options in terms of hair, ears, classes, etc.\nSimple building system, just hold what block you want in your hand and left click where you want to place it.\nLots of levels and worlds with vast ecosystems and creatures.Cons Definetly NOT for low-end PCs. My old Toshiba could barely stay at 20 fps with lowest settings.\nOnly 2 or 3 tracks from what I've heard so far.\nIf you grind at lower levels, the game gets extremely easy once you get around level 10-15.\nVery confusing armor equip system if you don't know how it works at first.\nNothing wrong with the character creation. NO STEAM CLOUD SUPPORT.\nLike I said, simple. Could do with some complexity?\nA lot of worlds are repeated levels with near the same enemies, just tougher. Not a big problem though, at least to me.RequestsI would loove a bigger skill tree and more classes, maybe jobs and special upgraded classes? I adore rpg systems is these types of games.\nPETS. PLEASE. I would love to ride on one of those sand shells or fly on an eyeball.\nClass-specific weapons and items. While there are buffs for your classes' main weapon, and I like that system, it could do with class-specific doodads. I'm thinking katanas and dual weilding knifes, elemental staffs (like thunder, ice, fire), shotguns or super crossbows, etc.\nMore ways to customize your character, hats, body types, etc.\nSteam Cloud support. I played for almost 4 hours on a desktop and expected to go back to my laptop and be able to continue where I left off. Sadly, I had to start over because of no Cloud support. Terraria added it with eventual updates, so I'm expecting this to as well.\n\nWell, that's all folks, thanks for reading my review~\n:)","March 15","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is fun, has minor bugs but they can be over come with some patience. The worst bug I found while playing was the fact that my character would continue to run forward after I had stopped holding down the W key, which then led to me running through a mountain into a dungeon surrounded by Fallen Squires. Exciting. But for all these fun mishaps that happen there is only one major flaw in this game I think. That is the fact that it takes 20 gold ore to make one bar when it takes 10 for iron and like 5 or something for copper. 20 ore is ridiculous . It takes about 20 minutes lets say, to find enough ore for one bar. You searched the map found a big deposit, it had like 23 nice start right well now your running looking for more, wait a minute you cant find any. Well you start fighting a mirror golem and bam you see a couple of gold ore in the ground. You kill the golem and run over there to get that gold. You mine the top 3 and realize thats it. Unless you are ready to mine out the entire world I recommend getting one character. So the classes are Mage, Ranger, and Warrior. They are pretty self explanatory and all have special talents and uses. The system for leveling is quite easy to understand and amazing to say the least. While playing the game you collect portal shards to travel the worlds (great idea on the game devs parts). With new worlds comes harder foes, cooler castles, better portal shards, and most of all resources. Also multiplayer is only on LAN servers. I hope that gets changed to online. Also if the developers could make a trade system like a world market where players can sell items for coins that would make a great twist and allow them to forever change the world of portal knights. :D\n\n10/10 would review again!!!!!!","March 13","true","28.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had some trouble getting used to the controls, as I've been used to the minecraft controls when it comes to these types of sandbox games, but after about 1,5hours I managed to get the hang of it. The start of the game goes really fast and there's not much explaining, which is pretty nice, but has its downsides; I rushed through the first 6 areas like mad. I obtained copper pretty fast and managed to get a nice base going on my home island (which is actually pretty useless. the only thing you need is a chest to dump your recourses in). After that, it took me about 6 hours to finally get a proper feeling of progression (even though I've defeated the first boss of the game), but I had the same gear for about 4 hours which felt pretty annoying as there was no iron to be found until island 12 or so. conclusion; the balancing of the game could use some work. But hey, it's still in development!

That is a lot of content for a early access. It's annoying in a fun way. You tend to fall off your island while farming..... a lot. The process of completing this game is as following: get to the boss level and then farm up to make better gear and upgrade your spells for the boss fight to be. Then you open new portals and make your way towards the new boss. When in front of his portal, you grind for new gear. The better the gear, the more mats. IE you need 10 iron for 1 iron bar. You need 20 gold for 1 gold bar and you need 40 titanuim for 1 tianuim bar. The game has some bugs. But it is what to expect. It lacks some content, but that is what to be expected. As far as I know the developers are keen on feedback so they can improve a lot.\n\nThe game needs a lot of polishing and following up in addition to more content.

Maybe it's too much freedom for one man to handle and I'm not american?\n\nAnyways, I played a few hours of this game over the week-end and I'm really liking it so far. Mining, scavenging and eventually building helps you to explore further worlds and kill more powerful enemies. So even if you're not builder soul, in this game, the game gives you legit reasons to do so.\n\nThese tiny worlds are also much smaller than in Minecraft so it's just easier to play around. You never feel like you're missing out on something big.\n\nThe combat is great though I guess I would have liked dodging to be a bit more responsive (won't dodge during any animation) but I'm sure the devs will fix that since it's EA. Very Zelda-ish so if you played the Zelda series of Oceanhorn on Steam, you'll be at home.\n\nOne other point which is clearly making the difference for me is the graphics are really nice. It's colorful and crisp. The environements are already pretty diverse. Portal Knights does not feel like your average Early Access game at all. I hope the devs will support their game for a while so we can get more content/packs and new customisation for our characters (a richer talent tree would be nice, and some active skills too).","February 28","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why? it's completely dull, you lock on with no option to free aim and just spam attacks until the target is dead, there is a dodge that can't be used during attacks (may or may not be a bug) however everything is so easy there is no reason to use the dodge at all. I love the fact that resources don't respawn on realms, this gives the game a bit more of a challenge and makes it so you don't stop and stay on one world forever, you have to constantly move from world to world. Multiplayer is great so far, have not experienced any lag or random boots yet, the only issue (for my friend when we play online) if he goes into his chest (he's a wizard) he will randomly get stuck, it happens for all the crafting stations, he's unable to exit the station and the only way out of it is to either break the station or have him leave the server.

So I bought it, even though I rarely just up and buy games. I have played about 55mins because I got into it so much even though I was really tired and wanted to go to bed. To me it feels a little bit like a Zelda and Minecraft became one game. But any ways for a Early Access Game I am highly impressed with it especially for just being released yesterday O.o Unlike most games I have played the early realeses to, it feels pretty clean and nice running. Though I'm not sure if it is just my computer but having shadows on causes crazy lag, but when I turn them off my game runs like a dream <3  I do agree with others when it comes to the maps sizes though as they do feel very small  and lacking, I have only gone through 5 portals so far though so I don't know what the fother maps are like, but I have high hopes that as this game ages it will get better, like a fine wine.

Right now the crafting progression doesn't scale with the character progression and some very nice looking sets are just bypassed which is a waste, they should instead have those as endgame sets ti give players more options (haven't reached endgame yet btw, level 13 so far).\n\nI don't know if this is a procedural generation bug but I'm stuck on three islands at the moment (around island 8,10, 11). Those islands are relatively tiny but I spent several hours trying to find the exit portal with no success. I even dug through a big part of the islands with the drill (fast digging tool) but no luck so far. I assume the portals spawned somewhere inside the blocks somehow, or perhaps I've missed a spot.\n\nThe game has great potential and I love the boss system, I really hope the dev team will keep regularly adding content and this won't be one of those early access games that barely evolve pass the alpha. It currently only has tutorial quests and then goes full sandbox mode, the only goal remaining being to unlock all the islands and get the best crafting gears; keep that in mind if that's not your style. The game has really solid foundations and would florish with added content to enhance the gameplay experience.\n\nWould recommend in its current state, fingers crossed for the rest.","February 26","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in all I'd highly reccomend Portal Knights to anyone who cares for the crafting genre and even to those entirely new to it as this game is a great way to enjoy yourself with a highly polished crafting experience suitable for any gamer; casual & hardcore alike. 9/10 in it's current state.","February 26","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You've seen the comparisons, but being someone who has played games for 30 years of their life, the most accurate portrayal of the game would be Minecraft (crafting, building, and mining) meets Zelda: Wind Waker (combat).\n\nI'm more than happy to support this as an early access title, because there is a ton of potential here. I feel like the one thing that this game is going to need for it to really be a hit success, is more content--larger environments, more regions to visit, etc. The gameplay is really fun at the moment, but I can see it potentially getting somewhat monotonous.\n\nAnyway, I'm wholeheartedly on board right now!\n\nLast of note, if you're into cheats like infinite health, max XP, etc., then I also run a YouTube series you may be interested in which differs drastically from all the other lets-players.

Camera is a little wonky but works fine. Can easily get lost in the game and just spend hours doing nothing.\n\nThe building aspect of game feels off to me, I feel it needs to be refined some but I can't really say what feels off so I am no help there.\n\nDurability on items seems on the low side to me, not by much though.\n\nIn my 3 hours of gameplay I only got to the 5th worlds, spent a good amount of time gathering items and crafting and building a house.\n\nIf you like minecraft, and you like adventure games, you'll like this game.","February 25","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Obviously, there are some bugs and glitches, but it's an Early Access game right now so that's to be expected. The worst glitches I've experienced though, weren't much worse than moderate FPS lag and world generation lag. But of course, these are things that can be fixed in time, and I'm sure they will be fixed.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, absolutely. The graphics, world, art style, and soundtrack are all gorgeous.

The graphics are very well put together for an early access game and content is alright.\n\nA few things I think need work howerver...\n\n1. The "Portal" at the end of the game doesn't do anything, I'm assuming it's for later content.\n2. The UI for the inventory is a bit annoying to work with, maybe adding a function to quick stack/sort items would help.\n3. Being able to drop an item out of your inventory, instead of destroying it, would be a helpful feature espically if you're playing with other people.\n4. In game chat would be helpful or a push-to-talk button for those who use headsets.\n5. Perhaps make an island solely for building on that doesn't have monsters, like a sandbox island.\n6. Stats seem to have very little affect in the game at all and the skill tree needs to be revamped a bit, some of the skills have no real purpose for that specific class (i.e. a bonus to int for a warrior class).\n\nThese are just a few I can think of off the top of my head. That being said I believe that Portal Knights has good potential and hope to see future content in the months to come. If you're really enjoy games like this, I suggest playing with friends it enhances the experience and makes the game way more fun.\n\n9/10","February 29","true","26.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has beautiful music, stunning graphics, and a good base for an RPG/Sandbox style game.\n\nI only have a few things to point out that I would like changed about it.\n\nContrast setting. I could not find it in the setting menu and in places like the Crimson Woods where its this red bright world, it would be nice to change the contrast.\nI noticed with the camera it glitches when the character is inside a building, and switching it to first person helps. But I personally like playing it in third person POV and would like the camera to be fixed so I'm not looking at a wall instead of my character.\nMore customization would be nice. More hair styles would be awesome, and in the game class customization, like more with the skill tree, would be awesome. Even adding in a sub class feature could be cool.\nMore inventory space would be nice. Or even a bigger chest starting out. Maybe giving 2 full rows would be nice.\n\nOverall this game is turning out amazing! They are doing a great job over there. I hope to see more updates soon.","February 29","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in all I'd highly reccomend Portal Knights to anyone who cares for the crafting genre and even to those entirely new to it as this game is a great way to enjoy yourself with a highly polished crafting experience suitable for any gamer; casual & hardcore alike. 9/10 in it's current state.","February 26","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You've seen the comparisons, but being someone who has played games for 30 years of their life, the most accurate portrayal of the game would be Minecraft (crafting, building, and mining) meets Zelda: Wind Waker (combat).\n\nI'm more than happy to support this as an early access title, because there is a ton of potential here. I feel like the one thing that this game is going to need for it to really be a hit success, is more content--larger environments, more regions to visit, etc. The gameplay is really fun at the moment, but I can see it potentially getting somewhat monotonous.\n\nAnyway, I'm wholeheartedly on board right now!\n\nLast of note, if you're into cheats like infinite health, max XP, etc., then I also run a YouTube series you may be interested in which differs drastically from all the other lets-players.

I have not played hours of the game ,because it did not need that kind of time investment to get an idea of what shape it currently is in. Now with that out of the way  I'll put down some pros & cons.\nPros\n+ Combat system is fun ,and is clearly akin to that of 3d Zelda games which given the graphical style of the game fits perfectly.\n+ Classes though not need are a nice add on to this style of game ,by which I mean the whole Minecraft trend.\n+ Crafting is easy to access ,and doesn't require any guides to makes items as the recipes are listed in the crafting  stations.\n+The leveling system was a nice touch that when completely flushed out will add something more to the game ,and helps give a better blend of RPG & Voxel games.\nCons\n- The maps are extremely small to the point that you can travel one end to the other in seconds.\n- Though it doesn't make or break the game everything being blocky could hurt the game when compared to other voxel games moving away from it.\n-As mentioned in the pros the leveling system needs to be worked on ,but I'm sure it will be (or at least can be since it's still an EA game).\n- Game will need more things to craft in the long run which includes armors/weapons.\n- Not being able to be on different maps while in multiplayer needs to be addressed as well\nIn conclusion the game does show great promise if you're looking for a fantasy based voxel game ,but being Early Access ,and  only recently coming  out on steam  time will tell if it gets the treatment it needs.","March 14","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My girlfriend was browsing the steam store and she showed me this game, needless to say i freaked out at how amazing the game looked from the previews. I have been blown away with this game so far and i've only scratched the surface of it. The graphics are something out of a dream. The animations for the game are unreal. The soundtrack is peaceful as runs along well with the game. The only thing that could be improved is the customization. Such as with the character creation, the talents in the tree (Maybe make unique talents for the different classes). This is going to be a game im going to be along side to watch grow and get better and better with each update. (Hopefully!)

This game plays more like a light action rpg. It has an simple but engaging combat/leveling system and a basic class system for flavor, though you can do all the things with any character you make.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out. Do not go for the typical minecraft strategy of massive base building right off the bat. You'll want to get deeper into this. Just make way stations until you get pass the first couple of bosses.

Now, judging by my play time (2.7 hrs when posting this), I guess I really haven't gotten a full taste of what the Portal Knights world has to offer, but either way, just because it's easy, does that really make it a bad game?\n\nAlright, I am all for challenging games. It doesn't matter what it is, I Wanna Be The Guy or the Dark Souls series, I just like challenging games. I might break my controller now and then or mentally kill something, or scream, etc. but hey, they ARE ANNOYING AS- alright I'm really getting off topic... I have gameplay videos and seen people play it on Twitch.tv also. Even if I haven't played it too long myself, the game still has a great concept and is very enjoyable to play/watch. Do I like this game? Definitely.\n\nPeople insult this game for how easy it is, but not Minecraft, and other very popular games? (In my opinion Minecraft is very easy once you have at least Iron, which can be found in about 1-30 minutes if you're really trying).\n\nFrom what I've seen, most people just build houses and other things in Minecraft. Why not build in Portal Knights? They even showed people building in the video! Just have fun with some friends and build a castle!\n\nThings like this!: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=638882855\n\nI know I'm pretty bad at writing reviews because I haven't written many... or any? I don't even know, but listen to me, this is how it goes:\n\nGames that aren't like Portal Knights (Easy/not too hard games to lay back and chill or put to hard mode for a challenge)\n\n-Minecraft\n-Trove\n-The Legend of Zelda\n-Building games\n-Games you play with friends\n-Voxel games\n-Crafting games\n\nGames that aren't like Portal Knights(Medium/hard games that can sometimes make you break your controller/keyboard)\n\n-The Dark Souls Series\n-FPS games (Depends on the FPS game)\n-Games with a very heavy story\n-I Want To Be The Guy (Games like Megaman, Metroid)\n\nGet the game? ლ,ᔑ•ﺪ͟͠•ᔐ.ლ\n\n༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つOne.

The sandbox type game at first feels like you’re playing minecraft besides the 3rd person starting view (you can change to first person which is helpful when building things and sometimes mining in tight spaces). Once you get past the recollection of minecraft days, you quickly see that it’s a different game with tons of possibilities. The game is listed as early access on steam, but it I think it’ll pick up a following and they’ll continue to add content. 34 more levels to get through so long as it keeps my attention, I hope to see more of the items (drilling seems to be fun), longer more challenging dungeons, and more biomes!\n\nThe combat system is pretty cool from what I saw, mobs don’t seem so bad, until you’re beaten down by a skeleton that all but one shots you!

It seems fair though and works well with the ability to be able to build a wall between you and a foe if the tides of battle seem to change (they will) and you need a place to hide while your healing potion cool down replenishes.

(e.g. option to flip item vertically/horizontally)\n\nMonsters:\nI wish when the knights that disappear when day time hits, could revert back to the regular monsters that were converted initially, so I wouldn't have to wait 5 minutes+ running around the map, waiting for everything to respawn.\n\nKeep up the good work! I love the atmosphere of the game's graphics when the sun is setting and makes the treeline glow gently, as well as small details like cindering ash rising from a hot plane. I also enjoy the flexiblity that armor are not restricted to class and skills are swappable, so that I can swap around builds however and whenever I like.\n\nGood job!","April 22","true","47.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll be updating the review as updates roll out, so what you read should be the most updated information:\n\nPROS:\n- Wind Waker art Style (Very bright and full of life)\n- Well mixed "Sandbox meets RPG"\n- Easy to learn gameplay mechanics\n- Tons of Realms (Univereses, Portal Pads, or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want to call it) to explore\n- Fun battle system\n- Enemies have patterns, which pushes you to learn what they do and how to beat them\\n- BEAUTIFUL Lighting\n- Sp00ky night music\n\nCONS:\n- Dodging rarely works during battle\n- Crafting system sometimes gives you random items (eg. Crafting a Refined Wood Block and getting a Stone Pickaxe)\n- Crafting system has unessary steps for getting the items you made\n- Games FPS drops slightly at night\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe game is a masterpiece, after the few kinks it has are worked out, this could go as far as to earn Game of the Year awards!\n\n9/10","April 16","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We're both fans of games like Minecraft, but Portal Knights takes the concept a step further with a more in-depth RPG aspect.\n\nPROS -\n\nUnlike Minecrack, there are several worlds to travel to a fro. Although they're much smaller than a single server in MC, they're still plenty big enough to encourage exploration, and I believe the worlds' smaller sizes makes the game run smoother (whereas MC takes a beast of a PC to run smoothly).\n\nYou can build whatever you want! I've built a modest home where I farm resources, while my friend make his wizard tower up the hill from me where he makes spells and bombs.\n\nThe graphics are a bit cartoony and childish, but they're VERY pretty and leagues better to look at than MC. There are many different looking enemies and tilesets between worlds, making no place feel the same as you leap between portals.\n\nAlthough there is a bit of an RPG feel to MC, Portal Knights takes it much further by making far more types of weapons and armors that add varying bonuses to suit your play style. Combat is simple, but it's more complex than MC.\n\nThere are classes! I started off as the Warrior while my friend picked the Wizard. He heals and does elemental damage from a distance while I charge in and agro. You can't do that in MC!\n\nThe game starts up very quickly and the loads screens between worlds are brief. I'm never tapping my fingers waiting to play.\n\nCONS -\n\nWe're unsure of why it happens, but when my friend in connected to my world he crashes out of the game from time to time. While I continue playing just fine, he has to restart the game (which isn't that bad, more of a mild annoyance considering how fast the game starts up).\n\nMC has a survival feel to it, having to cook and eat food - I wish this game implented something like that down the line. It'd be interesting to travel between worlds and eventually need to set up camp with your friend to eat some grub.\n\nWater. There are no bodies of water, which means there are no boats, underwater creatures, or swimming. Unless there is a level down the line I've yet to see, I'd like some form of seafaring adventure.\n\nOVERALL -\n\nThis game is awesome and I'll be playing it for a long, long time. I can't wait to see where the devs take this title and it's totally worth the asking the price. Aside from my friend crashing sometimes while we play together, I have come across ZERO bugs. For an early access game, I am very surprised and pleased with my purchase and play time.\n\n","May 1","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Building and crafting is great but the game shines and sets itself apart because of level-based progression; this is not (another) open ended, open world sandbox but much more a linear Adventure with some base building and gear upgrading in between. Dungeons, special events and boss fights add variety and extra fun. Very refreshing genre mix overall, beautiful graphics and soundtrack!\n\nCon: Combat camera needs work and can get very frustrating due to auto-lock mechanic à la Zelda. This is especially a problem in coop. Inventory management also needs to get simpler. Otherwise, in the long term it would be fun to see more modes added to the game, such as proper survival or permadeath.","May 16","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is it Alpha, sure, it is! I'm looking forward to beds and the furniture I craft having a greater purpose, but it's all done in such a wonderful colour palette, I can sit back and admire my home.\n\nI can go out and choose to adventure, different difficulty levels depending on your character's gear and the world you visit when you portal to other lands. The combat is fun and the enemies have different techniques that you can use to take them out, you can go all tank, ranged or magic on them and the visual effects are great. Boss fights are fun and can be very challenging depending on your gear, and there are lots of other innovations here like drills, resource finding tools, that can remove the grind of resource gathering (ores, gems).\n\nI am enjoying this in both single player and multi-player (with my kids) for ANY parents reading my review, just buy it and have fun with your kids, it's a real blast, I'd say completely fine for 8 years and up (just because crafting does require a bit of thinking of what resources to gather, etc.) Characters look great, not too gory, lots of replay value here (just keep creating new worlds).  You can spawn on each other's worlds as long as you are all connected via Steam.\n\nI enjoy playing the game on my own as well, and can happily spend an hour or two adventuring and playing, just having fun.\n\nDoes it need anything / my wishlist?\n\nResource stack splitting - this is something that would be great to see in a future update.\nMedium and Large worlds - performance is great on the current "small" worlds, I use quotes because once you start mining and exploring, some are quite a decent size, however, I'd love to see a large world being 10x the small size, as long as performance is the same.\n\nSpeaking of performance, the game runs flawlessly on my system (i7-3770K, GTX970, W10, 16GB RAM) but also runs flawlessly on the computers my kids run (Core 2 Quad Q6600 - GTX960 - W10 - 4GB RAM (yep 4gb old systems :o) ) and there are no issues whatsoever on their computers.\n\nYou will enjoy this game, and as you can tell, I certainly am having a blast... and this is ALPHA!\n\nLexx000","April 5","true","25.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If islands were larger I do feel there could be more room for structures and other buildings on each island too. One thing i would like to see is more of an objective to visitting all islands and defeating all bosses like for an example if the devs put in a way to combine 2 or 3 islands in to one wether being different biomes or even similar ones would create lots of space for building larger structures for those who love building big and beutiful structures. On a similar subject of combining islands maybe a add a way of fixing the current universe bringing every island together and connect them over time from exploring and defeating the bosses maybe. Other then maybe a lack of objectives for some players this game has a lot of potential for how it is being developted.","March 1","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Take this with a grain of salt though. My system is overkill for this game or it should be with msaa on 8x what the game automatically set me at it was using 68% of a single card no sli, now this is not much concern as when i cut msaa down it gets more reasonable with very little difference in overall quality. game looks good nice color variation and good mechanics with low impact on the cpu this is a great laptop title. One gripe is that theres not much of a tutorial at the moment it teaches you the basics but fails to teach you anything about more advanced things like farming which takes way too long and doesnt yeild much of a reward, to that extent materials are frustrating and i get it the game is supposed to get tougher as you move on. But when you reach endgame items like titanium it becomes so scarce that i had to create multiple universes in order for me and 2 friends to get geared up, albeit end game items so heres some quick notes\n\nStory: interesting but not apparant, i would like to see more.\n\ngameplay: fun light and easy to master good for a little bit of fun now and then. the dungeon exploring is a bit frustrating sometimes\n\nmechanics: simple and easy to figure out if you pay attention\n\nOptimization: Im a bit of a hardware nut so heres some specs as to compare your system to( all results are the maximums i saw when playing online with 2 other people and me hosting)\nCPU: Intel I7 5930k @ 4.4ghz\nRAM: 32gb ddr4 @2400mhz\nGPU: 2X Nvidia GTX 970's (note sli not supported as of this review)\nSSD: Samsung 850 PRO 512\n\nso my results using this hardware with settings maxxed all the way out at a resolution of 2560x1080 60 FPS\nCPU load: 15% avg of 12%\nGPU load: 68% avg of mid 50's (8x MSAA)\nRAM: max of 2.1gb avg of 1.7gb\n\nTLDR: game is fun for a while, easy to master and takes some but little thought to play. Gets very grindey toward the end, easy to run and smooth multiplayer. tutorial could be better and a few more levels added just for resource sake.\n\noverall review is good but could still use some work. grab it if it sparks you interest.","March 3","true","30.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Let's say you and your friend.\nYou are looking for battles, leveling up and doing quests more like a royal knight.\nYour friend is passionate or more interested in crafting.\nWhen you and your friend are in the same, it's gonna be akward.\nRather than doing the main quest, you end up staying with your friend on a low-level map\ncuz all the crafting tools are there.\nMoreover, when you guys try to craft, you two may end up splitting since u two are in different classes.\nHe needs to craft his leggings, u need your armors.\nThe materials are not often on the same map, so its either you find your stuff first or he first.\nEverytime you have to load the map and it takes time to find the mats.\n\nI suggest that do a borderless map for the mutiplayer mode like minecraft, or do something like cross-map\nwhen you are playing mutiplayer.\nFor example: you and your friends set your base in lvl1. when you leave finding materials or doing quest in other map,\nyour friends can stay in lvl1. He can have the option to choose whether to come or stay which is accept the teleport or decline.\n\nAnyway, great game.

I felt I got my money's worth, but just barely. I'm probably more neutral on the game.\n\nPros\n- Early game is pretty fun.\n- Graphics are very nice and most of the environments are amazing (space stuff didn't do much for me though).\n- No penalty for dying, which I know is controversial, but I tend to play conservatively if there are penalties which make things even more of a grind and less fun.\n- Moving between the different themes was a nice suprise.\n\nCons\n- Inventory is limited. There are so many things you are forced to collect, but almost no room for them. Chests are small as well.\n- Game is likely to go free to pay (ex. timers on crafting which have no real purpose and devs have said there will not be mod support), so just know that going in.\n- No story, so no real reason to explore anything once you find just one of the portals (if not dead end). I assume they are trying to be vague like minecraft to let people create their own story, but there is so much potential for making things interesting with one (all those abandoned castles).\n- Unlike an RPG, you never really find an item other than crafting materials, so you have to build pretty much everything.\n- Monsters are interesting starting out, but by halfway through there is nothing new. Just recoloring and resizing of existing monters (except for the one that is nearly impossible to kill for good - so annoying).\n- Monster respawn in locations that are cleared (which is generally a good thing), but it means they will respawn in a build you created or tried to turn into a home. That can get annoying and makes building things less desireable.\n- As far as I know you can't "use" items like new recipes without getting out of the inventory so you have to go back in a rearrange again. The new recipes were really confusing to figure out what to do with until I tried to use them in the quickbar once.\n- Can't see the upgrade requirements of the various forges, alter, etc without specifically clicking on them. So when I'm grinding for the blocks I have to remember how many of something I needed.\n- Can't put things on the ground, just delete. Makes juggling with the limited inventory difficult.\n- Combat camera is kind of annoying. Been many a time where I didn't notice I was locked in and couldn't jump to back away in time. I'm really not sure what the advantage of the roll is versus just moving out of the way.\n- I'm not sure why the day and night monsters rotate. I guess it is to bring in the monsters with glow effects but just feels very wierd to me.

One can, however, exit combat mode by right clicking, giving the ability to jump freely. Annoying that dodge isnt another button, but atleast they made a workaround.\n-Combat can become bland at times. It is just like Pokemon or any game with a 'weak to ___' feature. Once you learn how to exploit a creature's weakness it makes combat predictable and fast. Good for grinding, but I like a challenge.\n-World isn't exactly "randomly generated." Not sure if it is suppose to be but there are plenty of islands to explore.\n-Multiple islands almost discourage sandbox building. Because there are so many islands to discover you almost don't want to build until you search them all, but you can freely change your Home Island at any time so no restrictions on that.\n-Classes in a creative sandbox game. This isn't so big of an issue as I am making it sound but character classes are rather linier with you being able to choose a 'this-or-that' every other 5 levels for a skill. Stats are also automatically placed so one can't experiment. And everyone can equip anything, so classes only restrict stats and skills.\n-Boss battles are dull and predictable. When I faced the first boss I felt a sense of excitement and fear thinking 'what if I can't defeat it' the entire time. It however played like any classic game where it has a weakness and almost presents it on a silver platter. Oh man are they pretty to look at, great colors and animation to boot.\n\nCons:\n-Lack of content (obvious early access con so don't take it at face value, just letting you know whats up.)\n-No server list or Steamworks.\n-Up to 4 player co-op. (maybe obvious set up for a console release so I get afraid of them abandoning PC once tested)\n-Game is set up for quests but so far nothing past tutorial short of 'take on all the bosses and discover all the islands.'\n-No penalty for dying (yet). Not a big deal but I like to know there will be consequences for failing.\n-All Item's share the same cooldown. (Hp Potions, Mana Potions, Sharpening Stone [repairs a weapon's durability btw])\n-No cosmetic slot. Again not a big deal but I love the looks of certain items while I hate the ones with good stats.\n-Creative character customization, but looks like choosing male or female doesn't matter when they share the same cosmetic appearances and voices. (Maybe armor looks different on them, I don't know. I try to stay as true to myself as possible to make it an extension of me [ego])\n-No point in crafting any tools other than copper, they all mine at the same rate. Havn't tested any other tool since there is no restriction for mining the highest tier with a copper pickaxe.\n\n\nWhen it all boils down this game is really great, but I feel before moving on the game needs to figure the rest of its core mechanics first.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018518686/recommended/374040/","76561198018518686","Ace of Crazy","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018518686/","60 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI don't normally play early access releases for what are probably common reasons many people don't.  I enjoy being able to bite into a finished product with relaxed escapism for hours. After being introduced to Minecraft years ago by a lifelong friend, I've played that sandbox until my eyes bled and have been looking for a refreshing spin on that idea for almost as long. I can't even touch Minecraft anymore in the same way I can't touch Skyrim, it's a want of nostalgia that remains as a crater in my gaming soul. Then came along an ad for Portal Knights on a mainstream gaming site and in spite of my better judgement, because I hate ads, I clicked it and was immediately impressed by the charming visuals, the potential in its combat, and the simplicity of its cubic world and crafting system that too many "Minecraft" clones often convolute.\n\nNow that I have the game I can't recommend it enough. It is an extremely polished opening act for a game that is literally just ♥♥♥♥♥ing started. Portal Knights nails its first set of features with a surprising level of polish. The game sets out to deliver to its audience accessible gameplay concepts along with a very handy, but not intrusive tutorial. As opposed to many games of this genre that drop players into its realm with no information, Portal Knights begins with a non-mandatory tutorial. So if you'd like to take a moment to know the basics, it lays out everything for you, while if you prefer to set out and learn along the way you can do that as well.\n\nCrafting is simple with a unique, RPG styled user interface. The music is reminiscent of the original entry of Fable, and the art is just as nostalgic to my eyes. Portal Knight's combat feels like a return to the "Z-Targeting" era of the Legend of Zelda franchise and the interface for this combat system pays direct tribute to that legacy with an HP system managed by "hearts" and a magic system by a mana bar. It expands on its RPG inspired concepts also by allowing players to level up, incease their stats, and develope their characters along a skill tree as they so choose.\n\nExploring happens by traveling through, well, portals as opposed to wandering through an endless wilderness - but with good reasons. By creating a world of islands, the developers of Portal Knights have created a world that they can easily expand upon without forcing players to explore obscenely long distances through "old version" terrain before they experience new content in coming updates.\n\nIn short, by using islands players will sooner encounter new content than by using one massive, solid landmass for exploration - which is a fantastic approach.\n\nAs of this writing, I am extremely excited for Portal Knights future. The game is extremely polished, but be warned - it is a proof of concept. It has all it needs to be a functional, enjoyable game but its limited in its current roster of things that players can do before they have done everything. If you're like me and want an early start on what could be the next crafting phenomenon, then jump in to a portal near you.","February 29","true","22.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qigonjine/recommended/374040/","qigonjine","Materialyze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qigonjine/","175 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor a TLDR; look here. If not, ignore the next paragraph.\n\nPortal Knights has a few flaws and an insane amount of potenital. I have racked up about 20 hours within a few days. Its very fun to play either in single player or multiplayer and each level offers a unique twist on the voxel based landscape. I would give it 7.5/10\n\nNow for a more intricate and indepth review.\n\nI bought portal knights on steam when it was on sale for $11.99. It looked like a fun alternative to minecraft and cubeworld and so I was naturally excited. With that being said, I would like to praise the game on some things while also pointing out some very serious flaws with others. I will be dividing each section down by talking about the Gameplay, Combat, Environment, and what I hope to expect.\n\nGameplay 7/10The only thing really keeping me from giving this game a lower score is the actual gameplay aspect. I love that I can destroy or even build onto islands and there is no one to stop me. Every Island is randomly generated which provides an amazing and unique experience every playthrough. Dungeons don't seem to be randomly generated though which could be seen as a problem by some. Characters are fun and easy to play as and allow you screw around to create the funniest looking characters or most serious looking characters. I would like to see more color customization in the future though. There is also no storyline which could be good or bad depending on your stance. Personally I would enjoy more of a backstory on why players have ended up where they are instead of just the begining and how these monsters and creatures have been formed. If you are just playing for sandbox, then I would still recommend it. That being said, multiplayer can also be a pain. As of 2/29/2016, players in multiplayer will currently all teleport to the same island whenever anyone hits the next island. This is extremely annoying and this is my biggest problem with the game right now.\n\nPros\nFun\nAmbitious\nGreat to play with friends\nUnique\nStress relieving\nCalm\nCons\nMultiplayer needs some work\nCombat needs work\nMore lore would be nice\nNot enough customization\nCertain classes seem useless compared to others i.e. Ranger > Wizard > Warrior\nSmall backpack space\nSmall chests\nNo real skill tree\n\nCombat 5/10I will be honest, the combat system in this game could use a lot of work. Not only does your camera stay locked on the enemy you originally hit, but if you look directly at another enemy, your target will not change meaning that if I hit enemy 1 at first and then try to hit enemy 2, I wont be able to hit enemy 2 unless I change targets by pressing tab.\n\nPros\nUnique\nChallenging\nPacing is good\nCons\nClunky\nTerrible targeting system\nSome classes more useless than others\nMelee fighters are screwed every boss fight and need a ranged weapon\nWhat I expect to see in the futureIf the developers of the game see this review, I would want them to know this. Your game has a lot of potential and I see it being the next Cubeworld or even being bigger than that. There is a crazy amount of potential, please don't mess it up by not listening to your fans.\n\nI hope in the future some features are modified or added such as:\n\nMultiplayer: Allow players to teleport to individual islands without bringing the whole group with them. Allow a loot system to be added to allow players to either split the loot or at least share it so everyone gets some. ADD A TRADING SYSTEM PLEASE. I cannot stress this enough\n\nGameplay: Fix combat so it isn't as clunky and buff the warrior. The warrior is so weak right now and it makes me sad because I really do love him. I would like to see less clunky tools as well and a way to craft firebombs.\n\nIslands: Add your own guild island of some sorts. This would allow players to make an island that would be there own creation and not a randomly generated one. Players should be able to change the biome as well if they have discovered it.\n\nCustomization: More... Please... Add more hair styles and colors along with classes.\n\nAll in all this is a great game and if you have some friends to play or some time to kill, I recommend you get it. overall this game gets a 7.5 out of 10","February 29","true","21.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also I think that the skill tree needs to be more diverse, each class more or less feels the same to me so I would reccommend giving each class different talents and skills.\nI love this game to bits, the crafting is system is great, graphics are vivid and bright. The coop is so much fun but I always believe there is always room for improvement. I know you can make a bed/bookcase/dresser and what not in the game but I would love to be able to have some use for them. (Like sleeping gives you a boost in health or attack for a limited time, somehow using bookcases to learn crafting recipes and dresser to store cosmetic items) Maybe some immersive settings for players who are looking for a bit more of a challenge like needing to eat, drink or sleep, maybe enemy invasions within your the home you make.\n\nAll of that being said, this game is great for just being release in early access, and if you are interested you should buy it to support the developers to continue making this great game even better!","March 3","true","16.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Trust me on this one. If you like games like terraria, minecraft and Zelda this is the game for you. Terraria and minecraft are because of the building and landscaping you can do. Also , you can craft A LOT of armor and weapons. The tutorial is easy, and really shows you a lot about the game too.\n\nNow for the Zelda part, the combat reminds me of it. You lock on to a target, hit your target and when he comes close or channels his attack, you can dodge it. The boss battles in this game are really amazing. Huge monsters with their own moves and skills, other ways to kill them en ofcourse: LOOOOOOOOT. Yes, bosses drop stuff.\n\nFor the crafting, you will need to mine a lot of resources. Then you have to make bars out of ores by putting them in your furnace. Once you have bars you will need to combine these with other items like some sort of cloth or gems. This takes time, but if you like this style of game why not?\n\nAll together , i can really recommend you this game if you like some of the listed games. If you dont have patients, and hate mining dont torture yourself and just buy an FPS or something.","March 3","true","53.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

These things make for a fun game.\n\nBut as it is Early Access, it needs a lot of new content over time, more worlds, more bosses, more classes, more variation and impact from talents, and more epic loot.. like a few epic weapons or recipes, which clearly tells me that i have been rewarded..

It may not be hyper-realistic, but there's an astounding level of detail.\n+ Drop-in, drop-out co-operative gameplay. Grab your favourite character, find a game in the matchmaker, and portal in.\n+ Tons of things to craft. Whether it's a new set of armour, a new spell, or furniture for your crazy sky-mansion, there's lots to find and create.\n+ Warping between the islands you've unlocked is simple and easy. The world map allows you to portal to any world you've unlocked, and has a home button to make it simpler to get back to home base.\n\nCons:\n- While the experience has been pretty smooth for me, there are bugs to be found. It IS Early Access, after all.\n- Combat is clunky. The target-lock functionality needs some work, as it seems to want to be Legend of Zelda's combat but has a ways to go.\n- Inventory management is messy. Currently, organizing your stuff can be a pain.\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you love Minecraft and action-RPGs, there's a damn good chance you'll love Portal Knights.

Tried looking at the Wikia, but it's mostly empty, lacking even move of the basic resources that are actually in the game, so that didn't help much. I went ahead and bought the game knowing that I could get a refund if I needed to. No refund needed. Game is well worth 15 dollars! I don't feel like adding in a life story description, lengthwise, but let me tell you that my favorite aspect is that all your characters and worlds are transferable. You can have one character keep their inventory as you move between totally different save slots, or you can have one world with 5 different character saves. Due to this awesomeness, I've built my setup to where the first of five world slots is being used as my home base. I sealed up the portal and have built a really nice house, with more to come, as my home range. I offload all my gear or prepare for adventure, then I return to the title screen and go to the second world save where I tear the different game sections apart from the inside out for resources :D\n\n\nOnly con that bothers me at all so far is I wish you moved a little faster.

I felt I got my money's worth, but just barely. I'm probably more neutral on the game.\n\nPros\n- Early game is pretty fun.\n- Graphics are very nice and most of the environments are amazing (space stuff didn't do much for me though).\n- No penalty for dying, which I know is controversial, but I tend to play conservatively if there are penalties which make things even more of a grind and less fun.\n- Moving between the different themes was a nice suprise.\n\nCons\n- Inventory is limited. There are so many things you are forced to collect, but almost no room for them. Chests are small as well.\n- Game is likely to go free to pay (ex. timers on crafting which have no real purpose and devs have said there will not be mod support), so just know that going in.\n- No story, so no real reason to explore anything once you find just one of the portals (if not dead end). I assume they are trying to be vague like minecraft to let people create their own story, but there is so much potential for making things interesting with one (all those abandoned castles).\n- Unlike an RPG, you never really find an item other than crafting materials, so you have to build pretty much everything.\n- Monsters are interesting starting out, but by halfway through there is nothing new. Just recoloring and resizing of existing monters (except for the one that is nearly impossible to kill for good - so annoying).\n- Monster respawn in locations that are cleared (which is generally a good thing), but it means they will respawn in a build you created or tried to turn into a home. That can get annoying and makes building things less desireable.\n- As far as I know you can't "use" items like new recipes without getting out of the inventory so you have to go back in a rearrange again. The new recipes were really confusing to figure out what to do with until I tried to use them in the quickbar once.\n- Can't see the upgrade requirements of the various forges, alter, etc without specifically clicking on them. So when I'm grinding for the blocks I have to remember how many of something I needed.\n- Can't put things on the ground, just delete. Makes juggling with the limited inventory difficult.\n- Combat camera is kind of annoying. Been many a time where I didn't notice I was locked in and couldn't jump to back away in time. I'm really not sure what the advantage of the roll is versus just moving out of the way.\n- I'm not sure why the day and night monsters rotate. I guess it is to bring in the monsters with glow effects but just feels very wierd to me. Especially since the night monsters are pretty much all the same from the beginning of the game (colors are different is about it).\n- Monster AI is pretty weak. Stand on a post 2 blocks high and almost nothing will hit you and they just stand right below you.","April 10","true","18.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is just my first impressions after 6 hours of game play.\n\ntl;dr: Its early access and its not a bad game so far, just needs a lot of tweaking in certain areas. It has a lot of potiential otherwise. Its similar to Minecraft but its got some features Minecraft doesn't have.\n\nSo, I recommend this game somewhat. I didn't get to try the newest update yet so take that into consideration when reading this.\n\nFrom its presentation, you'll probably assume this is another game that copies Minecraft. You have the right to feel that way because thats how I felt looking at the trailer. However, I paid the 15 dollars to give it a solid try and I don't regret it honestly. It feels different from Minecraft. And there's a few reasons for that.\n\nSo, for my first nitpick, The first person camera needs work since you can't see your own character at all. They should at least move your weapon lower on the screen to where you can't see the handle of your sword just floating in space like you are using the force to use it. Its a nitpick and not a deal breaker. You'll probably spend a majority of the time in 3rd person mode like I do since its way better for open field walking and combat. However, there's another mechanic of the game where you will be using the first person mode of this game.\n\nAnd that mechanic is mining. Yes, this game, just like Minecraft, has mining. Its more bare bones and not incredible deep from what I saw so far.\n\nHowever, the combat is pretty good actually, though basic. You can dodge, swing a sword or axe around (my style), use magic (never done it), use a bow and arrow, or jump off a cliff leading to nothingness trying to look like a bad ♥♥♥. Its good, basic, but good.\n\nReason there's nothingness is because the game's story is where someone separated the world into little floating islands and the only way to access said islands is through portals you have to create. Instead of heading to the Nether, you are accessing more of the world. You'll get portal shards from fighting enemies and you use them to craft portal cubes. Its usually 2 shards per portal cube. Yes crafting is in this game and its different from Minecraft. That'll be for later.\n\nMy main reasoning for only sorta recommending this game is because the islands are way, way, way, way too small. You can get bored very fast spending a half hour on one island at a time. Its so damn small and they need to be bigger. You can climb a big hill and see the whole island easily. It doesn't require much draw distance to see it all. Oh and there's RPG elements to this game so each island is focused on a specific level. They won't restrict you and make you stay on a island the same level as you but its just a recommendation.\n\nThe main difference of this game from Minecraft is the combat and the RPG elements. Now, the RPG element in this game....its underwhelming. Big time. You don't quite feel you are dramatically improving and it can take a while to go from one level to the next after level 5. This needs to get tweeked because its so unsatisfying to grind for hours only to get a slight bump in strength, endurance, or magic (you get the choice to improve on whichever one at least). There are perks but only on certain levels and I haven't seen any after level 2 or 3. Relating to this, there's three classes. Person who uses melee weapons, person who uses magic, or person who uses ranged weapons (they have names, but I don't exactly remember them). This affects how you level up and how you craft since you can craft armor and weapons.\n\nThe crafting, yes there's crafting and its surprisingly deep crafting too. You have to use different types of work stations to craft different things. An anvil will help you craft items made out of metals and stuff. A forge can make those materials you mined into ignots. A Workstation does most of the crafting, its for building lighter armor, building materials for houses, fences, misc items, etc... And the difference here from Minecraft here is that if you want to craft more stuff, you have upgrade these work stations using materials you've gathered. Its fairly basic upgrading it but it makes it feel different from Minecraft's crafting which is basic compared to this. Still both are pretty heavy in this department.\n\nI haven't gotten to fight a boss battle yet, I heard they exist but I haven't encountered one yet.\n\nIf you're waiting for Dragon Quest Builders to be localized to the West like I am, sure, give this game a try. Just don't expect to have deep exploration. There is occaisional small dungeons to go through but they are really small for the most part. Not to mention there's been no friendly NPC's that I've encountered yet which makes the game feel quite empty. Now, there could be some and I just hadn't seen them yet, but as far as I can tell so far, none found.\n\nI will update this when I see some significant changes or features that I've yet to explore.","March 23","true","9.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've always been the person that was never satisfied with vanilla mincraft and was constantly trying to turn it into a sandbox fantasy rpg-esque game with mods. I feel like this game fills that void! It's decently optimized for my computer, it's fun to play with a friend, biomes are small islands so I don't have to worry about a chunk cache, and it has the fantasy rpg element I was searching for without the need to install 20+ mods. Like I said, I haven't logged that many hours so....I haven't come across any problems like "depletion of resources" on islands, but I mean, I assume, there's very easy workarounds for that. Make sure to replant everything you harvest, also if you need ores, and you don't see them respawning, create a new world to farm them.

If you plan on buying the game, you might as well try it out now (and go through the refund policy if it turns out you don't like it). The graphics are well-done, especially for a game of this genre. I was expecting a more fluid framerate from my system (i7-4710HQ, GTX 860M, 8GB RAM --> 40FPS 1080p max) seeing as how it's the laptop equivalent, or even better (in some cases) than the recommended desktop specs. Nevertheless, at 40FPS, it is still perfectly playable. There are no dips on my end. The gameplay is alright. If you like Trove, then this feels a lot like it and I'd recommend it. If, however, you were expecting something more along the lines of Minecraft, then do not purchase this game. It is RPG first, sandbox second. The combat feels simplistic, but reminds me of a Zelda game. You basically choose to either attack or dodge, and this will have some consequences (not really such awful consequences, but consequences nonetheless). Some of the reviews target the exploration aspect of the game, and while they are correct in the fact that the first few levels (5-6 or so) offer hardly any exploration, the seventh level (at least on my game, seeing as how it's procedurally generated) had one of the most well-done dungeons I've ever seen. It was a several story tall dungeon/castle system that had some tough fights, epic loot, and an all-around good feel to it. The quests confused me for the first hour of gameplay. In the tutorial, they were apparent, but immediately following it, they vanished. I was wondering if I had done something wrong. I hope more quests are added soon, as well as a bit more variety to the zones, as seen in the tutorial and I believe the seventh zone. The first boss fight was interesting. I felt it was challenging, partly from the mechanics themselves (after you learn them, it's a cakewalk) and partly because of the combat system. Sometimes I felt it just wasn't responsive enough. I apologize for this wall of text, I'm rather bad at formatting reviews.\n\nTL;DR\nI see a lot of potential in this game. As long as the devs continue to support it, I'll continue to recommend it. Buy if you want a fresh, unguided RPG with some exploration aspects. Don't buy if you are looking for a Minecraft clone.\n\nThanks for reading :)","February 25","true","4.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I never got into the whole Minecraft thing partly because of the aesthetics and partly because crafting has never been one of my favorite things. PK resolves both of these issues: the aesthetics are great, the world is beautiful, and the characters are adorable (in an improved Lego-universe-esque kind of way). Unlike Creativerse, which is a similar concept, the monsters and other critters you encounter in PK aren't ridiculous looking - they look like mosters and critters should - kind of intimidating and scary, but in a way that wouldn't make a 5 year old run away in terror. Craftng is also simple and straightforward - read the recipe, find the ingredients, then use the proper piece of equipment (workbench, forge, anvil, or altar), and boom, there ya go. Getting to the next tier of stuff requires upgrading your workbench etc, which requires materials on higher level worlds. Then the upgrades give you new recipes for higher tier weapons, armor, spells, potions, etc., which in turn require new ingredients from higher level worlds. That whole dynamic makes it almost like one of the good Civ games - you want to play just a little longer to find the portal and discover the next world, or harvest enough X so that you can finally craft that whoziwhats that you've been waiting for. The whole game feels very lovingly constructed and nicely polished for an early release.\n\nThe only downside so far is that sometimes the portals which connect the worlds are located in really obscure and hard to find locations. No, I'm not talking about the deepest levels of a dungeon that you only know exists because you can see it and access it through a grate in the floor. I'm talking about places that you can find only by jumping off the edge of the world and dying multiple times and trying to spot the entrance to a cavern way down at the bottom of the world, and then you have to try to find a way to dig down and locate it. If the portals are close enough to the surface, apparently you can hear them, but when they're that far down, at least I can't. That whole thing can be a bit frustrating.\n\nPortal Knights is like if Minecraft, Lego Worlds, and Cube World had a baby, and it got the best features of all the parents. Chances are, if you like one or more of the above, you'll really like Portal Knights, so give some love to a great indie studio and drop the $15 on it. If the additional content they're promising is as good as this early release, it will be awesome.","March 23","true","74.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","3"

She doesn't like any game I've played with her, we're talking minecraft, saints row, borderlands 2 etc. This game is the first game she has really gotten into, it's incredible. We played it all day and we're going to play it more tomorrow! Decorating your house in this game really is fun and everything looks amazing, the weapons are super cool, too! I hope we can kill our first boss soon!\n\nIf there is any cons to be had, and keeping in mind it's early access, there was one moment where I couldn't do anything and everything became unresponsive, which may be a bug I did through the inventory by accident, and my gf's computer started randomly lagging horribly at certain points, but turning down her graphics fixed that easily. Other than that, you can't drop items yet and you can't split stacks. I'm sure this will be implemented soon though, the way you share items currently is you put it in a chest so your friend can get it.\n\nOther than that, even as an early access game, this is definitely a minimum of 7/10 at this point, a very good buy if you like building a nice house and going out to explore different dimensions to get more items and interesting biomes whenever you want!","February 28","true","14.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Almost all of them have good dungeons and cool places to discover.\n+Creatures are well designed ( forgot to write "well" haha )\n\ncons:\n\nFIXED-Sometimes there is a lag when you break something, the thing you break vanishes after 1 second or so, it doesnt instantly break which is annoying ( EDIT: changing resolution to windowed-fullscreen completely fixed this for me!)\n\n-Maps are really small\n\n-Combat system must be improved, it's really easy with this locking system (you just keep pressing left button) and for ranger its hard to target enemies without the target system.\n\nFIXED-You have to create another user for your computer if you have a non-ascii character in your username (ı,ş,ç etc.) else the game crashes. ( They also fixed this with a pretty fast update! )\n\n\n\nTo sum it up, game in my honest opinion is great. There are a lot of things to do, a lot of places to discover, it's fun to combat with creatures and bosses, level system is also good which drives you to play more. Price is pretty normal and I'm sure there will be tons of things to come and the cons will disappear with time. If you enjoy games like this, you definitely should buy it.\n\nEdit: I love how the developers are fixing things so fast, I really have high hopes for this game.","February 29","true","11.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

The combat is simplistic but more tactical than minecraft, with a simple dodge mechanic. Note that attacking freezes you in place, so you have to time your dodges and attacks, no spamming. But once you get the hang of it, it's easier to play than most games.\n\nThe building functionality is very light weight as well. Basic array of materials, with very little variety at the start. It's not Terraria, Minecraft, Starforge where you have a lot of variety of blocks early on.\n\nEverything is strictly tiered. Not a lot of alternatives with give or take. Just straight improvement over improvement.\n\nMy recommendation is to use this as a cheap or relaxing way to get into voxel based games, but if you're looking for an advanced builder or combat game, all the other options are better in some regard.","February 27","true","221.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It's much more of a casual RPG set in a voxel universe. You level up, you have talents (though currently pretty minute), you have proficiencies (again, currently very basic). When you attack an enemy, you enter a sort of Combat mode, where you lock on to your target and can dodge roll, attack etc. While in the mode (as well as while not), you can actually use your hotbar as a sort of 'spellbank', and since every class can use every item, you can have a bow on 1, sword on 2, fireball on 3, heal on 4 and utilize these in larger pulls/bosses etc.\n\n----------------------------\n\nPROS:\nThe game has a lot of decorative items and nice looking blocks, tons of foliage, vegetation and a decent variety of mobs. All of which I am thoroughly excited to see grow and evolve. There are 4-5 bosses currently in the game (I've only fought two so far myself) and they have great mechanics, if only a bit too easy.\n\nThere are a lot of crafting recipes, some of which you learn by scroll drops (I love this and hope to see a lot more/more rare ones etc) and the models look fantastic and theres a ton of variety. Same goes for armor, but armor has something even more interesting to see in a game like this; Effects. Similar to set bonuses (though you dont need multiple pieces to gain the effect AFAIK) you get a sweet effect on your character just for having certain gear equipped. The effects are more specific to classes, but generally useful for everyone (Crit Chance etc). Can't wait to see this expanded.\n-------------------------\nCONS:\nDifficulty (The game feels a bit too easy as-is)\n\nMob Variety (There are a decent number of different mobs, but I would love to see more)\n\nIt Ends (It appears on the map that after 40+ portals and 4-5 Bosses, there is an "Ending" so-to-speak, or at least a final portal after the (current) final boss.\n-------------------------\n\nThings I hope to see in this game:\n\n-Hard/Hardcore Mode: While still very fun, I find the game very easy, even if you don't upgrade your item sets asap. Would love to see a more difficult mode that makes having a party more of a necessity\n\n-Hunger/Thirst: Currently food and vegetables are mostly used for potions, as they barely restore any health. It would be great to have a reason to farm food as it being necessary to survival.\n\n-Player Damage/Dueling: The lock-on combat style could be really fun; having to time dodges, plan combos, etc. Plus, sometimes I just want to kill my friends.\n\n-Authorized Steam Workshop support/mode: I think what can really propel this game to a No Man's Sky/Starbound level of infinite potential would be to open Workshop portals (perhaps as a seperate mode entirely) that would be submitted, voted on, and only accepted by developers/the community (so as to not have a billion trash maps). I could see myself (and I'm sure many others) spend some serious time creating awesome worlds for other players to explore.\n\n-Class Specific Items/Skills: This one I am tossed up about. When playing with two friends (each of us a different class) it really does not matter what any of us have/use. While it is kinda cool to be able to learn mage skills or craft incredible potions as well as build and use weapons etc, I do think it would be really cool to need a friend to use certain skills, or craft certain things. Plus, it could be fantastic to utilize mages healing as it being necessary sometimes.\n\nAll in All, this game is in fantastic state, especially for just hitting the market and has an immense amount of potential. Looks polished, plays extremely smoothly, and has a ton of nice stuff bundled extremely well into a unique Voxel based universe. I really want to see this game grow and would love to help any way I can. Plus, its cheap! I got it for $11USD on sale but 14.99 is a steal.\n\nHighly Recommend.\n3/6/2016 - 21 hours on record - about halfway through game in its current state","March 6","true","22.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/laoge/recommended/374040/","laoge","Laoge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/laoge/","193 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI will start with I enjoy playing this game. The combat is fluid, the crafting is new but I got use to it and over all a solid game for version 0.1.2. The only problem I have with the game is the crafting requirements on some recipes. Ten ore for one bar is a lot and that only the second tier of metals. The third tier of metal requires 20 ore for one bar. This means my hour or so of collecting ore gave me 4 bars. That’s not a difficulty change it’s just annoying! At ten ore a bar one hour of farming was 15 to 20 bars, that is worth it! With 15 to 20 bars you can see growth on you character; Upgrading crafting tables, new equipment, and more. The 4 bars was one crafting table leveled and nothing else. D:\n\nAnother problem was the chests, the first tier required ore that was easy to collect and only need 2 of it. That was half the cost of making a bar for the tier. The next two tiers of chest required bars not ore and it was 2 than 3 for second and third tier. Now this wouldn’t be bad if you got a lot of extra space for the resource cost but you got 4 extra slots(12 slots to 16 slots and so on)….. So here is to a lot of tier one chests!\n","March 6","true","17.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But nevertheless there is a great potential for the game. Me and my friends are having lots of fun building and adventuring the game. We currently have unlocked iron tier items and wrecks things up easily.\nBut thats where the fun starts to disappear.\n\nPROS:\n-Fun game to play with friends\n-Great concepts\n-Is still on alpha so there's a lot of potential to the game\n-Nice graphics, not too demanding and is still beautiful\n-Really love the idea of a drill for dirts, saved my time A LOT\n\nCONS:\n-Sometimes I feel like islands are too small\n-Need more challenge\n-Class upgrade/leveling needs improvements\n-character designing needs more variety (some people like me, loves to take our time on characters)\n-Weapons and armors need more variety (the concept on passive stats has great potential) - but this is more to fulfilling my desires for dress ups\n\nOverall, game has GREAT potential for the future and I would love to see what progress this game can make.\n\nOh and for the love of god, change that facebook advertisement quote, that '#1' makes me cringe.","March 8","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And I did moan a little when I saw blocks, the immediate thought was "Great, another Minecraft rip off.."\nBut this game has really got something good to it and honestly I prefer this over any voxel game made so far, including minecraft.\nI feel they have let out the game at the right time of its development.\nThere is beautiful background music that goes really well to the environment. The art is beautiful and the gameplay is solid. There is plenty to do and seems like there are plenty of places to go.\nIt's easy to get friends to join also should you want to play multi-player.\nThe game mechanics are easy to pick up and have depth to them aswell.\nI would recommend this game to anyone interested,\nI look forward to what the finished product has to offer. :)","March 10","true","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are certainly more weapons than MC and most with additional bonuses to crit rates and damage.\n\nThe MOBS:\nThere are a few different the further you go on but mostly the same on various maps, but they look better than standards MC (without mods or graphics packs), but never the less they do suffer from some glitches such as getting stuck behind doors with you out of their reach, but not so the other way round as ytou can hit them but they cant hit you, one for the kiting and dropping them off in a pit fans, as they cant jump or climb apparently plus they simply stare at you as you slowly erode their health as they can't reach you, I almost pity them but I want their loot so I dont.\n\nThe BOSSES:\nOnly 3 so far but if your not ready they'll still kill you plus theres the added danger of falling off the platform if your not aware of where your stepping, frustrating when the boss is about to die after 10 minutes of dodging his attacks onlyfor you to fall of the edge of the platform. Plus the way to defeat them is pretty obvious once you know.\n\nThe WORLDS:\nAt times some are very dark and the torches you can carry only light a some area, even if you pop a couple of them on the ground they only lights a slightly larger area, plus when you mine the blocks either pop out of existance or sometimes delay disappearing and it can be a bit offputting when mining. Plus resources are scarce but at least the DEV's have thought of a way to find them with the diving rod.\n\nBut other than that a good game to look forward to, so please DEV'S keep at it.","March 10","true","33.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The combat is simplistic but more tactical than minecraft, with a simple dodge mechanic. Note that attacking freezes you in place, so you have to time your dodges and attacks, no spamming. But once you get the hang of it, it's easier to play than most games.\n\nThe building functionality is very light weight as well. Basic array of materials, with very little variety at the start. It's not Terraria, Minecraft, Starforge where you have a lot of variety of blocks early on.\n\nEverything is strictly tiered. Not a lot of alternatives with give or take. Just straight improvement over improvement.\n\nMy recommendation is to use this as a cheap or relaxing way to get into voxel based games, but if you're looking for an advanced builder or combat game, all the other options are better in some regard.","February 27","true","221.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

But you realize that instead of an open world where you explore and also do sick dungeons with bosses for sick materials for loot. You teleport from depressing tiny islands until you find a boss portal. The bosses are super easy, like they want you to learn the boss mechanics like one of the old games which is awesome, except you respawn right in front of it and it doesnt reset the boss battle...thats right folks....you just respawn and keep fighting it so you can essentially ignore the boss mechanics.\n\nthe combat is massively clunky and you cant attack and move with tab targeting basis\n\n\n\nMy biggest gripe is that it has so much potential if it was in an open world setting instead of instanced little areas where each one you have to keep teleporting to for better materials for better gear\n\n\n\nI will say, the classes are awesome\n\nthe bosses have the potential to be super super fun\n\nthe cusomization of the character is awesome\n\nThe armour looks cool and unique to each class you can tell from a glance what class they are\n\nthe game looks amazing\n\nBuilding could be really fun but alas, its not an open world so who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about it?\n\n\n\n\n\nI will look at this game in a few months to see if they fixed any of everyones gripes and if they change combat ill give it a try.\n\nAlso please add an open world where you FIND portals to those little islands with a dank peice of treasure somewhere in it. Not just the little islands as the entire game\n\n\n\nYes only because this game has potential and hopefully they listen to feedback.\n\n\nSuggestion- Make portals more rare and the worlds bigger and it will get a more adventurous feeling as well as progressive.

Yes some of things like stat auto distribution feels like a placeholder. But a ton 4-5 for each tier  complete sets of gear available to craft furniture and decor for houses more than 1 type of lighting like alot of these games. Same with enemys seen dozen maybe more enemys top it off each has different element and variant types to make them even more unique.\n\nWhere it could be considered bad its small worlds and you go world to world. But what alot of the same people that complain about small islands. Would also complain that  dungeons portals are too far apart that they are not generating properly. As for inventory I can see the gripe about early on but fact is its part of character development earning and crafting the high level chest. It adds another layer of progression.\n\nSee what the small Islands provides is a more focused content development like in dungeons I have encountered many cool things. Like chest hidden behind stairs hidden rooms behind them  or look down hey through that grate on the floor I see a hidden room and some mobs.\n\nFor 15 this game is a steal most would charge you 30 take away the rpg add pvp greifing and a "endless" but non unique map. Seriously people complain but forget that it IS early access and already has more content that some games I have seen "finish" early access. And the small worlds most consistent complaint I see fact is yes its small can be explored fast but thats why there are so many. Secondly I have seen HUGE dungeons that generate without the normal landscape shear that happens in terrain generation of minecraft.","February 27","true","52.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I thought it would be something I will only play for a few minutes and get bored of. I had money to spend so I decided to purchase this game and now I feel as if I can't stop playing it. This game is very fun and entertaining. It also feels like this is not an early access game (This is very important, early access games I generally look down upon). Aside from that however, there are some issues that I have within the game.\n\n- Enemies keep spawning in places you've repaired and claimed as your home (May be fixed now, possibly a problem on my end only)\n\n- No way of traveling over a world for faster transportation (Ex: I have a house on the other side of a section of the world and walking there feels like it takes way too long. Maybe have a minecrart or something similar to that you can ride)\n\n- Almost all worlds are hostile (I know it's sort of the point to have hostile worlds for challenges but a home world should have a peaceful setting or something along those lines)\n\n- Cannot sleep in beds to make day\n\n- Game feels as if it gets somewhat repetivive (Need more world variety)\n\n- Larger chest storage (I always run out of places to put items and the tier one chests don't feel like enough. My inventory gets fiilled up way too quickly)\n\nOverall this is a great game and I hope to see some more fixes added in and some improvements.

Mostly focussed on co-op play though so bring a friend.\n\nJournal:\nThis game is good. There is a bit of lag on mine, where the character either move too fast or can't keep up with the mouse movement. I think that might be my own computer problem though.\n\nOn gameplay, good luck to those who choose warrior. It's my job and i'm drinking those hp potions like crazy! Dodging is hard on warrior, as I keep holding the attack key which spams attack and can't dodge in time. Have not tried the other 2 classes yet, but it should be easier than the warrior class since they are ranged.\n\nThis is more focus on being a multi-player game though, as the moment I went to the 2nd world and tried fighting during the night, I was mobbed like crazy. Good thing the mine was nearby so I could easily escape. Death has no penalties in the game so far which I like.\n\nOverall, besides the mouse sensitivity and lag problems which i think might be due to my computer not the game, I enjoyed this game alot.\n\nUpdate after playing awhile more:\nOk so warrior is not that weak. After I upgraded my wooden sword to copper battle axe, killing things got much, MUCH easier. With the spells added in I can survive now.\n\nWalking around feels a bit awkward though, with the 3rd person view sometimes going wonky and the first person view not showing much at all. And during combat the first person view does not auto-aim the monsters unlike 3rd person view, and yet you can't move freely as well, always walking around the monster you have targetted.\n\n2nd (and probably the last) Update :\nI've fix my lag issues, thanks to helpful reviews in the store page. All is fine now, except that gameplay gets a bit tedious after awhile. Once you have found a trick to melee gameplay, as long as you don't get mob you'll definitely win. For flying enemies, it's a good thing we are allowed to use other weapons like the bow, because the electric bats you encounter in the early dungeons just never, ever, goes to the ground! Died to them 2x before remembering a review saying that we can use other weapons beside those for our jobs as well.\n\nI've not fought the boss yet, but it should probably be around the same like Minecraft ones, with more action probably.\n\n3rd Update:\nI've done the first boss fight. Victory in the first try. Maybe the boss needs to be stronger? I went in there thinking it would be much harder than that. Even prepared a few regular healing potions, and made sure I got full viking armour set too. The first boss definitely can be harder than that.\n\n4th Update:\nI've found the range weapon for the warrior. And now that I've advanced further in, there's seriously a lot of weapons and armour set, and each have it's pros and cons too. Combat gets much harder the deeper you go into the game, and that heal spell saved my life plenty of times.\n\nIt would be nice if we could have multiple buffs on at the same time though, but each buff for the warrior currently only last 10seconds at most. Currently the warrior +Att Spell and +Def Spell are seperate, and since both only last for 10seconds and you can't use it together, having to choose between which to bring along makes things difficult. Maybe late game spells have a option of joining those 2 together so I can have the best of both worlds? I'm only at tier 2 upgrades after all, on iron equip so I have no idea about the late game spells.\n\n5th Update:\n\nI finally reach the 2nd boss fight, and damn what an adventure it was! This is not minecraft or terraria or any other game that previously came out that is similar to it. THIS IS PORTAL KNIGHTS! And the 2nd boss fight showed it. Damn it was good. And I thought it was going to be as easy as the 1st boss too! It wasn't though, the balance was just nice.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a great game, and I would recommend you to play it. Just try to play it with a friend since it can get a bit tedious after awhile, as being alone makes it very tiring collecting items and grinding.\n\nCurrently everything in this game is about encouraging co-op play, with the heal spell upgrading to healing a partner as well, and the warrior spells being split into +Att and +Def, which means having 1 person tank while another attack is the recommended gameplay. Mobs also get much hugher HP further in, so having more people together means faster completion of the level. Finding the portals also gets harder too, so having more people helps.\n\nI've only at most reach mid-game status though, so I hope it improves later on for those that prefer playing solo. But this game is definitely different from any other blocky game out there!","February 27","true","47.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So i will write some Posetives and negatatives from my point of view. (my opinions). Keep in mind its an Early access so alot will be fixed in time.\n+ Easy controlls.\n+ Alot of variations both biomes and mobs.\n+ Alot of items to keep you busy farming.\n+ Challenging. You have to dodge attacks or else you die fast.\n+ Fun combat but needs some more work.\n+ It's a serious development team, So hopefully we will see this Early access through.\n+ Epic boss battles.\n+ Not demanding in graphics , I could install this on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ work laptop and play with good fps.\n\n- Didnt feel fun to increase level, no new attacks or spells.\n- The AI needs some work.\n- Warrior is underpowered, you will just end up with useing the bow all the time anyway.\n- The dungeons need some improvements. At the moment they dont offer any unique loot so wasnt drawn to them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/olansconquest/recommended/374040/","olansconquest","Killer Queen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/olansconquest/","29 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've yet to play Portal Knights a lot (10 hours at this moment), but feel like writing a review of my experience so far anyway. >_<\n\nI bought this because my brother recommended it to me, and mainly to play together with him. So far, we have played a bit in one of his worlds and I've played some in my own.\nHaving played games like Minecraft, Cube World and Trove a lot (and liked them, to a point), I felt that Portal Knights could be my kind of game. So far, I'm not disappointed. In PK, you first get the sense that you've been put into something like Minecraft, but with obvious RPG elements. You choose your class, so far there are the 3 basic ones (Warrior, Ranger, Mage), and then go on to customize your character (a bit limited at the moment, but as a new game, I didn't really expect that much yet) and choose a name. Pretty basic stuff for an RPG.\n\nThen you choose a Universe(/World), from the 3 you can have at once (you can also have 5 different characters, which all share the same 3 universes), and enter it. The first "Island" is a tutorial to get you into the basics of controls, crafting, combat, exploring, etc. Again, basic stuff.\nBut then comes the thing that, in my opinion, makes Portal Knights sort of unique. In each universe, there is a certain number of Islands. These Islands were once a combined world, but as you get to know in the intro to the game, the world were broken into pieces. Those pieces are the "Islands", which you msust explore to find Portals leading to other islands.\nThrough fighting enemies, you get pieces of Portal Blocks that are used to make these portals work, and at times you might find yourself actually having to look around for a while to find the portal to begin with (I spent almost an hour on a Level 11 Island looking for the Portal to the next island, which was hidden in a dungeon BELOW the surface, so I had to dig some to find it...xD).\n\nOn each of these islands, you will find a different kind of scenery, from forests, jungles and plains/hills, to deserts, snowy mountains and mushroom-covered svamps. Every island has enemies, some which are unique to a certain kind of scenery and some that you can find on several different ones, and different resources that you have to collect to craft new items, weapons and armor to help defeating stronger enemies as you progress.\nYou also get to choose a "Home" Island in each universe, which you can easily travel back to from the map using a button there, that you can use as a base. I'm currently using the "Tutorial" (Lvl 1) Island, as the mobs there are easy to knock out, and they give some decent resources you need early-mid game. It is also one of the smaller islands, so I have some control on the enviroment and enemies spawning (well, once I find out how to stop them from spawning certain places...).\n\nAlso, at some point, you will be facing Bosses, which are, obviously, stronger, more dangerous enemies. These have their own islands (so you won't be meeting them randomly) and, at least in my opinion so far, gives some challenge when you have the "right" level and gear. And they're not just plain tank-and-spank either. You actually got to find a way to beat them without dying, even the first one (honestly not that hard once you find it out though :P)\n\n\nPros:\n- Easy to learn\n- Fun to play with others (as far as I know, there is a 6 Player Limit, but still fun)\n- Great, cartoony art-style\n- Enjoyable, not too intense background music\n- Many different sceneries, enemies, etc.\n- Crafting system\n- Small, easily explored areas\n- Easy resource farming\n- Repeatable bosses\n\n\nCons:\n- Maybe a bit too easy\n- Not that much difference between classes, other than the main stats and a few level-up skills\n- Small inventory space... (You'll find yourself traveling back and forth to your Home a LOT to clear out bag space)\n\n\nAll-in-all at the moment I feel it is a great, enjoyable game that I'd recommend to anyone liking sandbox RPGs like Minecraft and Cube World.\nA solid 8/10 for now, as the lack in class differences drags it down in my opinion, but otherwise great :D","March 3","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought this game because of the mix of RPG like progression, the exploration element and the charming artstyle that reminds me of minecraft, zelda and even a bit of terraria. There is not much story beyond the initial premise of establishing that you are a hero and must travel between portals to help the land and a somewhat simplistic combat mechanics is not really a bother but rather an endearing trait.\n\nIt doesn't hold your hand much nor force feeds you a story, just go out there explore the islands, gather materials and craft increasingly powerful gear and tools to fight ever more powerful enemies. The crafting is surprisingly deep already for an early access title. The game oozes both personality and potential at this early stage. If you like exploration, crafting and combat that will probably remind you at times of the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time then keep an eye out for this one. Imho its already worth the price and it can only get better from here.","March 2","true","20.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Give this game a try you wont reget it.\n\nxD\n\nps Alot of people give this game bad rep but tbh The only words they say is crafting is bad and the grind is hard and bosses are easy... and I would say the crafting is hard with a grind due to you need alot of a item to make a item. Bosses are only easy if you out level the boss with higher end gear, like I said I beat the first boss which is level 10 with higher than level 10 items.. so Please read more reviews dont let bad reps turn you away.\nI say 10/10","March 2","true","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is really immersive and fun to play, but I do think that the multiplayer feature could be helped by having loot double when two people are playing, that way there is enough for both to get items without having to scrape by.

I bought this game because of the mix of RPG like progression, the exploration element and the charming artstyle that reminds me of minecraft, zelda and even a bit of terraria. There is not much story beyond the initial premise of establishing that you are a hero and must travel between portals to help the land and a somewhat simplistic combat mechanics is not really a bother but rather an endearing trait.\n\nIt doesn't hold your hand much nor force feeds you a story, just go out there explore the islands, gather materials and craft increasingly powerful gear and tools to fight ever more powerful enemies. The crafting is surprisingly deep already for an early access title. The game oozes both personality and potential at this early stage. If you like exploration, crafting and combat that will probably remind you at times of the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time then keep an eye out for this one. Imho its already worth the price and it can only get better from here.","March 2","true","20.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/olansconquest/recommended/374040/","olansconquest","Killer Queen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/olansconquest/","29 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've yet to play Portal Knights a lot (10 hours at this moment), but feel like writing a review of my experience so far anyway. >_<\n\nI bought this because my brother recommended it to me, and mainly to play together with him. So far, we have played a bit in one of his worlds and I've played some in my own.\nHaving played games like Minecraft, Cube World and Trove a lot (and liked them, to a point), I felt that Portal Knights could be my kind of game. So far, I'm not disappointed. In PK, you first get the sense that you've been put into something like Minecraft, but with obvious RPG elements. You choose your class, so far there are the 3 basic ones (Warrior, Ranger, Mage), and then go on to customize your character (a bit limited at the moment, but as a new game, I didn't really expect that much yet) and choose a name. Pretty basic stuff for an RPG.\n\nThen you choose a Universe(/World), from the 3 you can have at once (you can also have 5 different characters, which all share the same 3 universes), and enter it. The first "Island" is a tutorial to get you into the basics of controls, crafting, combat, exploring, etc. Again, basic stuff.\nBut then comes the thing that, in my opinion, makes Portal Knights sort of unique. In each universe, there is a certain number of Islands. These Islands were once a combined world, but as you get to know in the intro to the game, the world were broken into pieces. Those pieces are the "Islands", which you msust explore to find Portals leading to other islands.\nThrough fighting enemies, you get pieces of Portal Blocks that are used to make these portals work, and at times you might find yourself actually having to look around for a while to find the portal to begin with (I spent almost an hour on a Level 11 Island looking for the Portal to the next island, which was hidden in a dungeon BELOW the surface, so I had to dig some to find it...xD).\n\nOn each of these islands, you will find a different kind of scenery, from forests, jungles and plains/hills, to deserts, snowy mountains and mushroom-covered svamps. Every island has enemies, some which are unique to a certain kind of scenery and some that you can find on several different ones, and different resources that you have to collect to craft new items, weapons and armor to help defeating stronger enemies as you progress.\nYou also get to choose a "Home" Island in each universe, which you can easily travel back to from the map using a button there, that you can use as a base. I'm currently using the "Tutorial" (Lvl 1) Island, as the mobs there are easy to knock out, and they give some decent resources you need early-mid game. It is also one of the smaller islands, so I have some control on the enviroment and enemies spawning (well, once I find out how to stop them from spawning certain places...).\n\nAlso, at some point, you will be facing Bosses, which are, obviously, stronger, more dangerous enemies. These have their own islands (so you won't be meeting them randomly) and, at least in my opinion so far, gives some challenge when you have the "right" level and gear. And they're not just plain tank-and-spank either. You actually got to find a way to beat them without dying, even the first one (honestly not that hard once you find it out though :P)\n\n\nPros:\n- Easy to learn\n- Fun to play with others (as far as I know, there is a 6 Player Limit, but still fun)\n- Great, cartoony art-style\n- Enjoyable, not too intense background music\n- Many different sceneries, enemies, etc.\n- Crafting system\n- Small, easily explored areas\n- Easy resource farming\n- Repeatable bosses\n\n\nCons:\n- Maybe a bit too easy\n- Not that much difference between classes, other than the main stats and a few level-up skills\n- Small inventory space... (You'll find yourself traveling back and forth to your Home a LOT to clear out bag space)\n\n\nAll-in-all at the moment I feel it is a great, enjoyable game that I'd recommend to anyone liking sandbox RPGs like Minecraft and Cube World.\nA solid 8/10 for now, as the lack in class differences drags it down in my opinion, but otherwise great :D","March 3","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Does not attack, does not build wepons, but builds units like mages archer and soilders. His workstation would be the planning table. The upgrades go like this: mage warrior, archer to wizard, knight, crossbow soilder to warlock, viking, rouge, to Voodoo witch, Gladiator, assasian to the final tier: Elemental Warlock, Palidain, Ninja. Armor sets are, starting with the normal clothes to cheif to commander to leader to Major to General. Just one of my ideas.  Hope the developers read and let me know what they think!

For some reason the UI and item images are FAR to freaking large. having them even a half the size would be more pleasant to look at then these "cutsie" items.\n\nOverall i would seriouslly wait to see what this game will become. maybe its the second minecraft? but for that it would require so much more. maybe its the next Windborne and gets canceled because it has nothing to offer at the moment.\n\nI seriously hope it is the first of the two but that remains to be seen.","March 1","false","2.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The Combat failed to catch my attention and despite the beautiful graphics I could not really get into the game.\n\nTo start with the Combat with any of the classes is very stiff, from a even from a craft perspective it's all very stiff. Though it is still a very smooth running and wonderful looking game! I may come back to it if they ever allow movement during the combat, as presently I find it to be even worse than a Turn based game.\n\nStill though, if you like to build and create a world for your self, I'd imagine this would be an excellent game for that!","February 27","false","0.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

This is a MASSIVE gem compaired to the standard early access games, and a above average game vs. a released game.

Game is full of bugs, it lags often, crashes randomly, things disappear, ...\n\nFun in multiplayer with friends, but WAY to broken to be recommendable. Only way to play with others is to manually add them on steam. Half of the time you still can't join their game, you're either stuck in the loading screen or your screen turns black.\nFurthermore there's no multiplayer servers. So the same person always has to host the game, or everything you build is gone.\n\n\nSingleplayer is really boring, as the story is non existant and there's nothing really interesting to explore.\n\n\nGame is insane about grinding. You hack for ours to get the ores necessary to craft something more interesting. Which is really pointless though because there is just NO reason to fight enemies!\nYou can just run around them, dig happily a few meters away from them or just stand a little higher on a cliff and shoot downwards, as they can't climb up.\n\nThis makes the game extremly easy and boring. Not to mention you get more experience for digging. So at the end we were just exploiting the game by blowing up the environment with the bombs, quickly leveling up 10 !!! levels in less than 20 minutes..\n\nEven worse, combat feels clunky and unrewarding. It's only fun in the first levels, afterwards you just fight monsters because they spawn in a position where you want to build or dig something. zzzz\n\n\nReally positive is the graphics and the sound though. It just looks beautiful and the different worlds are full of interesting looking plants.\nThe dungeons look all the same though, so once you went into one you know them all. And the maps are REALLY small.\n\n\nSo better safe your money and wait until it get's out of early access (or at least more patched in a few months). Perhaps the DEVs fixed all the bugs and improved the game, then it could be really cool. But right now, it's just too much of a grind and pain with all the bugs.","March 2","false","22.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I've played this game for a couple of hours now , and i think there's still room for improvement. I've played like 10 hours and i am already halfway, so the game goes very quick when i play it.  Let me sum up my pros en cons\n\npros: - nicely made worlds\n- epic graphics\n- plays smoothly\n- loads of stuff to make and do\n- balanced weaponery\ncons: - gets boring after a while because most of the maps are of the same biom\n- balanced shooting is a big point\n-  More maps are needed\n- maybe a little too much for what you get\n\nI do recommend this game to buy, because the developpers team is constantly working on  improvement so i can't wait till the next update .

Though it is still a very smooth running and wonderful looking game! I may come back to it if they ever allow movement during the combat, as presently I find it to be even worse than a Turn based game.\n\nStill though, if you like to build and create a world for your self, I'd imagine this would be an excellent game for that!","February 27","false","0.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Perfect situation where simple is beauty.\n- Perhaps implement a way to increase backpack space via crafting or drops by bosses\n- Create ways to disable spawning of mobs in spawned dungeons after a full clear so that it can be taken over as a fort\n- Map is seriously tiny with limited biomes\n- Some people have issues with accessing co-op mode\n\nOverall:\nIt's a very good game however some people have issues with accessing co-op.

How could that be a bad thing you ask? Well automatically by looking at the game you assume its a massive procedurally generated world similar to minecraft and such, but what it really is, is a small islands, like very small. Each level has an island and objectives to complete in order to finish a portal then once you finsh the portal you go to another really small island. This just repeats over, and over, and over. It makes this game seem much less like a Zelda/Minecraft mash up, and more like a 3D version of Clicker Heroes. Aesthetically its absolutely gorgeous, and it plays really well (Minus the lack of sprint which is extremely annoying), but for now the game is a repetitive bore. It is an early access game so that means its sure to improve, but for now just wait.","February 28","false","0.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

In Portal Knights you rely on your friends, Craft beautiful armour and weapons, Hack and slash enemies but you can have some cool spells if you learn them, Build awesome looking buildings, fight really cool bosses that require you to study your srroundings, Awesome enemies with harder cooler enemies at night, Each class requires a different tool to make armour. Example: The warrior requires an anvil to make his/her armour. A ranger or sorcerer can still wear the warriors armour it just wont benefit them as much. The game can seem a tiny bit boring at first because you don't know what to do and all the things you can craft require better material like iron and linen cloth which come a little bit later in the game.

I saw the unveil trailer a good while ago and got rather excited about it, looked like it could be a fun game to play with some friends, playing as different classes and exploring, killing, and generally having good times. After a short play, I found I wouldn't be getting these things, as;\n\n1. Combat is bad, really bad, melee isn't fun and the game takes control of the camera during combat, rather than giving you the OPTION to lock on, you either let the game control the camera or don't fight it's annoying. On top of this, range and magic are almost too easy considering the game will automatically target enemies for you, simply stand back, hold fire, and that's it, occassionally you have to dodge, or just step to the side a little.\n\n2. Exploration is shoddy, areas are rather miniscule and uninteresting, and there's no incentive to build a house or settle on any island, because soon enough you're going to build a portal and be on your way. Part of sandbox games is generally the ability to create a house and settle, all you need here is a crafting station and that's it, build your equipment and go.\n\n3. The movement of characters and camera are iffy, in order to be comfortable using the camera some tweaking is required, and the character seems a bit slow, not to mention that when trying to jump while beside a wall, characters just seem to slam right back down to the earth. Possibly more of a bug than anything, but come on, it's not like jumping mechanics are new, this kid of thing should be a big deal to get right!\n\nThese points are basically what makes me dislike the game, destroying the 'RPG Sandbox' nature of the game with poor combat, and poor exploration. I hope this game can become something greater as it progresses through Early Access, but for now, I can't say I like it very much.","February 25","false","0.8"," 47 of 95 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","47","95","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/backstory/recommended/374040/","backstory","AM Bakastory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/backstory/","1186 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGameplay:\nPortal Knights is an action game with click-heavy auto targeting combat that allows you to roll away from enemy attacks. When you kill enemies, there is a chance that the enemy will drop a portal shard - when you have enough portal shards, you can finish crafting a portal, placing the portal pieces in a Minecraft, block-placing fasion, you can teleport to the next small arena for harvesting portal shards. Eventually, there is a boss.\n\nThat's pretty much it. There is a whole system of materials, a workbench and furnace to craft more advanced items, and a whole host of decorative items from knight statues to different types of doors. Players barely ever need to touch any of it. Mechanically, combat feels clumsy. The movement and dodge roll on your character never seems to cooperate with the environment, like sometimes I'd end up on top of a bush or fall down a one block deep hole and get stuck for a second, but it didn't matter much since the enemies are nearly brain dead. The only ones you have to watch out for are the ones with quick lightning attacks in close quarters. Sometimes there are dungeons that go deep within the floating island that is each area, but the movement isn't tuned for indoors, so to fight enemies I just ate the damage and healed up when necessary.\n\nI picked a wizard and used a magic wand to fight enemies. I think there are spells but after a handful of levels, and realizing the crafting/building portion of the game is completely unnecessary, I didn't acquire any before quitting. I actually think the minecraft part of the game hinders the game overall, as the block-based nature of the environments make them frustrating to navigate, and placing blocks is glitchy, as sometimes when building a dirt pole to ascend cliffs, I would occasionally place a dirt block directly above me, rather than below. The level generator did not produce anything inspiring during my play time.\n\nAesthetics\nThe game looks good for a block-based game. I appreciated the variety of enemies and how well-animated they were, but the enemies looked dumb standing there humping a wall or bumping up against me. My favorite was probably the turtle who would shell up and roll toward you, as video game turtles do. The foliage sometimes made the areas hard to navigate, and I'm just talking about the grass on top of dirt tiles, not to mention the various cotton shrubs, berry bushes, and agave plants that adorn the different grassy and desert environments. The whimsical look and tunes often reminded me of Fable.\n\nEarly-Access Verdict\nNo. I don't think it's Early Access that hurts this game. Portal Knights is one of the most polished Early Access games I've played, but the end goal of Keen seems to be adding MORE stuff, and I just don't think that's going to do the game any favors. The crafting is unnecessary, and without it you just have a barebones, tedious action game that wouldn't be any better with or without friends.","February 27","false","1.4"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

It's scary because it would be a shame to see a game with this much potential amount to nothing more than what Portal Knights currently is.\n\nWhat Portal Knights currently is: a beautiful, but sadly very simple, linear storyline game with sandboxlike elements, but not a true sandbox game.\n\nSo yes, I obviously cannot recomend this as of now. Portal Knights has so much potential, but it could easily just be a moneyrun from the develeopers. Read my conclusion statement (bottom of the review) for a further explaination.\n\n\nPROS:\nCombat is done well in my opinion, but could be harder; rolling to dodge attacks, timing is key\nFeels very polished in terms of gameplay mechanics\nClean; Portal Knights isn't glitchy or buggy, just very flat and lifeless\nLooks amazing\n\nCONS:\nGame progression is extremely linear; does not feel like a sandbox game\nWorld(s) are very small; only one biome per world\nAbysmally small worlds take away all feelings of exploration\n\nRandom generation algorithms are bad; floating blocks, nothing for caves/islands/towers/castles\nBarely any unique armor or weapons\nTier amror/weapon progression; copper->iron->gold is boring, not to mention gold armor makes no sense\n\nCharacter creation needs more options\n3 Simple classes doesnt feel like enough\nClasses almost don't matter; the game allocates all your stat points for you; can't truly customize\nClasses aren't balanced; playing as a warrior is a handicap\n\nWorlds feel like a conglomerance of randomly generated blocks, there's no developed strctures and all in all it just feels empty\n\n\n\nIn depth:\n\nGame Progression is too lienar - "Randomly generated" worlds need to be a little more "random" in regards to their generation. It feels like I am playing a campaign for a storyline almost, except with no plot whatsoever... (the intro was nice backstory was nice, but there is nothing in the game) not a sandbox game. Don't get me wrong, I had fun playing the game up to this point - but it is simply ailed with too many flaws in its current state, which (I hope) are mostly from the game being underdeveloped.\n\nIt does not feel like a sandbox game, this is because progression is too linear. This right now is a "tiers" game, where you just go copper -> iron -> gold with little to no varation, except the levels you explore feel like missions, which make exploring for resources not even really feel like exploring. They need randomly generated armor/weapons or much more variety within the tiers instead of just 1 amror/weaponset per tier for each class.\n\nBecause the levels/portals you play are so small, you really don't end up doing any exploring or feel like you are exploring. As I've said, it just feels like I am playing a campgain and not really a sandbox game. There is no algoritims to randomly generate caves, islands, towers/castles - its really all just congomerated terrain. And when you combine this with how small the levels are, its not a pretty picture.\n\nThis game is fun but unless the update it with some major fixes, the game itself, just like the levels/portals is very fleeting and far too linear. They need to update it to fix some the things I've said above to get a recomendation from me. I want to like this game, I really do. It has so much potential, but it just isn't developed fully enough right now.\n\nIf the devs don't update the game to make it feel more like a sandbox game and less like a campaign/storymode, I'd say to stay clear of it. I will have to say this game isn't worth $10. In it's current state right now, it's worth maybe $5. Let's hope this game isn't a simple attempt at a moneyrun from the devs, because it has so much potential. Lack of a developer response as to where they are going with the game at this point is scary to me.\n\nConclusion statement:\n\nGame progression is too linear, and it doesn't feel like a sandbox game - but rather a storyline game with no plotline. This game could become something great, I would keep an eye on it. It is maybe worth $5 in its current state, but not $10, and sure as hell not $20.\n\nBut, the sad part about it all is that Portal Knights feels like it could be a finished game, just a very, very flat and lifeless one. If the devs did nothing more to it as of now, it could be considered complete; which they seem to be suggesting in what little statements they chose to divulge in regards to the game's development.\n\nAgain, let's hope that the above isn't the case. In it's current state the game is fun, but doesn't last very long and just feels like it is missing a lot to me. Gameplay is very solid though and there is very little bugs or glitches.\n\nI would love to be able to recomend this game, but I can't as of now.","February 28","false","20.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Me and my friend bought it thinking this could be a better looking minecraft/starbound/terraria, turns out it's as good as planet explorer(remember that game).\n\nThe world IS NOT RANDOMLY GENERATED.  IT IS THE SAME SEQUENCE OF MAP LOADERS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  You must think, is it big?  Well, imagine you're living in an apartment, not the Will Smith big ♥♥♥ mansion, but something more like a middle class apartment in let's say new york.  You see the beautiful city below expanding into the sky, and you look back and see your tiny house yet you feel satisfied because it's your home.  That ♥♥♥♥ing city, is NOT what the game offers.  It offers you your little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ apartment, with what?  Hmm, lets see, oh, mining, yes, an excellent minecraft floating island that's as large as your tiny apartment room.\n\nSo, is there a variety of different terrains?  If you think going from the rain forests of Rio and then teleport to the deserts of Iraq, and then you end up in the rain forests of another national park, only to be teleported the deserts of Egypt, that's your variety right there.  They're blocks, there's green and yellow and grey, those are your color scheme for terrains.  So exploration wise, I would rather have some fun playing star bound (considering that game is pretty godamn huge)\n\nGameplay.  You attack, the monster doesn't stagger.  Monster attacks, pick a direction, WASD, and tap roll.  Repeat process.\n\nCoop.  What is the point of even digging into that now... I did try, and it works perfectly fine, but it just doubles the time you get bored\n\nConclusion, me and my buddy were on a race to see who gets refund first.","March 16","false","0.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

Once you upgrade your machines, you are left with nothing for you for your hours of gathering just to unlock recipes. Certain resources can grow up to 9 blocks wide making farming a pain when setting up farms. You can place down a seed even if it will never have room to actually grow which shouldn't be allowed IMHO.\n\nBuilding portals is basically only a short load screen that will lead to another place to go and gather more junk later. I have seen portals that were burried in 20K+ blocks in terrain which is stop your progress if you refuse to mine that much blindly just to find it. No portal finding tools can even be crafted either to aid with that boring process.\n\nBosses are boring. You must always fight a boring boss to continue going to more islands.\n\nCrafting lacks proper descriptions.\n\nGrp functionality doesn't exist since you can't type to people in game, resources are not all renewable like ore, and their voice chat has no way to adjust it. So you are forced in grp play for co op to either play with all game sounds off or listening to Wendy fart non stop.\n\nClasses? What classes? We had those? Oh, my bad! I didn't notice. There are currently 3 out of the 4 classes shown that you can actually play. Each going to level 30 but they don't truly have their own gear or combat. They can all share and wear the same gear and weapons. None of that is neeeded since only the crit warrior dps set at the highest quality level will actually do any dmg  making all other gearing sets useless. Craftable skills are used by all and all share a global cooldown so really you shouldn't have more than 1 on your tool bar. I suggest the heal so you can skip on potions forever. Mana isn't that much of an issue since you will only be using one weapon attack any way. Gear is not restricted by class.\n\nBulding blocks are too small which means you will need a lot more of them which equals more resources and more never ending farming. Islands too small. Digging is a problem as you currently fall out of the world way too much. Hard to dig around all that mess.\n\nGame breaking bugs leaving you unable even move or craft or even allow you to close out the game without using task manager to do it.\n\nNo inventory space after making all mining tools and mining type items to aid you with mining and once you make your craftable abilities.\n\nLack of proper decriptions, on craftable skills or gear or even on chests to see their size.\n\nNO WATER! You can only use that for making potions and get them from mob kills or some resources such a cactus but u don't need them for anything other than potions which can be skipped. Forget about making pools or fountains etc.\n\nNo way to make items in world you think are cool at this time since there is no recipe for it. You have to hope your world has enough items in it you can farm and explore via portals just to make 1 cool project like a castle with lots of gargoyles etc or knights. No creative mode.\n\nToo expensive to craft. 4 copper ore = 1 copper bar. 10 iron ore = 1 iron bar. 20 gold ore = 1 gold bar. 40 titanium ore = 1 bar. WTF? Once your ore in your world is gone, it's gone forever. If you want to make another world for farming, that's on you. You will need to unlock all portals and get all shards for portal stones again. BORING!\n\nSub to follow game, skip for now. I play with others but we are about worn out from it. You gather, gather gather. Nothing more. Farm, but good luck crafting. The game does look really nice but that's about it. One of the most beautiful block games I have seen besides creativerse and windborne which is no longer in production. In the end there were many things I liked in this game but being early access as most steam games are now a days simply means, sure, nice game / has potential but needs a lot more ground work. I don't like feeling like ground work is missing in any game. I play with others however it feels like all we do is gather stuff non stop. It hasn't earned the tittle of my fav block game as of yet. Right now is a perfect time to critique the game as it is in it's infancy and still being worked on in hopes that it will blossom correctly later.\n\nA kind reminder:\nAs with most early access games, devs add more stuff and kinda forget about the current stuff because they get so concerned with expanding and that's a shame. Also be aware that their dev size might be smaller as with most early access games which can lead so huge time spans between updates.","March 4","false","147.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The combat is leaning towards zeldaish aim target system which is not bad but it doesn't really work on this game. The camera is horrible! When you're really down in a dungeon the camera gets in the way and sometimes it leaves you caught up in the moment trying to fix the camera that you suddenly die! The crafting system is really feature friendly it shows you how to make items really nice so you don't have to use a wiki which is really great and there is the map system where it shows you what type of monster resources and other stuff that are in the area. Progression is really confusing after you complete the simple tutorial the game leaves you alone without no idication what to do next. The Building system is really easy like any other voxel game. The dungeons half of the time feels emtpy with little or no reward at all. The boss battles are amazing and unique which is great! Inventory wise it's really small and it is really fustrating trying to sift out the crap you don't really need. The game is missing alot of necessary things like camera improvements and inventory system needs to be pan out more and the combat is clunky at times.\n\nSo far i see great potential with this game and the Devs are really up front with the community taking suggestions and really up there interacting with the community as for the price of 15$ and 20% off first week is really freaking cheap for an early access game which is really good we need more like this!\n\nDo i recommend it? As for the price and the content it shows you i would say yea get it but take note the combat system is really unique.","February 25","true","5.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I wouldn't rely too heavy on the sandbox bit however, it's different then your most average sandbox games.  Portal Knights offers 44 small islands to progress though.  Kill, loot, craft, and move on.  The game is quite fun for an alpha release but you're presented with a few bugs here and there.  For a game that's in it's alpha stage, I'm a little surprised it plays like a beta.  I would say knock down a few bugs and the game is ready for release.\n\nIf you're interested in crafting and level progression in a small sandbox, Portal Knights is the perfect game for you.  It's still early, there's a lot to do, add, and fix in Portal Knights.\n\nNote: There's a reason for small worlds.  Remember, today it's 44 levels, tomorrow  could be 500.","February 25","true","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DARGOL/recommended/374040/","DARGOL","I am the Heat Miser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DARGOL/","422 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game puts emphasis on sandbox construction; it's clear they want you to be building a base through the addition of many decoration blocks, farming and the crafting being focused around placed, upgradable workbenches. Conflictingly, at the same time the game forces you to jump worlds frequently due to the fact that each one is incredibly tiny and spawn only a very small fraction of the resources you need, so to progress craftwise you need to visit many worlds. In addition to this, the RPG character development is tied to jumping through progressively harder worlds. In multiplayer, everyone has to jump a world together, nobody can be left behind, which makes this the first game of its type to actually downgrade with multiplayer.\n\nWhat does this game want you to do? You can't progress without building a base, but you can't build a base because you need to progress. Why include base mechanics if you are supposed to be constantly adventuring? Why is the crafting based around placed crafting benches??? You have to carry the benches around to craft on the move, but why have them like that in the first place? Why is there farming when you don't stay in one place?!\n\nBasically the devs couldn't choose between two types of games, so they decided to do both and made no effort to allow them to compliment each other (unlike Terraria), so they end up destroying each other instead.\n\nI suggest either;\nA: increase each world size by about a factor of 100 and significantly reduce the prevelance/need of world jumping.\nB: Remove all mechanics that are based on staying in one place; remove farming, forget decoration/furniture/building and allow you to craft everything without benches, instead focus on adventure, character progression and combat.\n\nDon't tell players to constantly move around *and* stay in the same place at the same time, this is a paradox that makes the game unplayable.\n\n\nEDIT: After writing this I found an article on Kotaku about Portal Knights, they are better than me at explaining this but they say basically the same thing here: http://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/02/steams-popular-portal-knights-channels-minecraft-and-zelda-comes-up-short/","February 28","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamersomething/recommended/374040/","gamersomething","Supersomething","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamersomething/","193 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOne of the few games worthy of being an early access title.  Portal Knights is a Sandboxesque rpg builder.  Well developed but there is room for more and indeed the devs do plan to add more.  The game has elements similar to Minecraft but it is its own game.  People considering this game should be aware that the world sizes for every portal are not these immense worlds and the game does not advertise them as such either.\n\nThe game itself actually runs exceptionally well for being an early access title.  All the game systems currently implemented work exceptionally well but a few need just a little bit of polish.  The devs explicitly stated they are shooting for the release candidate this year so this game should not suffer development hell that  many other Early Access titles on Steam are suffering from.\n\nAnother big positive from this game are the visuals.  This game is really quite gorgeous with its bright vibrant environments and colorful creatures.  If you ever played Dungeon Defenders it has a similar art pallete with that game.  The colors just pop out at you.  Graphical options are on the limited side but then again this game is not exactly designed to push boundaries in that department.\n\nThe main point of the game is to traverse across the different worlds farming resources and items to make your character stronger while at the same time unlocking all 44 locations throughout the world.  There is a full scale building element, and hidden blueprints to find in dungeons, or off bosses.  The game plays well in singleplayer but is even better when playing with your friends.\n\nI would recommend this game for anyone that enjoys Minecraft type games but as I said before remember that each world size are not similar what you find in Minecraft.  Actually one excellent way to think of the game world is that each area could be considered a Biome in Minecraft because that is essentially what they are.  You have swampy worlds, lush forested worlds, fire worlds, snow worlds, and desert worlds.  At its current price which will only last for this week I would certainly recommend picking it up.","February 25","true","7.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It like hooks you once you get bored a bit, it gets more challenging as you go on. towards level 12-14 is the ideal place you begin to pick a world and settle there yet continue in your quest.

However, the reason for that IS a problem with the game. Lack of configurable controls make it unplayable. Not everybody uses WSAD. I can't play this game until that happens. Also, video is choppy even with a video card that well exceeds the minimum requirements. You'll want a really nice one to play this game.\n\nSince I couldn't post this until I played at least five minutes, I suffered through it. I DO like the tutorial system. It gives enough info without being overly basic. But, how am I supposed to click on an enemy to evade them when clicking either attacks or changes camera. A few bugs to work out here, I suppose.\n\nThe camera system is weird, at best. I would probably do better at first person, but the lack of configurable controls make that hard to feel comfortable.\n\nThe recommend is a no, for now. I appreciate that the game is early access and they are still working on things. But the point I'm trying to make is this is a common problem with ALL early access games.

However when playing online with friends you all have to be in the same tiny zone, so if someone wants to farm or build and someone wants to mine resources or fight mobs you're kind of screwed. You all have to go to the same zone and be together at all times, certain resources and mobs are only in certain zones and your 'home' zone where you do most of your building (I would imagine) isn't where you're going to be most of the time when playing.\n\nIt lacks the freedom of other sandbox games that let you do what you want while someone does what they want.\n\nAlso; TLDR there's no ingame chat, I have no idea what's going on.

Well, here you're forced to use it, it would actually not be a bad thing if not for the fact that almost all of the mobility and the attack variations Z targeting is made for are missing. So basically, you've got the camera lock and the evade. The attack animations have higher priority than the evades, of course, otherwise it would actually feel responsive.\nLiked the mining in Minecraft perhaps? Well, surely you don't like going underground then, so let's put all the ressources at ground level and nothing below.I only fought one boss before getting bored, but it was actually pretty well implemented (and very clearly based on The Legend of Zelda).\nAnd I got bored really fast indeed. Unlocking the 'iron' tier, I saw that at least they were trying to diversify the otherwise ridiculously basic classes, but since the battle system is so simplistic I really didn't care much, and then I saw the grind required for those armors (bear in mind this is the third tier). Grind is fine if the game has enough depth to make it fun (see: Warframe) and Portal Knights... does not, in any way.\n\nThe general presentation (UI and graphisms) is excellent. For some reason the configuration menu's resolution option will let you select resolutions the game won't actually use, but whatever. The Dr. Who loading screen is nice too. Performance is not an issue either.\n\nThe only bug I noticed in 4 hours of gameplay is a monster's shadow in the void.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrMaes/recommended/374040/","DrMaes","Maes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrMaes/","18 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo, I have played verry little of this game so far. However there are some basic things that need to be addressed before I can recommend this game.\n\nId like to start by saying this game has potential, and has some fun ideas, however they don't seem very fleshed out at this point. So onto my problems with the game, first of all. The controls and movement are.. off puting. This may be personal to me and few others, however I think the movement and animations feel a little slow and clunky. It seems like the animations are set as they are intended, which worries me because the game just doesn't feel right in that regard.\n\nSecondly, if you're a knight at least. The combat is basically minecraft combat.. which is awful. It's walk up to the enemy and click the attack key until it dies. Which is boring. This game looked like a combat oriented RPG style sandbox building game, but with combat like this, the combat is something that you feel like you'd rather avoid, for how boring and frustrating it can be.\n\nThen, there is the world. People seem to be touching on this quite a lot, and I agree to an extent. The world is verry small and your objective is to find the portal and move on to the next area. In doing this you'll want to craft new equipment to help you survive. This is entertaining for what it is, but what I'd rather see is a large, endless, randomly generated world, or at least a game mode where this exists. Reason being: It gives more incentive for exploration and creation. Currently there is no real point. Find materials to upgrade, kill monsters to build up the portal, then move on.\n\nThat's the jist of what I have to say about this game so far here. I think they could do very well, but in its current state it's isn't something I'd recommened. I'd wait for release, or at least wait until it's further along on it's development. However some of the issues I've stated may be core gameplay descisions, that were created on purpose. Maybe not for this reaction.. but that might mean they may never be changed.\n\nKeep an eye on it, but keep your distance for the time being.","February 27","false","1.4"," 19 of 40 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","19","40","0","2"

Anytime someone mentions "like Minecraft" to me I instantly turn off. I will admit, I am probably one of the few humans left that has yet to play Minecraft in one form or another, but when you had to endure the massive praise the game received over the past couple of years you don't really need too. I am not saying Minecraft is terrible by my lack of experience with it, but the idea of creating something from nothing can be a little daunting for some. Thankfully, as soon as I started playing Portal Knights, I discovered that the option is not possible with what is offered and managed to focus on the task of reaching the final island.\n\nThe one thing I can say right of the bat is how wonderful the visuals look. With a genre overburdened by a visual style of blocky low resolution fodder, it is refreshing to see characters and enemies at least look like something other than boxes and rectangles. The colorful atmosphere and cartoonish aesthetic gives each foe a charming sense of gleeful villainy while giving the player a character that can range from sourpuss to overexerted flower child. It is simple, but effective.\n\nThe world has enough detail to provide a distinct look while maintaining the needed box upon box construction. Trees at least look like trees, bushes like bushes, ore sticks out of dirt and it all works with the quirky music to emulate something you would find from a 90s era children's cartoon. The major downside, however, is the lack of variation in the biospheres. You get a few types (desert, snow, magma, forest, space) that repeats with new materials and the different skin variants of the same enemies you fought the last island. Diverse locations is crucial for a game stretched over several islands and when you have seen the same looking area on repeat, it gets old.\n\nCombat suffers from this issue as well when you take the lack of monster diversity into account. Combat relies on a camera lock system that causes your character to stop moving when striking. For melee, this can be a major problem when you can find yourself mid strike and unable to roll out of the way of an attack. Rangers and Mages can simply find high ground and watch as the AI causes the enemy to simply hug a wall as you lay into it. Bosses are rather similar, with a add phase, hit weak spot to stun while you lay into phase and a retort phase. They would be a lot more fun if they didn't repeat the same two attacks in the same order constantly. The bottom line: combat becomes very dull, very fast. Considering this is half of what you do in this game, means you can get bored or the repetition fast.\n\nCrafting and gathering is the second half of this uneven pizza with an overflowing portion of cheddar. Gathering consist of consumables, plants, ores, wood and gems that all (except wood) have tier variants as you progress further on the island map. Different types of crafting tables are used with each one requiring upgrades to unlock the better recipes. Monsters also drops parchment with recipes as well. The trouble comes in with the limited amount of resources available on each island and the amount needed to make ore into bars rises with each tier.\n\nBase building is also an option with doors, fences and cosmetics such as book cases and beds. Dungeons also exist on each island with special chests and hidden portals. Each portal requires six of a special item that is crafted from fragments dropped by enemies or randomly when gathering. This one aspect can be extremely tedious and makes reaching the last few islands a pain. Max level is 30 right now and 44 islands. The downside, however, is once you kill the third boss there really is no incentive to keep exploring outside of achievements. It feels like a chore just reaching the third boss honestly with the amount of time spent collecting the shards for each portal. It is fun for a couple of hours, but right when you beat the second boss and see the first space looking environment, you have seen it all.\n\nNow, mechanically the game is a seesaw. I have had a perfect experience half the time while the other few sessions have been a nonstop frame rate drop with crashes ranging from opening a chest to entering a new island. It is very inconsistent, which I guess could be a positive, but the fact it happens at all is grating on the nerves. Staying connected with friends can be an issue too with random disconnections, but whether this is the game or Steam is another question. The UI runs into some issues as well when transferring goods to chests, crafting or accessing inventory, but this is more a quality of life issue. Glitches can occur ranging from getting stuck between blocks (just destroy a block to free yourself) to bugs that make my character run non stop. The game client also has an issue where it opens up minimized and cannot be seen on screen unless I maximize it through Task Manager. It just gets really annoying.\n\nOutside of the beautiful visuals (although redundant after awhile), I just couldn't get myself to play this after I finished the Ghost off at the end. It was hard enough pressing myself to push on once I finished my set of Iron equipment. I am not sure how much this game is similar to Minecraft, but it reminded me a lot of survival simulators and that is never a good thing. The lack of a purpose outside getting from A to B makes it hard to feel accomplishment or a sense of purpose; now that I think of it, there really is no story to this outside the introduction cutscenes. With it's technical problems, simple combat and tedious progression, I cannot recommend the game at this time.\n\n\nPros\n\n- Charming aesthetic\n- Music is delightful\n\n\nCons\n\n- Crashing and Frame rate dips\n- Simple, tedious combat\n- Lack of diverse content\n- No real incentive to keep playing once third boss is killed","April 24","false","8.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Fields go from normal color (green) to crimson or some other color, and they call it a "new island" like its something to be exited about. Not to mention that to build portals  to advance to other islands takes like two seconds to do, making it feel like there is basically no progression in the game. Literally all you have to do is mine some minerals or kill some monsters to get portal fragments. I'd rather get them through completeing a dungeoun or something like that so it feels more like a RPG game than a grind game. The only reason to explore certain islands is for more portal frags so you can go to more boring islands or to harvest some materials so you can grind for that next set of armour or weapon on something like that.\n\nThe IU is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it feels like it belongs in a mobile game. The tabs to go in an out of certain screens to craft or something like that looks like poo. It should be simple, but its so simple that it feels complicated.\n\nFirst person is trash, especially if your playing the mage class. As a person who prefers first person to third person, this is a major draw back for me. This game is meant for third person, but for some reason they still kept first person in the game. It just feels janky and unpolished, unlike thrid person. And you know how I said that if your playing the mage class it looks a lot worse? I meant it. If you plan to play the mage class, play it in third person because if you don't it feels like your in the middle of some rave on LSD and Molly. Like seriously, it gives me a headache. Fix it please!\n\n\n\nIn the end this game just feels unpolished, overly simplistic and just downright boring.","May 26","false","0.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","4"

Game lacks a purpose for now. Maps are really small (think small floating islands you can fully explore in about 2 minutes).

Boss combat is .5 more complex with just as consistant attacks generally consisting of 2 or more attack types.\n\nstory..none exsistant..becase open world? emergant gameplay... whatever.\n\nin the end this is a purchase i made off of youtube vids..my bad... this review is just to clarify for those that read these reviews.. your getting minecraft 1.4. a slightly larger arsenal of attacks and a slight improvment in graphics with little to no real challange upgrade. if that suits your needs then this is your game.\n\nif you want anything more..then pass this up becase its a lazy upgrade over minecraft. I suggest Looking at trove for all its issues...who thought i would point someone at a trion game...\n\n","February 27","false","8.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It takes 4 Copper Ore for a Copper Ingot, what is that scaling?! I'll tell you what, that's the "hidden grind" method. They couldn't make a real end game, they had to pretend to make one, similar to many games in the industry in present times.\n\nI ridiculous amount of early release performance issues and bugs that make no sense as to how they even exist. Few quality options make it harder for lower end PC's to run and no distinct resolution options make it lack user friendliness.\n\nOverall I believe Portal Knights has amazing qualities, but it needs an unbelievable amount of help in the design department regarding game progression and display. I will most likely revisit Portal Knights when it is released or fixed immensely.\n\nWill I purchase the game again in the future? Probably. Will I play it a lot? Probably. Do I want it now?

Going in blind. Seeing zero content on the game. I can NOT recommend this game in its current state.\n\ntl;dr - No. Crafting is awful. The game is a grind. And building is almost entirely pointless other than building your way up a cliff. And loot sucks.\n\nI honestly don't feel like typing the long version. I was uncertain up till 10 hours of playing and realized it just wasn't fun grinding for ore that scalled with the late game, hundreds of gold ore and coal and such for only a few ingots. An awful crafting menu that shows every single stations items of crafting regardless what station you opened... There was no point in building a house since they give you one on the first stage, and storage is near impossible to manage. And item stack sizes (other than blocks) are just so low you end up with many MANY stacks of things you don't want (i just throw them away). And ugh.\n\nYou know, it really was fun for awhile.

I have played offline as well.\n\nMy experience with Portal Knights went from : Wow! Cool, this is new want to explore more!\n\nto REQUIRE MORE MINERALS.\n\nSeriously the only thing that drove me was the fact that I lacked minerals and needed more. Worlds are very small, dungeons can go really deep underground but offer VERY LITTLE in return. Basically couple of ores some potions, experience and most importantly NO LOOT. Yep, no armors or weapons. That for me is a deal breaker. Lackluster exploring.\n\nWhen you do grind for hours just to get the sword you like it truns out to be utter crap. Why? Well I played as warrior I had miserable 5% more STR than other classes but still my gold sword was outclassed by iron crossbow... Even though sword had way more Damage ( at least on paper ). However when I attacked enemy I did 75 dmg while my crossbow did 100-150... So whats the point of playing a warrior? ALSO armors are a joke!\n\nSeriously Marskman armor has 200 defense THE SAME AMOUNT of defense that Gold Viking Vest or any gold plate armor... On top of that a lot of archer armors have Dodge skill which makes it totally unfair . There has to be some balancing done otherwise there is no point on playing as warrior.\n\nSome daggers have sick stats that feel overpowered and yet rare swords or hammers are underpowered.\n\nOK so let's sum it up : Small crap worlds, lack luster exploring, NEEDLESS grinding and when you find a portal to a new world usually its the same CRAPPY WORLD! Found icy world with marble stone and coal? Goes through gate... same things marble and coal except layout is a bit different. WTF?! Dissapointing.\n\nGAMEPLAY.\n\nBarebones. I was very frustrated with DAMN auto lock on camera! Seriously kill it already. No blocks, no parries, just dodging that doesnt always work ( if you are too early to dodge or dodge the last second you will get hit ). So even though I player as warrior I ended up using bows because of higher damage and kiting possibility. Mages are crap because of mana constraints and to get skills you really need to upgrade magic station.\n\nLeveling up feels unrewarding and you have little to none options available on how to distribute stats.\n\nHonestly this game feels like a wasted potential. I hope they will improve the combat, character customisation and building/placing blocks is a bit frustrating. You can't really place blocks on empty space. Because of this I have lost a lot of resources...\n\nI cant recommend this game just yet, Unless you are a masochist or just like casual games like this.","March 8","false","10.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There isn't much game here.  The islands are very small and there isn't much to explore.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BJSwensen/recommended/374040/","BJSwensen","BJSwensen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BJSwensen/","23 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf I'd need to describe Portal Knights in few words, I would say "casual Minecraft-like action", "casual" being the main word here.This review describes v0.3.0, Early Access. If you're looking at the "not recommend" flag: I'm not saying the game's horrible, mind you. It's more... "not for everyone". For me it gets boring rather quick. If I would be given a 1 to 5 scale, I'd rate it 3. Interested in details? I got them for you.\n\nPros:\n+ Coherent cartoonish graphic style\nSomething PK excels at, graphic style is kept at professional level and is arguably the best among all sandboxes. Diversity of blocks (and props) is something the game improved in recently and I think it won't be the last time devs do it.\n+ Overall stability\nSomething you don't see often in Early Access games, PK is quite stable. It rarely crashes and even more rarely throws bugs your way.\n+ Easy to grasp, forgiving gameplay\nWhile some can say it's a drawback, this game doesn't make you shake in horror being afraid to lose everything you've got so far. Resurrection is instant and causes no penalties (aside from the fact you're always resurrecting in the same place). You don't drop any items upon death.\n+ Quick resource regeneration, no resource destruction\nWhile all the blocks can be mined, most can be acquired without mining through farming mobs, the exception being simple dirt (and any world mostly consists of it so there are lots). Trees and crops grow (relatively) fast. As I've said, it's a casual game. Bombs and exploding monsters don't destroy blocks but "mine" them (you can pick them up later). Few ways to destroy blocks completely include dropping them into the Abyss surrounding each island or waiting for the mined blocks to despawn.\n\nCons:\n- No goal in the game\nWhile "lack of a goal" may sound strange for a sandbox, there is actually not much you can do here. Monsters and "bosses" aren't much of a challenge. Currently the basic principle of gameplay can be described as "beat mobs, activate portal, jump into hext island". Repeat. There are no NPCs, little lore and no story. There are no quests, no pets to tame or rare things to collect. The latest updates brought random events though, so there finally is something you can look for.\n- Lacking and mandatory crafting\n"Lacking" doesn't mean it's downright bad. But most props and gear can be built straight away if you have the right crafting stations and resources, few recipes dropping from monsters (and even these can be skipped). You'll skip most early weapons and armors as you get new resources much faster than use them (especially copper).\nResource requirements for crafting are unbalanced, especially late-game. While you can easily craft your first forge, gathering high-tier stone/metal for the upgrades quickly turns into a digfest (or grindfest). Conversion rates for late game metals (ore to bars) is ridiculous (was even more so before the devs halved it, and it's still high).\nEarly recipes are fine, with the exception of a torch which requires cotton (growing and dropping only in first biomes) and 3 Wood (which is what roughly one tree drops). If you're going for torches (and you'll need lots of them for exploration) it's much easier to get to the desert island, wait for the night and kill Fire Knights - every knight drops one.\nLast, but not least, crafting is mandatory and is the only way of obtaining better equipment. Monsters, including bosses, and treasure boxes don't drop armor, weapons or props and drop few recipes.\n- "Classes" have little difference\nAll stats are raised during level-up simultaneously. Skill tree doesn't give many cool things, if any. Every class has spells but weapons are generally more efficient, so a mage doesn't usually do magic. Armor and weapons aren't bound to a class (which is good) and are of little usefullness beyond protection/damage and HP/MP increase (which is bad). Thus, little to no specialization. Playing every class is basically the same.\n- No treasure hunting\n"Treasure" boxes, urns and chests don't contain actual treasure. It's mostly blocks, potions, crafting ingredients and healing hearts (and rarely, recipes). All gear and most props are crafted. The game has no traders and no currency so crawling dungeons has sense only in search of portals.\n- Fragmented game world, static biomes\nThere is actually no "game world", just small islands flying in the Abyss and connected by portals. Big enough to explore, small enough to not get tired of distances.\nThe size, however, has its drawbacks. Abyss means no water or lava (or any other liquid whatsoever).\n"Biomes" are bound to islands, don't depend on soil or any other factors and are mostly decorative. Monsters and crops are also bound to islands so you can't bring your favourite mobs/crops to the world you like.\n- Static spawn system\nSpawn system is extremely predictable. Mid-game you'll know how many mosters are there in a room before entering it. There is no way to prevent spawning. In most sandbox games light sources or player-placed artificial blocks prevent monster spawning. In PK there is no such (or any other) system. You can find lots of half-destroyed castles and rebuild them but there will always be skeletons inside if you reenter the island, same number, in the same places.\n- Most props are purely decorative\nAnd when I say "most", what I mean is "everything except torches, doors, chests and crafting stations". Beds, tables, chairs, windows etc have no function.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick relaxing game after work, that might be your thing. If you're looking for something more deep and serious I would recommend looking somewhere else.","May 2","false","7.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It looks great, it plays decent and it has my two favorite types of games rolled into one. (RPG & Sandbox) The game itself really isnt that bad but with rather small "maps" really they are just islands which might i add half of them just look the the same and arent really dynamic enough.  Also the game really isnt a challenge, i found myself just going through the motions after awhile.  The last thing that really kicked me was the combat, i will say that it is far better then alot of other RPG or MMORPGs of the like but its just not perfect, you can attack while moving, your basically just an auto fire for a bit dodge roll then auto fire.  Also the rolling dodge is really cool but due to the rather rough terrain on most islands its practically useless.  Another last thing for me was the AI, which stands for Artifical ignorance for this game because the mod AI is terrible, lol "Just stand there while i shoot you; or GG on getting stuck on that Tree.  Its a cuties game but i would give it a 4/10 at max.","February 26","false","1.4"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","6","15","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nosteme/recommended/374040/","Nosteme","Lion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nosteme/","442 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you want to play a better version of this game for free, go look up Sky Saga.\n\nBoth games are in alpha, but Sky Saga's key features work way better than this game's.\n\nProblems with this game (and yes, I know it's early access):\n-The islands are too small. Considering this is a key feature, there's little hope this will change over the development period. There are so many islands, why care about a single one of them? They function all the same and do not influence each other at all. Even if they add more biomes and such, they all feel pointless. It doesn't help that there is no exploration, as you can often see the exit for an island from its entrance.\n\n-The combat is very dull. They might change some of this later, but as of now, the Zelda-style camera is the only interesting thing. Your attacks are all the same, there's no variety or jump attacks or anything like you might find in a Zelda game. You just target an enemy and hold down the attack button. Occasionally you backpedal. That's it.\n\n-Classes have no meaning. Any class can equip any weapon, so why have classes? There are no special attacks, and in the RPG progression, you can't even choose what skills to learn. It's all linear. Not to mention that attacking with a bow and attacking with a wand are exactly the same. There's no interesting spells or anything.\n\n-No quests. I hope you like the first three tutorial quests because those are the only ones you'll find. This game touts its lack of direction as "open ended gameplay" and "player driven questing." When your only options of interacting with the game are holding down the attack button on enemies and building a crafting table you'll never use again once you leave whatever tiny island you are currently on, there isn't much agency or ability for players to "create their own stories."\n\n-Repetitive. Everything is repetitve. Even with different biomes and different enemies, its all just\n1) Enter new island\n2) Kill enemies for portal shards\n3) Craft portal blocks\n4) Stick blocks in portal\n5) Rinse and repeat\n\nAgain, if you want a game with a lot of variety, interesting combat, large islands with lots to explore, home islands you can return to, community quests, a huge healthy community of clever builders and explorers, and all of that for free, go check out Sky Saga. I'll see you there.","February 27","false","0.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
