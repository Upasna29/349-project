It's not a feature, it's not retro, its ugly. Animations are bad, sometimes barely can be called animations at all. And you know what? i still love this game to bits. It's funny, characters are likeable and I find myself rooting for them almost immediately. Plot is surprisingly exciting and i couldn't stop playing at times, simply because i had to know what happens next. And thanks to build-in dropbox support for save transfer i could keep playing on my android device at work! It's just an amazing space adventure P&C game with good puzzles and charm, making it one of my favorite games of 2014! I did not expected that from a game like this. As for the graphic? After few minutes i lerned how to stop worrying and and love the game:) 10/10\n\nAs for the Linux port: No surprises here really:) 10/10!","October 17, 2014","true","0.2"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","32","36","0","0"

I kept on buying them, some even blindly, because I wanted them to be good. But they rarely even met the standards of the 90s games they tried to emulate.\nBik - A Space Adventure, on the other hand, is a great game. I mean, a proper one.\nIt contains timed passages. Deaths are frequent, but never unfair (the game always autosaves beforehand). I just fought some sort of boss, I could move freely and shoot it with my blaster. It still is a classic adventure game, not a hybrid, but developer Zotnip knows this genre is about letting people DO things, not restricting them.\nThink of Zak McKracken, a game where you could switch on your TV - in almost every other adventure, TVs are always broken or the main character doesn't want to watch.\nIn Bik, you're constantly asked to handle situations, fix things, work something out. And because everything is fast - no painful, slow dialogue, fadeouts, dragged-down-by-Unity interfaces - you're never punished for trying things out.\n\nNow, for the presentation. People call this game ugly, done with MS Paint and so on. Maybe, as a fan of reduced EGA-type graphics in general and titles like Pleurghburg: Dark Ages my opinion isn't that valid, but ...\nI'm glad about every developer breaking the mold. Here, it's more about perspective and grain than choice of colours, since the cyan magenta-thing isn't that new. Sure, there are traces of Mutation of J.B. and Mission Supernova in Bik, but please, why call it ugly? It's bold.\nSure, Wadjet Eye Games for example do their thing very well, but they're are also stuck in some conservative 90s with benefits limbo. They are miles away from having a style you could call "distinct".\nIt is obvious that each screen has been composed with lots of care, neither too empty, nor too cluttered and I find that very pleasing, except for some particle effects, which are really not very good.\n\nThe moody and well-produced music, by the way, is the best I've heard in this genre in a long time.","October 18, 2014","true","3.4"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","5"

The art has both a retro and unique feel to it, complemented nicely by the music and sound effects. The story is engaging and the dialog is pretty funny. I laughed out loud several times throughout playing this. The gameplay is also really enjoyable. The scenes and puzzles vary from start to finish so it never feels stale.\n\nWhat makes this game stand out from other point-and-click adventures is how it avoids tedium. You can highlight clickable items on the screen so that you're not just clicking everywhere all the time. Also, it's not possible to use every item in your inventory with everything on the screen. When you're trying to solve puzzles, many items will be greyed out for whatever object you're looking at. Now it's still possible to use the wrong item at times, the game doesn't just give you the answers, but this saves a lot of time that's normally spent trying every item combination in hopes of unlocking something. Best of all, despite these omissions, it still takes a long time to beat the game. This is a testament to how much actual content there is. By the end you'll really feel like you've been on a space adventure!\n\nThis is a fun game with a lot of charm to it. It's strange that this seems to have gotten no attention on Steam. It's one of the better point-and-click adventures out there and I recommend it to anyone who's even a casual fan of the genre.","January 2, 2015","true","7.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

And it's an odd one.  Odd, because as lame as it is, it is a designed lameness;  it looks crap, but it looks consistently crap;  the music is some generic midi-sounding sci-fi instrumentals, and it sounds like it should fit the on-screen action but it never does;  while the designers appeared to have gone out of their way to make a standard adventure game interface (really one of only two interfaces in popular use in the genre) much more clunky and much less intuitive than it needs to be.\n\nAccording to Steam I've spent (I think) around three hours on this game, playing it from start to finish.  Looking at other reviews, that seems to be a somewhat shorter playtime than most.  Usually, however, I tend to be someone that needs a bit extra time to finish a game.  Why?  Because I like to EXPLORE, I want to look at EVERYTHING, try out every possible combination, and really get a deep feel for the game.\n\nWith Bik:  A Space Adventure, I never felt like there was anything to be gained from being experimental, from clicking on everything, from trying things out.  It doesn't help that there really isn't much to click on.  Scenes tend to be absolutely bare.  There aren't any real puzzles;  there is only a flow of actions you are expected to perform in order to progress to the next scene.  It's all just so empty.  And perhaps that's what kills this game's appeal for me more than anything else.\n\nThe first hour I was psyched.  I enjoyed the character interactions.  I enjoyed the art design -- ugly as it may be, it does serve a certain design function.  I enjoyed the humour.  The interface was clunky.  But I was still going to give this game a positive RECOMMENDED review.\n\nThe second hour doubts started settling in.  It hit me how flat all of the characters were.  I realised that there was a complete absence of lore for this particular setting.  The almost complete lack of sound effects made the already bare scenery seem even moreso.  And the music was starting to annoy, chiefly as it seemed to be a such an ill fit for the action.\n\nBy the start of hour three the tedium had set it in.  The humour had worn thin.  There was nothing interesting happening in the story.  I just wanted to get it all over with.  I even considered taking a break from the game and moving on to something else.  (In the end I stuck with it, and here we are ...)\n\nIt's not that the game lacks polish.  Rather, the issue is that -- through the process of polishing the game -- bad design decisions were enforced.  Hence why the bad art is consistently bad throughout;  hence why the music is cool to listen to on its own (note:  massively dissappointed that the soundtrack DLC is mp3 ONLY!) but doesn't really work in the game;  hence why there are almost no sound effects implemented throughout the whole of the game (and the few that are, are PC internal speaker-style shrieking reminiscent of the DOS era);  hence why the interface takes an established standard (click on something -->  get a menu of possibilities) and adds an extra step as regards item use, while at the same time eschewing a quick inventory access icon.  And so on.  Etc.\n\nThe story has potential -- a human kid is abducted by aliens and ends up in the middle of international business intrigues.  But it's all wasted.  The "feels" just aren't there.  I wanted to care about this kid.  But he's so aloof and flippant about the whole thing -- and the story never explores his background or his feelings -- that I just ended up thinking:  "Okay, if the designers don't care about Bik, why should I care about Bik?"\n\nYou also get to control three aliens as playable characters -- outside of graphics there's nothing particularly alien about them, though.  They're just American sitcom stereotypes forced into a sci-fi setting (without it being anywhere near as interesting as that sounds).\n\nRegarding achievements, most can be had simply playing the game;  the rest all depend on you killing yourself in creative ways (designers forcing you to kill the character you're supposed to care about?);  except for the one at the beginning, where you have to get a perfect score on a partially broken minigame (again, likely partially broken by design).\n\nAnd so, to end off this review, I'm not recommending Bik, and I'm moving on to my next adventure, which will probably be Alum.\n\nThank you for reading!","October 27, 2015","false","3.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It's not a clone of those, but rather an original concept and story, a homage to the genre.\n\nThe game is surprisingly long and varied, taking you to several settings (planets, ships) with different moods, things to do, and characters to meet. The story will keep you on your toes, and the puzzles will (for the most part) keep you engaged without being too frustrating. (There are one or two that don't make much sense, but if you persist  you will solve them.)\n\nThe many charms include the lovable characters, the original music, and the family-friendly humor. The graphics and animations, though, might fail in striking the right balance between retro charm and being just bad. There are some cool cut scenes, but sometimes it seemed that the artists were just lazy. For example, characters will fade in and out instead of walking into rooms. Was it really so hard to animate a door opening?\n\nDespite the retro, pixelated graphics, the game is a bit heavy in resource use. My dinky little netbook would heat up considerably when playing it.\n\nVery much hoping for a sequel! What adventures will Bik, Ammut, and Tatenen get into next?  Also very much hoping that the devs will invest just a bit more in fleshing out the art.\n\nFinally, many thanks to the devs for supporting Linux! It made my gaming experience so much easier.","January 9","true","7.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandalwoodrabbit/recommended/325160/","sandalwoodrabbit","Sandalwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandalwoodrabbit/","132 products in account","Bik: A Space Adventure is a must-play, especially if you love point-and-click adventures or plan on designing one.  It serves as an excellent model for point-and-click adventure games and other developers could learn quite a lot from it.  In particular, this game flawlessly executes three objectives upon which the entire genre depends.\n\n1 - Avoids punishing the player for guessing.\n\nIf you've ever played one of these Zork descendants, you know that sometimes the solution to a puzzle is unclear.  Sometimes one wrong move can be the end of the game.  Bik circumvents this somewhat with a sense of humour.  Some of the deaths are outright ridiculous and great for a laugh.  Not only that, but if you make a fatal mistake, the developers were kind enough to include a feature that autosaves your game retroactively to your critical error so that you can try again from exactly the moment you fumbled.  It keeps the game fun, especially in the middle of difficult or complex puzzles, of which there are very few in the first place.  Short loading times mean that you're ready to try again in seconds.\n\n2 - Leads you in the right direction.\n\nAs I played through this adventure, I felt a mild disappointment at how neglected some of the object descriptions were and how mundane the non-essential parts of the game were.  I saw it as a missed opportunity to develop the world.  But then I considered it in a new light and realised that it ... might have been on purpose.  All point-and-click adventures suffer from one critical conundrum--in the effort to build an immersive world full of detail, the player is often overloaded with information.  When every object seems significant, none of them stand out clearly enough to lead us to what we're there to do.  A few pictures or disheveled bedsheets in the background may have lackluster descriptions, but that's the point.  It's directing your focus toward the puzzles' real elements so that you can progress without ever feeling 'stuck' and clicking every random combination of items in frustration.\n\n3 - It still tells a solid story.\n\nThis ties into the previous point.  Even with the background and details somewhat simplified, Bik manages to tell a good story with a classic outline.  It strikes a perfect balance between storytelling and puzzle-solving and shines by that accomplishment.  It's simple, it's relatively short, but it's consistently satisfying to progress.  The characters' personalities are not sacrificed to this end, the integrity of the world remains intact, and it really feels like a window into a new universe.  Sure, it's not the whole space opera, but it's enough of it that we want to see the sequel.  I'm waiting for Bik: The SET Strikes Back and Bik: Return of the Sandwich.\n\nTake my money, Bik.

One of the rare adventure games I never got quite frustrated enough to pull up a walkthrough for, and still felt good about solving puzzles.\nThis is partly because they cut down on trial and error puzzle solving, by not letting you try to use everything on everything else, so you don't have to waste time with constant "That doesn't work" responses.\n\nDistinctive art. Okay, it's not the prettiest, but I've played other games which used a lot more pixels to make boring art. Still, I do wish they'd put a tiny bit more effort into the "animations", especially for falling over.\n\nFair death system. Yes you can die, but the game saves for you, so you won't lose progress if you forget to save before "accidentally" blowing up the space station you're standing in.\n\nIf you're a fan of adventure games, Bik is well worth your time.","February 19, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
