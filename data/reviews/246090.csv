The game is going into "1.0" release next month and is being left to modders to finish it up. They claim they're going to fix bugs, but as I made clear in the review below, they couldn't even finish the A.I. during thier "Alpha" stage.\n\nThis game is like an incredibly dumbed-down Dwarf Fortress in space. Key word being dumb.\n\nThe AI has incredibly complex inabilities to solve their problems. They would rather let themselves asphyxiate in the cold of space than finish constructing the airlock that is filled with oxygen. Why? Because the unfinished part is a space suit locker. They were in space suits already.\n\nIn a previous run, the builders refused to add onto the life support section because oxygen was running low (for some unknown reason) and so the whole crew suffocated.\n\nAnother run, I had to tear down a door I placed. That destroyed the wall and converted the next room from an airlock into a reactor, and while trying to fix that, the builder simply never finished construction. The crew died because they had no airlock to exit and expand and there was a hole into space.\n\nThe security have no sense of uniformity and would rather walk one at a time into a derelict and die continuously to the same thing.\n\nYou can't place objects in 4 directions, only two. I don't know why 4-view camera controls aren't implemented yet, but its frustrating to deal with as you have so much unused space.\n\nIt's a neat concept and can become a good game, but it is not at all worth your time or money. It is bug-ridden. It has very stupid AI. If the developers can create useful viewing controls and decent AI that you don't have to play around in a nit-picky manner, it'll be a fun, hard game of balance between many facets of every characters' needs and wants, and management of a space station.","September 8, 2014","false","10.0"," 665 of 691 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","665","691","4","0"

I don't care how great the guys developing Massive Chalice are, they're from the same studio that scamed me out of 25 bucks.\n\n25 dollars, in the grand scheme of things, it isn't much. But there's alot of things I could've done with that 25 dollars, first thing that comes to mind is buy a case of mediocre beer.\n\nNow when I buy a case of Budwieser I expect certian things; I expect bland taste, I expect to get a mild buzz, sounds like a pretty ♥♥♥♥ty use of 25 dollars right? Here's the thing, I was never promised anything more.\n\nLets expand on the beer analogy: instead of Budweiser, DF is now the brewer. DF promises me a pretty nice brew: nothing amazing, but something well worth my money. Having heard DF has produced some quality brews in the past I buy a case from the affable salesman. I take the case home, eager to try a fresh new flavor from the brewer I've heard so many good things about; then I open the first bottle. ♥♥♥♥, this bottle contains nothing but ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ fumes; disgusted but still hoping to at least drink my initial disgust away I open another bottle..........more ♥♥♥♥.

So I hope you fine folks at DF can understand why the next time someone asks me to spend my money on one of your products, I'll tell you to shove your product up your ♥♥♥.","November 12, 2014","false","41.5"," 550 of 611 people (90%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","90","550","611","53","5"

And it reminds me of the Sims 4 or Sim City(2013)\n\n\n\n-Great idea for a game\nlots of people have done building games, city games,etc, but Space Bases are few. The idea for this game is Perfect, now if only the game was...\n\n\n\nWhat Space Base DF-9 did wrong\n\n\n-Did not deliver\non the Double Fine Games website they had a roadmap (now long gone) of things they said they were going to try to add. It was a big one. And yes i know that even they said it wasn't "set in stone" but it was used to get people to buy the game, and now only about 20 to 40% of those features are in the game, and it kinda feels like they tricked us.\n\n-Left the Game unfinished\nDouble Fine Games the dev and publisher has left SBDF-9 to make another game and thereby make more money. They basically blame the community citing that "not enough people bought the game to fund it". Perhaps because the game is in an Alpha state at the most\n\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI\nI don't know about you but when i'm in a space base on the far reaches of the milky way, i get pretty damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when i don't have Five Star meals, or Gyms, or bars, or TV. So mad i start trashing my own Oxygen tanks thereby killing myself. What? You wouldn't do that? Well the AI in this game does that. Yep, if they aren't living in luxury they decide life just ain't worth living.\n\n-Not Worth the price\nIf Double Fine Games was going to keep working on this, i would say this is worth the price, however they aren't so really there is no point in spending cash on it. Its not going to get better, its not going to get fixed, and its not a good game.\n\n-bugs and glitches that will never be fixed\nNot being able to build, Oxygen not being produced despite the fact i have Oxygen tanks and more, these are bugs and glitches that will never be fixed.\n\n-Made us pay for their failure\nThis is more of a issue of Double Fine Games itself. They the whole reason they said the game is being shut down is because one: Not enough people bought it, and two: they ran out of Kickstarter money. If they did run out of kickstarter money then STOP working on another game and spend that money on the game you sold us.\n\n-This is not the first time Double Fine Game has let people down\nAnother game by DFG, Broken Age was also misleading. The game is sold as a full game but it is like TellTale games in that there are "Episodes". Right now, a year after the funding for the game ended there is only ONE  episode, with a "promise" that the second one will be coming on "sometime in early 2015"\n\nWho Space Base DF-9 is for\n-People who like wasting money\n\n-People who don't care about playing an unfinished game\n\n-People who buy games on sale\n\n-Idiots\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe idea behind this game is amazing, and if worked on properly it could be a masterpiece. But it won't and thats a shame. Normally i keep supporting even bad EA games because i figure "eh, they will fix it later" i mean at the point i've already given them money, the best thing to do is hold on to the hope (however pointless) that the game will get better. There is no hope with SBDF-9, not anymore. And yes, modders could make it better, and they could make it a great game, but my belief is that if modders have to fix your game, and i mean Make it playable, then you've already failed.\n","December 18, 2014","false","10.5"," 337 of 360 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","337","360","9","6"

But between the horrible AI, UI, and overall game meta, not to mention lackluster developer support over the course of the last year I cannot with good conscience recommend this to anybody. Wait at least until beta to buy this, and only if they significantly alter the meta-game.\n\nAs it stands the AI are imbecilic, the gameplay progression borders on unfair or unplayable even at low difficulty, and the game has a daisy chain of progressive bugs and glitches that functionally cripple your base the longer you play. Invisible raiders? Yes. Unhealable citizens? Got that too. Ludicrous pathing? Sure! Lack of transparency in regards to what you're placing into the game?

But it is obvious to me that Double Fine isn't investing many resources in this game, and probably have no intention of doing so either.\n\nMy prediction? A halt in development by Fall of 2014 when the dev team gets recalled to work on what is seen as more 'profitable' ventures.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/recommended/246090/","maximumslothfulness","Maximum Sloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/","618 products in account","I purchased this game when it was still in Early Access for the full price (was $25 when I bought it).  Developers promised a lot of things, new features, customization, and a vast amount of gameplay.  Unfortunately, none of these promises were delivered.  I bought the game because I enjoyed Double Fine's Brutal Legend.  They seemed like a trustworthy developer that could get a fun quirky game done and make it worthwhile.\n\nAfter months of no updates and no communication I began to lose heart.  The minimal amount of playtime (logged 0.6 hours) was due to the lack of a tutorial (which they have since added, and it's sub-par) and (I assume) a bug that prevented my characters from entering the base I built.  I started another game, and again they wouldn't enter the base I built and ended up suffocating.  Started another game and I finally got them to enter the base, and that's where more bugs appeared.  Just read the forums to get an idea of how frustrating the bugs are and how broken the game is, despite it getting a full release.\n\nVery disappointed in Double Fine.  Their lack of communication regarding the game's development, refusal to be honest with people who bought their product (e.g. not letting us know they planned to stop development and leave the game as is), and the fact that they had the gall to release the code and tell the community that if they like the game, then they have to fix it.  Come on.\n\nTo conclude, I'd say avoid this game, it will receive no further updates, and as it stands it's an incomplete mish-mosh of ideas.  Even for $12 I'd say skip it.  Hopefully they update Gang Beast, which I also purchased before this fiasco, although it hasn't received an update since the day I bought it (2 months ago).\n\nUpdate: Source code has been released...and there are still parts of the code that are hidden, as one person on the forum mentioned, the Oxygen Recycler.  One of the most basic units of the game.  It's used to prevent your base from losing oxygen, thus preventing everyone from suffocating.\n\nUpdate #2: Price has changed to $20.01 (from the sale price of $12), and that's about it.  Tried playing the game again and it wouldn't let me complete the tutorial (was not allowed to place a second airlock door where it indicated).  Still have yet to build my own base.  They supposedly also fixed some bugs on October 30th.  This is what one user had to say:\n\n"crlsniper Nov 1 @ 2:30pm\n\nGlad to see your working on fixes, though the bigest fixes need to be AI fixes, Mostly for doctors and security. I lost an entire base just because none of the doctors would go help people who where incapacitated, neither would soldiers go arrest and move raiders who where incapacitated either."\n\nMultiple counts of the same complaint.  Furthermore, despite where you establish your base, you will have near constant attacks from pirates/raiders.\n\nSome brave souls have attempted to mod the game (essentially having to rebuild the game from the ground up), check this thread out: http://steamcommunity.com/app/246090/discussions/0/613940477963640858/\n\nIt outlines a lot of the bugs and problems with the game, such as faulty oxygen recyclers (e.g. too many people in a room would cause dramatic decreases in oxygen no matter how many recyclers you had, thus everyone in that room eventually would suffocate).\n\nUpdate #3: Free copies of Hack n Slash were provided to buyers of this game (myself and a few others received a copy), however it strikes me as more of a political ploy than a genuine apology.  This is because people who purchased Hack n Slash got a copy of this game.  As far as I know, Hack n Slash purchasers weren't spat upon and kicked to the curb by Double Fine, so this move makes no sense to me.\n\nAnd of course I'm not eligible for the new refund policy, since I purchased this game over a year ago.

No I am not.  I have never dealt with such mind-crushing stupidity in any game of this sort, ever.  The stupidity of your citizens goes above and beyond funny and delves into the absolutely painful and rage-inducing.\n\nI'm talking about builders not building airlocks and dying from it, Techs not maintaining their oxygen recyclers, panicing when the lack of oxygen makes them suffocate, and then dies flailing around in circles - going into a raider/monster infested derelict one after another for the sole purpose of greed; the overwhelming desire to pick up some stupid, worthless toy and dying for it in a pile of their greedy dead friends, stamping on a roaring fire the size of a house and burning to death in a huge mass instead of using the fire extinguishers directly outside and in said flaming room - walling themselves into small rooms and dying, refusing to tear down the wall to escape or build a door,   Downright refusing to maintain the station, their lives, their jobs, or anything relating what so ever to order, because they'd rather bash each others brains out in some psychotic fight, or they'd rather have a temper tantrum because they need to keep the oxygen recyclers operational and they can't play with their rubber duckies.\n\nYes, all of this actually happens, and it happens constantly.  It isn't some stupid trivial issue that appears once in awhile, it's literally ♥♥♥♥ing constant and it never ♥♥♥♥ing ends.  Seeing 30 people die one after another because they individually decided to stop working/cooking/sleeping to go steal a ♥♥♥♥ing trinket from a derelict near-by, and absolutely nothing I try to do can ♥♥♥♥ing stop them (Making them security and putting the deployment icon elsewhere, making them builders and trying to make them build, ANYTHING BUT DIE IN THAT ♥♥♥♥ING DERELICT ONE AFTER ANOTHER FOR YOUR STUPID ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T).\n\nAgain, this isn't funny.  It goes beyond funny.  It's unplayable.  It's literally ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable because you're actually trying to manage severely mentally disabled humans and aliens in a ♥♥♥♥ing space station.  If they don't kill themselves from suffocating, greed, or just random senseless violence and fighting, the almost constant raider attacks (that eventually culminates to a literal raider fleet, for no reason what so ever) will kill them.\n\nThe best part is apparently the developers took the money and ran, haven't been doing anything with the game, ban people who point this out or mention it on their forums, and are making new projects/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with the nonexistant money.\n\nThis game could be really, really good if the crew wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and suicidal.  If they were competent and HAD PRIORITIES like ANY LIVING CREATURE WITH SOME SENSE OF SELF-PRESERVATION, the game would be good, REALLY good in fact.  As it is right now?  No it's unplayable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nMaybe some modders can take it over and fix it, do anything with it, I don't know.  But by default this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is awful.","November 9, 2014","false","19.0"," 221 of 233 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","221","233","9","6"

After completing most of the goals in the game I've come to a conclusion:\n\nDF-9 does not hold up to its promise. Not by a long shot.\n\nAside from the fact that fact that Double Fine abandoned (I do actually understand their situation) the game long before their planned goals had been implemented, the unfortunate truth is that what we do have isn't finished either.\n\nMost prominently the power system. Without an actual power meter (like we have for O2) your base will just suddenly lose power if you've built too much. You have no useful way of knowing when to build another reactor. The devs expect you to hover your mouse over each and every room and sum up the power consumption in your head each time you want to take inventory.\n\nNext up is the "story" of the game. One of the last versions must have shoehorned this in because I don't remember it from Alpha5. Basically at some point the game will spontaneously throw multiple raider ships and raider astronauts at you in bulk. I've you've managed to build your base accordingly by then: congratulations for figuring out the simple and boring strategy needed. If you haven't? Well, you can start all over again.\n\nThen as you continue to play and expand your base to meet the other goals you'll notice how the game becomes increasingly glitchy.\n\nAnd speaking of goals: The "build all the things" goal isn't even possible.

The store page says this is in Alpha. It is not. It is in final beta stages since they have just announced that after a round of bug fixes they will release version 1.0 in october and content updates will stop.\n\nThe game had huge potential and I was under the impression this still had at LEAST a year left of updates, but sadly it seems like they are ditching it. What exsists today is the shell of a full title, a scant promise of something it could be after a lot longer in development, but £19 for this? Forget it.\n\nThis is the first time I have been badly stung by Early Access and it has shaken my faith in it completely. I have huge respect for Double Fine, but I will NEVER buy any of their Early Access titles again (and I was so close to getting Gang Beasts).\n\nJust have to put this one behind me I suppose.

No, don't fix them, lets panic for two hours while the oxygen slowly runs out"\n\nNow you can put most people down to blind panic in situations like those, but out of a crew of 64, 52 of them went to stomp out the fire (they ran all the way from a safe section of the base, past security and into the raiders, most of which were assigned to security and tasked with killing the raiders.  You just wouldn't get a situation like that in real life.\n\nI understand the reasons behind it, and the bug fixing is ongoing.  However in its current state it is still very very difficult to play smoothly, and I don't mean that the game is hard, I mean the game visibly holds you back when you want to play it and a single bug can be a game breaker.\n\nIf you like the look of this game, feel free to get it, back up your saves MANUALY on a regular basis, and don't be surprised if a sudden bug/glitch wrecks your experience.  However please don't buy this game if you are thinking it will be epic.  It's epic until a bug kills it.\n\nAs major bugs are patched I will update this review, but it’s looking like the "patches" will either not continue or be few and far in-between.  There is currently a comminity unofficial patch in the works so I will be interested to see how/if that pans out.","October 30, 2014","false","82.6"," 111 of 114 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","111","114","0","0"

A game that has potential, a game that has that Double Fine sense of humor we all love, and a game that will fill a void in the market that has been left open for far too long.\n- The investors love it and give Tim Schafer $400,000 to make this game.\n- Tim Schafer gets addicted to cocaine and hookers and completely blows (heh) all of his investors' money, but just about this time Steam early access was hitting its stride and crafty Schafer cooks up a scheme.\n- Tim Schafer puts a very early, borderline-developmental build of DF9 up on steam for $25 with a link to a web page promising tons and tons of features - all with a very nebulous timetable attached.\n- A few months later (and a few inconsequential updates later) Tim Schafer finally cons enough money from hard-working people to pay back his investors (and get himself into rehab). Unfortunately, Double Fine is now broke.\n- Tim Schafer announces the latest development build as the final release, takes down the webpage with the planned content, and releases the source code in a futile attempt to placate his former fans.\n- Tim Schafer goes off to further bankrupt Double Fine.\n\ntl;dr, DO NOT BUY.  This game is fundamentally broken and lacking in content.\n\n\nI realize game development can be expensive, but I think it's pretty obvious from this and the Broken Age debacles that Tim Schafer isn't particularly good with money. Maybe Double Fine's next project should be an Excel spreadsheet so he can keep track of expenses.\n\nAlso, I really don't see how releasing the source code, or modding API, or whatever will possibly save this turd.  Modders are not going to want to spend time making a bad game adequate.  I think a complete rewrite of the AI should be the first thing to be done, but by the time they familiarize themselves with the code and rework the game, it'll be months from now. Months of work, just to maybe make the game playable and - best case senario - make Tim Schafer a few more bucks from sales.\n\nTim Schafer\nTim Shillfer\nTim Pilfer\nTim Tookallyourmoneyfer","November 28, 2014","false","9.0"," 238 of 283 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","238","283","11","0"

BUY. I bought into this game very early, paying $25 for basically a tech demo, because I loved the concept. I also trusted DoubleFine and Tim Schafer, being a respected studio and developer, to deliver an awesome product in the end. Alas, the development of this game seems to have been mismanaged into the ground. DF is abandoning the project and leaving us gamers with an unfinished buggy mess and calling it 1.0 release. There's about 10 hours of playtime here at most and quite frankly that is just not worth the pricetag.\n\nUpdate 11/12/14: I tried playing this game again after the 1.0 release. It still feels terribly unfinished. The new tutorial and goals system feel slapped together, lackluster, and unnecessary. I wish they would have spent the time adding more actual game content instead of these "features". Not to mention, the game is still very buggy. My first attempt at a base fell apart rather quickly after a derelict showed up. I set  a beacon to have my security guard check it out, who got killed by a bot. That alone would be fine as a possible risk of exploration, but then my other non-security personnel decided to go to the derelict "picking something up" (presumably the body) even after the beacon was removed. They all subsequently got killed, too. Nothing I could do would send them back to the safety of the base. Basically, I just got too frustrated to want to continue. If you still want to try this game, get it on super sale. It is just not worth the new lower price of $20.01.","October 26, 2014","false","11.5"," 135 of 147 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","135","147","0","0"

It's just not completed yet.\n\nLet's start out with management. Since the tiles you are working with is not directly underneath the stuff you're actually building, it's impossible to know if you're for example deleteing just this room, or also deleting the wall for the next room, which would mean all of the oxygen sucked out of your base.\n\nAnother thing is, that you can't move citizens around. This means, that you'll have to wait with (for example) destroying a room, because there are people in it. It can also be annoying, when you know theres a fire in a place, and you just have to wait until somebody discovers it. Even having the rooms alarm on won't help you. People only notices fires (and mostly also intruders), if they accidentally walks into them.\n\nA third thing is bugs. There are bugs everywhere in this game. One bug happens when you have an intruder. You then mark the intruder with an icon saying "kill this man". Even if all of your citizens are security guards, they can just be standing, looking at the intruder destroying all of your reactors, and they will first react, when he actually starts shooting at them.\nOMG thats annoying.\nAnother bugged thing is the airlock, the chamber between the base and space. Here you have two doors, that are never ment to be opened at the same time. Despite that, i've had a whole base killed twice, because the doors sudenly opens at the same time, and everybody is sucked out into space or suffocated. I've also tried people just standing in this room with the outer door opened, waiting until they die, and the door closes again.\nAHHHHHHHHH\n\nThis is just some of the bugs i have experienced. Tough i've tried several times now, my best game has only been finishing my base, and starting to make research, when some stupid bug happens, or some superior enemies destroy your entire base in seconds.\n\nIf DoubleFine made this game 10 times more solid, i would definetely think it was a good game.\nBut unfortunately for everyone, this game is totally ruined by the crazy amount of bugs and poorly crafted tools in it.","November 16, 2014","false","8.6"," 111 of 125 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","111","125","0","0"

I am almost embarassed that I purchased this game and the only reason I did is that the green light games I have purchased in the past were KSP and starbound, both excellent purchases.  Remember before buying any greenlight game that you are buying an unpolished and unfinished game as is and the developer, as doublefine affirmed, does not owe you ant future content.  If someone has a game where you can currently jump and play a card game, even if they promise the best RPG of all time, you are buying that game and not what they promise.  I have bought games that have tremendous glitches and that dont start on my laptop through steam and this is the one I am most dissapointed about. This is the one I want my money back for.  I probably own 5 doublefine games on my xbox and I will never buy another game from them due to this experience.

It sounds like a lot of fun for anyone that was into Star Trek or even games like Dungeon Keeper 2, but it turns into all of the management and none of the fun. The big issues that I have with the game is that its tough to survive the first few moments of a normal game and beyond that, its just a dull game that forces you to assimilate all metal to keep growing your station to accommodate more crew.\n\nYour objective is to keep your crew alive against first asphyxiation and later raiders. Even when your crew dies and the game tells you start a new game, it still continues. It is a game over without being concrete or giving you a final score before you have to start a new game.\n\nTo start with, there's an optional easy how to play tutorial level that will guide you through the basics without feeling forced upon you. The tutorial makes it easy to get up and running. Assign crew to the roster of jobs. Builders build when you construct rooms or objects. Miners will mine ore to be refined to get more matter to construct with. Technicians fix things and that's about as far as the tutorial gets.\n\nYou'll need a few things to get a space base operational. The first is power that comes in the form of reactors or a seed to start with. The second is the base itself which can be a giant room. You'll need an oxygen recycler since you are in space after all. After your space base has O2, an enclosed room and power, there's another matter and that's getting in. To do this you need to setup an air lock with two airlock doors one to the interior and the other to the exterior. This room also needs to have a locker for space suits.\n\nOutside of the tutorial the giant problem that I have with the game is the level of difficulty when you're even getting started. The tutorial is nice and setup and it does let you continue on playing which is perhaps the best method. Consider that easy mode. You get to select your location and the game tells you how rich in ore and the frequency of attacks. Its a nice choice of difficulty without being a blunt difficulty slider.\n\nIn normal play, the game starts you with a seed for power and three crew in space suits with limited oxygen. There is so much that can go wrong. Running out of matter before your crew is in oxygen will doom you. So you need to budget building a small room to house the seed, a recycler, food dispenser, and a second for the air lock. Then you need to wait for the station to fill with oxygen and even for the air lock to cycle air in and out. Your spacemen can die in their suits when waiting for an air lock to pressurize. Oh but there is another nail to get caught on and that's the fact ore needs to be converted into matter, so it requires a matter refinery. This getting started kicks off the game and it will scare people away.\n\nOn paper, interesting things do happen. Derelict space stations will come into your area for you to explore and spaceships will dock with you. From there you have a choice, send your security over to investigate them or ignore them. The spaceships become part of your base where then you need to claim each room, which can be tedious and cumbersome since many small rooms are just tough to click on.\n\nPeople can come aboard infected with a disease and then your science station will be put to work finding the cure. To do so, click whatever science room you've setup and select whatever they should research. There are a number of diseases to cure and upgrades to unlock. Upgrades include things like body armor and heavier doors.\n\nYou will get attacked from time to time. Raiders will float out in space and either try to shoot your miners as they pass by or they will board your station. Other times vessels will dock with your station and you'll be invaded. The catch is, unless you're watching a mining operation, its easy to spot and prepare for. You can have your security waiting for them, unless they're busy putting out a fire. It seems like more of an annoyance than a fun or cool challenge. You can also purchase wall mounted defense turrets.\n\nNormal crew will still engage the enemy if they're in the same room, but to send crew in to fight hostiles, you'll need to assign crew to the security. From there you can make a security beacon that draws them to the area. It feels like an extra step and even marking the point and calling off security seems like it could be streamlined. A lot of the game needs to be streamlined.\n\nOnce attackers are incapacitated you can act to cuff, uncuff or execute them. In fact you can chose to execute or cuff any of your crew. Its just a little odd. Sometimes they will even chose to join your crew. Once resources become scarce, its just easier to execute them and dump them into the refiners to make matter.\n\nSometimes there is an issue where a firefight in an airlock can down the only crew inside the station. So anyone outside the station is forced to suffocate over time because the air lock refuses to open when someone is in there without a suit. It gets more hilarious because in smaller stations, crew will just stand in the air lock when its too crowded everywhere else. Spacebase DF-9 is an amazing game to watch because of its logic.\n\nSpeaking of logic, I managed to glitch the game into thinking there was no airlock. Those outside the station would die of asphyxiation and those inside the station would stay in there. Even crew joining would stay outside until they died. Destroying the airlock doors and rebuilding had no effect. Yet I could manually keep a door open so the spacemen could float into my base still in their suits. They would still suffer the same fate with no oxygen. The only way I was able to get people in and out was to build a new airlock.\n\nIn terms of crew management, when it comes to the roster everyone has an emotion to specific jobs no matter what their skill level is. You can have someone great at botany, yet hates doing it. Crew member you're the best doctor we have! Yeah but they get sad while doing it. Its a realistic and offers a level of micro management. Once you get to a point where you have crew of every class it gets easier since you no longer have people flip jobs such as having a miner one day and builder the next.\n\nYou get constant hails to answer and decide if you want them to join. It feels like a chore so I opt to avoid the calls. Sometimes the hails are to lull you into security so they can get "in your base, killing your dudes." Their transmissions all seems sketchy. There is no one that sounds like a clear cut good or bad choice. They all sound like they're trying to be funny and questionable, because that's what people like in their games, humor and charm. Well both fall flat and it feels forced.\n\nIts also annoying having to press the faster speed setting, because the game will drop to normal speed whenever a yellow notice appears. It could be worse by being a popup box that you have to click like in so many other games. These warnings are things such as a crew member is starving or running out of oxygen. These warnings are color coated. Green means an overall hint on what's needed in your station such as more self space. Yellow and brown seem to be specific crew have achieved something or need something. Major warnings like crew being attacked or raiders about to board are in yellow so they blend in. A lot of times I realize we've been attacked after I see the number of crew go down. Raiders look similar to your own crew.\n\nSpacebase DF-9 is just a tough game to love when it feels like a tough start followed by dull and uninspired management. It does feel like a fleshed out game with a lot of annoyances. I think scenarios would help extend my interest, but within a few hours I feel like I've seen everything there is to see. With all of that said, it is still worth the one dollar I paid for it.","January 3","false","8.2"," 90 of 102 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","90","102","0","0"

The way they did it was not bad at all, simple drag-build controlls and assigning the different areas by a simple click of a button and design the interior as you like with various props. Easy.

That mean, it feel  like somethings are missing as they didn't have time or money to finish the game. Content is lacking.\n\nNow if you're ok with it:  You get to build up a space base with different type of rooms and assign jobs to your crew as: builder, tech (repair and keep up your base running), doctor, security, etc..). Diferent type of rooms: Airlock, Refinery, Garden, Pub, etc. Explore direlicts and rescue people or enconter aliens, killbots or raiders waiting to kill you. Defend your base from raiders who will breach your base hull or enter through the front door, or just dock. Deal with your crew emotions and manage your resources.\n\n\nThey decided to end development and jump straight from 0.6e version to 1.0 in a month. All they did was fix major bugs and add a tutorial to give the impression the game is complete and finished. There are still bugs, but from what I played after it got released, I didn't find major bugs yet.\n\n\n\nMods:\n\nThe game is modable, they provided the Lua code to everyone who purchase the game, it's located somewhere in the game folder. That's up to community if they want to work on this, but from reading the forums most don't feel like doing it since the game still being sold and are upset with the devs due to lack of communication and transparency.\n\n\n\nWhy the game development ended early:\n\n\nDouble Fine decided to use Early Access as the only way to raise funds for the project after the $400,000 they made when released at Steam. That money went back to their investors from Indie Fund and they relied on sales. Big mistake. Horrible money management from DF part, plus the lack of communication and transparency from JP and his team helped to dig down the future of this brilliant idea.\n\n(more info can be found on PC Gamer, RPS and other gaming sites)\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR    -   A fantastic "potential", tossed out after terrible money  management, lack of communication and transparency. Game is fun, but get boring after some time as you will feel things are missing or unfinished.\n\n\n\nRecommendation:\n\nGo play Prison Architect or Rimmworld instead, those are a lot of fun and devs update those games and their community very often. Or Theme Hospital, great classic tycoon and have a free mod that makes it HD.","October 27, 2014","false","104.2"," 75 of 81 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","75","81","0","0"

This game is overpriced, unfinished and, worst of all, abandoned. The argument that not enough people bought the title to warrant continued development is a silly one, as most people tend to wait for a title that is at least playable before purchasing, no doubt explaining the poor sales. On top of that, they will not be offering refunds, and complaining about the people who did not purchase, Double Fine are just providing an extra slap in the face to those that did.\n\nThere was so much potential here, but as it stands the AI is a mess & it isn't possible to prioritise tasks so DF-9  becomes an exorcise in frustration.  You may find yourself wanting to create a turret to defend against incoming raiders, but because you can't tell your builders to do so, they'll continue to build a room before the turret and by the time they've finished it's too late and your whole base has been destroyed.\n\nRaiders are also occasionally very overpowered, a raider single handedly killed everybody in my base because all of my crew members seemed to just flap about and let themselves die.\n\nEven if you get round these issues, there simply isn't enough to do to warrant a purchase, especially at the frankly ridiculous price of £18.99. I will never buy another Double Fine title again. If you'd like to see an Early Access title that never deserted its backers and continues to get more and more brilliant by the day, try Project Zomboid. It's being made by friendly, helpful developers and is 3 times cheaper than this one for at least 10x the content.","October 9, 2014","false","7.7"," 69 of 73 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","69","73","0","0"

As a fan of the genre, I'm generally willing to look over minor flaws in base-building games, and when I first fired up Spacebase DF-9, I'll admit I let the excitement of building a space-station get the better of me.  Now, countless hours in, I find myself pinching the bridge of my nose in frustration and dissappointment everytime I boot the game up.\n\nThe game begins by mousing over an imaginary galaxy to find an area to establish a new space-base.  While I dreamed of building my own Deep Space 9 or Babylon 5 at an optimal location, I found that I needed to spend 5 full minutes dragging my mouse around the galaxy map looking for an ideal location.  Rather than allowing the player to set start parameters, the designers force you to hunt the 2D galaxy map for 4 varying starting conditions, consisiting of generally unclear parameters.  Sure, levels of mining materials, a threat level, and a proximity to a warp gate seemed to make sense since I was a sci-fi fan, but through different playthoughs, they had only small differences.  The final and fourth parameter, Magnetic Interference, remains unclear.  This is because none of these parameters are ever explained, even during the tutorial.\n\nOnce the game begins, regardless of the parameters selected, the player has but a few minutes to build a basic base before the three astronuats supplied run out of air to breath.  They must be assigned tasks, which, at first are dictated by necessity, and later by NPC prefence, which is shown via an assignment screen using varying degrees of happy and sad faces.\n\nThe problem with building a basic base is that your resources are so low, no matter what world parameters you set, that you need to be near absolute barebones.  There is very little room for error.  Of course, once basic resources, like air, food and the ability to create building material are met, a player can always expand, and sometimes with ease.  But, this is where bugs, even in version 1.03 begin to appear.\n\nI've had my start point pressed up against materials which have made it extremely difficult to start a base.  I've had one of my 3 vital NPCs get caught on what little terrain there is at the start.  NPCs get caught inside fully constructed rooms until you place a door, which usually isn't bad, unless you go pet your cat for 30 seconds and then look up to find everyone dead.\n\nOr, in my last three games in a row, which inspired this review, have NPC's get stuck in terrain that was under construction, rendering the game a death sentence.  Since there is only one save, this requires a new base, which in turn requires mousing over the 2D galaxy for 5 minutes to find starting parameters...\n\nOnce a player has a basic base up and running, the game begins to punish it much too soon.  Incoming asteroids, disease, incoming asteroids, raiders, incoming asteroids, and NPC incompatibilty all appear just a 4 or 5 rooms into the base.  Did I mention that incoming asteroids will hit your base and ALWAYS target vital systems?\n\nOnce a base is established, NPCs start getting sad, angry or upset.  They all have demands.  Nobody knows how to please those demands.  I even doubt the developers know.  I have never found a correlation between the limited items I can place and NPC happiness.  I try to supply them with, say, Monitors.  What do Monitors do?  I have no idea.  Are Monitors cosmetic?  Do they increase Happiness?  Do they decrease stress?  No one knows.\n\nIn summation:  The game works.  It does some basic stuff.  But, I get so frustrated everytime I bring myself to give the game a 8th or 9th chance than I'd rather watch watch seconds tick by.  Furthermore, I'd like to say that my faith in Double Fine is rattled - a company that once did no wrong has now done wrong.","November 7, 2014","false","26.8"," 62 of 63 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","62","63","0","0"

I loved dwarf fortress, psychonauts was amazing, what could go wrong?\n\nI bought the early access copy since it was Double Fine, these guys are gamers, they get it, they wont mess this up.\n\nWell the could be lazy and greedy and  just release half finished ♥♥♥♥ when they get bored thats what.\n\nThis could have been a truly amazing game. Instead it is a half finished idea, you can still see the  whiteboard brainstorm session.\n\nZones? Incomplete. Progress? Nonexistant. It is a  gesture at dwarf fortress in space but instead of living up to their studios name they just ♥♥♥♥ed off when the cash grab was done.\n\nEvery time I logged into this game I said to myself "okay, still a lot of huge problems, but Double Fine will fix it and eventually this is going to be the next iteration of dwarf fortress. I cant wait to see where this goes."\n\nI said that every time I played this game for a few hours, dealing with horrendous AI was okay because hell, its still alpha. They will fix it.\n\nI logged into steam today, saw that it was 1.0 and was thrilled. Oh my to go to 1.0 the AI must finally be good! They must have fixed all the hilarious behaviour where a guy repairs an oxygen recycler and then freaks out and dies, finally i can play a base that wont just come undone due to insane citizens after a few hours! Great!\n\nI created a new base and was horrified to see the exact same ♥♥♥♥ing problems that made the alpha quite literally unplayable. The citizen ai will guarantee your base will fall apart after a few hours.\n\nNo matter how smart your contstruction, no matter how carefully you manage the base, some collection of events WILL occur and wipe your base out. And it will be because of the ♥♥♥♥ AI. like telling people to repair a hull breach but instead they all just run around and suffocate. Or when a base adds on to yours and you explore it but then your whole base thinks it would be cool to explore and then they all suffocate and die. My favorite one so far was a guy who refused to build a door to get out of a room even after making him a builder and watching him starve to death, which caused the entire base to become depressed and stop repairing things so the base falls apart.\n\nThis is infuriating and flatly unacceptable\n\nI will never buy another game that has Tim Schafer in the building, and I will never purchase another Double Fine game. if this is how they want to play the game, fine. ♥♥♥♥ them.","October 29, 2014","false","26.7"," 66 of 70 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","66","70","0","0"

It’s in space, that part they finished pretty early on. The entire everything else part, the parts that involve managing a large, complex and interrelated system of many smaller systems all working together and against each other, that part they didn’t quite finish. Much of what was promised for Spacebase DF-9 was dropped just before release (the game had been in Early Access for about a year now). The game was given a half-decent tutorial, opened up so users could modify and “finish” the game themselves, and a few meta-goals were added to give the experience a bit of structure.\n\nSo what you’re left with is something that so painfully looks like the start of something great but then never actually goes there.  You can build your base, take on space immigrants, juggle their needs and desires, fend off raiders and explore derelicts that may appear. But it all feels pointless, unless you chase the arbitrary goals the team shoved in at the last minute, like “have a base with X amount of denizens”. It’s a pity the game didn’t get more support in Early Access, as a lack of interest from consumers is why Double Fine claims to have dropped the project.","November 29, 2014","false","2.4"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","53","58","0","0"

It would be inappropriate for me to speculate where the money that was donated to funding the project went to or what it was actually used for but if the state of the game is an indication it wasn't allocated where it should have been.\n\nThe only reason you might consider paying money for this is if you are a skilled modder and want to prove your ability to the gaming industry.  It would be very impressive if you could create a release worthy program out of this monument to mediocrity.

Billed as Dwarf Fortress in space, with the lofty promises of away team missions and much much more. This game is now being released with barely any content and over a year spent making it barely playable and none of the interesting promises of the roadmap. On top of that they managed to cash in on it not once, not twice but three times. With the Amnesia Fortnight Bundle people actually paid money for the concept to be developed. Then with the kickstarter, people paid the money for the game to be developed. And with early access on steam, people actually paid for these devs to lead extravangant lifestyles. They're software designers in San Fransisco. THey are geniuses. You've gotta tease that genius out with sweet tens of thousands of dollars.

Why not just tell us "Sorry, we didn't get enough money to continue development, but here's what we'll do - giant bugfix/polish patch, release sourcecode. We hope you guys can make the game we couldn't afford to!" That would at least have had the respect for the players and Early Access supporters that seems "right" to me. Deleting the old "roadmap" seems particularly dishonest at this point as well.\n\nHowever, that's just me with my silly morals and standards and respect and honesty. I don't have to run a business and make decisions like "let's pretend this is great when it's actually crap." Sorry, DoubleFine, but you've managed to massively damage my opinion of you with the way you're handling this. I know you're just publishing GangBeasts, but there's now NO WAY I'm putting money into that until it's actually finished. And if too many people feel that way, will it stagnate and suffer the same fate as DF-9?\n\n-----\n\nI'll try to make an update to this review once the so-called-1.0 version comes out, and see if it's actually some working skeleton of a game.\n\nAs it is now, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME AT ANY PRICE.\n\nIt simply does not work as a game. Stuff happens and your base will die, and there's nothing you can do about it. Just after the latest patch version, I lost an entire base to one raider, because the security team was either standing around and getting shot, or running away (and getting shot). None of them ever bothered to attack the intruder. Not even once. Your base will catch fire from asteroid impacts and your inhabitants will gleefully panic-run right into the flames and die, instead of grabbing the fire extinguishers you've placed across the base and actually doing something constructive. Someone will decide that they absolutely need to do floor pushups right in your airlock door, and then everybody will suffocate to death.\n\nThese things are quite forgivable in an alpha game. Frustrating, but understandable. It's alpha, I get it. Things might be broken or unfinished. I'm fine with that. But if ANY of this crap manages to slip into the 1.0 release? That's just garbage.\n\n(Edit: Apparently The S-Word is too raunchy for a review. Sigh.)\n\n----\n\n1.01 Update\n\nIt has improved nothing at all.\n\nNo. I absolutely do not recommend. It continues to just not work. I started two bases today after the 1.01 patch, the one designed to "finish" the game. I see no significant improvements. Build orders are randomly followed, regardless of importance. Citizens start "running away" for no obvious reason. Random station boarding parties still utterly annihilate you base regardless of the number of security personnell you have assigned. Security teams clearing derelicts still seem to think that actually shooting the hostiles is a silly concept.\n\nBut hey, at least now there's a tutorial! A rather unnecessary one, since the game mechanics are not at all complicated, and I felt were very obviously conveyed through normal play. The problem isn't the players misunderstanding the game mechanics - it's that the game simply doesn't f-ing work.\n\n----\n\nFinal Final recommendation:\n\nDO NOT PURCHASE THIS. EVER.\n\nSecondary recommendation:\n\nNever trust DoubleFine again. Only buy a product once it has been actually released, and you've tried it, and it actually works, and the community is being treated well. Do not give support (either financial or social) to companies that make bad decisions. And especially not companies that make bad decisions, then try to tell you how great their decisions actually were.","September 18, 2014","false","4.5"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","0"

What we got was a good and entertaining simulation that grows boring after a few hours, repetetive and chaotic. With too many downsides to really enjoy the game.\n\nSimple things like not being able to rotate items, or not being able to place specific items on two of the four walls (either due to the inability to rotate, the lack of graphics for the other two walls or other design failures are not known). Or like not having a better control over what is done well...\n\nIf you like games like this, play Prison Architect instead, it already contains easily three times as much, and their developer is doing a great job. And it costs less... this game would be a nice game for ten bucks, and if it's on sale, pick it up.

That left me down a person and made the early game much more difficult. In my second base, the seed pod didn't spawn and one of my colonists spawned stuck in part of an asteroid.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kirona/recommended/246090/","Kirona","Kirona","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kirona/","360 products in account","After playing for several hours, all I can conclude about this game is that it's excessively frustrating.\n\nFirst off, the tutorial lacks a lot of important information.  No mention that you have to build aesthetic stuff all over to keep up morale, no proper explanation of what most of the structures/objects do or why you should care about them.  I lost three bases to everyone flipping out on each other before I pulled up the (terribly-made) wiki and a starter's guide said to scatter cosmetic stuff everywhere to keep people happy.\n\nThe interface, while thematically good at first, gets very old very fast.  Every UI element is oversized, and everything flickers like an old TV set with every interaction, and everything has horizontal lines through it like an old computer monitor.  It gets grating and hard on the eyes rather quickly.  Event warnings on the right side of the screen can be minimized (usually), but not dismissed, even for minor alerts, or ones that no longer apply.\n\nYou have no direct control over the citizens of your station, which is fine, but it means that when they're all ignoring your orders - which happens fairly often - you can't do anything about it.  The closest you can get to controlling anyone is setting people to the "security" job and setting a beacon  - they'll jog over and stand near the beacon, but that's all you can do.  You can't prioritize commands, or set a "do this first" type thing on anything, so if you need a room built NOW, you have to go across the entire map and cancel every other build/dismantle task.  If things fall into disrepair, technicians take FOREVER to fix them - each time they work on something, they only improve it by a few percentage points, and then wander off again.  You also can't set anyone to do more than one task - a guy can build things, or repair things, but not both unless you constantly toggle his settings in the roster screen.\n\nRaiders and derelict ships spawn far too often and too regularly - it's not at all random.  If you don't get "security" to respond in time to raiders, your citizens will just wander through and drop one by one.  Seriously, multiple times I've lost almost my entire station's population to single raiders because nobody has the sense to run away when they're being shot at, or security gets there one at a time and just drops.\n\nA known bug (I'd say it's a bug, anyway) with derelict ships is that sometimes they'll just "drift away" with your people still on-board.  What this means is that the derelict despawns - taking your people with it.  This means you have to very quickly "claim" every part of the derelict to prevent that, at which point it's treated like part of your base - including constant alerts that it's not connected to the power grid, and citizens will wander over to it and just hang about, making it impossible to safely dismantle.  This also includes warnings about rooms on the ship not being tended to properly, even if you've already flagged everything to be dismantled for materials.  Heaven forbid you don't tend the garden on that ship you plan to scrap (by the way, it mentions this only in passing in the tutorial, but you NEED a garden - it provides food that doesn't eat through your resources like the food-dispenser does.  And you need a bar with full facilities to serve/store that food properly - also only hinted at).\n\nResearching new technologies/illnesses isn't discussed at all in the tutorial, nor does it say how gardens work, or what to do with incapacitated-but-alive raiders.  It doesn't talk about building a brig, or whether you can ever do anything with these raiders - you only find out on third-party guides that EVENTUALLY these raiders can convert to citizens if they're confined long enough.  And your own citizens will freely wander through the brig, even if occupied, and get injured/killed by captured raiders.\n\n"Passing ships" also happen like clockwork, and get spammy.  The sense of humor in all the dialogue is great and everything, but it wears thin after the 200th ship in a 2-hour session, especially since most of the somewhat-limited encounter types seem to play out the exact same way every single time - either they give you more citizens, or they send raiders.  If you tell them to go away, they either go away, send citizens anyway, or send raiders anyway.  And you almost always know exactly what it'll be the moment it pops up.  Passing ships also turn off timelapse - you'll be going along at 4x speed to get something built, then it pops back to 1x so you can tell some guy to bugger off because you have no more room for more people.  And he may still send more citizens, in which case you have to quickly build beds/rooms for them to stay in or they'll start throwing tantrums and send station morale into the toilet.\n\nI'm sure there are other issues I've forgotten to mention, but I think this gives a decent idea of how obnoxious this game is to play in general.","January 4, 2015","false","6.3"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","0"

Releasing the source code is kind of nice, and at the same time is quite useless in itself.\n\nThis is a game which was "prototyped" in a fortnight. Which meant it was written on a language enabling quick prototyping. In this particular case, Lua, which I don't think is precisely the best programming language to develop a project so ambitious as this one was sold to us as being. What sold me the early alpha back in October 2013 was the vision. If I knew the vision was backed by that, ehm, questionable technological foundations, well, certainly my scepticism about the whole enterprise would have been higher.\n\nOn the other hand, the writing was on the wall for all of us to see. The development team promised monthly major updates and a continuous stream of bug fixes between updates. That development wasn't going quite right for this title was obvious when those updates started to lack regularity, at some point after February 2014, right after the "Amnesia Fortnight".\n\nIndeed, Double Fine seemed to forget about this one, since the fortnight turned out to be a couple months. Since then there have been "major updates", but to be honest, I am not sure that the new features added since May are that interesting, well thought out or functional, as the "backbone" of the game. Which I now reckon hadn't changed much between February 2013 and February 2014.\n\nI'll look forward to the source code release. It will be good to see how things were implemented, and probably will inspire others to take up the concept. It will also, to be blunt, allow to rewrite the f*cking thing using tools actually meant for this kind of job (say Unity and C#, or Unreal/Cry Engines and C++). In that sense, hats off to the devs of Spacebase DF-9 and to Double Fine for putting this into the public domain.\n\nOf course, this last paragraph will only make sense to people like me, who understand and appreciate the real hackers' ethics.\n\nWhat I don't appreciate at all is that this comes out of the blue, without saying a "we're sorry but the early access revenue wasn't enough to support development". Which would have been a very a straight way to approach the community, without giving excuse to people to think that they have been duped. I also see some astroturfing going on: it seems like some community management person is trying very hard to spray a giant smiling emoji on top this. And failures like this one are sad.\n\nSo I'd say that Double Fine doesn't deserve a sale of this title unless\n\nYou appreciate the release of the source code to the public domain as an inherently good thing.\nYou look forward to someone to take up the torch and actually take this ball all the way to the touchdown line.\nIf you're just interested in a game that you can play now and you can get value for money, just stay away, and look out for that rewrite I mention above.\n\nDISCLAIMER: if the source code turns out to come out with a very restrictive license, i.e. one that prevents people from doing what I suggest above, then I'll be sure to come back to this review and use very different terms.","September 18, 2014","false","7.8"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","0"

The game was apparently reliant on early access funding and didn't sell enough copies to continue development past an extremely barebones set of features. Not sure why Double Fine decided on an extremely risky business model.\n\nIt's worth noting that I haven't been able to play for more than about an hour without some kind of show-stopping bug as of the patch before they call the game complete. The AI is dreadful and has a habit of doing the worst thing possible, like suffocating when there's a working airlock and oxygen generators. It's not very likely that all of the issues will be tidied up in the month or so they had left on development.\n\nIt's a genuinely great idea and with another year or so of dev time I could really see it shaping up to be worth the money.

Previously I had recommended it while it was in early Alpha.  In early Alpha, I did recommend it because it showed great promise and looked like it was going to be improved greatly as development continued.  As it was Double Fine - I had high hopes.  Admittedly, I probably shouldn't have gotten my hopes up for any game that is early access.  I highly encourage you to buyer beware for any early access games you may wish to fund in the future.\n\nA note on the current status of Spacebase DF-9: It is considered, by the developers, to be complete enough for a full release.  Currently they're bug squashing and finishing some other small details on their development list.  That's it.  They're done after that.  There will be no future development done to this game for the foreseeable future, according to the developers.  They may not get back to it for at least 2 years, at minimum.  Buyer beware.\n\nOn to the review:\n\nI have only played it for about 2 hours since it's official release.  While it still retains the charm and brutal difficulty as most games of this genre (ala Dwarf Fortress), there hasn't been that much added since the last builds of the early access Alpha.\n\nThe graphics are passable, the sounds are passable, the text and artwork definitely has the Double Fine touch that many love and enjoy.  The actual game play and game design is a hollow shell, crying for more.  Should you survive for at least an hour to hour and a half, you will have built everything that is needed.  The rest of the game is simply adding more space for more crew members, taking care of their needs, fighting off the occasional raider/parasite, researching the lack-luster tech tree, and preparing for the “end game” fight with the raider mega-fleet (which also completes the game; I believe).  I'm unsure if the raider mega-fleet actually ends the game or just scores you as I simply got too bored waiting for the mega-fleet to show up.  I built everything I wanted, I raided derelicts for tasty materials, and I threw the troublemakers in my station in a brig or two.  Not to mention dealt with some of my own bugs that are still hanging around since the Alpha builds.\n\nAmongst some of the issues with the game: No varied save slots for more than one base at a time, vague tutorial, unrealized or fully implemented concepts, inability to clean up blood stains (at least no way I have found out), questionable fairness (random spikes in difficulty or events that have no lead up; bad things just happen and they're absolutely devastating), and AI having no way to prioritize important tasks (so they just stand around building the room while they suffocate instead of building the single oxygen recycler they need to survive).\n\nElaborating on the unrealized/fully implemented concepts: There are a great deal of the beginnings of production chains, rooms, etc. - But they're just lacking.  All those things you would normally build in other games to fully flesh-out a production chain just aren't there.  You just build a room and get the end product immediately.  For example, instead of building a whole bunch of different machines and making an actual factory that takes raw ore, crushes it, purifies it, refines it, and then makes it into usable construction components – You just get a single shot “matter” resource that you use for everything.  The developers didn't want the game to be too bogged down in these systems, but you never need more than one type of room with their setup.  There's not enough décor for the rest of your base, so you're just stuck with single blocked out rooms at a minimum size to hold just what you want and that's it.  It just leads to boring designs and an uninteresting base to look at.  It's visually boring.\n\nIf you're dying for another Dwarf Fortress game, set in space – I highly recommend checking out Rimworld or even looking into Gnomoria for your Dwarf Fortress needs.  Let this derelict game drift away.","November 10, 2014","false","6.7"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

In its Alpha build, DF9 AI was rudamentary. It made bad, often comically bad decisions, and it was like watching a child grow and interact with a world we knew it would adapt to. Like parents, we told our friends the marginally interesting tales of how the children stopped to chit-chat about Moonbeef and whatever while oxygen recyclers caught fire and firefights happened around them. And it was funny because we assumed that it would improve with time, development, and attention.\n\nThen DF noticed. They thought this is where the charm of the game came from, and they pulled the plug. Our AI children stopped growing, and were now going to stay stupid. "You enjoyed the stupid AI", they say, "and now that's where we decided to leave it."\n\nWe enjoyed the AI because it was temporary and had some amusing quirks in its broken state. Being forced to deal with the game in the shape that it's in is not fun.

It has been rushed to "completion" after the developer failed to deliver promised monthly updates and supposedly ran out of cash. They returned their original investor's cash mind you, but they banked on using gamer's (Early Access) cash to subsidize the development, greatly overestimating the monthly sales for an unfinished piece of garbage. Maybe if they had kept up with updates it would have sold better, that seems to have been key in most other successful Early Access titles.\n\nThe greatness of the game's concept (found at http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054131/http://spacebasedf9.com/devplans) pales in comparison to the terrible nature in which this games development and budgeting was handled.

While not a deep as initially promised, there was still a good amount of things to do, and I could imagine just maintaining a large base over an extended period of time would keep me pleasantly occupied. Sadly, the final release is riddled with bugs and is not balanced very well, making it impossible to play beyond the initial stages of the game. The developers have said they will provide patches for the game, but thus far their updates have done little to improve the faults with the game and seem to have spawned new bugs. It is hard to imagine that they will have the time to actually fix the game properly given their claim to have run out of funding and their stated desire to wrap up support within a couple of weeks. At this point, avoid this game.\n\nUPDATE: It's now February and support for this game including bug fixes is officially over. Update 1.6 was DoubleFine's last patch, and they have stated on their own forums that no one is working on patches anymore. The above review applies to patch 1.6. This game has too many bugs and balance issues to warrant purchase.","November 1, 2014","false","22.8"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

DF stated that it simply wasn't making enough money to warrant continued development and from a gamer's perspective, there's not much of a game to warrant purchasing, especially at the $25 price range. What we have here is a stalemate in which both parties lose. Gamer's lose money and the developer loses face.\n\nAs it stands, Spacebase DF-9 does let you create a base and manage some resources, it does have some random events to throw at a player so that the game isn't completely boring however, there are no end game type things to work towards, no objectives to ultimately strive towards.  In five hours, a player can pretty much run into everything the game offers and after that, the game will just keep repeating itself.\n\nThe lack of gameplay issue is compounded by the fact that the beta phase of game testing is being skipped over entirely.  DF is going to tack on a tutorial, wrap up some issues and then release the code in hopes that modders will run with their..un-game and make it better.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a game that was to be in continuous development over the next five years with gameplay tweaks and additions is now kicked out the door in its current shape. I guess in space, no one can hear you break promises.","October 10, 2014","false","3.4"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","2"

(Offline play, that's why the hours don't match up.)\n\nI purchased this game very early on at a reduced price around $10 or so and at that time it seemed tottally worth it. What was promised seemed awesome and backed by a developer I actually liked how could it go wrong? Well it sorta did and didn't. The game had serious bugs like:\n\nBeing wiped out within 1-10 minutes by a parasite\nBeing wiped out within 1-10 minutes by raiders\nSave files being deleted\nGame crashing\nOverall difficulty\nPoor performance\nNo direction/Story/Lore\nNo basic tutorial (now in game)\nPromised missing core features\nNo really settings\n\nWhile I won't get into specifics a simple google search can easily confirm every one of these points. While some of the perforamce issues have been fixed, gameplay "bugs" still remain. It is incredibly frustrating to spend hours building a large base when within seconds, Because of derpy AI or crazy strong raiders/parasites/space debri, everything you built is gone with no real feeling of acomplishment and a feeling of being cheated by the game. Right now $20 is a crazy high price to sell this game at, especially when starting a new game could last a handfull of minutes to several hours after being cheated and killed. I really hope this game gets some serious gameplay options and core function updates soon.

Leaving that aside I wanna focus purely on the game, that I got bundled in a Humble Bundle when it was still Alpha and played several times until its current version.\n\nThe premise and style of the game seemed enticing to me: Build and manage a space station with room for crew and their needs. I like space and sci-fi settings, plus the whole base-management had a Theme Hospital-like feel to it, which was also a great and creative game.\n\nSo I started out in space and began building. The game doesn’t offer a campaign, you basically free-build and manage your base from scratch. After a few basic rooms for living quarters, refining asteroids and oxygen supply your base begins to take shape. An intercom window pops up: other space drifters saw my station and want to join my effort. Randomized events like this keep things interesting and challenging. Not all encounters are friendly and you need to be ready for intruders - or pay the costs.\n\nThe building and managing is fun and keeps me entertained: There are some fun ideas in Spacebase DF-9 that I really like. Your base-dwellers for example post about their wants and needs in their social media “Spaceface”, where you can read how they feel and if they are happy with their occupation. The rooms and objects have good ideas that tie into each other: Plants can not only produce food but also oxygen. The food you produce can be brought into the pub for cooking. When fire breaks out you can not only use fire extinguishers but you can also cut off the oxygen supply to a room - though this usually takes longer and damages your equipment.\n\nAll these ideas and concept sound fun - on paper. In the game however they can get buggy and very frustrating. The power management for example can get very messy as the only data I have is a bunch of colorful lines across your base. I don’t see how much reach a generator has and how much power is being drawn. New derelicts appear out of nowhere that are so close to my base that my building plans are screwed. And several times my crewmembers kill themselves by simply staying in space until their oxygen runs out or not fleeing a empty vessel that runs out of oxygen. This is very frustrating and something that doesn’t feel like its the players fault. The build-queue is also not very clear as my crew builds rooms but just doesn’t make time to build the door that would connect them - ordering them useless.\nAll in all Spacebase DF-9 is a game that had great promise but will never live up to it because bugs ruin the experience. I tried, I spent the time to build a big base and train my crew to fight back an alien invasion - but when the same men later just suffocate by standing in an room without oxygen, I just feel like its not my fault, its the games. And I don’t want to play it any more.","January 2, 2015","false","12.1"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

This game also has a large amount of game-breaking bugs, which are not fun and will kill everyone in your base. Sadly now that it is officially released these will probably not be fixed.\n\nThings to enjoy: SPAAAAAAAACE. Also base building, planning, and generally keeping everybody happy, fed, and safe.\n\nThings to hate: Terrible AI. This includes having all your technicians/Miners/Scientists/etc go to a raider ship to pick up an item they want... and then being killed by raiders. It's like watching lemmings. Speaking of raiders, they have a tendency to outmatch even the toughest of 5v1 battles with your security forces. Other things to look out for are Builders bothering to install some more flooring, taking a break, and then suffocating to death because they forgot to build some air recyclers before taking said break.\n\nWhat this game needs: Able to queue up actions, or prioritize building. Being able to tell your citizens to STAY AWAY from scary people in scary spaceships. Or fires. Or vacuums. Theres a lot of room for both necessary, and quality of life AI improvements.

Unfortunately AI continues to be the cripple point that can turn a thriving colony into a pirate laden junkyard. I am very close to giving this game a positive review if they can stop crew from running off to derilicts and asphixiating.\n\n04/11/14: With the release of 1.03 this has fixed up the lack of PROC and the game is now functional. Gameplay is now the issue and the AI acts in ways that will destroy you finely crafted society in minutes (like wandering of to a low oxygen area and dying). Hopefully they will now be able to refine and eliminate these problems. I stil hold out hope for the game, but those who are frustrated by AI stupidity may want to avoid this game.\n\n01/11/14: Those who remember fondly Space Colony will also be fond of this game; at least until the subtle and confusing "bugs" start appearing. In this, the game presently plays like a beta. Playable, but with niggling issues. An example is a continual warning that some sections lack power, yet my base is entirely connected and reactor areas report low energy usage of X/Y. I currently am playing v1.02 and ships (increasing population) just stop coming at about mid game so ending the game at midpoint. Also there is no save games listing: it's one game and perma-death. Hopefully they will address these issues with bug fixes or better in game help.\n\nUnfortunately, according to the annoucement by Double-Fine (http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/10/29/sad-space-party-spacebase-df-9-leaves-early-access/), they spend too much money on this game and have ceased development and opened it to the community. There will be some critical bug fixes (like ships that stop coming, I hope) but no more content or systems (like changing resolution or rotating isometric view). Perhaps the Steam community can save this game where the developers failed.\n\nI'd like to see the game succeed, but it is not fully playable just yet.

I will still from time to time come onto this game to pass the time and play on it for a few hours but despite having it as an early access game they decided that they would cease production of the game and keep it out on Steam and ask for a high price despite it hardly being finished. To make it look more appealing they dropped the game by a few bucks but in all honesty this game is worth about £4.00/$6.00 max if that!. This review is aimed at informing you all that this game is no where near finished, has many bugs to it and won't get finished as the developers ceased production and said "we will leave it to the modding community". Was a huge disappointment for me as this had so much potential and after the first two weeks that i got this game and played it a lot they announce on Steam that they are ceasing production of this game. 4/10.

The only way to fix this is the reclaim the damaged equipment and build it again. This is totally STUPID.

They will destroy half your base, kill as many crew as they can and then eventually hopefully be subdued but some passing person as your whole security team run around them doing nothing.\n- Invincible aliens that wipe out your crew, eventually your security team turn up one by one and get killed off. Restart game.\n- Space debris damages a reactor and take out the power, nobody repairs it, builders take ages to get to it to reclaim it, will not build a new one as they are freaking out about oxygen.

Isn't it a bit disgusting that Double Fine is the curator for their own project?\n\nAnyway it's a bare bones Space Building game in the vane of Dungeon Keeper, Theme Hospital and Startopia. You build stuff and people rather stupidly suffocate in Space because you can't give people a slight nudge in the right direction to avoid their terrible deaths. The AI is very stupid, and the Building is a very bare. Worse yet is how much DF are asking for, while it's not quite the price of a AAA title, it's by no means cheap either which is yet again is another reason to be critical because what you're buying doesn't add up to £20/$30 worth of content. And to add salt to a fatal wound? DF have decided to just straight up ignore Beta stage and release the game into 1.0, that's right a full version from Alpha where there's been a startling lack of updates throughout it's year of development. Poor show.\n\nAfter the jump into V1.0, my impressions are still disappointing. The game is not fun to play, the citizens now know how to not suffocate stupidly but their prioties are extremely messed up. The UI is counter intuitive and really clumsy and hideous as a result, the game is unimpressive visually and you'll find that the game doesn't do enough to hold your attention.\n\nThis is further signs that money should not be given to DoubleFine, a company who do not deliver on their promises.","October 4, 2014","false","1.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

You don't control the citizens directly, but instead you put down work orders, and the citizens will handle it on their own.  You sketch out rooms and order furniture and so on and your citizens place it.\n\nThe first few mintues of the game were a lot of fun for me.  You're kicked out of your life support pod drifting in deep space and have to build a little self sustaining environment with an airlock and some life support systems before your citizens run out of air (about 5 mins).  This was an encouraging first glance for me, because it's pretty hard and will probably require a few resets if you don't know what you're doing, and the systems seemed interesting and complex.  Eventually, though, I figured it out and started branching out, putting up a refinery to allow my miners to mine nearby asteroids, using the materials to build a residence and a bar and a garden and a lab and stock it with furniture.\n\nAnd then the game ended.\n\nI don't mean it dumped me to a "game over" screen or anything, there just wasn't anything left to do.  Once you've got a half dozen rooms down and functioning, which takes maybe an hour, there's nothing else you can do except wait for your science team to sloooooowly research some unnesescary upgrades, or maybe have your security team scrap with some raiders (note that this isn't an RTS, combat in this game is just a matter of setting a point for your security team to defend and maybe they will if they're not on break or hungry or tired or sad).  Sometimes a derelict will show up and you can... well, tear it down, nothing else to do with them really.\n\nIf you've ever played Dwarf Fortress, basically imagine that game but with no workshops.  You can make rooms and designate areas and place furniture, but there's no crafting system, no economy, no trade, resources are all boiled down to a single currency which is used to buy everything from walls to furniture.  The game just has no depth at all, and it's competing with some of the most complex and deepest simulations on the market right now.\n\nThe devs seem to have responded to this by ramping up the challenge, which makes things a bit frustrating.  Colonies can die from parasites before you get a doctor, waves of raiders can annihilate an underequipped security force, and once things start to fail, it's pretty much a chain reaction to an abandoned base.  Colonists freak out and refuse to do their jobs so vital equipment isn't maintained or repaired so colonists freak out even harder and things just spiral downward.  For example, if the air supply gets low, colonists will freak out rather than do their jobs, so if the area with the life support systems has air problems, you can't ever fix it because whoever goes in there is going to panic instead of fixing the air generator, and the problems get worse.  And this doesn't really do much to fix the problem with the game being short, because once you've got whatever it is you need to counter them, then they're not that big a deal.\n\nThe 1.0 update added a lot of nice features, but the game still has serious issues with longevity.  There are still occasional glitches with draw order and some AI issues, but the game works pretty well mostly.  I've only played a bit, but pathing does seem improved and the interface does make things clearer now.\n\nI don't want to sound excessively negative, this isn't the worst game ever.  I had a lot of fun with it.  It's just really short, and the asking price is kind of high.  On sale, for $5, I'd say this is a good deal.  At full price, I don't think it's worth it.  I'd recommend looking at something like Startopia or Space Colony or grabbing something like Gnomoria or Dwarf Fortress if you're not in love with the sci-fi aesthetic.

That's just pathetic behaviour. Small indie studios get crucified for that kind of thing, let alone a bigger established studio like DoubleFine. As a bonus they put it on a big steam sale a week before announcing the end of development, just so new buyers felt extra shafted. They tried to buy some goodwill back by giving purchasers a free copy of Hack n Slash, as well as by putting out tools for modders and asking the community to finish the game for them(!), but buyer beware. This game was halted a brief way into development and never even remotely came close to being a releasable product.

The developers at Doublefine were on a roll with a great game, and out of nowhere cancelled the project without finishing the game due to funding issues. Not to mention they didn't even open up Steam workshop support so Steam users could finish it for them.\n\nThe worst part is that it was a fun game a couple versions before Doublefine abandoned the project. However, when they abandoned the project they released a final patch that sends swarms of raiders to attack your base so frequently you can't build, and your citizens are constantly sad or angry. It's unplayable now because you can't send your citizens outside your base to build,mine,explore,etc without them being killed. And I'll point out that this is in the Extremely Low threat areas of the galaxy map. To me this seems like a final insult to all of the people who paid good money for what was a good game.\n\nI for one will never purchase anything from Doublefine again, and I can't see how this could fix their "funding" issues because the PR nightmare of this game has killed their reputation.

It might have been just that, had it not been developed by Double Fine.\n\nUnfortunately, Tim Schafer thinks that Early Access exists to test the waters rather than to operate as a platform for developers without solid capital. They honestly wanted to develop this game for 5 years. 5 years. And Tim says since the game isn't bringing in enough money on early access that they're going to have to push it out as 1.0 with most of the features on the devplan unfinished.\n\nSo Tim honestly thought that they were going to make profit on an unfinished game for five years. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the CEO of Double Fine. That's the man that couldn't finish a point and click adventure for 3.3 million.\n\nI've got some advice for you, Tim. And it comes from Gabe Newell.\n\n"Do not focus on anyone but your customers. Your reputation will follow you forever so always be fair to your customers, and certainly one thing you need to always remember is that your customers are not going to be fooled. Some people think they can get away with something and just hope people won't see through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The internet is way smarter than any of us."\n\nYou've been exchanging your reputation as a game developer in for cash, and given your recent default on Spacebase DF-9 it is with regret that I must inform you that we, the gaming community and responsible consumers, can no longer extend your line of credit.\n\nThe next time you want to build a game, like oh, say, Dear Leader, don't come to the community with your hand stuck out and nothing for collateral but promises.\n\nI feel bad for the people who worked on this game. Who wanted it to be something more only to have its legs cut out from under it because it wasn't a profitable Early Access game. To be honest, the updates were too far apart. Of course no one was buying it. It took too long to see progress, and your behavior and glibness on Twitter and other formats has been intolerable.\n\nSorry, Tim. You can't ride the success of Psychonauts, Day of the Tentacle, and Full Throttle forever. You could have been one of the greats, but instead you're going to end up like John Romero. Only John only screwed his fanbase over once, while you seem determined to make it the remainder of your career.\n\nDo not purchase this game. Do not purchase Dear Leader, an Amnesia Fortnight winner like Spacebase DF-9. Do not buy Costume Quest 2. If Tim Schafer comes onto Kickstarter and is like, "Hey, Psychonauts 2 - I need cash." Do not give him money. Double Fine cannot manage its finances, and has abused a system that was put here to help unestablished developers as a way to decide whether they should bother to finish a game based upon its profitability before launch.","September 24, 2014","false","3.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I'd hoped it would resemble something like Prison Architect, and to an extent; Banished.

Taking into account this was in the easiest area of the game I could find.\n\nAfter multiple restarts (I've barely played a single playthrough for more than 30 minutes), I gave up.

You are put in charge of a few colonists to build, maintain and protect your own space station.\n\nPros: The game is easy to pick up on: you start with a power source, minerals and a handful of colonists whose first priority is to build a modest space station with oxygen supplies, and expand to a small variety of room types while mining and refining minerals. As your crew grows and time passes, additional needs will surface, needs that you must address or risk your crew to lose its temper. Derelict ships and additional travelers will want to join, some whether you like it or not, and you must deal with meteor showers, raiders and other threats, all the while researching better equipment.\n\nCons: There is a severe lack of variety in every way: Only a couple of room types with very little content or options, while general furniture offers a scarce selection. Travelers will often discard your rejection, and you quickly become over-populated. You barely have any control over crew morale. The game become repetitive as you are constantly facing the same issues: need more resource or oxygen/power, raiders come over to kill some of your crew, crew member goes berserk, rinse & repeat. Even tech research is rather limited.\n\nVerdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget it\n\nSpacebase DF-9 drops the ball. While not a bad game, it had the potential of being the next Space Colony, but doesn't come even close. Games of this genre require variety to make it interesting to build and grow, and this game doesn't have what it takes to give it the replay value it would need.\n\nP.S.: I do not recommend this game as it is offered on Steam. There is, however, a dedicated team of developers at http://spacebasehub.net who have taken it upon themselves to enhance the game and its content. There is still a long way to go, but should the game's potential actually come to fruition, my opinion of the game could change.\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","December 20, 2015","false","13.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

This video gives you a good idea of what the game is actually like to play as the narrator explores it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2G33jDCyc0\n\nA YouTube discussion by Total Biscuit. His discussion will not only tell you a bit about all the drama surrounding this game, but you’ll also see some of the gameplay. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAd8Ls8Mwl4\n\nGeneralFor what little it is now worth, I did enjoy playing the game and exploring the changes in each new Alpha update. This game had a lot of potential and was very exciting. With gorgeous artwork, a decent attempt at UI design, atmospheric music, and an absolutely delightful sense of humour, all of which contributed to an interesting universe of different species and way of life. But the fact remains that this game was abandoned, never finished properly, and at the time of writing can not be considered a complete game.\n\nThey did go in and include a tutorial for the game, and I was very impressed with the tutorial until it suddenly ended. Although it felt like it ended abruptly and too soon, I can see why they did limit the information provided. If they don’t leave you to figure out the other rooms and the way the spacebase generally functions then you would have played all there is to play of this game in the tutorial. Ultimately the tutorial just seems to highlight the lack of depth to the game.\n\nSpacebase has a rocky history so far, and I feel I really must include a discussion of this so that you can make an informed decision. However, as you will see with the format of my reviews, there are plenty of sections which allow me to consider the game for itself regardless of the surrounding drama.\n\nIn the interests of full disclosure: I was an early access purchaser, and yeah, I did get burned with this game. My experience with Spacebase truly set my mind to never buy an early access game ever again, no matter how wonderful it looks and tempting it seems. Nothing is a sure bet, and I will only be spending my money on finished products from now on. I can accept that I took a risk by purchasing an EA game and that it did not pan out in this case, but the end result is still a bad experience with Spacebase and Double Fine by extension. Things did get very dramatic, but I don’t think the company did a very good job of handling things. I’m not going to go on about it, so suffice it to say that I’m not an admirer of Double Fine any more. If you want more information regarding the drama I refer to, please check out TotalBiscuit’s discussion on the subject.\n\nGameplayThis is a base building game. You build a space station from basic building blocks (floors and walls) and zone different rooms. You fill those rooms with things like oxygen tanks, plants, beds, exercise equipment, tables, food, defence turrets, fire extinguishers, science labs, and matter converters. Mine asteroids to refine into matter, the basic building block/currency of the game in order to build everything else.\n\nThere isn’t exactly a tech tree to this game, and there aren’t any crafting recipes (although there is scientific research). It seems to be more about the simulation of how people interact with one another, but there are so many characters that join your base that it’s impossible to really follow many interactions in a very meaningful way. So I end up concentrating on building the base and trying to see just how big I can make it. Once you get a vast crew though, things start lagging up and the bugs start to get obvious. Ultimately you will find that there is an imposed limit on how big a base you can create and keep running not by design, but because (I'm afraid I must repeat) this game wasn't really completed.\n\nI really desperately wish that there was a blueprint function (like in prison architect) so that one could plan their base out before starting construction.\n\nControlsAlthough you can use the mouse to do everything, there are thankfully plenty of hotkeys. Some of them aren’t as intuitive as I might like, but I got used to them over the course of many hours of play. I found the camera controls to be fairly good, with my most appreciated camera functionality being the ability to pan around. It’s also always a plus to have a simple pause/start button to hit, which is good old spacebar.\n\nStorylineI can’t say there is much of a storyline. I think the original intention for the game was to immerse yourself in the lives of the different people on the base and sort of imagine your own story. However, there isn’t sufficient depth and breadth to the rest of the game to allow you to direct any sort of imaginary storyline. It was an interesting concept which didn’t really get developed or thought through well enough.\n\nSoundI really like the sound in this game. The music is quite atmospheric (appropriate to the universe they created) and interesting to listen to. It may get repetitive after a while, but it is more like it fades into the background of your awareness rather than becoming irritating. Meanwhile, the sound effects are pretty much functional, nothing much to warrant remark.\n\nGraphicsThe artwork in this game is really very good. It’s certainly got a specific style to it, however that style is stuck to throughout and that consistency helps to establish a weird and wonderful universe. I really only have good things to say about the graphics, it’s a shame that all this creative work is now trapped in the wrapper of the rest of the game. Alas.\n\nPros+ huge potential, great concept\n+ easy to read and navigate the UI\n+ gorgeous artwork\n+ interesting universe\nCons- EA = Early Abandonment\n- an unfinished game\n- no real end goal\n- not enough depth to make it a decent sandbox\n- still rather buggy\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

If you enjoy building something next to an angry toddler who destroys all your work randomly… then this mightbe a game for you. I've played it some hours now and found it quite frustrating. Even in the supposedly easier parts of the galaxy you can barely construct a base, at one point the game starts to throws masive waves of raiders - way more than the population of your base - against you. Just after you barely survived a couple of killerbots arrive. This might be something to handle and to enjoy if the games worked as intended. But you only have one "security" beacon (but probably about 6 differend intrusin locations) and if you are lucky the citizens respect the emergency alarms and the security comes to the beacon. one by one. to get slaughtered. But about half of the time they don't do anything when they arrive at the beacon.

The game is far from complete (and even further from what was promised), even though DoubleFine seems to think it will be from just adding a tutorial, wrap up the major bugs, and calling it "1.0".\n\nDF continues to look highly mismanaged, especially financially. E.g. Broken Age was supposed to work with $400k funding. They got six times that and still they "ran out of money" and had to release what they had as "Act 1" (i.e. "Incomplete game, part 1").\n\nThis was the last time I trusted DF to make a good game with my money. The only time DF is getting any money from me is if they've actually released the game with all its features, and even then I'll think twice if there's nothing better I can do with my money.

I think the price tag is what really bugs me and, personally, says a lot about the way the higher-ups at Double Fine truly feel about the whole situation.\n\nYeah, the whole rush to 1.0 is a bit of a joke and there won't be much to the vanilla full game. But to have the audacity to charge $25.00 in Early Access! And given that the time between now and its 1.0 release is mainly for bug fixing means you're not getting any more bang for your buck in terms of gameplay (i'm not sure a tutorial counts).\n\nThis game was gifted to me nearly a year ago and bought by the giver for about the price of a movie ticket. I got nearly 3 movies-worth out of it, so by that reckoning we're doing alright. That being said, I would be incredibly angry to have bought this for $25.00 only to find what the game holds (and more or less will hold at release). It all seems like "poor sportsmanship" on Double Fine's part. So your game lacks polish and contains less gameplay than some free Flash games; at least be honest about what it's worth.\n\nIn any case, post-"release" sales performance will, over time, likely drive the price to where it should be...somewhere around $5.","October 4, 2014","false","5.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

In the past I've held Double Fine in somewhat of a high regard, but this game just isn't very good at all, for a multitude of reasons.\n\nNamely, it is unfinished. It is abandonware. And yet DF have the gall to keep selling it. On top of this, there are people making mods in order to fix the game. This should not be necessary, and sends red flags from the get go.\n\nPlaying some of the game you immediately see that it has a very unfinished feel:\n\nThe controls are rather clunky, and there are quite a few problems with the graphics. I can't find out how to rotate the display, which means [as it's in an isometric view], lots of stuff are hidden and can't be easily accessed. Many of the elements end up 'overlaying' themselves on each other, evidence of problems in the graphics engine itself.\n\nThe gameplay is rather boring, frankly, and the game lacks flow. You're just dropped in without any real explanation of what the point is. Every now an then a passer by might interact with you with some, well, 'odd' dialogue is probably the nicest way to put it.\n\nThe sound design in this game is probably the best part, honestly. It has some nice background music.\n\nJust to TL;DR, Don't buy it, its a shambles.","May 4","false","3.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

And now it has done just that.\n\nI was surprised by how "polished" this game looked back when I first played it in one of the first alphas. The graphics and animations looked a lot more "expensive" than in similar games (mostly because they seem to be using 3D for everything while other games just use simple 2D sprites often with barely any animation), even the UI felt a bit overengineered.\n\nAt the same time the releases rarely addressed game-breaking bugs (e.g. airlocks being death traps) and frequently added seemingly arbitrary features that didn't really improve the gameplay other than giving players more bugs to worry about. I guess the project could be described as ambitious, but then again the same would be true for games like Prison Architect and Rimworld, both of which have been able to maintain some level of consistent narrative over a large number of releases (without needing to re-release every single version several times to provide hotfixes).\n\nSome reviewers have said DF made the mistake of treating a supposedly indie, crowd-funded project as if it were another big team big publisher triple-A title. I don't think anyone but the DF9 team can answer that, but it seems telling that a game that was already funded with half a million dollars within the first weeks of the open alpha and that was intended to be entirely financed by pre-release purchases/"backers" has managed to drain its entire budget within only six major releases. If the game needs more than this kind of cash just to make it to 1.0-as-intended, maybe DF shouldn't have attempted to follow through with this idea. If you're burning money, either find a potent investor who doesn't care, or cut down your development costs to a level where you can bootstrap the project without making f-you money.\n\nTo quote Robot Unicorn Attack: "Your dreams did not come true."","September 28, 2014","false","14.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I bought this for 99 cents and I still fell ripped off. sure, it looks okay, sure, it has it's atmosphere but the game doesn't understand what a "low chance of being raided" means. I played one game for ~4 hours today and I was actually starting to have fun. theeeen raider after raider after raider, waves of the scrublords killed my workers, so I had to assign people who were not workers.. they were murdered, eventually my security was killed off and everything fell to pot. This isn't a strategy game, this is an exercise in futility and it desperately needs fixing. (but its not being  developed any more, ohnooes) And if you think I'm just being salty over this, I moused over the galaxy and found the most ideal spot I could. (which is near the galactic center) I was looking for the easiest of easy modes to get my feet  wet before I tried any of the other areas. And it was decently easy! uuuntil the game decided to start throwing raiders at me like they were party favors. seriously, I couldn't even keep up with  the info box because it was all "hey, raiders. look, raiders. oh hey, guess what? raiders!" Maybe there's some sort of infinite loop, maybe there's some sort of size threshold that this happens at but I never even got my population to 40. On top of all of this I was unable to do any research, medical or tech related. I couldn't assign anyone to do anything like that even though I had a huge research bay with 16 or so research tables and at the peak, 4 scientists.\n\nAnd can we talk about unhappiness? nothing  I did seemed to help them, they'd just go off and sulk and get into fights n stuff. All in all,  not as bad as Kirk Cameron's Saving Xmas, nor is it anywhere as awful as Depression Quest, but it has some serious coding and feature-related issues that really need to be looked at (if not by DF, then by allowing 3rd party patches to fix it.)","December 6, 2015","false","4.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Even on the map selection there is no exit button just alt f4 out. There is a lot of bugs that create in game issues. Controls cannot be rebound.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaolinpear/recommended/246090/","shaolinpear","King of Sweden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaolinpear/","294 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEarly access brings the unfortunate risk of being burned and this game is the first one to have burned me badly enough to write a negative review.\n\nFirst of all, this is practically a demo that absolutely does not capture what makes this genre "fun". Generally the interesting thing about base building games is not about how you can create a utopia where nothing goes wrong, but how your base will eventually come to its inevitable end.\n\nSpacebase DF-9 fails to spark any continued enjoyment because of how quickly one can create a stable base without having to worry about anything bad ever happening. One playthrough was all it took to figure out all the kinks for the next time, where it is entirely possible to reach a state where everything simply balances itself out. This can be attributed to the fact that the game has a very short list of features.\n\nThe short list of rooms have an incredibly short list of items one can add to it, so constructing a base on the second playthrough provides almost the exact same experience. It is not surprising how shallow this game feels compared to other games from the genre, even before you are hit by the realization that the learning curve is really just a horizontal line.\n\nThe random events and the citizens "dynamic" behavior do not add a lot of variety, which is something that also quickly realized as you build your base. Understanding the patterns of the short list of events the game throws at you does not take a lot of figuring out, which is not surprising given the fact that you can count these on one hand. To make things even worse, any negative event that can happen is easily preventable with the aforementioned short list of items at your disposal.\n\nThe only challenging element this game presents, is the incredibly stupid AI that is set on destroying itself as early as building the very first airlock for the base. God help them if they are apart of your mining crew and there happens to be two airlocks to your base, because they are more likely to asphyxiate in space than they are picking which one is closer so they do not die.\n\nAgain, all these negative aspects can be attributed due to the fact that this title is feature INCOMPLETE and will probably remain so, unless it builds a decent modding community (which is incredibly unlikely to happen given the current state). The keyword here is short, as in the feature list, the amount of time this game was given development time until its "full" release, and any enjoyment you can get out of it.\n\nI would be lying if I said I had never been so disappointed by a game before, but certainly not with a game that I was so excited to see completed. In the end I, and several other hopefuls lost out on $20-25 on a game that will never be finished. And while they did not lie to us about "silently pulling the plug", but they certainly lied about delivering us a "complete" game. With them violating my trust, I will never be purchasing another early access title or Double Fine game ever again.","September 28, 2014","false","8.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The interface is very clunky and you will be lucky if you actualy do get a base up to specs.\nTo begin with the game is so full of game killing bugs that 9 out of 11 games I played were ended NOT because of a disaster, but because of  a major game killing bug.  I even had to restart the game 6 times in a row one time just because there was a bug that was killing it shortly after launching..\n\nMoving on we now go to the general aspects of the game itself:\n\nSupport 0/10\n\nThis game was released in an unfinished state and is abandoned yet sold on here for $20 (at the time of posting)\nI can not give a game in this condition or state any kind of rating at all.  Moving on, the devs are not freindly at all and have banned people for expressing their opinions that the game was a piece of vaporware.  You can take a look at the discussion forums for yourself on this and get a good idea of just how much censorship that is going on and make up your own minds on this .\n\nGraphics 5/10\n\nI am really not impressed with the graphics.  They are not impressive at all and were somewhat below average.\n\nSounds and Music 1/10\n\nThis is an area that is bare bones.  Obvioiusly this area of the game also did not get fnished.  What little music and sounds that there are  annoying as it is repetitous.\n\nGameplay 1/10\n\nI tried. No really I tried and I got 1 decent game out of 30+ hours which yielded  constant frustration from game killing bugs.  So I give gameplay a 1 because it was fun until the game was killed by a bug.\n\nFun 2/10\nWhat time I did play that was not killed by a game killing bug was fun so I give it a 2 in this area.\n\n\nPrice:  due to the bugs, unfinished state, and unfrinedly devs it is my opinion that this is one game that definitely NOT worth more than a few pennies.\n\nBugs and Execution:  The interface sucks, the game is full of game crushing bugs.\n\nI hope this review has been helpful to anyone looking for a new game. Feel free to comment.\n\nOverall :  This game is not just an epic failure but truly IS  vaporware.","January 23, 2015","false","36.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It has so many glitches, that it is bound to break after some time of gameplay.\n\nTo be honest: I'm sick an tired of constantly being the alpha- or beta-tester!\n\nThe game lacks the very basics. You can only save your game by quitting. If you accidentally click on "how to play" or "New Base" you lose everything regardless if you have saved previously or not. You are not even asked "are you sure?" or be warned the your current game will be lost.\n\nIn terms of gameplay:\nIt is quiet unbalanced. Constant attacks don't give you much time to breath if you have not found the right area in the galaxy for building your base.\n\nSometimes ships dock at your station and there is nothing you can do about it. If these ships happen to have exterior turrets you might as well start from scratch. Because these turret will tear your crew apart and you won't have a chance to disable or even destroy them.\n\nAgain. Haven't the developers even played the game? Other players keep having the same problem. There seems to be no answer accoring to the double fine board.\n\nYou have to start over several times in the beginning until you have figured out what to do. There is a tutorial, but everything it does is presenting you a half finished base. There is nothing that explains the building items, what to take care of or the basics of managing the station.\n\nSometimes some of your citizens just stop doing their duties and telling you they are bored. You send security to a place where pirates tried to break into your ship and they just keep patroling the base. On occation citizens refuse to enter a room and do maintainance... which results in suffocation of all citizens on your station.\n\nSo, what do you do against those pirates raiding your base? You build some turrets of your own. Then one of your scientists goes mad, usually you would stop him and throw him into the brig until he stops acting up... but the turret has a better idea: it shoots him.\n\nConclusion:\nUnder no circumstance is this game in a "release"-state! Beta at most. I feel violated as an alpha-tester again by a company which obviously did not even bother to try and play their own f***ing game! It reminds me a lot of the initial problems of X-Rebirth.

But from an established studio like Double Fine, there's a reasonable expectation of not only a certain level of quality, but of a completed product. With Spacebase DF9, we're getting neither of those.\n\nDeciding that pre-release sales aren't up to their expectations, Double Fine has opted to cancel further development of DF9, label the next version 1.0, and abandon it. Sure, we'll get some bug fixes in 1.0, but the game isn't nearly ready for release. Between miners who refuse to stop working and suffocate before reaching the airlock, doctors who can't be bothered to retrieve dead bodies, construction items that builders ignore, and a notable lack of features and variety, DF9 is an incomplete and sometimes outright broken product. That never bothered me much because I kept telling myself, "It's still alpha. It'll get better."\n\nThat Double Fine is using sales of an alpha to determine the game isn't promising enough to finish is astonishing. The lack of commitment to invested fans is even more so. Of course it's not selling well; it's not a good product yet. This almost makes one miss the old days, when games didn't sell at all before release. Then no one could complain, "it didn't sell well enough before we finished it."\n\nThis is the kind of thing we've come to expect from no-name, fly-by-night indie devs, but from a studio like Double Fine it's all the more shocking, if not more shameful.\n","September 22, 2014","false","9.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I mean, the game works and all but there are a lot of glaring problems with it.  After a few runs through the game, I couldn't help but notice that every space sector you play in has almost zero differences between them.  The astro density determines how much asteroid is in your area to mine from, which is appreciated, but it hardly makes up for everything else.  The threat level has very little difference, as it apparently suggests how often your base gets showered on by meteors and debris, while warpgate proximity indicates how often you get potential new residents passing by.  What is evidently missing is where Raider occurrences would be placed, since they happen fairly regularly.\n\nThe Raiders themselves are stupendously overpowered.  The raiding parties vary between one and three Raiders that *will* decimate your population, no matter how well-trained your Security staff is.  The reason for this is because they tank damage like it's nothing while killing a majority (if not all) of your residents in less than five shots each.  The defensive turrets don't offer much by way of defense.  As the camera is locked to only one perspective, you only have the option to face the turrets downward (i.e. towards the bottom of the map) to either the left or right directions.  Seriously, you can't really use them to shoot at the approaching vessels since they have to be *inside* the base.\n\nThe base amenities are also a joke as follows:\n- Despite having oxygen capacity for X number of people, the second I fill the base to capacity, the oxygen recyclers eventually fail as if I was overbooked (despite each recycler to be working perfectly at roughly 80-85% durability).  This caused my residents to panic and run around, abandoning all jobs and waiting until they either starved to death (because they used up all of the matter in stock) or waited until the next Raider party exterminated them all.\n- The bar doesn't offer much, since it's the only thing that works in the Pub zone.  I have seen neither the fridge nor stove used at all so they're essentially useless.\n- I set up a Reserch Zone and set a tech to research but my Scientist was busy doing everything else while on duty rather than actually research anything.\n\n\nOverall, the game pretty much sucks since each playthrough is just the same thing: see how big your base can get before Raiders kill them all.  And given how Double Fine's treating the game now, I'd have to agree with everyone else.  The developers are basically dropping the project and turning the rest of the game's development over to the community after announcing that they're releasing the source code for the scripts and pushing the game out the door with a 1.0 full release version.  Avoid this game and pick up somthing better instead, like the classic StarTopia or even Prison Architect (which I also have). Spacebase DF-9 is simply a waste of time and money.","September 20, 2014","false","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There was definable progress. I'll admit it, it was fun. There were bugs, and early access gripes, but the EA rule I use is that "As long I can visualize this being finished, done, and fun, I can consider spending money on it." DF9 met those criteria. However, as the game has moved abruptly to a "release", and with the complete stoppage of new features, Double Fine has fallen far, far short of even approaching their planned development milestones. Further, the lack of believable rationales, detailed explanations, or even breakdowns about why this came about mean that I can't in good faith recommend that you purchase this game, or any future titles from Double Fine productions until some form of publically disclosed management shakeup takes place.\n\nThey reportedly raised approximately half a million dollars to develop this game. They then stopped development, citing financial reasons. They do not appear to have then offered any breakdown of where said money went. They are now confused, as people are angry and asking "WHERE DID THAT MONEY GO!?" The statements I have reviewed do not appear to show that this logical connectoin has been made.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was a "AWESOME DEV PROCESS GREAT JOB" timeline that was issued as a "We're sorry we took your money, but don't pay attention to the archived feature lists we pumped for months about what we were going to do, instead read this sleek graphic that shows what we DID do! JUST DONT COMPARE THE TWO!" Their conduct in this and other products leads me to the following unfortunate conclusion regarding Double Fine Productions:\n\nThey simply are not a worthwhile investment for your consumer dollars. This is not the first time this endgame has come about for one of their product. That is not to say Double Fine is an intrinsically bad company, or that they cannot make good games. But I simply cannot justify spending money on early access titles from them now or in the future.\n\nAt this point, Double Fine serves as an argument for Valve to more or less micro-audit game development companies, even basic indie ones, for management practices. Whether that is feasible or a correct response is a different matter, but Double Fine's performance definitely elicits that reaction. That or open up a "Developer Review" page to trash talk developers (This would also be a bad idea, but it is my inclination in response).\n\n\nA more reasonable option would be for Valve to construct a form of "Warning Stick" that it can publically shake at developers who mis-behave in such a fashion. A "We're reviewing their sales agreement" or "We're considering yanking their priviledge to post on early access" type of statement, to remind developers that Early Access is not a kickstarter equivalent, but is rather an opportunity to generate interest and feedback on your products.","September 30, 2014","false","27.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This hasn't been fixed from alpha 6. Two months ago.\n\nThe tutorial is complete crap. There is no audio queues and it is VERY uniformitive. All they did was have text on the bottom and hope the random event generator triggers what to do next.\n\nCrew members will walk back and forth until they die - refusing to either fix/build oxygen supplies.  There is  no way to keep track of power usage.  Just build until you run out of power.

I cannot count the number of times my space station found istelf down to a tiny crew due to the rest being killed off. You will have much more satisfaction with the 'New Base' option.\n\nThis is a game with  basis, but too many frustrating points.

You'd THINK that would lead me to recommend it, but no. I don't recommend this game to purchase.\n\nI started playing the prototype that released with the Double Fine prototype bundle, and I really, really enjoyed it. I was so thrilled when the game hit Steam, and couldn't wait to see where it went. Well, it did add features to the prototype game, which I was playing regularly, so in that sense I'm still enjoying it. However, the game is extremely unfinished and buggy. Asking $10 for it is a slap in the face to consumers; they should ask no more than $1 or so for an unfinished game, if that. Basically, I've played more completed games from Pyweek, and that's folks slapping together games in a week -_-\n\nAll that said, I do like playing this game; I enjoy the space sim aspect, and since I've never really gotten a successful, self-maintaining base running it's sort of a perpetual challenge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unifyzero/recommended/246090/","unifyzero","unifyzero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unifyzero/","484 products in account","Being a fan of the old “Tycoon” games and “Theme Hospital” I was really excited about Space Base DF-9. I thought for sure reviewers were being too hard on it, so as soon as I saw it pop up in a Humble Bundle I was ecstatic… But, all of my excitement was for naught. Almost 6 hours wasted and I can pretty well guarantee I will never touch this title again.\n\nTL;DR\nThere is a ton of promise here. When the game is running smooth there’s not a lot to complain about (except maybe lack of construction options), but eventually that smooth ride will be over and you’ll realize nothing works like it should, if at all. So while playable you’ll hit a point where the effort to advance isn’t worth it. If you still think you want to punish yourself by playing this game make sure you check out http://www.spacebasehub.net/ for the unofficial patch, the mechanics are still broken but everything else has been improved.\n\nIn-depth Review\nOverall Gameplay:\nThe basic construction and management section of the game is fairly well done. It’s very similar to “Theme Hospital”, but with a slightly improved interface. That’s where the positives end. So many things are broken that it becomes unnecessarily difficult, and not in a fun, challenging way but in a “oh there’s another thing that doesn’t work right” kind of way.\nHere are just a few examples of things you’ll see characters do:\n- Die of suffocation despite being surrounded by rooms with oxygen and having access to an airlock with space suits,\n- Become incapacitated (not dead, just lying around uselessly) indefinitely. If they’re Raiders they actually might be back up and start killing people!\n- Be marked for the brig or infirmary but never go there\n- Scientists not researching (despite being assigned research and having a research station).\n- Ignore the 3 fire extinguishers near the fire, and instead stomp on it until they catch on fire, then run around the base being ignored by everyone else until they burn to death… Actually that might’ve been the most entertaining part of the game!\n\nPresentation:\nThe user interface is easy to navigate but overly simple. You only have 1 save slot and the game auto saves by default, so if you’re not careful it’s quite easy to erase a save game by clicking on the wrong thing and not exiting before it overwrites your game.\n\nThe graphics are fine. They’re quite obviously a throwback to “Theme Hospital” (how many times can I name dop?). It works well for the genre, and they’re fairly sharp.\n\nThe sound is outright boring, the music is nothing impressive and off the top of my head I honestly don’t remember any sounds other than that and the chirping alarm if you zoom in far enough.\n\n\nSummary:\nThis game could be so good, but as in so many cases now it looks like the developer took their money and ran. In my love/hate relationship with Early Access this is why the hate portion exists. I’d give it a 3/10, it’s playable and as long as things work right it’s quite enjoyable, but the unpredictable and frustrating broken mechanics make it another EA Trash title. Pick it up in a bundle with some good games or for $1 or less and get a couple hours of fun… But DO NOT, under any circumstances pay any more for it than that. Especially when you could get the vastly superior Theme Hospital and forget this all together.","February 22","false","5.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You should expect bugs.\nIf you are surprised by the fact that there are bugs, I honestly don't know how you're breathing right now.\n\nSpacebase DF-9 is an excellent concept for a game. It's like a space-themed Prison Architect: you micro-manage the needs of your crew, build/destroy sections, new world events happen, etc.\n\nBut that concept has been poorly executed. The updates seem to be coming fewer and farther between, with not much added to keep your interest. It seems Double Fine have put this game on the back burner.\n\nAnd as I said, it contains bugs. The AI of characters is still a bit dumb, but it has improved since I started playing.\n\nAll in all, if you're very patient, and don't mind waiting around for updates and waiting for the game to figure out what you want, it has potential. Whether that potential is worth 25 USD is a personal choice.","August 20, 2014","false","6.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

Throughout the alpha the gameplay did not change at all. Instead each alpha update added some tacked on crap that contributed very little to the game.\n\nGood\nThe characters you construct a base for seem to have depth. They have feelings and thoughts and you can read about them and so on. The basic gameplay elements for a base builder are there and function.\n\nBad\nThe game seems to be caught somewhere between Dungeon Keeper and the Sims. Unfortunately, the emphasis seems to be on Sims gameplay. The station inhabitants have clearly had more effort put into them than the actual gameplay. This could have been a positive thing, as it is in the Sims which is a great game, except without a base and proper neccessities all your inhabitants will die. So you find yourself in a panic to build a base early, made all the harder by the fact that your workers spend more time socializing and posting to their "spacebook" than building things essential to survival. This is made even more frustrating by the single most terrible UI I've seen in a modern game ever.\n\nIn conclusion, the game isn't finished. The gameplay in Spacebase is incredibly underdeveloped and clunky. There isn't even anything to do. You build a small base and then there's nothing. You could make a bigger base, but there's no reason to. There's no challenge.

Double Fine had no problems lieing to us a few months before the game was abandoned and thus i can only recommend to avoid any Double Fine kickstarters or early access titles.

If you ask me, the outrageously high Early Access price ($25+) was in and of itself the primary deterrent for shoppers. I've learned my lesson now, and don't intend on purchasing any more Early Access games, and certainly never any other DoubleFine products, again unless they offer some kind of partial refund. This game is practically unplayable on a Mac; there are just far too many graphics glitches and various bugs. In the right hands, this could have been a "game-changer," but now it's nothing more than an utter waste of money.

Not because you essentially scammed loyal fans out of money, which you did. Not because the game is incomplete, which it is. Not because you botched the project at the expense of your fans, which you did.\n\nYou should be ashamed because you have hurt the entire industries trust and faith in early access, small developers, and where to trust developers.\n\nI understand not all early access projects work out, I understand that buying into early access is a risk. This however was pure deception on behalf of the developers.\n\nYou don't deserve to be distributed on Steam and you don't deserve my money ever again. Shame on you Double Fine you lost a fan, a supporter and revenue.\n\n-Adding to this review in hopes it will bump it now that it's been released and on sale. I cannot warn anyone off this game thoroughly enough, if you are considering purchasing this now that its been "completed", you are being swindled. Do not purchase this game. Purchase literaly anything else. -\n\n-Adding again, now that 1.0 has been released DF has given a free copy of Hack'N'Slash to people who supported this game.

Once you've built everything there is nothing left to do as there are no objectives, its a sand box. It could be better with updates but since the developer is pulling the plug on that, there won't be any more updates. AI doesn't act in a reasonable way and a small group of two or three raiders can wipe out your crew of 50+ guys due to a lack of just being able to effect  AI  citizens to react. It's just not finished, half baked is more appropriate. It looks good, had potential but inside its still a nasty surprise to find out it's not cooked all the way through.\n\nProduction chains are a 1, 2 step process with no real meaningful payoff. Items may or may not build/demolish and random "derelect" spawns clutter up space with unusable nonsense as "salvaging" them is a chore. If there are bugs, the development team is leaving and won't be around to fix them. As a final product this thing is only something an enthusiast of the genre looking specifically for a space station to run would like. Even then, there are better complete games available that will fill that desire. At best this game is average but will likely let you down.\n\nDevelopers don't do this for the money, they don't get the lions share of it, the investors do. They do it out of a passion and love to create games. Ultimately looking for that big break that garners them adoration and accolades. They won't be getting that here. Unleashing this deformed beast onto the world is a disservice to customers and a cross that will haunt the programmers for years to come unless they really are just the shills forums claim them to be.\n\nDo not buy unless you want to take a big risk.","September 30, 2014","false","24.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Instead, you will just run out of material to mine and slowly watch your base die.\n\nOr quickly, depending on the raiders.\n\nUnfortunatly, the developers rather surprisingly have seemed to have just given up completely on the game, rushing it to version 1.0 even though there isn't even a reasonable end game experiance. If they actually added everything they were planning, it might have been interesting. However, as is, it's simply not worth the surprisingly high cost. While the gameplay that is there is fairly strong and enjoyable to play, there's simply not enough for $25, and it looks like there never will be.\n\nLong story short, avoid this game at its current price. If you see it on a massive (like, selling for less than $5) sale, maybe try it, but honestly, there's really not much here, and certainly very little replayability. If you want a base building game but aren't neckbearded enough for Dwarf Fortress, try out Gnomoria instead.

Some of the issues were fixed; most were not.\nGoing in, I expected many more features by this point, and for development to continue for at least three years. The game simply did not deliver. Instead of fixing core design issues (like oxygen/pressure not being split, inability to respond to crises, and terrible AI), the developers just added on a few features (like asteroids, which quite simply make the game more annoying) and fixed the easy flaws (like technicians doing lots of damage, flying off to repair derelicts, and taking too long to train).","October 8, 2014","false","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To my mind, there is no real point to the game. The whole thing about choosing where to have your base is very cool, but in reality there is little to no difference. There are lots of rooms you can put down, which is great, but I can find nothing to do apart from put all the rooms down and defend myself against the waves of baddies.\nWhich leads us onto another problem: Combat\nIf I was to be nice, I would say that the combat was... flawed.

Double fine decided its done, so lets look at this as a finished product\n\nSpacebase DF-9 is The Sims, but in space. I know what youre thinking, I was hyped too. You can assign different jobs to different citizens and theyll like it a certain amount. Your citizens will scurry around and converse with each other about inane things like space mudcrabs. You can select asteroids to be mined, which works kinda. You can get other people to come by and ask to join your space-hovel, and supposedly they might even try to do other things, but that never happened in my playthrough. You can send you citizens to go and explore derelict ships, and they will find things. You can build rooms, and put things in those rooms, and your citizen will use them. You can give those rooms different named functions, and your citizen will use them for those functions. Spacebase DF-9 is The Sims, but in space.\n\nPros:\n\n-Aesthetic: If you can count on Double Fine for anything, its that their stuff always looks good. The semi-retro looks of the interface and the hand drawn aliens look nice and stylized. Sending your citizens off to investigate a derelict ship is always a harrowing affair, as the ship is completely dark, with red warning lights flashing ominously through the hallways. Even if you have no idea whats coming, the atmosphere of the ship makes you anticipate losing a few citizens. One fult is that the play space looks very flat, even though your citizens, while in space suits, can go under your space-hovel, which was very confusing the first few times.\n\n-Sound: The soundtrack is short but nice. Ambient trance music has a soft spot in my ear canal, but I found the music very nice, even though it will be seen as repetitive to some. If you dont like, it, you can always mute it and play Eminem, or what have you.\n\n-Core gameplay: The game mechanics I described above are very good, and makes the base of a great sim game. I'll elaborate more on this in the negatives.\n\n-Fun alien designs: I like the designs of the aliens. I didnt see two aliens who looked exactly alike in my playthrough, besides the two humans I started with. Reminds me of Star Wars!\n\nNegatives:\n\n-It isn't Psychonauts. Lets all face facts, the main reason we all buy Double Fine games is in hopes of another wacky, fun game like Psychonauts. It doesnt need to be a Psychonauts game, it just needs to have the same spirit (Although, I'm still holding out hope that if I keep buying DF games, they'll eventually make Psychonauts 2). The plain fact of the matter is that this has none of that spirit. Spacebase DF-9 is as sterile a gaming experience as there is to be found. The most funny thing I did was purposefully suffocate my citizens in the bar. Forshame, Double Fine.\n\n-The gameplay is completely flat. As in grossly, sadly, boringly flat. If you have played 30 minutes of DF-9, you have played 30 hours of DF-9. With the exeption of the rare derlict ships, I spent most of my game watching netflix on the other monitor. Even the derelict ships suck in a way, since even with their mystery, it takes too much time and resource to explore and kill the monsters inside for it to be worth it, since all your citizens will be terrible at fighting. In other games, like the Sims 4, this could be remedied with patches and DLC, but Double Fine has no intention to patch or make DLC for this game, and so were tuck with the husk of a potentially great game.\n\nEnding score: 4/10. A passable game that works just fine but because of its pedigree should be a while lot better than it is. If you really need your fix of a Space Station simulation game, try Space Colony on GOG, if you need a Sims-esque game, just go back to the Sims. If you want a fun Double Fine game, just play Psychonauts or Brutal Legend again.","December 30, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Therefore I am not reviewing this game as a complete product, but rather I am reviewing its creative process. As a building management and construction simulator, Spacebase DF-9 fails the most important criterion in any simulation, uniqueness. Uniqueness is a core aspect in simulation games because it is there in which specialties and creativity come together to make an enjoyable and memorable simulation game. Examples of popular simulation games are Goat Simulator, The Sims, and Train Simulator, which all can be easily identified by each of their unique points. That being said, it is hard to find unique points in Spacebase DF-9. As I am writing this review, in trying to remember things that were unique I find myself fixated more on the bugs than actual gameplay.\n\nOverlooking the bugs, let me break down the gameplay. You build a base, gather resources, and make the base bigger and repeat. You have raiders that attack your base but they don’t present a threat if you properly maintain security. You have asteroid showers that happen every once in a while that start fires and destroy structures such as walls and they need to be patched up. You will get transmissions every once in a while so that people can move in, attack, or attach themselves to the base. The difficulty ramps up as your base becomes larger and more populated; you have to keep track of people’s morale, energy consumption, and security.  That is about it.\n\nAs I have stated earlier, it lacks uniqueness. The simulation itself is very basic and there seems to be a large amount of creative work in creating the characters. Unfortunately, the programmers made the characters expandable, having them die very easily and having a lot of them makes the characters feel insignificant and therefore, their uniqueness insignificant. As a simulation, this game will not stand out in sales or reviews unless the creative department decides to do some major reworking. Furthermore if unchanged and published, this game will stand out as one of many examples of morale hazard in pre-release gaming.\n\nNote: As I was about to post this I realized that this game was published a year ago. I could not fathom that a game this unpolished and lacking in content could be deemed complete by anyone who took pride in their work. In the end, it seems that DoubleFine just took everyone’s money and fled.\n","May 18, 2015","false","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Boy was I wrong.\n\nIt looks amazing, and the idea is fantastic! But the game IS indeed unfinished. It offers no goals that keep you excited about what's next, such as unlocking new rooms and items as you progress. There's no campaign, no mission, nothing. You get what you get at the start of the game (and it is ridiculously little), and that's that.

Therefore I am not reviewing this game as a complete product, but rather I am reviewing its creative process. As a building management and construction simulator, Spacebase DF-9 fails the most important criterion in any simulation, uniqueness. Uniqueness is a core aspect in simulation games because it is there in which specialties and creativity come together to make an enjoyable and memorable simulation game. Examples of popular simulation games are Goat Simulator, The Sims, and Train Simulator, which all can be easily identified by each of their unique points. That being said, it is hard to find unique points in Spacebase DF-9. As I am writing this review, in trying to remember things that were unique I find myself fixated more on the bugs than actual gameplay.\n\nOverlooking the bugs, let me break down the gameplay. You build a base, gather resources, and make the base bigger and repeat. You have raiders that attack your base but they don’t present a threat if you properly maintain security. You have asteroid showers that happen every once in a while that start fires and destroy structures such as walls and they need to be patched up. You will get transmissions every once in a while so that people can move in, attack, or attach themselves to the base. The difficulty ramps up as your base becomes larger and more populated; you have to keep track of people’s morale, energy consumption, and security.  That is about it.\n\nAs I have stated earlier, it lacks uniqueness. The simulation itself is very basic and there seems to be a large amount of creative work in creating the characters. Unfortunately, the programmers made the characters expandable, having them die very easily and having a lot of them makes the characters feel insignificant and therefore, their uniqueness insignificant. As a simulation, this game will not stand out in sales or reviews unless the creative department decides to do some major reworking. Furthermore if unchanged and published, this game will stand out as one of many examples of morale hazard in pre-release gaming.\n\nNote: As I was about to post this I realized that this game was published a year ago. I could not fathom that a game this unpolished and lacking in content could be deemed complete by anyone who took pride in their work. In the end, it seems that DoubleFine just took everyone’s money and fled.\n","May 18, 2015","false","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

From my experience, the game as-is is interesting but very buggy and sorely lacking in features. The base-building is somewhat simplistic, which, while partially due to the visual format of the game, is not enough to keep me interested in it. The AI for both friendly and enemy NPCs is very glitchy, hard to control and frankly suicidal at times. The user interface is clunky, incomplete and apparently designed for touchscreen support at the expense of UI size. The game has fullscreen support bugs, occasionally crashes without warning and lacks a tutorial.\n\nResource management is laughably simplistic, relying simply on the presence of basic station necessities (walls, furniture, life support, matter refineries, etc.) and NPCs in enough of a quantity to satisfy some invisible mysterious ratio (with the exception of oxygen/life support-based crew capacity, this is prominently displayed on the user interface, a very good thing).\n\nThe long-term gameplay suffers when you take into account that there's a very finite amount of natural resources (called matter in-game) with which to build infrastructure and feed NPCs, which means you generally have to rely on proper choice of starting location in order to ultimately dictate how long you'll be able to keep your base going and how much harassment from raiders you'll get. In my opinion there's something wrong with the game when raider attacks are a promising sign of long-term survival after a certain point.\n\nIf derelicts are part of your chosen starting location, then, yes, ostensibly I could see you breaking them down for matter for self-preservation, perhaps indefinitely, but I have yet to succeed at this, either due to a lack of experience or simply because it takes too long, I don't actually know personally because it's completely up to the AI-controlled crew NPCs to do this after the order's given.\n\nNPC deaths (which happen often, due to only security officers being capable of self-defense if I recall correctly, and hardly capable at that) affect nearly the entire crew's morale directly and drastically and how useful they are in performing their tasks. This is apparently impossible to remedy (again, I may be mistaken).\n\nEven beyond these problems there's just not all that much to do, just survive as long as possible and assign new/current NPCs to station tasks and watch them utterly fail to perform them. Or starve to death because they can't find their way to the cantina because they're depressed and oversleeping. Or open up an interior door into a hallway with an oxygen leak and asphyxiate. Or catch themselves on fire and avoid several nearby, conveniently placed fire extinguishers, relying on other NPCs to actually see that their compadres are on a painful path from the psych ward to the burn ward and put them out. This all creates a bit of a death spiral for the NPCs, which is an interesting but infuriating and uncontrollable part of Dwarf Fortress, a game which Spacebase: DF-9's apparently inspired by.\n\nTo Double Fine's benefit, survival was one of the game's main selling points. Sadly, in its current state and potential state when released in 1.0, this may be impossible, or indeed, utterly futile and pointless to attempt from the outset.\n\nHopefully the game will improve once "mod support" is implemented, but it shouldn't take mod support for basic implementation of features and bugfixes to occur.\n\nIt seems like the general consensus is that the game has been abandoned. I'd disagree with that verdict and give the developers the benefit of the doubt if it weren't so d**n obvious.\n\nDouble Fine, you know better than this.

Your base, which showed such promise, such hope, a seed among the scattered stars, will inevitably become a corpse-choked space necropolis, asphyxiated space pirates drifting, mixed with your own crew's plague-riddled forms in a macabre embrace, a scene of terror and death ruled over by the killbots which inevitably turn up to breach the fragile hull that protects your base from the endless night.\n\nAnd that is just the tutorial level.","October 28, 2014","false","6.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Updates are slow and add to the backend with new features that increase complexity, but don't actually add content or meaningful gameplay in any way. Worse, the developers have completely removed the "Future development plans" backlog from their website with no explanation. This is to say nothing of the numerous game breaking bugs and brick-dumb AI which have survived for release after release.\n\nAnd yet I could deal with all of that if the game were fun to play... but it's not. Games like its inspiration, Dwarf Fortress, are fun because of their emergent gameplay - the stories and situations which unfold around you are completely unique to each playthrough, creating a different experience every time you play. This frankly isn't true in DF-9, at least in its current state. Fire up the game and start on a random map and you'll have built and encountered everything there is to see in around an hour; there's no point in starting a new game since the same story unfolds every time.\n","September 8, 2014","false","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That doesn't mean don't pay attention to it, just don't put your money into it at this juncture.  The AI pathing is questionable at best (space requirments for individuals to navigate around larger items within the base is different considering the dimensions available). AI would rather sleep then do a job you have assigned them to; AI get's stuck within a structure with no doors or other forms of escape after you ask them to build it.\n\nWay too many individuals ask to your base than you are obviously ready for (I had over 10 within the first 15-20 minutes in one play attempt). The mechanics are fantastic. I will personaly be continuing to attempt playing this game, but can't recommend it to others that haven't already paid for the alpha.","September 6, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Post version 6 release, it now totally sucks.\n\nWhy?\nSpecifically the AI doesn't seem capable of managing the new functionality. Also the threat system is totally broken. For some reason in my "extreme low" hostility sector I get constant pirate raids (and I do mean constant. Like... 30 seconds after beating the last one there's another).  Or a meteor impact. The "game" (if one can call it that anymore) has gone from a space colony sim to a constant crisis.\n\nBut more fundamentally... the brig system doesn't work right, nor the tantrum system. So first the brig system: enemies can often get "subdued" where they just stand there endlessly until they starve. If you have a brig, you can store them there instead. There doesn't appear to be any reason to do this that I can see. There is no benefit. Its preferable to let enemies starve, especially because sometimes captured enemies lose their "subdued" flag and simply walk out of the brig to shoot up your base again. Seriously... WHAT IS THE POINT? Also... did you guys even test this release?? Its almost entirely unplayable.\n\nOkay so now to the tantrum system. Colonists can get freaked out, wreck the place up, and fight with fellow colonists. Yet for some reason this happens to happy colonists sometimes. I suppose one could say they "just snap" or something but... once again, what is the point of happiness if it doesn't do anything? Bigger problem is after a tantrumed colonist is subdued they lay there and nothing happens. Even if you have doctors on staff, they don't seem to treat the person like... laying there in the hallway injured. It appears that the primary role of doctors is simply corpse disposal, rather than anything doctor-y.\n\nIf steam had a numeric rating system, I'd give this 1 of 5 stars. Its really abysmal and should never have been released with the numerous game-breaking bugs. At least it was playable before.","September 6, 2014","false","23.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, it hasn't had a significant content upgrade since I initially saw it months ago on an Evening with Sips episode or short series.  What is in this game is a wide gamut of bugs combined with sheer stupidity when it comes to the AI, arguably the most important part of the game, and they screwed it up.\n\nNot being able to build rooms, place objects, or cancel construction orders without having to move the camera around until the game sees fit to finally let your commands go through was the most common bug, and it persisted in being terrible from the moment I tried to start building a base to my eventual giving up on the game.  Random events seem to pull from a pool of maybe 5 different things, the most frequent of which was a ship encounter that featured a squeal along the lines of "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! WE FINALLY FOUND YOU!!!!!!!!  WE'RE COMING ABOARD THIS INSTANT!" to which no matter whether you select to allow them on or not, you are forced to take on additional crew members, all of which will be more of a liability than a help due to their universally crap skills.  This will culminate in your base having to constantly expand its oxygen suppliers and eventually even building a second reactor, just to provide for these new idiots while avoiding losing your valuable crew members to oxygen deprivation as the wastes of space use it all up.\n\nOh, and if you want to expand your oxygen room to make space for more recyclers, or any room in fact, make sure you set the entire station to become builders.  Because when you have four builders dismantle a wall, immediately head back into the base to go to sleep, and refuse to build the floor in place of the wall you just tore down, your entire base will asphyxiate and your builders will sleep themselves to death, dooming the entire station.  Absolute rubbish prioritizing and programming.\n\nDo not buy this game.  Do not buy Early Access games.

The plan of the developer, Double Fine, was to fund the development from the start with the sales of the (prototype of the) game, reduce drastically their initial investment, and hope that their good name and promises on how they imagined the final game were enough to attract customers. The 'experiment' failed completely because most people interested in the game were holding their purchase to see how the developers were updating the game. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure, in which due to the lack of sales the developers were not able to assign more efforts to the game and, at the same time, exactly that slow development was the reason behind the low amount of sales.\n\nTo come to an end to this grotesque scenario, Double Fine decided to stop the development and release the game as it is currently. The game is still in its bare bones and the experience is lacking in many areas, but they will create a tutorial, tools to create mods, and hope for a nonexistent community to continue its development.\n\nAbout me: I've been a big fan of Double Fine games during the last years. I loved Psychonauts and Monkey Island, funded the Kickstarter of Broken Age and enjoyed other games like Costume Quest, Stacking or The Cave. This is the first dissapointment. It has destroyed the trust that I had in DF and, in the future, I will behave with them as if they are an unknown dev without credentials. I will investigate with caution about their games before buying or I will simply ignore them. Also, I won't buy any Early Access games and advice others to do the same.","October 4, 2014","false","30.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While what is in the game is fun the game is far from being a full game and will be released as such relying on modders to finish the game.  If this barely more then a prototype costed more around the $5-10 range then I would say its definitly worth picking up for that price even though it will never be a full game, but at a $25 price point I can not reccomend this game. Hopefully Doublefine doesn't keep with the trend they are on right now between this game being abandoned and who knows how long it will be untill the second half of Broken Age. Hack 'N Slash was pretty good, but I don't want to see Massive Chalice fall to the abandoned development that Doublefine seems to be doing because Massive Chalice looks like a interesting concept of mixing the reboot of XCom with having your soldiers inheirt good and bad traits (possibly just one side or the other depending on hidden dice rolls) from previous soldiers you retire.","October 5, 2014","false","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game is buggy and has extremely shallow gameplay.\n\nI played the early prototype of this game that I got with HumbleBundle's Amnesia Fortnight bundle, I liked it the concept but it was clearly in very early stages. Sadly, what we have now is not very different, even though the graphics have been improved.\n\nDoubleFine was looking to cash in on games like Prison Architect. They even said as much themselves. They got investors involved (and successfully paid them off with the huge volume of Steam customers) and then when it wasn't as hot as they wanted, they cut development, did some more sales to lure in a few more suckers and then pulled the plug. In that order.\n\nMost of the people who hadn't bought it yet were waiting for beta or full release, but DoubleFine wanted to make all their money up front. Their business model for this title depended on it, and it is a flawed and presumptuous business model that screws over the consumer.\n\n"Obviously, spending more money than we were making isn’t something we can afford to do forever." - Tim Schafer\n\nConsidering that in traditional gave development the developer puts in all the work up front, making the investment in themselves to deliver a great product. In this case, we, the consumer took all the risk. And they took none, while never intended to deliver a full game if it wasn't a pre-release hit with a cult following. Does this sound like a sane sustainable business plan to you? Well, if it does, then congratulations your name is Tim. And Tim, we can't afford to keep spending money on products that never materialize.\n\nI own Prison Architect and its a much more complete game, I recommend getting that instead.

Updates are slow and add to the backend with new features that increase complexity, but don't actually add content or meaningful gameplay in any way. Worse, the developers have completely removed the "Future development plans" backlog from their website with no explanation. This is to say nothing of the numerous game breaking bugs and brick-dumb AI which have survived for release after release.\n\nAnd yet I could deal with all of that if the game were fun to play... but it's not. Games like its inspiration, Dwarf Fortress, are fun because of their emergent gameplay - the stories and situations which unfold around you are completely unique to each playthrough, creating a different experience every time you play. This frankly isn't true in DF-9, at least in its current state. Fire up the game and start on a random map and you'll have built and encountered everything there is to see in around an hour; there's no point in starting a new game since the same story unfolds every time.\n","September 8, 2014","false","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Post version 6 release, it now totally sucks.\n\nWhy?\nSpecifically the AI doesn't seem capable of managing the new functionality. Also the threat system is totally broken. For some reason in my "extreme low" hostility sector I get constant pirate raids (and I do mean constant. Like... 30 seconds after beating the last one there's another).  Or a meteor impact. The "game" (if one can call it that anymore) has gone from a space colony sim to a constant crisis.\n\nBut more fundamentally... the brig system doesn't work right, nor the tantrum system. So first the brig system: enemies can often get "subdued" where they just stand there endlessly until they starve. If you have a brig, you can store them there instead. There doesn't appear to be any reason to do this that I can see. There is no benefit. Its preferable to let enemies starve, especially because sometimes captured enemies lose their "subdued" flag and simply walk out of the brig to shoot up your base again. Seriously... WHAT IS THE POINT? Also... did you guys even test this release?? Its almost entirely unplayable.\n\nOkay so now to the tantrum system. Colonists can get freaked out, wreck the place up, and fight with fellow colonists. Yet for some reason this happens to happy colonists sometimes. I suppose one could say they "just snap" or something but... once again, what is the point of happiness if it doesn't do anything? Bigger problem is after a tantrumed colonist is subdued they lay there and nothing happens. Even if you have doctors on staff, they don't seem to treat the person like... laying there in the hallway injured. It appears that the primary role of doctors is simply corpse disposal, rather than anything doctor-y.\n\nIf steam had a numeric rating system, I'd give this 1 of 5 stars.

THIS IS YOUR JOB! not to mention that they leave all these unconcious and injured people all over the base.\n\nthen there's the science team, there was a disease i needed them to reaserch so i assigned them to it and checked back on them about sixty minutes later and they had done NOTHING. i had a special room and everything, i double checked and they had just been standing in the hallway chatting the whole time. eventually they got to work, but people were sick and going to DIE!\n\nthe security job is nearly pointless, and what they actually do can hardly be considered security. people assigned to security patrol a small area around a single security beacon, and the only real use for this is to have them explor derelicts. i just ended up building defense turrets everywhere, but they have limited view.\n\n1.5: you can't tell anyone what to do, so even though this room is on fire no one knows and your fusion reactors are going to burn down.\n\n2: given how little you're actually able to do as a player, the game asks way too much of you. every five minutes it's telling you there's a new disease that needs to be researched, when instead you want to research new technology (because apparently the scientists who research dark matter also research medicine, and not the doctors), raiders seem to attack more and more frequently untill you're perpetually under attack, and the game is always telling you that, even though you have 30 reactors and twice as many oxygen recyclers than you need for your population, you don't have enough power or oxygen.\n\n3: the AI is stupid. outside of not doing their jobs, when i got attacked by raiders the AI does nothing to avoid them. when they walk into a room and see a raider, most of them just stop and hold up their hands in fear before being shot. raiders aren't even that smart, one broke into my pub and started punching my fridge.\n\n4: i'm not listing all the problems, i'm glad this game was so cheap when i baught it, because it's too late to get a refund.","December 4, 2015","false","8.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Reasons are numerous, and most already mentioned by others and this blogpost[wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.nl] explains most of it I think.\n\nIn addition to the blogpost I'd like to add an other reason why NOT to buy DF9. Once again the AI, which just plain sucks! My personal experience with the AI sucking balls is that after a debris stike, my oxigen tanks and power supply got hit. Without power and oxigen, the whole crew starts to panic, including the whole technical team. WTF? You guys should run to the power supply and oxigen tanks to fix them instead of running around like headless chickens!\n\nAn other problem is the Sims part of the game. The people have a (hidden!) worklist of stuff they have to do. So far so good I'd say. But technical maintenance (yes once again) should have a top priority for lifesupport, but noooo..... Ocigen tanks are about to break down and they fix ...a bar stool... FFS guys get real please! Or at least let me point the Sims where they should go next instead of fully automated.\n\nBottom line, the idea behind DF9 is real good.

A few promising features were half implemented but went nowhere.

I also really like the ideas the devs have.\n\nBUT and that is a huge but...\n\n... I purchased this game like a trillion years ago and hoped for updates. But there are just minor ones like nothing happened.\nI feel a bit ripped off, because in the state it is, it is not really playable. The AI is just dumb as hell and it gets really frustrating (the citizens are like lemmings).\nAnd after a short time you have done everything there is to do. I'd say after a 100 minutes you have seen everything and it gets to the point where you are just tweaking your base or you are eager to fight the trials caused by bugs. I really tried to befriend with this game the way it is but it just gets worse, because the unfinished state and slow development starts to aggravate me more and more.\n\nAlso there are a lot of known bugs, but they fix them really late or never. Who knows? The devs prefer to remain silent about nearly everything. I just read something about “We’re nearing our goals and the complete state of the game is not far away”, so I decided to write this and warn everyone about this. The way it is, this game could be a free to play iPad thing. I'd pay about 4-7$ for this max, given that I wouldn't know what I know now.\n\nFor all the people, who think I'm just being pessimistic:\nLook at their Website, or the updates here at Steam. It seems like they are releasing updates labeled as huge success, which are little more than some minor bug-fixes (or sometimes a bunch of new ones adding to the old ones).\nAnd you can't know whats to come, because the devs decided to delete the "Future developement plans"-website, which is a huge issue for me and just another indicator, that this game is dead and light years from being finished.","August 29, 2014","false","40.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
