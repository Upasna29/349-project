Think back to the great games in the genre: Ace Combat, Crimson Skies, Fury 3, Lylat Wars, YAGER; what would you like in a game like that?\n\nDo you want pretty? Pretty you'll have. While explosions don't have the best effects by far and environment textures could use some work, AX:EL is one of the prettiest flight games out there in light, colors and environment. The camera and the moving planes give also a great sense of action alongside with non-annoying but very nice touches like lens flares, glows, refraction and lots of tiny details like some destructible structures, flora and waves.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=478227199\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=461741816\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=364959399\n\nDo you want campaign? The "Mercenary missions" mode currently offers 10 missions that need to be unlocked progressively, with objectives varying from destroying squadrons, running search and rescue operations, transporting sensitive cargo through storms, and fighting huge boss-like enemies. While the number might seem a bit small, they are highly replayable, fairly long, include their selection of music (also composed by the author, really nice music, too.) and feature no lives, meaning you'll have to do them on one try, which adds to the difficulty but doesn't make them especially frustrating.\n\nDo you just want to shoot stuff down? The Arena mode features deathmatch and team deathmatch, both with customizable bots. It also has multiplayer support, but only ip-to-ip or LAN modes. AI can get pretty intense on the higher levels.\n\nDo you want customization? Every kill in either game mode, Arena or Mercenary, or Mercenary Mission completion, will earn you MsM. You can use that MsM to purchase a variety of body, weapon, wing or tail modules, with specific bonuses to each one.\n\nDo you want spectacle? Not only AX:EL's visuals will keep you engaged, the planes control really nicely, and the combat soon gets close and personal, with planes struggling to shake missiles while avoiding explosions and pulling insane-G maneuvers. It would be safe to say it's a game one will want to come to time and time again.\n\nDid I mention the planes can go underwater at any time? And that once there they switch to an underwater configuration? And that there's underwater missions, as well? And that there's sonic booms, working in-cockpit first person view and different atmospheric densities?\n\nNow, while still weak at the finer points of the game and control (I feel like the weapon system should be more fleshed out and general presentation is still a bit lacking), if what you want is to fly planes and shoot stuff up, I couldn't recommend a better game to do so with. Easily over War Thunder if you don't mind the limited multiplayer, and easily over Ace Combat Assault Horizon, period.\n\n8/10. Not perfect, really *really* friggin' good. For a studio made game. For a one-man project such as this one, it's outstanding.\n\nGAMEPLAY VIDEO:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbXAmqgsazA&feature=youtu.be","December 20, 2014","true","28.4"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","2"

Then you can buy wing modules which effect 'Recharge' 'Repair RT' 'Max Speed' and 'Engine PW' this is the same for tail modules. There are also various premade ships which you can also buy that have their own stats.\n\n----Flying----\nThe flying is simple, the ship follows your mouse while you speed the ship up, there isn't anything unique or cool to it it's just simple and works fine.\n\nI give the game an 8/10 for being a really well made dog fighting ship game, even though no one plays multiplayer the Single player is decent and now with all missions available.\n\nYouTube: Coming Soon","September 26, 2014","true","2.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/319830/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","AX:EL is Axe Eel Games, a one person developer, Steam debut and it is one of the strongest sci-fi aerial dogfighting games currently on Steam. The game spent significant time moving through the Steam Early Access program and was released in early December of last year. It has been met with mostly positive community feedback. Fans of the game appreciate the amount of work that it would have taken to make the game solo. Doing so enabled the dev to create and fulfill his ideal vision of the game.\n\nOne of the best aspects of AX:EL is that you have the ability to build your own aircrafts. While that sounds cool in and of itself it’s not until you’re actually under the hood of the creation system that you truly appreciate its scope. You have the ability to choose an actual ship from twelve different varieties. Then you can choose your wing and tail modules as well as change and adjust weapons systems, counter-measures and the N.A.E.L. (Navigational Automated Evolutionistic Logger). Initially it can all be a little confronting and there’s not a lot of information provided as to what each component does but given a little time you’ll soon work out exactly what each part can do to help your playstyle.\n\nWhen it comes to actual gameplay players can choose from squaring off in the arena or taking on any one of ten mercenary missions. This doesn’t seem like as much as it should be and perhaps you’d be right. I can understand how early access supporters would have been disappointed with the retail version of the game. However, there is a lot of replayability within the confines of the available content. This, aside from the ship building hub is the game’s greatest strength. Even though the mission structures are the same it is rare to find two playthroughs that play out the same. The arena also allows you to match up against bots giving you an opportunity to continue playing even when nobody else is online. Speaking of, unfortunately, I can never find any other games occurring when I look in the lobby.\n\nGameplay is surprisingly fun and somewhat addictive. Some players have reported issues but generally speaking the dev has been very quick to polish areas of weakness in the game. He is continuing to work on the game post-launch and is supporting the game and his developing community. You’re getting exactly what is advertised in the game. That’s a strong dogfighting game set in a sci-fi world  where you can fight in the skies above and deep in the oceans below.\n\nA great first up effort with signs of a lot of potential to come.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com\nTo become fully Steamified join our Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 16","true","2.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The gameplay is fun and somewhat addictive, which is a little strange for a game like this. The graphics are well presented and polished up nicely.\n\nGameplaySo what are you going to expect from this game that is basically a flight simulator? Well first of all there is a rather nice feature which is implimented into the game that really brings this game up and past the other flight simulators on Steam. This feature, is the ability to be able to create your own aircrafts and be able to fly around in them. For me personally, I am one of those people who will happily take a hour o rtwo to create my aircraft, it does take a little bit to be able to create your aircraft so don't expect to be done in 5 minutes and off you go. It has a rather nice variety of different types of ships that you can choose from, I think there are about twelve different types that you can choose. After you have chosen that, you can then choose your wing and tail parts as well as change your weapons systems and the Navigational Automated Evolutionistic Logger (N.A.E.L). When you first make your craft, it may be a little tedious, as there is rather little amount of information provided as to what each component that you put on your aircraft does. But if you are willing to take a little time and consideration into finding out what each component does then you will figure it out soon enough. When you are finally ready after creating your aircraft, you can then start on the actual gameplay. When you start, you are able to choose fromsquaring off in the arena, or choosing any of the ten missions that they set you on. For a game that is fully released on Steam, to me it didn't really seem like there was much content in the game than there should've been for a fully released game. However, the game does manage to keep pulling you back into some of the missions because of the replay value of this game with the content that is avaialble. Despite the missions are similar structures to one another, it is very doubtful that you will find that two playthroughs of the same mission play out the same way. The arena mode for me wasn't as fun as the missions that you can embark on, you are matched up against bots giving you the ability to continue playinf even if there is nobody else online in your lobby. However, it was rather unfortunate that I couldn't find any other games that where going on in the lobby as I looked through. Overall, the gameplay is rather fun and addicting to play.\n\nThe graphics of this game are really well done, there seems to have been a lot of time and effort that has gone into every little detail of this game as you play it through. The atmosphere really works well, with this type of sci-fi feeling with the sky really works well when you are flying and shooting in combat. Each ship variety is done really well, they aren't just copied and reskinned like some other game. They have all of their own unique features of them making each of them look really polished and nicely presented.\n\nPros+ Ability to be able to create your own aircraft\n+ Nice variety of componenets to create your aircraft\n+ Lots of replay value\n+ Fun and addictive gameplay\n+ No two playthroughs of the same missions are the same\n+ Nicely polished and presented graphics.\n+ Trading Cards & Achievements\n\nCons- Creating your aircraft takes a fair amount of time,\n- Not much infomation about what each component does when you build your aircraft\n- Not as much content as I would of hoped for\n\nResult / Final thoughtsWith this dogfighting simulator that has a lot of vairety and replay value to the game, I really recommened this game to anyone who likes this genre of gaming. With the ability to be able to fly in the skies and then dive into the ocean is a satifying feeling that you won't instantly crash when you hit the water. All of the graphics are nicely presented and the gameplay is fun and addicting. Just a few things that need to be polished up here and there, which aren't major things at all.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow ReviewExperts curator group here.","April 1","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Having recently got into War Thunder with some friends I was looking for some fun dogfighting action and the 'undersea' mechanic had me interested.\n\nThe first impression of any game (whether you realise it or not) is from the main menu screen and other elements of the GUI (Graphic User Interface) This is where AX:EL hits probably its biggest problem. The interface is at best poorly designed and in truth feels like an afterthought. Whilst a simple utilitarian GUI is never great it's better than having an overly stylistic and confusing one like AX:EL. Navigating the menus is a task in itself and especially in the hub where the cut off words on buttons and lack of tool tips means that I've very little idea of what's going on.\n\nThe poor GUI really shows through in the 'Hub'. The Hub is where you buy upgrades and paint jobs for your ships. The problem is it's very difficult to tell exactly what you're buying and what it does. There seems to be a fair amount of customisation to your ship. I say seems to be because despite the large number of buttons and sliders it didn't seem to actually do anything.\n\nThe game also looks pretty poor. The texture quality is downright abysmal and even the plane models look like they're from the early PS2 era. Whenever you get close enough to anything be it enemies, the ground or the aircraft carrier you immediately notice how bad it looks wrenching you out of any immersion you may have had. And for the most part there's not much to look at, most of the fights take place over or under an empty ocean.\n\nGraphics however aren't everything. It's been proven again and again that even with bad graphics and GUI a game can still be great, just look at 'Consuming Shadows' for a recent example. AX:EL's game play however is about as good as it's graphics. Upon starting it up and finding the controls strange I decided to rebind them which lead to, interesting consequences (LINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYy3j0_ZPn8)\n\n(The Developer has since responded to this and fixed it)\n\nHaving reset to default and after a bit of playing around I somewhat got a hang on the controls and then set about on the missions which are the standard fare. Go here. Shoot down these things. Find the plot point etc. With a completely forgettable story the game boils down to navigate the space and dog fight with anything that comes your way. The problem for this is that you feel like a tank with wings. The plane is so totally unresponsive to your input so the fighting is a long chase until you eventually manage to luck out and blow them up. And how about the underwater mechanic? Well it's exactly the same as in the air. As in I didn't notice a single difference besides the blue tint to the screen and the obnoxious bubbles that come off the back of your plane. No slow down, no different controls or feel to the flight. This meant that the underwater component feels very much like a gimmick, not even one that much effort was put into.\n\nAX:EL is a title that I can't recommend at all. All it offers is some poor quality dog fighting and there are far better options out there. I mean with War Thunder being free to play there's nothing that AX:EL offers over it.","December 19, 2015","false","2.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","7"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Action Flight Simulator AX:EL - Air XenoDawn. AX:EL - Air XenoDawn was released out of Steam's Early Access on December 4, 2015 by Developer Axe Eel Games and Publisher KISS ltd.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XxE5ejZQgRs\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nFun flight sim. Great Action. Awesome for One-Man Crew! 4/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nAnother hidden gem has been found on Steam! Are you a fan of Flight Sims, Dogfights, Airplane Combat, etc? This may be your ticket to fun here. This is not going to be the most detailed as far as simulation goes, it's not Flight Simulator X or anything, but it is an awesome flying combat simulator. Especially for the price! This one-man project is absolutely a thrill. There is a solid Solo campaign, complete with a good story and a pretty cool Report you are given for each mission. Very nice touch. Speaking of nice touches, the interesting thing this game has that no other game like it does? Your plane is fully capable of going underwater as well, continuing the combat below the surface. A really neat mechanic that adds to the fun and chaos of some of the battles. There is also an awesome arena for Multiplayer combat. TONS of fun can be had here and also, you can play the Arena with Bots if you would like to simply practice or mess around in that way. You really have a lot of options for customization too as you progress and earn money. All in all, this is a great little find for under $15. It made it through Steam's Early Access and the developer is still quite active and friendly. If you want to enjoy some flying combat, without having to plop down big bucks, this is the title for you. Great effort from just one guy, 4/5 and worth every penny of the $13.\n\nHappy Gaming!","January 20","true","3.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The premise behind the story may seem fine as a concept; however, the dialogue and grammar leave a lot to be desired.  The interface is very basic right now and a lot of the elements are not very user friendly.  I experienced some flickering on the craft mesh when in the 'Hub' menu going through aircraft options.  There are a lot of graphical options that can be tweaked under options, but once I launched the first mission with all of the settings on high the quality wasn't what I expected.  I understand that this game is still at a very early stage of its development, but in given game's current state I cannot recommend it.","February 20, 2015","false","1.5"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","3"
