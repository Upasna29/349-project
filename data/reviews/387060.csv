While the game does feel like an alpha to me, there is already a lot of polish.  I look forward to watching this game develop.","September 5, 2015","true","1.2"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","24","34","0","0"

Original review still listed for completeness sake, but this is definitely a developer worth supporting. Major usability bugs are gone.\n\n----------\n\nThis needs to be listed as Early Access. Unless there's a bug on the review page, it is not.\n\nEven at full price, I can't see this game going for a fair price of $7.99.\n\nRight now the game has several experience-destroying bugs, and even when it's working the content is pretty bland. It's clear the developer is putting in hard work, but comparing this game to early RotMG is a joke. There is no player-player interaction(arguably the crux of rotmg)\n\nPros:\n\n- Sounds are good\n- Weapons all feel different and have a different use\n- Feels satisfying to hit things\n- Controls are tight enough\n\nCons:\n\n- EDIT: FIXED - If at any point you click off the screen, you're done. Your character will keep moving and your key will get locked. This is compounded by a hard to see cursor.\n- Enemies all feel similar. They either rush you down or spam you with projectiles.\n- Dungeons take forever and all feel the same.\n- Entire game hinges on which bosses you roll. Some of them take forever and keep you at bay, while others just stand still and die for you. You definitely want the latter of the two.\n- Chests never feel useful. It's much more effective to just get the shark cannon and go win.\n- Every playthrough feels the same. I beat the first campaign so I could say I gave it a fair shot, in four tries. The second campaign is the exact same thing except bosses/elites spawn everywhere, instead of just at boss spots or elite spots. The bosses don't feel like they were designed to have synergy.\n\nI want to like this game, as Realm holds a place in my heart, but it just feels like a paid version of a free game that does everything better.\n\nIt would be worth in its current state IF:\n\n- It was at the $2.50 level. There are just so many other things out there for $8 or even $5 that are *better*.\n- It was marked Early Access. This does not feel like a finished product.\n- It did something new. Adding a timer to the game lies directly at odds with any strategy besides 'rush', and rushing doesn't feel fun in this game.\n- It had online multiplayer. Playing by myself is boring, but I could see this being okay with a friend.","January 7","true","1.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","3"

The game has some nice retro graphics, many creative and fun to use weapons, and a few different modes to play. Enemies and projectiles abound, but it is rarely hard to see what is happening on screen (unlike some other games in this vein). I enjoyed the way that the character collects both keys and money and must figure out which ones to use on which chests. Earth Overclocked is not an easy game, but it isn't as hard as many other roguelikes.\n\nRecommended","December 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is tons of variety in weapons and enemies. The replay value is pretty nice, as each time you play it is quite different, the boss enemies change, weapons change, placement of basically everything changes.

Widescreen and full-controller support (well done, at that), VSYNC, Antialiasing options, and even an option to show the FPS. The tutorial is short and simple and almost fits into the story.\n\nThe gameplay is impressively polished for such a new, early-access game (that only has 3 reviews so far?). It's fun, and the roguelike nature of it fits the game well. The interface is minimal and functional.\n\nIt just about fits the bill at this price point ($5.99), but I got it in a bundle, so...\n\nRecommended, though.

I greatly like rougelike and randomized games that hve different starting parameters every play.\n\nThis one is pretty interesting in it's own way:\n- you have 20 minutes to win the world (game session)\n- you start with 4 suits (well, classes with different tweaks)\n- you have a maximum of two weapons, three potions and 10 keys at one time\n- world is pretty small, but the time limit makes it pointless to just randomly wander around\n- time limit is good, it keeps up the pace of the game and makes it randomness more important than just wasting your time on searching for the most powerful weapon here and now\n- unlockable weapons and stuff\n\nThis came to me as a surprise. It looked as if this was some kind of a very random and pointless game but in reality is pretty fun.\n\nI think this one would be ok for about 5 euros. But still, you can grab it during some sales and bundles so go and check it out if you like rougelikes and randomized games.","January 14","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
