"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/434210/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","It was a shame to be born with feet instead of wings. If we'd had wings we could have shared in the culture and traditions of every country around the world. But, thanks to It's Spring Again, we can share a delightful Russian artform with children who are growing up with the internet and ipads. And, here is a game that utilizes voice talant, art, and mechanics in a fluid way to engage kids everywhere. They might even pickup a little bit of a second language as well.\n\nI'm probably getting the horse before the cart here, but this game is based on a puppet show, and the dlc (which is really a must-have in this game) includes a free video of the puppet show, along with an artbook. The artbook is filled with art from the game and the puppet show, as well as a concept sketchbook. The video is a live performance of a diaorama-type puppet show, sort of a 3D flannel board of the earth, which different stick puppets are attached to during the performance. This alone is well worth watching, though it is in Russian, and I couldn't locate the subtitle function on my plug-in. The acting was so dramatic and I'd already played the game through for a few hours, and you can tell right away the Earth is sleeping, even without knowing Russian. It is presented as metaphors.\n\nBut, that was just the dlc for this charming game. The game itself is it's own unique artform. It begins with giggling clouds, and a sunshine playing hide & seek. It calls for simple exploration type interactions to find the sun, while the narrator is telling the story in your choice of Russian or English. Each changing season is presented dramatically, while the gamer essentially operates the show himself. Nature is personified, with big faces. Even "Earth" has a face and hands. The rainbow walks across the sky dome. And, those clouds are so giggly and fun. I can't wait to play this with my nephew in Kindergarten. Having worked with children for a lifetime, teaching Elementary Science and working with puppets, and drama, I fell in love with the artform and Science of the game immediately.\n\nThe  designers really put a lot of work into the format and chose to give two modes: an interactive game mode and an autoplay visual story mode. I started with the game mode, and was immediately drawn into the art of it, which somehow reminds me of the stacking Russian dolls. The game mode has no ending, and not only has replay value, but one play through can engage a child (or adult) for quite sometime, with the cheerful sound-effects and basic Science concepts illustrated for young kids. The clouds literally drop the rain and snow on Earth, for example.\n\nThe achievements come quickly. I got them after completing the game mode and the autoplay mode, though it may be possible to get them without the game mode. I'm not sure about that, since I started with the game mode. But, the cards illustrate the characters from the story, and the badges have inspiring, positive words on a color-changing sunshine. (Oh, those arms on the sunshine!) The emoticons and backrounds are the seasons, snow, leaves, flowers, etc. all in tasteful illustrations. I'm obviously missing the Summer background, lol, and will have to wait until one shows up in the market.\n\nI doubt more words are neccessary for you to realize I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a perfect game to share with a child.","February 3","true","3.5"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","4"

Education is paramount to a child's development.  Nothing better than sitting back and watching your child beam a smile in your direction, it can brighten and warm even the coldest of people.\n\nThis game won't break the bank, and will probably give a child a couple of hours of entertainment...

Believe me I've gone through them all Barney, Teletubbies, (although DJ Lance Rock was awesome)  Elmo and the likes.\n\nWhile I don't forsee this game/story taking over your child's life the same way something like Seseme street will, it can be a nice few hour escape for a parent who wants to take control over the television.\n\nSO I'll say if now, buy this game, your kids will love playing games on the computer like they see Mommy and Daddy doing, you'll love the fact that something other than Television, or (forcing 5 DVD's into the dvd Player.. heck even the old Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich on the television trying to feed Cookie Monster... true stories)  coloring on the walls..\n\nSit back relax and enjoy the fact your child just helped you add another 100% game to your achievement list :-d\n\n","February 3","true","12.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","2"

The Collector Edition, which is a must-have, has the video subtitled in English of it and pictures, concept arts, etc..\n\nThe game is in Russian and in English, which means that kids from another language could be missing the educational side of It's Spring Again.\n\nThe storyteller is explaining what you can expect from a season: flowers during springs, fruits in summer, mushrooms in fall, snow in winter, etc.. Each scene is interactive: for example, the child has to find the sun behind the clouds or to make flowers growing on the ground by clicking on it, etc.. First, no help is activated, unless you click on help on the pause screen. Then, an hand will show you where to click. And as the winter is technically ending the story, there is in reality no end of the game. Indeed, you come back to spring and the cycle will continue, showing that it's infinite. The title takes all its sense: it's spring again!\n\nThe graphics are making me things of embroidery or anything that seems like it. Everything is anyway having eyes (trees, earth, sun, clouds). Also, the seasons are represented by a strange creature that is moving around. The voice acting in English is good and the sounds made when interacting will please children.\n\nIt's Spring Again is a short and good little game for 2-3 years old, with interesting bonus if you buy the CE. Even if it's in English, I do think that the pictures in the CE can be interesting to use in a classroom.","February 4","true","0.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

It's based off of a successful puppet show, which the game mimics to perfection. The main focus and goal of the game is to help teach children about the four seasons, and the benefits of their cycle.\n\nThroughout the game, the player will click on various elements, such as the sun, rain clouds, and trees, in order to help progress the cycle of the seasons. Starting in Spring, the player will help bring about the oncoming seasons, and when Winter hits the game then repeats by going back to Spring. During each season, the player will learn very simple facts; such as the sun getting warmer in the Summer, and leaves turning red and orange in the Fall.\n\nAgain, the game is aimed towards very young children. However, I feel that It's Spring Again could be a little more educational. The most your child will learn from the game is the order of the season cycle. It's nothing more than what they would learn in Kindergarten.\n\nThe art style is cute and simple, which is perfect for the target audience, and the female narrative is soothing and kid-friendly. The entire experience lasts roughly 5-6 minutes, so don't expect for it to keep your kids entertained for hours on end. There's hardly any replay value, although small kids do like to rewatch videos multiple times. For a buck, it's not a bad little Unity based game; just don't expect your kids to get a big lesson from it.\n\nRating: 3.0/5.0 - Average, can take it or leave it.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 22","true","0.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Que pouvons-nous dire de cette petite expérience?\n\n+ Personnages colorés\n+ Douce voix de la narratrice (Désactivable dans le menu principal)\n+ Chaque saison et ses effets sur la nature sont décrits par la narratrice\n+ Un succès débloqué par saison\n\n- Très court: on en voit la fin en 5 à 10 minutes\n- Pas de doublage français\n\n"It's Spring Again" est un petit jeu sympathique avec un design mignon s'adressant aux jeunes enfants. C'est l'un des rares jeux que vous pouvez laisser entre les mains de votre enfant dès qu'il est capable de tenir une souris.\nFait amusant: une édition collector est disponible pour ce jeu, dont le contenu peut être acheté séparément. Cela signifie que ce jeu a un DLC, ce qui est assez inhabituel, pour un jeu éducatif.","February 19","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You click on various aspects of the screen to move the story along.\n\nYou see rain & snow fall, leaves grow, change colour & fall, flowers grow, storm clouds gather and indeterrminable creatures walk across the screen as well as playing peek-a-boo with the ground and sun.\n\nMy two year old has not mastered the mouse yet so I had to do the mouse movement and clicking for him but he was able to point and tell me where I needed to click. The squeals of delight then we found the sun after chasing the clouds away and seeing the leaves fall off the trees were magical. We had to play the game through three times in a row and it as only with the arrival of tea time that I was able to drag my son away from the game.\n\nProsEnchanting story narration\nBeautiful stylised graphics\nExcellent for kidsConsUse of the term Fall instead of Autumn (The term Fall is not really used in the UK)Marks Out Of 5\n5) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this\n4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted\n2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted\n1) Not worth getting even if given away free\n\nWhere I got the game from\nI got this game as part of the  Indie Gala [www.steamgifts.com] Friday Special Bundle #30\n\nPlatform Played On\nIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse & Steelseries MERC keyboard.
