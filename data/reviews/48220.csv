I will try to explain why I can't recommend this game and how I came to +250h ingame time, just scroll down to the text under the original review.\n\n\n---- Original review ----\nDo NOT buy this game - even if it is cheap!\n\nWhy?\nThe game is still full of bugs even after 2 years and UBISOFT stopped supporting the game.\nNo new patch, no apology, NOTHING. They just got your money, why should they care?\n\nThe game itself could have been great but with all the fuss I had to endure I won't recommend this piece of garbage to anyone. Trust me, you're better off with buying games which actually deserve your support.\n\nI repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Show UBISOFT that they can't treat customers like this.\n------------------------------\n\n1) My rig at the time I bought this game:\n- Intel i5 2400\n- Nvidia N560GTX-Ti Twin Frozr II/OC\n- ASRock P67 Pro3 (B3)\n- Spinpoint F1 1000GB, SATA II (HD103UJ) then ADATA S511 120GB, SATA 6Gb/s SSD\n- ADATA 2x4GB 1333MHz CL9\n\n2) How did you freak manage to get to +250h game time?\nYou can subtract at least a third for the time I encountered crashes, game bugs which forced me to restart a map or simple idle time.\n\nI'm also a completionist, an achievement wh*re. In maps without a time frame I usually pick up every treasure, kill every monster and do every sidequest. This type of playstyle is time consuming :).\n\nNow take into account that I encountered nasty bugs which forced me to replay a map or browse the web for a solution. And there is also my profile swap which I will explain later.\n\n3) Is this a rant against Ubisoft or the game? Why didn't put the game aside and waited for a patch?\nThe game itself could have been great!\n\nBut it is still bugged and you have to find a way if you want to continue the story. Some achievements are luck based - you get them or not. The only way to get them is to replay the campaign map.\n\nI put the game aside for a couple of months in between patch 1.5 until 1.8. The discount on the DLC (-50%) drawn me back.\nHope dies last. I wanted to give UBISOFT and their new developer team a chance to fix the game. It's better now but the NVIDIA black screen bug is still there and now they dropped their support.\n\nHow can I recommend a bugged game to anyone? I simply can not.\n\n4) Which (nasty) bugs did you encounter in your long journey?\nMy guess would be 90% because I explored the whole map ;). Just a simple summary about the fixed bugs I encountered in previous game versions and the ones that are still there.\n\nI. Nvidia Black Screen Bug (still there)\nYou play the game and suddenly it freezes. Most of the time it's a black screen while the sound is still played. It can happen randomly or it can be reproduced via savegame. Sometimes it can happen in a fight or (no kidding) by walking over a certain spot on the map. I managed to continue the story by loading the savegame and trying every angle.\nAs mentioned above I had a HDD at that time which had a horrible loading time :). From patch to patch there have been improvements or it would get worse. I never rolled back my drivers but I can play it almost without crashes now.\nI can not safely say which GFX will work without problems. Some do, some don't.\n\nII. The achievement swap bug (fixed)\nRight after a patch a new feature was introduced - looking at achievements of other players.\nBeeing a jolly fellow I wanted to test it and look where I stand. Bad idea ---\nMy ~85% done achievement list was copied from the one I looked at - a 30% done player.\nI spent some time to find someone who had at least 80% done and never used that feature again. Guess what - I still had to replay a lot of maps to get that ONE damn missing achievement :).\n\nI talked to the UBISOFT customer service that they get my achievements back but they told be that they can't do anything which I do not understand even today. After the short "We're sorry that we f*cked up but you have to fix it on your own" conversation I bit my tongue and played on.\nUBISOFT was so kind to give me a dynasty weapon that I already owned as a compensation :).\nI contacted the customer service three times about different game related problems and none of them have been resolved.\n\nIII. The plague bug (fixed)\nOne of my favorites. I happened to meet this little fellow three times.\nThere is no creature growth, in fact it is negative. You can't get any creatures because "week of the plague" is active all the time. No creatures means that you have to end the map with the creature stacks you have as your army. Might sound funny but it slows your combat down because you can't afford to lose any unit :).\n\nIV. The little bugs (fixed and still there)\n- Achievements that only trigger sometimes (an example would be in the DLC - the treasure achievement which I tried to get recently)\n- Crash spots in the the map (also in the DLC and the original game)\n- Spell or creature related bugs e.g. the famous griffin bug (The creature would not deal any damage when using their special ability). Still a vast amount out there. Some players couldn't finish the tutorial (!) because their creatures wouldn't heal. A game which has a lot of different spell/creature combinations can have a few bugs but not to that amount.\n- Dynasty weapon which would get lost if you didn't put them on a charater and saved (reloaded) the map. There is still a nasty bug which will happen if you reload the map and use certain class spells (e.g. dark) while having certain dynasty weapons equipped (the spell power goes down, permanently).\n\nThis is an endless list. If you want to dig any deeper just visit the UBISOFT forum and click on the 334 pages long bug thread.\n---\n\nTL;DR:\nI could write a little bit more about the game's story and how the maps are designed.\nThe story is fine and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The map design, especially the new DLC (new developers) is brilliant.\n\nWhy won't I still recommand the game?\nBecause the release version was horrible, the customer "service" doesn't deserve the name and the game itself is still a huge pile of bugs with a few moments of happiness.\n\nWith a continued support (multiplayer = bug-ridden) and an open communication between the fans and the developers this could have been the best game in the series.\n\nIt is not.\n\nI will change my review in that way:\nIf you have an ATI GFX or don't mind restarts, if you are not interested in achievements and are able to restart maps without getting angry then this might be a game for you.\n\nAbout the DRM/Uplay, it is annoying but not that important to me.\nWe're using Steam which is the same but has a lot more time on the market.\nGranted, Uplay is horrible and I got kicked out of the game every time their servers went down.\nI developed a habit to press the quicksave button after every turn because I had to reload an older savegame a couple of times. I have a 50Mbit cable connection and traffic is not an issue.\nOn the other hand I never played Mass Effect 3 because of Origin :). I will though.\n\n\nWell, I am done. Thank you for reading and I wish you all the very best!","November 29, 2013","false","250.0"," 1,230 of 1,378 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","230","1","0","38"

There are bugs. Lots of bugs. Ubisoft took over primary support of this game since its conception and the bankruptcy of Blackhole in 2011, and there have been 11 official patches to date, all of which fixed one thing, only to break another thing. It's hard for a support company (Ubisoft) to do all the work the parent company was supposed to do, but as it stands, with the announcement in September of 2013, Ubisoft is moving on to greener pastures, and Patch 2.1.1 is the last of the "fixes" issued. There are still bugs that can spoil a game, for example, in the campaign mode, where the Town Portal spell has been disabled because there was no town to be used, and that data is saved with your character as they progress to the next level (even after a new map and load screen) and are unable to use the spell even there. The only fix is to restart the campaign all over and "hope" that the spell will work anew.\n\nToo many things in the game variables are hit-or-miss - random to the point of useless. Though the idea behind dynasty weapons and progressive character leveling, and select campaign character class traits is something innovative, the game really falls short of delivering all its potential because there is no way to avoid even one of these numerical/action-based failures. To be fair, I did find myself enjoying the campaign, albeit generic in some places, even through the bugs.\n\nNow, the multiplayer function is where the fun is supposed to be. If there is one good thing about this game, its the 'Hotseat' multiplayer function. I say this to the shame of the online mode which, like its single-player counterpart, has many issues all its own. Technical difficulties abound in the online-mode: random disconnects, frozen turns, black screens, jumpy combat and frazzled animations to name a few. Hotseat seems to avoid the vast majority of these issues, and runs almost identically to the single-player custom and campaign modes.\n\nIn my final analysis, this game is not at all worth the money Ubisoft has it priced out as, nor is it worth the time I (selflessly) invested in it. There are plenty of other turn-based SRPGs out there, like the earlier versions of the Heroes franchise, like Heroes of M&M 2, or earlier still, Age of Wonders, or even Master of Magic.\n\nThis particular game just isn't worth your time or money.","November 27, 2013","false","10.6"," 383 of 442 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","383","442","0","0"

I didn't like videos of this and what they did too my precious mercury, too, I didn't.\n\nBut yeah, first about parts I actually enjoyed.\nThe setting of Falcon Empire Era is pretty neat, with all that skulldruggery, old ways of Ilath, orcbros, oceanic weaboo empire, necromancers not as power-hungry cartoon villains, but bizarre keepers of balance (more like it was in Diablo II). Story is good enough too. The split dynasty, the rise of Railag, the crazy adventures of Crag Hack (though I found this one quite boring, but then again, I was playing this for a while at that particular point) and a little fanservice with Sandro cameo (OHGODIT'SREALLYHIM). Dunno about vampire campaign though.\nSanctury is a good addition to the world, it's unlike anything you saw in Ashan before and I hope we'll see more of Naga Samurais and Sharkmen in the future.\nThe system of unlockables through seals is decent. Provides a bit of stimulus to play it if you feel you are bored here (and it happens pretty fast).\n\nNow, the bad parts.\nSoundtrack. Quite unremarkable.\nThe balance. The problem here is not overpowering something, but making it too difficult to figure out (the same mistake devs did in HoMMIV with cross-classes and tons of perks). See, there are just too many perk combos you can't really predict, because spells are perks here. In HoMMIII you could point your finger at a guy playing Necropolis or Conflux and call him an a-hole, In HoMMV you could point your finger at Kaspar starter, here...well...you can't. And it's not really a good thing (but it may appear so). Still, if you like overcomplification, you may just ignore what I said.\nWhile devs created complications, they simplified the resource part. Which feels...unfair,\nAh yes, map layouts. Region - based map isn't a good solution for me. You can't raid mines behind enemy lines, now you have to sabotage them or keep you secondary hero there all the time. This is a huge problem when we come to next point...\nOveruse of town portals. No really, this is a big issue. While they provide mobility, they are, well, too damn essential. You can easily evade encounter with enemy via it. And...everybody gets it for free. No spell, no perk, you just need enough mana to cast it.\n\nOh, about Conflux service. It wasn't down at the time I played it, so maybe Ubi fixed it. Maybe. Still, I'm okay with being online to play.\n\nStill, the review is "mixed", so I have to claim "non-recomendation" here is gentle here, not strong. You wanna your 60 hours (well, I lasted nearly that amount) for that price - fine, go for it. If not, or you have bad experience with Uplay - better save the money for sale or whatever product on Steam you want more.\n\nHeh, probably the longest one I've written so far.","November 21, 2014","false","57.1"," 266 of 306 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","266","306","3","11"

Ideally the complete edition.\nIf you came here for a more recent game play feel and fun game, go buy Heroes V: Tribes of the East.\n\nIf you are still reading this let me tell you why Might and Magic: Heroes VI Shades of Darkness is bad then you are in luck. The biggest problem with the game is it takes what made the previous games so good, the uniqueness of the different factions, waters them down and makes sure they are all bland different colours of each other. Every race has a creature that operates as a harpy used to, with a strike and return ability. Whole factions have been removed or completely redone, racial abilities and advantages have been removed. None of that made the game unenjoyable for me. No what did that was the horrible Hero system that was implemented.\n\nHeroes now come in 2 flavours, Might or Magic. You can no longer see what your hero specialises in beyond their flavour until you have already selected them and are playing away. Most of the heroes and factions are also locked behind a in game store front, they are free but they have to be manually unlocked one by one. We aren't talking a few heroes, there are over 20 that need to be unlocked, with whole factions like the Demons and Stronghold blocked off. Once you are in game it doesn't get much better, if you buy a hero, there is no way of dismissing the hero, other than sending them to their death against a monster stack or enemy hero.  Another bad change that has been made is giving every faction and town two versions of town portal. The first version allows you to teleport a hero and army to any other controlled city, the second one teleports a hero and their army to the nearest town with a portal building. This sounds great, right? Wrong. It completely destroys tactically positioning your heroes on the map and means the enemy just portals away to a town. End games become a constant back and forth of heroess teleporting to at risk towns, a very un-fulfillingg way for games to end.\n\nI have had lots of problems gettign the game to run, it has 3 different forms of DRM at work, Steam, Uplay and Conflux. I often find the game wont actually load unless launched through Uplay and only then about 2/3 times. I have had no luck with multiplayer, the game telling me I need to connect to the internet, when I am already connected, which the game knows because of the afore mentioned DRM. The official word from Ubisoft is this requires port forwarding. I have a no desire to go messing around inside my hub's settings. I find the idea that you need to port forward to get the game working, even through Steam, Uplay and Conflux is a joke.\n\nSeriously just avoid it at all costs.","May 3, 2015","false","59.0"," 147 of 165 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","147","165","5","0"

The problem is that M&M:H is not HoM&M. Heroes of Might and Magic games were strategy games with RPG elements. This one...even the name is just wrong...  I don't know what it tries to be. It's no longer strategy game because of all oversimplifications in the mechanics  and AI blatantly cheating. Yes, computer needs some advantages to make things challenging but in previous games it was limited to giving AI better starting position, some free resources and ability to win fights withour losses. In this game however computer is not bound by the most fundamental rule of this game: production limits. This means player and AI no longer play the same game. This is intolerable in strategy.\n\nSo perhaps it's meant to be RPG with strategy elements, like Kings' Bounty? Well, the game doesn't do that either, because it's turned based and thus lacks the liveness and pacing of KB.\n\nThen there are 'dynasty artifacts'. This is possibly the worst idea in the history of the franchise. Acquiring good artifacts before your opponent used to be imporant aspect of the game. Now, you open a menu and equip a relic of your choosing at the start of each map.  Because UPlay.\n\nThere are some good ideas in this game. For example: I like 3-tier unit system. If it's better than 7-levels from H3 and 5 is a matter of taste, but it worked better than I expected.\n\nAs much as I like (or used to like) the franchise, I cannot really recommend this game.

Dozens, if not hundreds of bugs, minor and major have been in this game since release.  Not one frak has been given by the developers and the publisher to fix anything, focusing instead of pumping out DLC.  Some examples:  Many hero skills either do literally nothing, or act REVERSE.  Picking 'Pathfinding' for example doubles the rough terrain penalty instead of reducing it!  Almost all Dynasty weapons can severely cripple your hero permanently, when equipped.  Some will reduce your hero's magic power each day it is equipped, 'Affinity' weapons increase your spell costs to unmanageable levels.  Maps also have a number of bugs. I've several times had to restart a map from the start, after finding out for playing for hours that a keep I had to capture for a quest, simply did not spawn on the map properly, for example.\nInstead of getting a choice of skills, when heroes level they put points into a talent tree.  I personally dislike this method, it takes the fun out of hero development.  Once you learn what skills are good, you typically build all your heroes the same way.\nAtrocious AI.  Some of the worst I've seen, possibly rivalled by the HOMM IV AI only.  It literally doesn't play the same game as you.  It is given huge amounts of resources each day. but even then doesn't understand the concept of upgrading its towns.  It is given heroes and large armies for free every week to send at you, with a larger army each week.  Wipe them out too slow and their free unit spam will soon vastly outnumber anything the players can buy in their towns.  Adventure map armies also grow in the same manner, a strong design flaw that makes rushing for the win the single most important priority on every map you play, every time.  I was very disappointed to learn how the game actually works in the regard.\nIn combat, particularly during the campaigns, nothing comes close to the importance of healing and resurrecting units, to minimize casualties in each battle.  It is basically the only really viable way to play the campaigns without losing too many units to be able to finish the maps.  I would have liked to see other viable ways to play.\n\nOther thoughts:\nThere isn't that much else to say.  This is one of the weakest and most disappointing games in the series, which could have been pretty good if it was only given the chance.  It is disgusting to see how this release was handled, with zero effort taken into patching out all the bugs and problems it suffers, Ubisoft instead only focusing on producing more bugged DLC's to sell.  Game design wise I was not a fan of the simplified resource management and hero development either, but I could have lived with it if the rest of the game was in a playable state.\n\nIt's a big shame, since I was actually really enjoying the campaigns, having tested the Haven, Necro and Sanctuary ones, but the gamebreaking bugs prevent me from being able to finish any of them.  I am not interested in restarting them over and over to play around the bugs.\n\nFor those looking for a high fantasy strategy game to play I would recommend steering clear of MMH VI and instead getting HOMM III Complete from www.gog.com, or perhaps try my personal favourite in the series, HOMM V with both its expansions, its patches and the superb AI improvement third party mod.","October 5, 2015","false","101.0"," 93 of 101 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","93","101","2","6"

This actally forced me to restart my first campaign after 2 maps... as my magic character was totally useless by the time I discovered it.\n-Bugged spells that don't work as indicated.

I don't mind being always online, but when it loses connection and it does it often enough, it kicks you back to the main screen WITHOUT saving. Yea so you lose all your progress. With auto save it is not nearly as bad as it sounds but it's bad. REALLY BAAAADDD.\n\nAll in all I wouldn't really recommend it to any new players. After reading weeks of forums it does not appear that Ubisoft will be putting much effort to supporting it further, that is no more major patches, if any at all.

It has an utterly generic story that has nothing to do with the events of the previous titles and a gameplay that lacks any inspiration. But I could have ignored that, since, despite being not a very good title, the game still has some solid entertainment.\nWhat really killed it for me is the "always online" issue, even if you really just want to play a single-player game and don't even care about multiplayer. While being always online in Steam is usually a non-issue, having to be always online on the notoriously unstable Uplay network can be a pain.\nAlso if Uplay servers are down for any reason and you try to work around that by starting the client in offline-mode the game will begin giving you trouble. For example it will refuse to let you load any of your savegames, because games you played while you were online are not available when you are offline. And if it has a particularly bad day it will deactivate completely, tell you that your version of Heroes 6 is "unregistered" and demand that you go online to register your already registered game another time before you are allowed to play the game again. So that's my real issue.\n\nHowever, if you need another reason, then here is a word for those of you who just happen to be die-hard fans of the series like me: please take my warning. This game does NOT continue the events of Heroes 5 and/or Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It is a prequel that surrenders the previous story-line completely.\nI mean: Bloody hell! It's not like Ubisoft left us with a cliffhanger after Heroes 5, where the dark messiah, possessed by a half-naked, smoking-hot succubus, stopped the necromancers and their alliance of the willing from dropping weapons of mass-destruction on the underworld, destroyed the skull of the seventh dragon to free the demon-lord and open the gates of hell. So that the dark lord would rise from the abyss speaking the magic words: "I am your father". You know - introduce some global warming: the lucifer-way. And right before we found out if the world was going to end and if beelzebub actually can be a picture-book daddy... curtains dropping! The end.\nAnd here comes Heroes 6 and it starts with the words "2000 years earlier"! Wait a minute, Ubisoft: I thought we just had some serious armageddon and succubus-action going on here! What happened to good old: smash skull first, eat brains later?\nSo honestly: unless you are really desperate for another Might and Magic title, just skip Heroes 6 and wait for Heroes 7. You won't be missing out on anything at all.","October 18, 2014","false","25.2"," 101 of 120 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","101","120","4","1"

Thus, I cant play the game.  If I cant play the game, Ive wasted my money.  Trying to tell me otherwise will be wasting your time.  If the game creators fix this issue and I can finally play, I might change this review, but as it stands, I would not reccomend buying this game.\n\nEdit and update:  The service they want me to sign up for is called Uplay, and is similar to Steam and Games for Windows Live, which are both services meant to sell and confirm that I legally own a game.  My problem with this is when I buy a game off ONE of these sites, I dont expect to have to register it to a second one.  Ive spent months trying to get this "Uplay" program to update and run properly.  Ive tried updating it, checking to make sure it functions properly with my firewall, and just about everything else imaginable.  When Uplay runs properly, I managed to get this game registered to a Uplay account and logged into Uplay via my new account.  I did everything as was part of the deal and it either crashes upon launching, or it loads properly and claims it "cant find the game file".... and THEN crashes.  I did manage to get the game to load ONCE, and it crashed within 5 minutes of loading.  I didnt even get past the menu screen.\n\nAs of now, Im done trying.  I cannot recommend any M@M games that involve this Uplay farce until it works properly.  I purchased a game, I should be able to play said game.  Because I cannot, I fail to see why I should ever buy another game from this company.","July 4, 2014","false","0.5"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","37","41","0","0"

Uplay makes the game 100% unplayable - I wasn't able to run it after creating the Uplay account at all. Maybe I'll just have to crack the legally bought game in order to enjoy it.\nAs usual, legal customers are the ones that get screwed by irresponsible publisher.\n\nMar 15: Now that I somehow managed to run the game, maybe it's time to say something about the game itself, not the DRM.\nWithin those 5-6 hours played I'm in 2nd scenario of Necropolis campaign. Here's my experience:\n\n+ Heroes can travel without army and scenarios don't end with failure after one lost battle, the hero can be resurrected\n+ I may be the minority that likes the concept of teritorial control in order to profit from mines and dwellings\n+ Option of converting cities and dwellings to your fraction is a big gamechanger\n\n~ Abandoning creature levels (1-7) in favor or "tiers" (Core, Elite, Champion) is something I did not expect and I'm unsure whether it's a good or bad thing\n~ Not sure how to feel about Altar of Wishes, as it gives you possibility to "purchase" bonuses improving your heroes. I'd be okay with it if it was only for profile customization, like titles etc.\n~ Interface is pretty much a copypaste from Heroes 5 which can be either perceived as lazyness, or an intentional move to stick to something that players are familiar with\n\n- Be always online to play the campaign\n- Some of the soundtrack (as well as some sound effects) is just a rehash from Heroes 5 and Dark Messiah (I'm looking at you, Inferno town theme)\n- Did you like full 3D town screens in Heroes 5? I loved them. Bid farewell to them, because here we're back to 2D drawings. Of course they are pretty, but I loved town screens in H5.\n\nOverall, the review is still a "no", even though I'm somewhat enjoying playing it, but that may be just a long desire to get a new taste of Heroes. I'm not saying "you shouldn't buy this game" - it's more like "I can't pinpoint to whom I'd recommend this game". If you like Heroes series and 7,5 euros isn't too big deal for you, sure, go for it. If not, maybe other reviews will help you make up your mind.","March 14, 2015","false","122.7"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","41","49","0","0"

Heroes III is arguably the best in the franchise.  I really enjoyed Heroes IV though.\n\nAnd then came UbiSoft...\n\nIt seemed their mission was to destroy the beloved franchise.  With Heroes V came lame, watered-down spell-casting.  The graphics were good in 2007, I had no problems there.  The inability to divide your troops in your army was bad.  I had all but given up on Heroes of Might and Magic.\n\nThen I saw Heroes VI.  The graphics are fantastic.  The animation is good.  The storyline is interesting, if a bit underdeveloped.  I like the ability to convert towns, forts, and dwellings.  I have played this game for over 240 hours, and beaten all of the campaigns and expansions.  I like the hours of playability it provides for one player.  It doesn't hinge on multiplayer like so many other games do these days.  I love the Necropolis in this game.  The Altar of Eternal Servitude provides a deliciously twisted advantage as your army never dies, depending on if you have enough resources.  The Haven is excellent despite only one shooter.  I'm better with the Sanctuary than even the Necropolis.  The Stronghold is just impressively strong.  I like the Dungeon expansion.\n\nNow for what I don't like:\n1.  I don't like how you have to go through UPlay whenever you turn the game on or off.  "Synchronizing Your Saved Games With The Cloud" takes a very long time, and only works maybe 12% of the time.  It is highly frustrating.  I want to be able to click on the game and have it load.  When I quit to desktop, I want the game to quit.  This is the first game I've had to deal with these issues.  The benefit UPlay seems to provide does not outweigh the cost of time and sanity.\n2.  I don't like how I reached Platinum level before I completed all of the campaigns.  On paper, I should be one of the best players in the world.  Once you max out on experience there really isn't much to play for.  On campaigns the maximum hero level happens too quickly.  The maps are epic in scope, and there is so much to do, but if you max out your levels one-fifth of the way through the map then it's not fun anymore.  I understand that the experience keeps going into the dynasty weapons, but you really don't see that happening.  Let us players continue to grow!\n3.  I don't like the Haven's faction ability.  They are pretty much the antithesis of the Necropolis except for the faction ability.  Necromancy heals troops, but Guardian Angel doesn't?  At least until level IV.  No, the Haven faction ability should be healing.\n4.  The Necromancers differ in this game in that they don't raise skeletons after each combat.  Other than that, I love the Necropolis.\n5.  I do not like that troop growth is centered around your overall kingdom.  I miss having a lot of troops.  Instead of only getting 8 Core creatures a week, for instance, you should get those 8 Core creatures from every castle you own plus every creature dwelling every week.  That is one upgrade I do not like.  At least you have the ability to divide your troops in your army, and among secondary heroes.  Give us more troops!\n6.  I have a very nice gaming computer, and Heroes VI still glitches to where I have to just shut the game down and start back at the last save.  And that takes forever because I'm waiting for Uplay to sync.  Glitches happen, I know, but I haven't heard of any patches in months.\n7.  The Inferno has been completely castrated.  It's so hard to look at.  I get the Chaos aspect, but still...Inferno has been done better.  Get rid of the Inferno and bring back the Sylvan elves.\n8.  I absolutely hate spell recharges.  The whole point of having a Magic hero is to be able to obliterate enemies with spells.  Casting Lightning Bolt once every three turns sucks when in previous games you could cast it every turn.  The mana is mismanaged in this game too.  Your hero may have 200 mana, but each spell costs 45, 37, or some other random amount of mana?  No, take some lessons from what 3DO did correctly.  Unleash the spellcasters again!\n9.  Though I like having the skills and abilities options Heroes VI provides, the levels are few and far between, so it's hard to take the path you want to take when you level up.  That's just a minor issue with me though.\n10.  I hate how the Boss fights give you a pre-set number of troops.  What is the point of building an army for the whole map if you can't use all of your troops in the final Boss fight?!  I understand the need for a challenge, but there is something so satisfying in having an overwhelming army that you just spent 3 hours running around assembling.  I like the introduction of Boss fights into this game, but please let us bring in our full army and wreak havoc!\n11.  Maybe it's just me, but the AI is super hard on the Scenarios.  I can barely beat a single AI on Easy let alone levels with multiple enemies.  I have no idea how the enemy assembles such a huge army before I do, etc.  Maybe I just suck, I don't know (I don't think I suck that badly).  That's just another issue I have.\n\nOverall, I love this game.  It has given me hours of playability, and for that I am grateful.  It is a visually-stunning and beautiful game.  The Inferno is so hard to look at, but the beauty of the Sanctuary makes up for it.  If they make a Heroes VII I hope it is a lot like Heroes VI, but with the changes I have suggested.  Take away a cliche Demon threat and give us some other storyline.  Let the armies grow like they did with 3DO and Heroes V so the Might heroes can thrive, and take the recharges off the spells so the Magic heroes can thrive.  I recommend this game highly, but with those caveats.\n\nWhat is dead may never die!\n-- Kingsley\n","April 9, 2014","true","243.7"," 60 of 87 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","60","87","0","3"

Soundtrack is great, graphics too. Progress of story gives motivation to continue. Fights are (mostly) enjoyable. Still, there are things in this game which make me furious.\n\nI have game on Steam. When I launch it I must wait several minutes because Uplay must search for proxy, login and occasionaly update. Then finally game starts - and it logins to another network junk called Conflux. And now it becomes interesting. Because if you play with conflux there are additional items you can use in game. If you start game and loose internet connection orsomething similar, these saves you had are not available at all and you may start from beginning.\n\nMultiplayer game in HOMM 5 was possible using lan network. In this game you can forget about it, only internet based multiplayer game is possible (again using conflux). Even if you want to play with someone sitting opposite of you. It doesn't sound too bad - but all attempts to play I have tried end after few turns because conflux looses connection or something similar. Multiplayer game is essentially impossible.\n\nSingleplayer game is ok, but some maps quickly become boring. On normal difficulty setting it is common that 'level cap reached' show up while half of the map is still hidden. However important enemies are still terribly strong and armies defending gold and artifacts are usually very simple to beat (or so difficult that it doesn't make sense to fight them - all income is not enough to buy lost units back). So after promising start there is lot of sitting and waiting and buying new units each week. So far the most enjoyable game was for Haven fraction.\n\nAnd finally, there are still bugs. When combat should start sometimes screen remains black and there is no way out just switch to taskmanager and kill the game. There are some workarounds mentioned in forums (change in settings of nvidia driver)  but even then it is not 100% reliable. If you can make several important fights in one turn, save after every one of them!\n\nSo if you don't care about multiplayer, you like HOMM series and you see this game on sale then you may give it a try\nBut I am terribly dissapointed. I will try to finish the game for the story but I am putting Ubisof on my blacklist.","October 4, 2014","false","498.6"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","0"

Good Points.\nCampaigns last you quite a few hours each.\nDynasty goodies, special side quests and hidden bonusses makes exploring a reward.\nMaps offer different approaches, lots of goodies and quite a challenge at times.\n\nBad points.\nStory and dialogue wise, it's pretty generic. I personally didn't really care for the story much, deeming the theme and way the theme was handled overused.\nCampaign mission difficulty gaps. Some missions are insanely hard, only to be followed up with a cakewalk, or vice versa. Some missions also require replays because they punish a mistake you made early on a few steps from endgame.\nTear of Asha. Cute that it's included, but ends up being overkill on half the maps it's given on.\nNo Random Map Generator, killing the replay value of the skirmish maps very, very much.\nItem Placement at skirmish maps makes no sense, oftentimes giving you a completed moon disk/tear/full set/epic artifacts/et cetera ad nauseum before even getting past flagging your first mines.\n\n\nOverall though, it's not as bad as people yell at times and certainly worth a try if you're into the type of game, especially if it goes on sale.\nThe full package, even when lacking a RMG for skirmish + obvious flaws during the playthroughs, still holds a bit of appeal.\n\nIf I'd have to grade the game without comparing it to previous games of the series, it'd come out on a 7-(6.75 for those unfamiliar with +s and -'s).\n\nWorth a try if you like the series or the genre, do pass if it's not up your alley.\n\n","November 26, 2013","true","102.8"," 149 of 242 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","149","242","0","0"

My first observation about this game is why did they have to change around the name? What was so wrong with Heroes of Might & Magic?\n\nProbably the most important thing you need to know about this game is that it uses Ubisoft's draconian "always-on" DRM meaning that if the Ubi servers or god forbid, your own connection cuts out, you can expect to lose any progress since your last save and quite often get a corrupt save as well.\n\nHeroes is a very pretty game and disregarded the weird caching issues and the slow loading times it is a visually very impressive game.\n\nThe problem with this game however is that you aren't trying to win battles, you are trying to win battles without losing any units. Because the AI is 100% predictable this becomes more like a puzzle game quite quickly, trying to find the perfect tactic.\n\nMajor imbalance in the RPG system doesn't help either and this just feels like a game that was released purely to cash in on the name.","November 9, 2012","false","150.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

This is also the reason for the high number of hours in my profile. I spent them having it on in the background, waiting for Ubisoft to fix their &§$% DRM, not playing. In my opinion, having a DMR tool when a game is already on Steam is pointless, and then having it malfunction is close to unforgivable.\n\nAs for the game itself: I found it rather uninspired. It's a slightly more polished version of Heroes V, with a few units switched around, the option to convert all cities to your main type and control of mines regulated by capturing forts instead of individual mines. The latter is actually a good idea, but the former makes the game more boring. Storyline and animation are also seriously sub-par for the time it came out. Finally, the difficulty of maps seemed to stem more from the incresible amount of troops the AI could field and less from using those that it had effectively.\n\nAll in all: Don't buy this, save your money to get a complete edition of Heroes V (or better yet, Heroes IV).","November 29, 2013","false","45.6"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

It followed me through my childhood and youth and though I could never really get good at it, I still enjoyed the mechanics, visuals and the idea itself.\nNow we're at Might & Magic: Heroes VI and boy what a long way lies behind us. But what kind of game do we have now?\nI knew that UPlay would come along with this game so I struggled a long long time before I finally bought the series in a sale. After I played approx 2 hours I totally regret this decision. Why?\n1. Uplay. This thing is so clunky and annoying. It gives you nothing but yet another piece of software that somehow holds your games hostage. Ubisoft is one of the big publishers but seeing and using Uplay makes you think: damn, a bunch of small budget devs could have put together something better. Even the GOG Website is done better than Uplay. It's just an insult.\n2. The game keeps crashing. How is that even possible? This game is made by a damn big publisher and could have gotten several updates. But no, it keeps crashing 2 hours in the campaign. That is just not acceptable.\n3. The AI is a joke. They predict your moves and know everything you know. It is just no fun to play against an AI that has basically 0 element of surprise and just plays unfair. It sure reminds me of the old Rainbow Six days when the enemy AI had instant knowledge of your moves and actions as soon as you were 100m close. That is yet another insult and infuriates me.\n4. The interface is very questionable. While it looks kinda neat, it is just not useful. It is big, full of blingy graphics and other damn beautiful crap but hell it just does not appear useful in any way. Maybe we have grown to a "everything MUST be minimalistic" state of mind, still a strategy game does not need to be super shiny. It needs information on the spot, not after clicking and mouse overlays.\nI will try to get a refund as this is just not acceptable or at least playable. Yet another series ruined Ubisoft.

Consequently, losing a single unit on a single stack is enough to warrent a reload. The game has been out a long time and still the final 'dynasty perk' slot hasn't been unlocked for use; even at max level and with all DLC. Finally, the game has a random crashing issue that has yet to be resolved; the crash may occur within five minutes of starting or after six hours of play.\n\nDespite all this though, the game is surprisingly balanced (again, assuming all your recources are pooled to your main hero) and the units are refreshingly diverse across all races.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you're a fan of the series and have played one of the predecesors this game is a big disappointment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yukimoya/recommended/48220/","Yukimoya","Asamoya","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yukimoya/","69 products in account","I strongly recommend you play this game if you love turn based strategy games, RPG games, or are a sucker for a good story. Easily one of the best strategy games I have ever played (and I have played a hell of a lot!) - don't be scared of UPlay and Conflux (more on this later).\n\nThe game is at its core a Turn Based Strategy game, but also has strong RPG elements - levelling up, skill points, hero inventory, reputation points, faction variations etc.\nI would strongly suggest watching some YouTube videos to see how the game plays out.\nBriefly speaking you have a game map where you move your heroes around, collect various items/dynasty weapons for your hero's inventory as well as wood, ore, crystal, gold and fight neutrals. There are also various structures you can interact with which confer various bonuses, or grant units for your army etc.\nOn this map there are various towns and forts which you fight to capture, and once captured you build up to allow you to recruit more units, higher level units or get bonuses for your battles.\n\nBattles involve moving stacks of units around on a grid, destroying enemy stacks in a variety of ways. There are a large variety of units in the game, roughly 7 types per faction - each with an upgraded version so really 14 per faction. Units often have special abilities, like being able to puppet enemy units to do your bidding, or charge through stacks slaughtering ally and enemy alike. All the factions have very different units so it never gets boring.\n\nIn addition to units being moved around, your heroes can also use various abilities each turn, you can unlock more by spending skill points as you level up. There are loads of hero skills split in to Might types or Magic types, and these are futher classified into many sub-groups, too many to list here, but for instance for the Magic branch you have separate skill trees for Fire, Water, Light, Dark, Earth, Air, Prime (not all are accessible for each faction)\nHero Dynasty weapons can also grant more abilities, as can items - many items come in sets (Diablo style) and wearing the full set can give you some very nice bonuses.\n\nThere are Five factions in the main game (Haven, Inferno, Sanctuary, Stronghold, Necropolis), and a Sixth faction (Dungeon) in the expansion Shades of Darkness - which I also strongly recommend you get! Each faction has completely different units, different available skill trees, faction specific abilities, reputation abilities, different game play and look very different too.\n\nSound and music in the game is awesome, the battle sound track is stuck in my head.\nGraphics are amazing too; the detail on the maps, on the units, structures, flora is great. Even the main menu has switchable themes - all of which are great (personal favourite is the dungeon one).\nThe loading screens have some really nice drawings too, I had the Haven one as a wallpaper for some time.\nUnits have really nice animations, and even have idle animations - Dungeon's Assassin starts spinning his daggers above his head like helicopter rotor blades and gets lifted off his feet and then drops down headfirst (all an animation - has no effect on gameplay..!), Vampires start playing rock music and using their swords as an electric guitar - really shocked me the first time it happened -"where is that rock music coming from..?"\n\nThe storyline is amazing - I was eager to learn more just after the intro video!\nThe game is split into many different campaigns - each campaign has up to 4 missions. The core game has one tutorial campaign, and then one campaign for each of the five core factions. The expansions add four more campaigns.\n\nThe story is great but as the core campaigns all run simultaneously in the story chronology, it is possible to play one mission in one campaign and then ruin the story for yourself as you now know the outcome of another mission for another faction that you haven't played yet.\n\nI would recommend you play the Custom games and Campaign missions in the following order:\n\nHeart of Nightmares (Custom game accessed via the Custom game option in the main menu!), Prologue 1, Prologue 2, Stronghold 1, Sanctuary 1, Haven 1, Inferno 1, Necropolis 1, Stronghold 2, Sanctuary 2, Haven 2, Necropolis 2, Sanctuary 3, Stronghold 3, Inferno 2, Necropolis 3, Inferno 3, Sanctuary 4, Stronghold 4, Haven 3, Necropolis 4, Haven 4, Inferno 4, Epilogues, Pirates of the Savage Sea Campaign, Danse Macabre Campaign, Dungeon Campaign,  Necropolis Campaign 2.\n\nMaybe copy-paste that list into a text file somewhere and delete missions as you complete them!\n\nThe only issue some people have, is with UPlay. Upon installing the game via Steam, you may have issues launching the game. Just install the latest Uplay off the Ubisoft site, see this link: http://steamcommunity.com/app/48220/discussions/0/45350245398257355/\n\nAnother issue is that fighting neutrals can get repetitive as they are often so weak. Turn on Quick Battle in the options menu, and if you have a decent army, the battle will be resolved for you automatically.\n\nGameplay tips - The Reinforcements skill is the key to victory in most scenarios early on- use it on stacks that are going to attack / get attacked and you will never have any losses from your main army.\n\nIf you have other issues, just ask in the Steam Forum for the game, there are plenty of people that can help there!\n\nI'll say it again, I strongly recommend you play this game! Or you can just wait for Heroes of Might and Magic VII which is currently in development - can vote on factions to appear in the game etc on the developer's website!","October 25, 2014","true","272.9"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","24","37","2","0"

If this is the first game in the series you play you'll probably wonder why they made 6 of them considering what an absolute piece of unfun trash this one is. I would recommend this to new players even less than I would to fans because at least fans might appreciate some small scrap buried deep down in the remains of what is now barely recognizable as HoMM.\n\nOh, it's also horrendously buggy two years after release. It got I think 3 patches released before Ubisoft stopped supporting it and just started releasing DLC. This is nothing but a shameless cash grab, milking dry a classic franchise that could've had so much left to give if Ubisoft wasn't such a terrible company. They drove the original developers to bankruptcy and brought in a team of unknowns for a very short time after release to salvage the mess as much as they could - there were constant crashes and glitches that would totally halt your progress through a campaign mission and force a restart, and some of these persist to this day.\n\nAnd then there's the highly intrusive uPlay integration for those of you who dislike aggressive 3rd party DRM on your Steam games.\n\nOverall there is no reason for anyone to buy this game.

I have been playing heroes of might and magic since Heroes 2, and I think that they are one of the best games I've been following through my life. Good memories and good stories!\n\nWell first I wanna talk about how you are gonna start playing this game, as it's not just simply to click the game and start it. First of all you gotta make an account for uplay, which gives you a few "presents" if you play the game enough. It is also saving your save into a cloud using this program. After saving "save password and log in automaticly" you won't see much more of this problem, as the game will enter as you click the Heroes 6 icon.\n\nNow at the menu screen you see a whole lot of buttons! Confusing? Ye, a bit maybe. Some of it are related to social stuff, like skype, while there is also a store you can buy different titles, icons and heroes + some abillities for your hero. The important reason for Uplay here is that you can go to a page: http://heroes-6-conflux.us.ubi.com/soulforge to upgrade weapons, and litterary do the same thing as ingame, except the weapons part.\n\nSo so far you have: Made uplay account, seen the store, seen the page where you can upgrade weapons.\n\nPhew! Now that that is written, lets take a look at the game.\n\nThe first I realised is how much time it takes for each level to load. It is pretty slow, but I'll guess you gotta live with it. The levels are also quite big, but I'll take that after I've talked about a very known problem. As I played the first level and got into a fight, everything went black...and this problem occured to me over and over and over and over again, until I made it a common thing to quicksave after every single battle. Luckily I found a solution online for my nvidia graphic card that recommended you to go into the controll panel (for nvidia graphic card), 3D setup and pick the game. Then put the option so you only pick the Nvidia graphic card. I have a laptop, so it shows two graphic cards. Click the named graphic card, and not the integrated one.\n\nAs we have now solved everything we can finally play! The game got huge magnificant levels, with lots of nice music, sounds and hours on hours to play the game. In the previous games of heroes 6 there might have been alot more levels per campain, which for me made it easier to play. These campain levels are huge, and even the tutorial level will require a few hours to get through.\n\nHeroes are also built point by point, through a skill tree. Kinda good idea, but really different from the earlier games. I am not sure if I liked it that much in the start, but it got better as you learnt it. Towns are almost the same as before, and the gameplay is pretty much the same.\n\nAs I now have played through 4 campains I can say that the story and campains are really good. You follow the story about Duke Slavas "children", and all of them got an affliction with one of the different playable teams that heroes 6 offers. I think that's kinda cool, because every team is different and every hero got their own story. As the teams are different you will allways have to play a different way with them. You can also pick might or magic afflication, which means you will excell in one of them (Might = can use armor, Magic = more items for a mage).\n\nI said earlier that the gameplay was mostly the same, but there is a huge difference. The way of telling the story this time is chatboxes, with dialogue. This works really nice, and makes you able to follow the history when you finish of tasks/quests/missions to do, and move on.\n\nI feel the AI, even on normal can be a bit dumb, and can sometimes feel like it's pretty easy to win. There was one level I remember that I spent a few days on to complete, but it was the layout of it, that made it hard, and the fact that the enemy had so much more than me.\n\nThe last thing I am gonna talk about is dynasty weapons. You find them in different campain levels and you can upgrade em from level 1-5 either using your hero (getting experience for the weapon), and level it like that, or use the link I put in the start of this. If you use the page it takes 10 minutes (level 2), 1 hour (level 3), 24 hours (level 4) and 2 weeks to complete level 5. I would recommend levelling a weapon if you plan to use it on a character. It goes faster, than the two weeks.\n\nANYWAY! The game has been great, all though it takes up alot of time to complete. Some things are new and you just got to get used to it. Eventually you will, after spending so much time on it. Would recommend playing on normal, which should be suitable for most people.\n\nEnjoy the game, and please like this recommandation if you feel it's good.\n\nP.S. Still got 3 campains for the main game, 2 DLCs and the expansion pack left, so I am far from done, but what is written here is what thoughts I've had so far.","April 24, 2015","true","276.2"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","18","28","3","0"

I've played every single HoMM, and this one is the worst of the series in my opinion.\n\nFirst thing, Uplay... So many things wrong with this.. The fact that you're basically forced to be online, or miss part of  the game...\nOnline saves can't be saved on your machine and so CANNOT be continued offline... Who's the incompetent fool who thought it was a good idea????\n\nSecond, the AI... GOD THIS AI IS SO DUMB... I cast an ice storm on his ranged units, so for 3/4 turns, they will take dmg because the ai IS TOO DUMB TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY. Same with every kinda traps you can think of. AI have a very simple pattern in how they attack and move their troops, and the precense of traps or ice storms in my case doesn't change their strategy.\nA simple example. With haven, I left my sisters right behind 2 stacks of praetorians, but within range of the ai. Unapgraded sisters are useless yet the ai desperately tries to kill them. So he goes after the sisters, triggerring counterattacks from both praetorian stacks... resulting in a stupidily easy victory despite him outnumbering me 3 to 1...\nThat brings me to the second issue, AI's only way to pose a challenge is he WILL outgrow you no matter what you do. Even with 5 bases to 1 he will get more units than you, because developpers somehow couldn't design a smart AI so they just went and made him grow large armies to simulate difficulty.\nLeading again to another problem. As a result, you cannot take your time to explore a map because you have to rush to defeat the ai before he does grow to large to have any hope of defeating... or in some maps you cannot afford to lose units in any battle cough *undead campaign* cough...\n\nMy next  issue is more personnal, but I hate the new way you level your heroes and manage their spells and abilities. Really makes me feel like I have to grind my hero to get him the necessary abilities.\n\nThe current factions feel also less unique. I guess they attempted to balance them out (with more or less success) but now they feel more or less the same.\n\nOn the plus side, the story is rather interesting to follow, the graphics are good, and you can customize teams in multiplayer battles (and yes I hated that I couldn't make the teams in HoMM 5)\n\nMy advice is, take your favourite previous version or HoMM and stick to playing that one.

Actually, I played more of this game offline than online (mainly because for a long period of time after buying it, I had no regular access to internet from home), although Ubisoft implemented a punishment for doing so by not alowing you to collect rewards after finishing scenarios of the campaign. So yeah, always online is kind of mandatory and I think that is pretty lame.\n\nBut I also have concerns about the game. Now Ok it is pretty and all there is no denying that, but there are some really bad design decisions in my opinion. For example, when you want to attack a enemy unit, you have to do it in one step, meaning that if for any reason you misclick and end up right in the square where you wanted to be but failed to issue the attack order, you cannot do it anymore. Another example is your hero who can cast spells and also attack, actions you have to take as long as one of your units still have the possibility to act; move all your units and that's it, your hero action is lost. I recently obtained a more stable internet connection and decided to get over with Uplay/always effing online but those "features" quickly annoyed/bored me.\n\nOtherwise, again, the game is good looking for sure, but it is also really different from the cult HOMM3 or the more than respectable HOMM5. Some would say "overly simplified" (aiming at a casual audience?) as the several resources of its elders are gone (now its just gold, wood, ore and a unique "special" one). The hero progression is also completely rehauled and despite not going into it too deeply (played like 20 hours offline and 2 hours online) it did not appeal to me so much I shall say, as again it seems to lack the diversity and options found in previous installement of the series.\n\nIt is not a bad game (and I am happy I only wasted 75% of its price considering how little this episode of the franchise appeals to me - luckily I tried the demo and it only convinced me half-way so I waited for a sale) but it is far from having excellent game mechanics and in any way a good and contemporary implementation of the latter. I wished focus had been put more on making the game fun than on making it pretty to look at. Ultimately I wished Ubi's vision had been slightly less autoritarian, paranoid and business focused and a bit more into catering respectfully the heart of the gamers who contributed to make HOMM a great franchise by supporting it over more than 20 years.\n\nMost likely if you never played any previous iterations, this may still be a "shiny" introduction to the franchise as it certainly has the best graphics and accessibility. Veterans of the franchise though may be wary/reluctant to buy this one (although for most it is too late I guess) and maybe the next iteration "VII".","September 10, 2015","false","2.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's a much better game. Or maybe try some of the older ones, they're pretty good and absolutely hold up in this day and age (the third one's even better than the fifth, if you ask some people).\n\nHOMM6 requires you to use Uplay in addition to Steam. This leads to a whole bunch of issues (Steam not tracking your playtime, game refusing to launch for this or that reason, you get the idea). It also introduces a weird element of meta-progression (called "the Dynasty", essentially a way to get incremental advantages by playing a lot of games. It offers some things like additional equipment and passive abilities for your heroes. Luckily, all this can be turned off in the skirmish mode). IMO, the meta-progression is an absolutely pointless and token addition to the game, as it adds no real depth. Pointless unlocks didn't make HOMM the venerable franchise that it is right now, it was the profoundness and quality of its gameplay that laid the foundation of its popularity.\n\nTo add insult to injury, this one's essentially abandonware. The people behind the vanilla HOMM6 went bankrupt after the game's release, and Ubisoft passed development rights from one team to another before finally dropping all support for the game completely. As a result, HOMM6 is still kinda raw and incredibly buggy. Check the forums, there's a sticky thread with a list of major game-breaking bugs that you'll have to try and play around if you dare purchase this one. Personally, I haven't encountered any of those, but that may be just because I wasn't able to play the game for long. It simply stopped launching for me at one point, after hanging up on me for like three times in a row whenever I tried to save. Also, after uninstalling the game, I found a bunch of 1,5- to 3,5-gig files in my savegame folder. Yeah, the game basically crapped into my C drive as a final "screw you". The sad thing is that the game itself isn't terrible, really. Still, probably not worth your money.

For me, Heroes 5 was the pinnacle of the series and every step 6 takes is a step backwards in my opinion.  Here are the 5 biggest problems I have:\n\n1. The AI programming completely ruins the game.  In the single player campaign, the AI does not play with the same rules or even close to the same rules as the player.  Every creep monster it encounters runs from it, which allows it to pillage everything on the map as quickly as it can walk to it.  It also doesn't actually build its cities up.  It starts with a predefined city build and just gets flooded with many times more troops per week than the player gets.  Additionally, defeated AI heroes respawn with very large armies.  This forces you to rush through every map as quickly as possible because the longer you give the AI, the exponentially more numerous his army becomes.  Its rate of growth is far beyond what you can keep up with.\n\n2. The skill system is awful.  Every hero has some base stats and beyond that, they are all otherwise exactly the same since every hero can be trained in any skill you want.  Have a warrior?  Spend your skill points and turn him into a spell caster.  Have a wizard?  Spend some skill points and make him the strongest warrior on the map.  It's silly.\n\n3.  You can convert towns to different factions.  Some people surprisingly like this, but its actually just a bandaid to help compete with the terribly unbalanced/poorly scripted AI.  Yes, with just a few ore, wood and gold, you can convert any town of any faction to your faction.  Just like magic, instantly.  Again, it's just stupid.\n\n4.  The campaigns aren't really campaigns.  You can bounce around between campaigns mission by mission and ironically have to in order to actually follow the story chronologically.  It basically kills any attempt to keep a coherent story line going.\n\n5.  It has 2 additional layers of DRM.  Uplay is bad enough, but the Heroes 6 "Conflux" always on internet connection requirement is just too painful to bear since half the time it doesn't even connect.  There are plenty of times where you can't play the game because the conflux servers are down.\n\nAll in all, the game is a nice looking, shallow disaster.  Avoid this like syphillis.","April 6","false","48.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Seems like the devs have copied most of the pages of the Bad Gameplay Manual. Forget making your own unique hero in the campaigns, unless you spec them very specifically and very carefully then it's close to impossible to beat the missions.\nAs side for the super cheating AI with it's heros respawning with full armies, the game is rather good. Has some good features and nice visuals. It also feels less cluttered unlike its older cousins in the HoMM series. I think they recycled the music from HoMM V though as I feel as if I have heard every track before.\nBut my issue is and remain the super cheater AI and the lack of creative freedom in the campaigns and possibly custom games thus why I will not be recommending this game to anyone.

It is another installment in Might & Magic franchise.\n\nMight & Magic: Heroes VI has kinda unique gameplay, you start with one castle, develop it, build a barracks, train troops in a turn-based gameplay, but to move your troops around you will need a hero. When you move your hero and the troops he command around, you can engage random enemy, found resources or found something that may upgrade your heroes, increase experience or even someone to join your troops.

You're often forced to just skip turns in order to build strong enough an army to defeat a final opponent, who is, btw, just passively waiting in his own castle.\n\nThe story isn't written badly, but the overall experience is worse than Heroes V and not anywhere near its predecessors.\n\nLastly, the game isn't very well optimized. It doesn't look bad, but for what you get, it actually demands way more than it should off of your PC.

I'm HOMAM veteran and I've spend countless hours on third one, some time with fifth and I wasn't prepared for this.\n\nWhat it is? Difficulty. I wasn't able to finish first level of this game. I've completed tutorial campaign without any problems, then after playing first mission for two hours, I've realized I just can't win against AI player that suddenly appeared with army three times big that I had. I wasn't feeling like wasting two hours on every try, which is very nice if you're a game designer and you want to make your game feel incredibly longer, but it's abysmal if you're just a simple player. So I went to steam forums and found out that every mission is pretty much meant to be played one of two ways, and if you do anything else, you won't make it.\n\nAnd that's why I've stopped playing. I've actually liked how game's story continued, it was nice and well put together. Graphics are decent, soundtrack too and overall, I would be gladly playing the game, if it wasn't for this crippling difficulty. Their idea was to make few levels, but as difficult as possible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/recommended/48220/","zirune","zirune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/","991 products in account","This review is written with players of previous games in the series (III and/or V specifically) in mind. If you haven't played those before, I'd recommend playing either of them instead, as I feel they are both significantly better games.\n\nFirst and foremost, the game runs pretty poorly for me. I have an Nvidia card, so I have to work around the game to stop it from freezing every second time I enter a battle. Even with the workaround of changing the priority and CPU affinity (which I have to do every time I boot the game, unless I want to revert to an old GPU driver just for this one game), I still get the occasional freeze, mostly when attacking castles. The loading times are long and annoying, to the point where there's actually a loading screen the first time you enter a town. It takes a good 5-10 seconds of blackscreen to load a castle fight, while other fights barely load at all for whatever reason. Granted, I don't have an SSD, but really...\n\nSkills and spells aren't random, instead you choose 1 ability or spell to add or upgrade. The amount of skills rivals V's skill and sub-skill system, but there are far, far fewer spells (since you can only pick 1 per level, instead of just visiting a mage guild).\n\nUnits are pooled, so you can buy units from anywhere in your kingdom in any castle or fort that has access to the appropriate dwelling. Towns also have buildings that allow you to teleport to other towns by casting a spell, with some restrictions. Sounds good, but it leads to (at least against AI) stacking all your units on 1 hero and simply bulldozing through everything, because you can always just teleport to any castles that need defending. To add on to that, you can convert dwellings, castles, and forts to your faction, meaning a Necropolis player can convert a Dungeon castle into a Necropolis by paying resources and sacrificing buildings that can't be converted. Because of these things, you're going to end up having massive armies on 1 hero in pretty much every (PvC) game, which is extremely boring.\n\nThe number of resources has been cut down; there is now only Gold, Wood, Ore, and Crystal, where Crystal is the rare substance and the other three are as they are in previous games. It leads to less situations where, for example, a Stronghold in III doesn't have the crystal to get cyclops or behemoths, hamstringing them. It does make everything feel samey, though, with resource costs practically the same across the board.\n\nCastles and forts have a zone of control around them. What this does is prevent enemy heroes from taking any dwellings or mines within their zone unless that hero stays put at that building. So no more annoying heroes running through and taking all your mines and dwellings while you're away. Hurray! It does pretty clearly telegraph who owns a castle nearby, though, since you can see a big blob of their colour on the minimap representing the zone.\n\nTowns are also structured a lot differently. There are almost no prerequisites in the manner that there are in III and V; you just need a certain level town hall for most of them. There are no more Tier 1 - Tier 7 creature dwellings; instead there are 3 tier 1 (called "core"), 3 tier 2 (called "elite"), and 1 tier 3 (called "champion"), and none of the dwellings are required to build any other dwellings. All towns have the same dwellings (though obviously with different units for the faction), town hall, fortifications (which only increase creature growth by 1 instead of 50/100% like in previous games), the marketplace, the previously mentioned portal buildings, the ultimate building which is equivalent to the Grail or Tear of Asha building from previous games, and a hall of heroes for hiring heroes plus its upgrade to resurrect them. Literally the only difference between factions' towns is two unique buildings (a tier 2 and a tier 3), each of which has two possible options. There's usually one with an effect that works in the town's control zone and one that's global; the tier 2 generally improves the faction's unique ability, and the tier 3 is generally something strong that fits the theme of the faction.\n\nHeroes also (by default; you can speed it up for non-campaign games) seem to level really slowly, which really hampers the game, since your spells are directly tied to your level in addition to regular old abilities. I might not have looked hard enough at exactly how fast you level, but it at least feels a lot slower.\n\nUnit speeds in battles are almost the same across the board; melee and flying units can generally move across the board in 2 turns with few exceptions, and without even looking it up I honestly doubt there's a unit in the game with a speed under 5 (the size of a normal field, for reference, is 12 wide and 10 high) and I doubt there are many, if any, with a speed above 8. There just aren't slow units like Dendroids or Zombies or wicked-fast units like Archangels that can cover massive ground even when slowed. As mentioned before, creatures are split up into 3 tiers instead of 7, meaning all factions have 3 creatures with similar stats, 3 stronger creatures with similar stats, and then their truly unique top-tier creature. Just like towns, creatures often feel samey.\n\nThey also went back to the III style of turns (as opposed to V) in part; units with the highest Initiative go first (Initiative and Speed are split like in V, meaning the unit that can travel furthest doesn't also automatically go first), and each unit gets one action in the round, unless they get good morale, which gives them an immediate second turn with reduced speed, damage, and the inability to use abilities. I'm pretty indifferent to this, but I feel like V's system of not having 'rounds' has more potential and variety available.\n\nLike in V, each faction has a unique ability they can use in battle. They each charge up in a different way and have a different function. Necropolis can resurrect troops (surprise!), and the ability is charged up when units (enemy or friendly, though friendly charge it faster) take damage, while Sanctuary can buff their units' stats and charge by attacking any unit that hadn't already been attacked in the round.\n\nThere's also boss fights and other unique encounters with special fields or conditions. So far I've played 2 non-tutorial campaign missions to the end, and both had a unique fight at the end. In one, you control a boss fighting against a massive army. I happened to be playing on the hardest difficulty for this, which made that army really massive, to the point where I just gave up, since a little bit of bad luck or an imperfect move could easily turn the battle to a loss just like that. In the other, you have a certain number of turns to kill a massive army of units that all have No Enemy Retaliation and Strike & Return. I know, fun. This one was pretty easy after I took a practice attempt to figure it out.\n\nRandom maps. They're not in the game. At all. And there aren't even a whole lot of custom game maps, either. It's sad. I'd even take V's pretty bad random generator over none. Really disappointing.\n\nThen there's the Dynasty. There a meta progression thing going on, where you earn passive abilities, weapons, and things like that by playing the game. Naturally, these things only work when you're online, and only when you're *always* online. I don't know how strict it is, but I do know that one time I started a map, disconnected a few seconds in, and was promptly booted from the game. Not simply disabling the Dynasty, seeing as I'm not playing against other people and so it likely doesn't matter if they're enabled or not. Kicked from my own player vs. computer game; that type of behaviour doesn't typically endear a person to a game.\n\nIt also requires Uplay.\n\nIf you don't have Heroes III or V, get one of those instead. If you absolutely need more Heroes, I'd recommend getting II or perhaps even IV or I after that.","December 29, 2013","false","17.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The list of fails is too long for this topic.\nI advise all players to try Heroes of Might and Magic III (or King's Bounty series)  - there you will see the great game mechanics and exellent balance between towns.\nToo sad that for 15 years no one developer didn't learn anything from old school heroes - greed and hunger for glory are bad friends and advisors.\n11.30.2013 i've tested HMM VI Shades of Darkness - game balance still 0: too many small numbers of buffs and debuffs make solo game without Ubisoft "Conflux" and bonuses from dynasty imposible - AI cheating too much (even know how to intercept you when you don't expect it).\nSo my recomendation still true.\nIn general - too many artwork (units has very good view) but no game mechanics, no HMM potential (combined forces from other towns, no working stats (example: vampire under your command do less and receive more dmg then under AI command - even your physical attack and defence equal to AI opponent), useless skills, teaching magic for skill points, level cap 30),\n\nP.S. I don't know who's responsible for this DLC...don't waste your money.\nP.P.S. Buy King's Bounty game series - much more fun and true legacy of HMM III (especially new one: Warrior of the North).","July 14, 2012","false","155.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The games scratch that wonderful itch i get for a tactical RPG but in a western setting and normally do a great job of hitting the balance between tactical thinking and forward planning but with a lot of the fanbase, we noticed a lot was up when the brand name changed from "Heroes of Might and Magic" to "Might and Magic : Heroes", a change that made no sense. This whole trend - Changing of the brand - follows it through the whole game. From simple changes like how the battles play out to multiplayer being a "create your own hero" rather then having a list of heroes. It feels like less work was put into this game, just to test the waters to see if people cared. It's a little hard to explain what went wrong. First off, the story is set BEFORE the heroes 5 game (a game i really rather enjoyed) which means not a lot of the events are really explained outside of "AND THIS COULD MEAN STUFF LATER", with some rather dull line-reads and the Haven once again being kinda just used as "We totally are good guys, but...", the lack of effort in the story keeps the story going for far far too long and by the time you are doing anything considered fun, you are passed bored.\n\nHave i mentioned the bugs? 2 years. No patches outside of basic ones. The game STILL forces me into offline mode. It says i've played 1.7 hours but im over 100 hours. I wanted with all my heart to like the multiplayer but after a while, it just gets boring when my heroes skills are chosen by me. I like random for a reason. :(\n\nJust...skip it.

If you loved Heroes 5, you'll probably like this one as well, but I can see why some of the die hards would complain.\n\nPros:\n-It's Heroes. I've played the incarnations of this game since the original, and have enjoyed every version (except for 4, seriously what were they thinking).\n-Every creature has a special ablility. I like that, because it means if you only have low level guys, you can still use stratagy to outwitt a larger army.\n-There's a bunch of new creatures to explore.\n-All of the town types are evenly matched. I found in the previous games Necromancers (my favorite) had generally weaker monsters compared to other towns, but would make up for it with numbers as you fought. The Necromancy skill has changed in this one so you don't mass up a swarm of skeletons from your enemy's corpses, but your army can hold it's onw anyway.\n\n\nCons:\n-U-Play. I've never liked using U-Play, and this game is the best example of why. Aside from the bulky and unecessary U-Play shell that runs, you have to have a connection to their server to access most of the game. Also, if you're not connected, you can't access any of your saved games. And most annoying is the autosave. I found that after about two weeks of in game play, my computer would bog down to the point of freezing the game. I was able to fix the problem by not allowing the auto save, but that means I have to save my game myself often.\n-Skills. I honestly don't know what I don't like about the new level up skills format, but something about it rubs me the wrong way. I do like that you have to earn your spells by leveling up, but there is something about the new system that just feels .... blah.\n-Enemy Heroes are really tough. In a custom map, you can spend a couple hours building up your castle and hero. You'll find that the random map monsters are fairly easy to dispatch, but then an enemy hero will show up. "Holy Crap, where'd he get that army from?" or "How did he vaporize my stack of creatures with that one lightning bolt?" I find them wickedly powerful. The campaign though, which I havn't yet finished, seems much easier.\n-You really only need one hero. You beef up one guy and go smashing. If an enemy is sneeking up on your castle, no problem, just use your town gate spell and you're home. It's also too easy to get your hero back every time. While I get nobody wants to loose their big main hero, I find this takes away the stratagy of defense for your castles.\n\nOverall, I do enjoy the game and would suggest it to anyone, both fans of the series and newcomers alike!","October 29, 2014","true","199.9"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","21","38","0","1"

They did not update the map items titles "Episode Name goes here...".\nAfter some time I was not able to get to start a new game because the buttons were disabled but at one point after 15m or so the UI resets and "boom" the Start button enables.\nFinally after a lot of frustration the game starts and I get to do the first Campaign map (offline mode) but after finishing up I got bored because it was the same game play I was experiencing on prev versions and nothing new to it to make me excited to continue. If you played Heroes before and got bored after so many repeating game play you will probably have that right from the start now.\nOn the map there are items that you cannot interact with in Offline mode and after 5 days of trying the game never connected.\nAlso advancing from a map to another the menu is not letting you to select items in Offline mode.","February 27, 2014","false","53.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Content is either dulled down or absent entirely, and not just small things, but entire factions. There is also no alternative creature upgrade tree, meaning each factions has one less of each troop type than TotE. Action camera seems to be absent entirely from combat, which is slower than the previous game. Heroes no longer have their own turn in combat, but can instead cast a spell when on a creatures turn. UI is smaller but more cluttered, making for a worse experience. There is no map generator for custom games, which is terrible.\n\nI cannot recommend this over the previous entry other than for online features, or a prettier but clumsier presentation.

The older I get, the more I find that DRM stacking is a dealbreaker. It's true, perhaps I am remiss in basing my overall recommendation on game design itself, but I will not recommend a game that has an extra DRM gate attached to it, ever.\n\nHere are some of the things I think are interesting, though:\n\nPROS\nWorthy addition to the HoMM series - all the things you've come to know if you're a fan of the series. Interesting monsters, magic spells, hero development.\n\nGood graphics.\n\nI like the Hero development system, which allows for many different styles of play, each of which peaks in power at a different point in development. Might heroes are generally more powerful early on, then Magic heroes dominate. Hybrid heroes are strong midgame. Finally, at maximum level, the power levels are back in synch. I like this pattern, as it informs my strategy as the game progresses.\n\n\n\nCONSSO much like previous HoMM games that it's hard to see why you wouldn't just play one of those. For the money, HoMM V can be purchased with all extant expansions, and that's a better value.\n\nDRM stacking. Get ready to log into Steam only to have to remember another set of credentials to log into UbiSoft's UPLAY service. You can't play the game properly without it. Internet down? Sorry, you miss out on content.\n\nVoice acting is... well, sometimes it borders on the offensive.

The Heroes of Might & Magic (HOMM) games definitely represent a dated turn-based playstyle that is not for everyone and also seems very hard to improve upon which is why I think each new HOMM game release basically mimics the previous version although with better graphics and a few tweaks here and there.\n\nHeroes VI unfortunately does have a few issues:\n- The computer AI just isn't challenging even when played at the toughest level.\n- Game crashes are problematic.  A common one I come across fequently occurs when in combat agains griffins and they try to use their special attack.  At one point after a crash I was simply unable to load any saved game period even after re-installing the game and was forced to start from the beginning again.\n- Although not technically an issue, I have a strong dislike to having to log into both Steam and UPlay in order to play this basically single player based game!","March 26","false","979.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

The combat is about the only thing that keeps this game together, as the rest is really sort of meh. Options are limited / dumbed down, there's only 1 way to go for most heroes for optimum effect and the AI cheats their asses off to a point where it's just frustrating, rather than a challenge.\n\nAnd let's not talk about the multiplayer, or the lack of a proper working one and there's no LAN option at all. It's absolutely horrid and Ubisoft refuses to fix the problem, or even reply to the made complaints. In my case (and many others) I get 'out of sync' after 50 or so turns. I reload the game from 7-10 turns ago, still 'out of sync'. This happens with every multiplayer game.\n\nIt's rather hard to recommend the game because of these flaws, but, the combat is really well executed.\nIt may be better to get this when it's 80% off or something, it's deffinatly not worth the full price. That said, I forgot to leave out that it has the Uplay requirement and after that, you're required to be always online (yes, it will kick you out of a single player game if you disconnect).","November 29, 2013","false","114.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

A few nice concepts, but not well executed. Story isn't bad, though let down by horrid voice acting. Seriously, King's Bounty had better voice acting. Destiny stuff is a neat idea, though all of the extra heroes were free for me, maybe from DLC? The music is mostly ripped off from HOMM5 and reochestrated, so it's alright. I do like the idea that your hero can go on any allied turn instead of having to wait for a specific place in the initiative. Also, when you recruit from a town, It automatically recruits from surrounding structures and other forts etc. No wait time, the troops are just there (by magic I assume). Saves time on re-arming, even if it makes no damn sense.\n\nCons: HOLY CRAP IS THE VOICE ACTING BAD. Necromancy is nerfed to uselessness, The other racial abilities are frankly meh, All heroes have all of the same abilities to pick from, and spells are just abilities. You get to pick one per level essentially, and a lot of the core spells aren't there (No summoning to speak of, no raise dead, almost no direct damage spells.) Nice 3D rendered towns like HOMM5 you can circle around in? Nope! Static images with overlays. Also, the interface overlay crawls, even if the rest of the game runs great (AMD quad core, Geforce 560)\n\nThe real shame is the sheer homoginization of the play styles accross races. Since all heroes have the same ability access and trees, you just pick the tactic you like and then hang some set dressing on it by picking a race. Literally no other flavor involved.\n\nThe units are a nice mix, but they all are roughly the same at each tier. Also the AI is balls. Aims for highest tier, or ranged and ignores everything else. Sieges are about as challenging as water baloon fights.\n\nAlso adds in the idea of territory control, which is kind of nice and kind of dumb. To control a mine or sawmill etc, you have to control the fort or town it is in the territory of. You don't get any resources from it unless your hero is parked on it otherwise it continues pumping to the local town as normal. This would be neat if you could at least stop production from it by attacking it and sacking it, thus denying resources, but no, the moment you leave it it just reverts back. So again, cool idea, with a flaw in execution.\n\nOverall, if I had played a demo of this game, I would not have bought it. I payed $10 on the autumn sale and uninstalled it within 24 hours, and wish I had my $10 back.","November 30, 2013","false","27.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I really like strategy games, especially strategy games that take a long time to actually complete. With many customization options, you can really craft the game you are really wanting. Anyway, on to pros and cons...\n\nPros-\n\nGraphics, simply put, amazing. The graphics for the characters and enviroments are completely what I was expecting from this game at this time. The characters themselves look really good, although they have limited animations, so the characters tend to get a little boring, but that isn't really a big problem.\n\nControls, the controls are very efficient and very user friendly. You can complete your turn with only a few clicks if you use the menues correctly.\n\nInterface, the interface for the overworld if very nice, you get all of the important information right in front of you with the ability to make changes on the spot.\n\nCombat, personally my favorite part! The combat is similar to the games previous to this one, but in this one the combat is more user friendly, but also doesn't reduce the amount of strategicness (strategicness isn't a word, but you get it). Combat is played like a turn based RPG, just picture a literal boardgame and that is exactly what it feels like. Your hero doesn't actually take part in the combat on the board, but does attacks and skills from the sideline. This is not a common thing in games like this, but this game has done a great job at doing it this way.\n\nLocal Multiplayer/Hotseat, I am giving this its own section, because it is just plain amazing! Although having a large group of people playing on one computer may seem at first inefficient and slow, playing with friends is great fun. Being a Dungeon Master (Game Master of Dungeons&Dragons) has taught me that bringing people together to interact with something is a great way to have fun with your friends. Anyway, moving on now...\n\nCons-\n\nRepetitive, the game can seem repetitive after playing it a while. The combat is basically the same thing every time, so I can see where people can get tired of this game quickly (personally, I am fine with the repetitive nature of it).\n\nCampaign, although the campaign was overall nice and what was to be expected from Might & Magic, it just didn't get me into the story. The story itself didn't really seem relavent to the game itself, the game could have been completely fine without even having the campaign. The voice acting just didn't seem realistic/believable enough was another issue with the campaign.\n\nOther than those minor flaws, this is overall an amazing game that I definitely recommend.\n\nConclusion-\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a gameplay experience similar to any number of classic tabletop roleplaying games. It is a fun game and it is especially fun if you have others to play it with. Strategy games are perhaps my favorite kind of games, and this one is high on my list of recommended ones for sure.\n\nMay your adventures be many and always end in reward!\n-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League","July 21, 2015","true","7.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I'd put it in my top 15, I would say. Yeah, its not AS good as Heroes of Might and Magic 3, but I still think its a pretty great time. The visuals are colorful, vibrant and very easy on the eyes. The gameplay was just as addicting as its always been in the HoMM series, wanting to do just one more turn before you left the game, eventually with the sun rising in your window. I also really liked the new addition of the Tears/Blood system, with getting special abilities depending on how you play and all that. I also loved the new faction, Sanctuary. Now, there are some missteps in all of this, of course. One, as the majority have mentioned, is the DRM. And I do have to agree that Uplay can be quite an annoyance, almost more so than Origin half the time. I will say that I have had less issues with it than I have had with Games for Windows Live, but that's not saying much. There is also a lack of factions. Not saying I need ten of them or anything, but just a couple more for a bit more variety. One of my favorite things to do as a kid was playing through all the different factions of HoMM 3, and wish I could have a similar experience with this one. Overall, I still think this game is worth picking up, especially with its sales prices. But if you really hate clients such as Uplay and Origin(which by all means, I understand) then I would say you should probably skip it, as it can cause issues. If not, and you enjoy strategy/turn based rpg's, then this is a great entry to a fantastic, venerable series. 9.4/10.","January 2, 2015","true","266.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Indeed, I'm staying in Indonesia, and don't have a great internet connection, so every once in a while I just get booted from games because my internet connection stops for 10 seconds. Not to mention that I can't ccess save games without internet connection, or have my progress registered.\nYou can in fact play the whole game in offline mode, and forgo a level bonus, so it's definitely worth bearig that in mind before you jump into the campaigns. But I cannot stress enough how useless, unsupportive, and interfering the presence of Uplay is, and what a terrible drain its methodology is on games like thiswhich should be aa lot of unhampered fun, I'm honestly losing track of how many levels of DRM are being demanded at once, and am not totally convinced that is the sole purpose of the wanton invasion of my computer that seems so populr amongst game developers!!!!!","April 28, 2015","false","80.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For those who have been with the series for a long time, it's a bit of a mash-up between III and V. For the rest, I'll break it down into PROS and CONS, since I know that helps me when I'm looking through reviews at games.\n\nPROS\n- Separate campaign for each faction. You might not think it's a big thing, but it is. Very exciting for each faction to get their own story in some shape or form, for those who enjoy playing campaigns.\n- Familiar but different resource management. Gone are the days of managing common resources (wood & ore) and a slew of uncommon ones (mercury, crystal, sulfur, gems)... plus your gold income. With VI we are down to just wood, ore, and crystal, and while it seems strange at first it actually balances out rather well.\n- Forts and the ability to convert dwellings & towns to your own faction. No more hodge-podge army. Oh, and you can recruit all available units at any town you have that has the dwelling for it. So you don't need a train of 3+ extra heroes to keep bringing new units to your main.\n- Skill points. Tons of options to customize your hero as they level, and while your might-based heroes can still take magic-based abilities, you tend to get more bang-for-your-buck sticking with the same theme.\n- Champion units are CHAMPIONS. HoMM3 is great, but a glaring point that you cannot overlook is that some level 6 units were just better than the faction's level 7 (I'm looking at you, Necropolis). This installment has units divided into three "tiers": Units 1-3 are your Core units, 4-6 are Elite, and your 7 is your Champion. Within the same tier you won't see much power difference, but there are noticeable leaps between tiers, especially between Elite and Champion. Regardless of your faction, your Champion unit will be a force to reckon with.\n- Melee units can damage walls in a siege! Yes, you read that correctly. Previously when laying siege, you relied on your range and fliers while your catapult took its sweet time bringing those walls down. No more! Send those ground-pounders in to beat down the gate with their bare hands.\n\nCONS\n- Skill points. The skills and abilities are so numerous that going through them to pick the one (1) you want to spend your point on for the level you just got might take a bit.\n- Spells. WAY fewer spells than any previous HoMM installment. Spells are integrated into your skills as well, which will be confusing at first. You also don't have a Mage Guild in your town anymore, since spells are directly tied to your hero and faction.\n- Interactives do not stand out well. Call it a side-effect of the nicer graphics the game is running, similar to HoMM5, but it is easy to miss interactive buildings and items on the map due to blending so well with the background.\n\nIn all a solid game that is most certainly worth your time if it's on sale. I see a lot of negative reviews because it installs and launches through Origin, but I cannot say I have ever run into a problem with it nor do I find it to be a hindrance to playing a game I enjoy.","March 19, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, 'Uplay' is a pain, so what's new I hear you ask. Indeed, I'm staying in Indonesia, and don't have a great internet connection, so every once in a while I just get booted from games because my internet connection stops for 10 seconds. Not to mention that I can't ccess save games without internet connection, or have my progress registered.\nYou can in fact play the whole game in offline mode, and forgo a level bonus, so it's definitely worth bearig that in mind before you jump into the campaigns. But I cannot stress enough how useless, unsupportive, and interfering the presence of Uplay is, and what a terrible drain its methodology is on games like thiswhich should be aa lot of unhampered fun, I'm honestly losing track of how many levels of DRM are being demanded at once, and am not totally convinced that is the sole purpose of the wanton invasion of my computer that seems so populr amongst game developers!!!!!","April 28, 2015","false","80.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For those who have been with the series for a long time, it's a bit of a mash-up between III and V. For the rest, I'll break it down into PROS and CONS, since I know that helps me when I'm looking through reviews at games.\n\nPROS\n- Separate campaign for each faction. You might not think it's a big thing, but it is. Very exciting for each faction to get their own story in some shape or form, for those who enjoy playing campaigns.\n- Familiar but different resource management. Gone are the days of managing common resources (wood & ore) and a slew of uncommon ones (mercury, crystal, sulfur, gems)... plus your gold income. With VI we are down to just wood, ore, and crystal, and while it seems strange at first it actually balances out rather well.\n- Forts and the ability to convert dwellings & towns to your own faction. No more hodge-podge army. Oh, and you can recruit all available units at any town you have that has the dwelling for it. So you don't need a train of 3+ extra heroes to keep bringing new units to your main.\n- Skill points. Tons of options to customize your hero as they level, and while your might-based heroes can still take magic-based abilities, you tend to get more bang-for-your-buck sticking with the same theme.\n- Champion units are CHAMPIONS. HoMM3 is great, but a glaring point that you cannot overlook is that some level 6 units were just better than the faction's level 7 (I'm looking at you, Necropolis). This installment has units divided into three "tiers": Units 1-3 are your Core units, 4-6 are Elite, and your 7 is your Champion. Within the same tier you won't see much power difference, but there are noticeable leaps between tiers, especially between Elite and Champion. Regardless of your faction, your Champion unit will be a force to reckon with.\n- Melee units can damage walls in a siege! Yes, you read that correctly. Previously when laying siege, you relied on your range and fliers while your catapult took its sweet time bringing those walls down. No more! Send those ground-pounders in to beat down the gate with their bare hands.\n\nCONS\n- Skill points. The skills and abilities are so numerous that going through them to pick the one (1) you want to spend your point on for the level you just got might take a bit.\n- Spells. WAY fewer spells than any previous HoMM installment. Spells are integrated into your skills as well, which will be confusing at first. You also don't have a Mage Guild in your town anymore, since spells are directly tied to your hero and faction.\n- Interactives do not stand out well. Call it a side-effect of the nicer graphics the game is running, similar to HoMM5, but it is easy to miss interactive buildings and items on the map due to blending so well with the background.\n\nIn all a solid game that is most certainly worth your time if it's on sale. I see a lot of negative reviews because it installs and launches through Origin, but I cannot say I have ever run into a problem with it nor do I find it to be a hindrance to playing a game I enjoy.","March 19, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've never played the Heroes games, essentially it's a vivid medieval fantasy world where noble humans, towering demons, ghastly undead and an array of other factions all clash together to fight their way to victory on a living, breathing chess board. Unlike chess, though, the combat is a rush, with each unit having its own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThis installment also features the most extensive multiplayer suite yet, with some very exciting features like character persistence, customisation and some very dynamic maps to play on. Definitely recommended, even from someone who rarely appreciates turn-based strategy.","July 15, 2012","true","47.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Still lots of bugs in the game, they even didnt re-adjust the campaing difficulty after they did big changes to the game balance. Result is, that without sticking exactly to game guides, u wont even be able to pass the tutorial campaign (which is no real tutorail campaign, since there is noone explaining u the game). So the campaign skill-tree is broken, tutorial campaign is now the hardest in the whole game. The worst thing about the game though is the big number of crashing causing issues, that are still not fixed.

It seems like every level you are simply trying to just stay alive long enough to finally build up an army which you can use to rush toward the enemy.  There are quite a few areas that you want to explore, but every time you start going toward them, suddenly another large enemy army is marching towards your city(ies), and you have to turn around and defend yourself (there's no way that you can produce a generic hero strong enough to defend yourself, only your main hero has a chance to win.)

I managed to recover this by playing the "offline" function but even the "offline" mode is created in such a way to PUNISH the player for daring to oppose using Uplay services as by playing offline you cannot access many functions of the game.\n\nUnless Uplay is removed and replaced with Steam servers or is fixed to actually work my only advice unless you use a direct internet connection or are routing savvy is to just avoid the game altogether and break out your old Might and Magic games which were created in a day when companies didn't hate gamers.","September 21, 2014","false","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tantaluspl/recommended/48220/","tantaluspl","Tantalus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tantaluspl/","246 products in account","TL;DR - The best Heroes installment since the third one. Amazing graphics, suprisingly good story and a great price to gameplay value, but it comes with the horrible Ubisoft DRM system (UPLAY) that forces you to be always online. Campaign offers about 120h of gametime with core game and additional 60-70h with all available DLC (Pirates, Dance Macabre, Shades of Darkness).\n\nPRO's\n+ Overall gameplay improvement - Although I played Heroes V for some time and recall some improvements implemented before, the overall gameplay overhaul in Heroes VI is, for me, its greatest advantage. All the flaws of the Heroes III (which I am very fond of) are fixed and remade into intersting mechanics. I could name many examples, but I will focus on the two selected, the first being the Town Portal mechanics. In H3 all you ever wanted from your Hero was to have Earth Magic on Advanced level and a single Town with Town Portal spell to learn. If you could get it, you practically won the game, as you could jump around the world to collect your units and utilize a devastating mobility advantage. In H6 all units from given faction can be purchased in a single Town, provided it has all the necessary dwellings so there is no need to jump from town to town to accumulate the army. As for the mobility advantage, Town Portal is no longer a spell you have to learn - its a building you can create in any of your castles. Level 1 Town Portal allows a visiting hero to teleport to any other town or fort of his choosing and Level 2 Town Portal allows any here to teleport back to the city (nearest with L2 Town Portal) from any place on the map. As you can use only one of those spells on a single turn, Town Portal becomes a commodity and a feature of its own. The second noteworthy feature is the complete revamp of unit tiers. In the past units were categorized by 7 tiers, first one being the cheap weaklings and the last one being an all-powerful destroyer. Now you got pretty similar units but reworked into 3 tiers: Core (three first units), Elite (the next three) and Champion (the old Tier 7). All Core units are comparable in their usefulness and so are the Elites, but they got their traits that would work best for certain heroes (as the rule of a thumb, there is a Might unit, a Magic unit and a shooter in both Core and Elite tier). This makes creating your army more flexible and greatly increase the basic unit performance in comparison with Champions. Unit reclassification was the real gamechanger and a very welcome one.\n+ Astonishing graphics - The environment is pretty amazing, especially in the campaign maps. The world is filled with random magical objects or unique decorations that really help to maintain the magical character of the world of Ashan. It is also very well optimizes for older graphic cards. Unit design is top notch and campaign posters (images seen when loading a campaign map) are simply fantastics.\n+ Interesting storyline - The world of Heroes has always been ridiculous and over-the-top with its magical theme, but I think this is the first time the main story actually embraced it and used it so effectively. The dialogues form a suprisingly coherent narrative for the main plot, which might not be written that greatly, but sure as hell is well voice-acted. I was very positively suprised how well contrived the world of Ashan is in the dialogues, so the story has its value whatsoever.\n+ Lots of playtime - The game, even without DLC, provides you with a very decent amount of content to go through. Core game has 22 campaign missions, clocking at about 5h each, so you can easily go over 100h just enjoying the single player mode. DLC add another 14 missions (2 in Pirates, 2 in Dance Macabre and 8 in Shades of Darkness, so the two adventure packs ain't worth the price), with similar amount of gameplay within. And of course the multiplayer, especially the couch one, can provide you with another Infinity hours of gameplay. If you buy the Gold or Complete edition on sale, the price to value ratio is pretty damn good.\n+ Very heroes-y music - Lots of the tunes are remakes of the H3 score and everything else really complements the graphic design. Soundtrack is what you would expect from a Heroes game, but thats a good thing!\n\n\nCON's\n- UPLAY - Ubisoft bloody DRM will turn the game off when the Internet is down (less often) or UPLAY servers are unresponsive (very often). It also forces itself into the game in the form of CONFLUX orbs - something similar to chatrooms, placed near boss battle locations. Their Mission/Reward system is stupid and the whole software is simply annoying as all hell. Still, its not Origin, so I guess it could have been worse.\n- No hexgrid (again) - Why did the developers of Heroes decided to go from classy hexgrid battle to obviously inferior square tiles? I know it was the same with H5, but why? Hexgrid is million times better!\n- Some balancing issues - Although units on their own are very well balanced when comparing factions, the Hero bonuses are not. Faction powers of Haven and Necropolis are far better then those of Sanctuary or Stronghold. Blood/Tear bonuses also vary from totally worthless to grossly overpowered.\n- Gets kinda repetitive - After few missions and some skill experimenting, the game gets pretty easy and repetitive. Reinforcement skill almost break the game, as it allows you to go through most minor battles without a single lost unit. You don't have to change your tactic that much to win with different enemies.\n\n\nOverall, I recommend this game very stronly. Unless you hate UPLAY more then I did or you want to play this game competitively againts your friends, you gonna love H6 if there is any affection for turn-based strategies in your heart.

It actually has the makings of a good game in there but for one major flaw. I can live with uplay and I've only once had any trouble logging in. My problem is with how the game handles the difficulty.\n\nIt has been mentioned before but your resupplies are granted weekly. The enemy's troops are also topped up weekly. The problem is that as you're exploring the map getting into fights and loosing troops the enemy isn't. On my first play through I wanted to get around the map, get into battles and collect prizes (usually armor). By the time I got to the boss his army was so big they were undefeatable. I started again, this time racing through as fast as I could. This time I pushed on to quickly and was caught out by a roaming enemy.\n\nBoth times I played on normal because I don't do easy. I'm sure with another couple of attempts I could get it right but there's the problem. There's a difference a game being hard and a game being cheap. If the game took your play style and army size into account it could have worked. Instead the developers figured it would be best to have the enemy army grow at a consistent rate regardless of what you do or how you play. The game is too much about time management and too little about fun and so I can't recommend it.\n\nIf, like me, you like the look and idea of this game keep looking as there are countless other games that do a much better job of being a good fun game.","April 10","false","20.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/that_one_dude/recommended/48220/","that_one_dude","that one dude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/that_one_dude/","117 products in account","I've mixed feelings about this game. Ever since spending countless hours playing Heroes of Might and Magic III and it's expansions/mods years ago,  I've been a fan. I love a good turn-based tactical combat based game. In fact, it may be my favorite genre. A strong strategy of collecting resources, helpful items and building powerful kingdoms backed by a solid story, good character dialogue, with outstanding art and soundtrack all mixed together, it's my opinion there is no topping this genre of game.\n\nMight and Magic: Heroes VI though falls short of legendary status for many reasons. Many avenues of this series have been simplified such as the resources, additions like the caravan options from HoMM IV and NPC monsters on the map being able to attack you during their turn if you are too close are missing. The story is nothing that held my interest and the dialogue happening in the pop-up screens was pretty horrible in many instances, and the in-game cutscene graphics are pretty generic. I did enjoy the map art and the soundtrack was okay.\n\nThe gameplay is decent, though at many times not challenging. I had to crank up the difficulty to hard for any real strategy. On normal it can be difficult in the first few levels, but once you amass some powers/items/armies it's pretty much a steamroll. I played through 3 of the campaigns and towards the end of the 3rd I was getting bored and just selecting auto-battle and having minimal to no losses.\n\nI did like the inclusion of dynasty weapons, dynasty traits and having to open further slots and options by playing more and earning the achievement points. Again, there wasn't much of a challenge to the achievements other than just playing long enough to rack up enough kills/battles won without losses/ etc.\n\nUplay is another barrier. Online activation to continue your game, if you do need/have to be offline you have to play a game started in offline mode.  I don't like to open my steam purchased game in two menus. Not a deal breaker for me, but annoying and unnecessary.\n\nI doubt I'll go back and play another full campaign. Perhaps, a random map here and there. Overall, it's just okay. Nothing spectatular that a turn-based strategy lover must have, but a worthy buy if you come across for cheap.\n\n","September 17, 2014","true","108.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Campaigns are extensive - each takes about 20 hours to complete (I've only made it through two), and there are about five in the base game.\n\nThe only probem with this game lies with Ubisoft's "Conflux," an always-on social application that you must be connected to in order to play. It isn't intrusive, but it does mean that you need an internet connection to play, and if your internet cuts out, the game boots you out - even if you're in the middle of a 15 minute castle seige - and you have to reload the last save when you reconnect.

Redundant "services" like Uplay and Origin should just move everything over to Steam. They are trying to fight piracy by punishing their paying customers. It's the most ridiculous and ill-conceived plan imaginable. However, people should not be putting this excellent game down because of Ubisoft's paranoid, control freak mentality. If you like HOMM games, you'll love this edition.","December 4, 2014","true","36.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

Stay away from this nightmare.\nI've been playing the HOMM for as long as I can remember.\nAnd this game truly is a let down.\n\nThe story is thin and is lacking any kind of depth that would make the player intrigued to advance further into the campaign.\nThe selection of factions and interesting creatures are slim. Thou they've added a completely new faction. Which is on the upside, but it does not counter the negative aspects of the others.\nThe heroes themself have somekind of RPGish levling, which is to me just confusing.\nBalance of the game is all roody poo, I can't put my finger on it. And neither can the devs, or so it seems.\nAll creatures has way too many perks and active effects it's all just a big mess.\nIt's like the devs have gone tryhard on this game, making it as complicated and frustrating as possible.\n\nOh, and you need to be online at all time during your session and connected to Ubisoft's Conflux service.

The balance doesn't seem to be all there neither, might is a far superior choice over magic from what i've seen and the factions seems to be a bit unbalanced as well. There are less resources to think about, etc. You can also not steal mines in the same way you could previously since they are all connected to the owner of the nearby town so it's a bit less micro-heavy than previously as well. For some this might be a big issue.\n\nWhile the overarching story might not be anything amazing (neither was any of the previous installment's stories) I still enjoyed the campaign a great deal, playing from the different perspectives of Duke Slava's children, one for each faction.\n\nAnd honestly if you are into the story that much I'd recommend going for the Might & Magic series instead.\n\nAll in all, It's a fun game if you can look past the whole double-DRM thing and some changed core features such as less resources and how the whole territory-war works.","October 18, 2014","true","11.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

The graphics are BEAUTIFUL and the real-time battle models look astounding. Battles are a mix of complicated turn-based, chess-like gameplay, with interesting, game-changing abilities. The maps are fun to explore and are filled with treasure and plenty of monsters to fight. One thing worth noting is the difficulty of the campaigns. The AI are smart and aggresive. So if you are are a fan of being  able to say, "I've finished this game, good luck at doing it yourself", then you will really enjoy this. Heroes VI is also great fun to play against friends. It features a hot-seat gametype which can be tedious if you don't like waiting for your slow friend, though the AI in Custom Game will be a worthy, oppenent in an actual player's stead. So, if you are a fan of expansive, challenging strategy games or enjoyed the other games in this series, this should be an memorable experience.","January 9, 2014","true","24.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The game runs great.\nOn the same note, the landscapes are breathtaking and the Art direction for the creatures and characters is truely original (as far as Heroes games go). Heroes skill sytem is complex and rewarding and the storyline is interesting enough to not be dismissed as "generic".\n\nI don't know what else to say, if you're a diehard Heroes fan like myself, don't listen to anyone else, give it a chance. I'm really happy I did!\n","March 1, 2014","true","227.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

That is a lot of game for a small price tag, so I was willing to deal with any issues I found.\n\nCurrently, I have played over 10 hours into this game and I have to say that I don't see what everyone else is belly-aching about. I see a lot of crying on the reviews, but in game I see nothing but positive.\n\nI run a PC with Windows 7 Professional, AMD 8-core processor, Geforce 545GT, so my rig is okay, but definitely not the best. I have not crashed once, no freezing, no glithes, no bugs, literally no issues.\n\nThis game is visually stunning, challenging and engaging, very detailed, and FUN! You can really tell that some talented people put a ton of time into this game and it's mechanics. It's a lot like Warcraft 3, but it's very different too; you don't really fight directly with your hero, just your army and there is a vast variety of spells, abilities, weapons, gear and units to build and choose from, you also control and build a city.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, this game isn't perfect, and there is some room for improvement. For instance, there is a lot to learn and the tutorial is fairly long and drags on a bit and if you take too much time building an army, you may find yourself unable to defeat the objectives due to overwhelming forces.\n\nThis is just my two cents, but I really feel this game was given a bad rep by some people who didn't give it a fair chance or judged it based on things the game wasn't at fault for. Hope this helps.","January 3, 2014","true","29.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I then go into the game open up the custom game option and find that you can't even so much as change your faction without going through the games dynasty system ( a system basically set up to milk cash out of online play) and nor can you change the faction of AI players at all.  This is in "custom" games.\n\nAfter realising this I went back to the menu and the more I looked at the game and it's features the more I felt that it didn't look like a game anymore, it looked like a F2P app with in game purchases.\n\nDon't buy this game.

You can see that I have a lot of hours logged into this game.  What you don't see is that a tremendous number of those hours are idle; I simply refused to log out because I thoroughly distrusted uPlay to the point of not believing I would ever be able to log back in if I logged out.  Previous experience justified that fear.  Subsequent experience validated it.  I finally had to reboot my machine.  Once again, I cannot get into the game because of uPlay.  The latest "update" to uPlay upgraded my experience by once again denying it to me entirely--as in, where I once could log on, I no longer can.\n\nWhen I was in the game, I was able to get through the first campaign and part of the second.  The game is a respectable member of the HOMM franchise but nothing truly revolutionary (the primary new element, dynasty weapons, is a good concept and I hope that it appears again, but it isn't exactly series-defining), and there are definite power balance issues among the factions.  Fortunately for beginners, you start playing the easiest (most powerful) faction (Necropolis), but the balance issues could be serious in multiplayer with random factions.\n\nThe bottom line is simple: Not only do I not recommend this game for as long as uPlay exists, but I personally will not buy another Ubisoft title of any kind until they abandon or dramatically reform that system.  There are many excellent publishers out there that treat their customers with more respect, or failing that, if they force you to use proprietary portals, at least they function.","September 23, 2014","false","252.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lagmasterturkey/recommended/48220/","lagmasterturkey","Turkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lagmasterturkey/","188 products in account","Might & Magic: Heroes VI is a bit of a mixed bag in my honest opinion. Right off the bat I’ll say that, overall, the game is decent with enough content and unlockables to keep you occupied for a while. The various factions each focus on their own unique theme and due to this they also have different units to go along with it as well as heroes that can be adapted to your playstyle with the use of skill trees and reputation. This works just as well in the different campaigns where the reputation you choose for the main character will actually influence the story potentially giving you two different endings for each one. As good as this may sound the game isn't without issues that potentially ruin the whole experience (at least it did for me).\n\nFirstly it's worth mentioning that the game uses Uplay (a platform made by Ubisoft) as opposed to Steam meaning you have to register the game on a Uplay account as well. This was more of a slightly annoyance rather than a problem so I won't get too much into this point but I have heard that this has caused problems that seem to involve Uplay not accepting activation keys provided by Steam.\n\nThe main problem I have with this game is the way the multiplayer was handled and how disappointing it was. I bought this game to play with a good friend but in our first game we quickly discovered that you couldn't watch battles being fought by other players (including allies). This means that every battle that your friend will take part in is another 5 minutes of having to sit there and watch the map as nothing happens (unless you both make use of the quick fight feature which I would recommend doing).\n\nThis also means that you're forced to miss out on any significant battles between your friend and enemy heroes which may decide the outcome of a match. What? You actually wanted to see these two mighty armies clash? You wanted to laugh at your friend as he makes a bad move and gets a stack of his units killed or even see what his faction plays like? Too bad. You can't.\n\nThe only way I can really recommend this game is as a single-player game which it seems to do well enough but as a multiplayer game it just feels like most matches (under normal circumstances) take longer than they should and even when you do finish it you look back and realise that the experience could have been much better. Regardless, if this game ever goes on sale and you are a fan of turn-based strategy games then I would still recommend it even if it's just for the campaign and the occasional skirmish against AI.","September 18, 2014","true","45.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But in terms of gameplay everything is simplified - lower number of resources, common army pool, easy town portal for every hero etc. There are some good ideas like forts / zones of control, and even town conversion could be a pretty good idea if implemented in a different way (e.g. took several days, cost much more, and was not allowed for every castle in the game). But general impression is still not very good, considering that there are still some bugs in the game (4 years after release!), and that UPlay client is inconvenient and buggy (crashed on start immediately after installation, and kept crashing until I fixed some issues with file permissions - it is clearly written in a very bad style if it tries to write something into his own Program Files directory).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grayswandir2/recommended/48220/","Grayswandir2","Grayswandir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grayswandir2/","95 products in account","Probably the Best "Heroes" since HMM III.\nPreambleBeing a massive fan of HMMIII, and having played all the following games in the series (Except M&M: HVII) I would rather warmly recommend M&M:HVI.\n\nWhile the game was first plagued by game breaking issues courtesy of Ubisoft's dodgy DRM, numerous bugs, and a lack of Town screen which caused an uproar when the game first released, these problems were eventually addressed.\nI think a lot of the negative reviews date back to the olden days of 2011\n\nIn my infinite wisdom, I only bought the game a year or so after it released, and my experience was only slightly mired by the innate DRM and Conflux systems.\n\nI've not played all the DLC content available today for M&M:HVI, only Shades of Darkness (SoD), so this is the scope of this review.\n\nThe Good\nThe campaigns are interesting overall, with some of them really shining as possibly the best campaigns  in the entire series. This is particularly true for the SoD extension which was thoroughly enjoyable in my opinion.\n\nI liked as well that the main heroes in campaigns are related to the other heroes by an overarching story frame, which - to boot - allows you to play the campaigns in pretty much any order.\n\nThe game also includes the "Dynasty system" allowing you to unlock Heroes and additional bonuses that can then be used in multiplayer and other modes, as well as weapons and pets for your campaign Heroes.\n\nLast but not least, also included is a Karma system of sorts which, through your choices and actions, allows to you to gear your main Heroes towards super-good or mega-evil, thus gaining equally good or evil superpowers.\nThis is a tiered system, which at first provides small but useful advantages, but by the time you reach the last scenario in a campaign will give your Hero some massive bonuses. This adds another level of customization to your heroes and provides some replay value for the campaigns.\n\nThe profusion of ways in which your Heroes can be tweaked, upgraded and customized will give the min-maxers a great time.\n\nGraphics and audio are pretty good, though some of the voice acting can be a bit off-putting at times, but overall the presentation is pretty good.\n\nThe gameplay, exploration, city management, kingdom building, hero development are all very enjoyable. The battle system while being very classic is also very enjoyable thanks to a clear interface, nice graphics and animations (which after a few hours you will certainly want to speed up !)\n\nThe Bad\nOn the downside, you have to bear with an "AI", which at times is so obviously scripted that it becomes a bit of an immersion breaker. (Hello Inferno campaign!).\n\nThe Truly EvilAh! UBISOFT darling when will you understand that such heavy handed DRM only affects the people who actually purchase your games? We're not in 1990 anymore when everyone was burning "backup" copies of games and "lending" them to our friends! We have the internet and we have smarts! We can download in a few mere minutes DRM-free versions of your games and enjoy their content without your annoying, crippling, absurd and utterly pointless DRM!\n\nTo the point, Uplay, the DRM, should really be called Udontplay, because frankly it can be pretty hard to get the game to start after installing it. Thankfully in most cases you will find the solution in this here forum or on the web.\n\nConclusionLastly, once you are past the DRM Gates of Hell, Heroes VI, offers great gameplay and a huge amount of content to play through, even more so nowadays with all DLCs available.\n\nOverall, with 313 hours on my counter, I must say I have very much enjoyed Heroes VI + SoD, more so than any other since the days of HMMIII. (Excluding Heroes VII- which, in my still infinite wisdom, I will not buy before Ubi gets their game together so to speak.)","December 23, 2015","true","313.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

I even encountered a time when I had 2 castles and the deadly enemy hero came , I was in one castle so he went on to the other , I used town portal to defend my other castle and he just went for the first castle ( he never went that far , so he shouldn't know where my hero is ) and that process was repeated infinitely.This is cheap and unfortunate since the creature and world design is great and a good innovation from the previous titles.

The two hero option per faction has been restored, in the vein of III, which is great. The hero pathway has become more defined, but I can't help but feel it is more homogeneised now, and not as impressive as V's skill system. It provides more options for the player to choose whether to rely on might or magic, so you don't have oddities like a Warlock hero focusing on unit-oriented abilities, and can instead take a hero suited to this path. Sandro is also back!\n\nVI also brought in the Naga as a faction, who I find interesting.\n\nOn the negative side, I feel the battle system is simplistic compared to V's. Most units have had their abilities stripped down, and V's awesome system of two upgrade options per unit (introduced in ToTE, IIRC) is gone. Many of the factions have had their unit makeup shaken up and a distinction between "core" and "elite" units, which has always existed, at least on an informal basis. Again, I feel V has it beaten on this aspect. The Sylvan and Academy didn't make it in. I've little love for Stronghold, which ToTE brought in, and their exclusion for this faction did little to appease me. The artwork and music of V was far grander and of a higher quality.\n\nAll in all, it's slightly above average, and I'd give it a 6/10. I'm hoping VII will revert to the pathway carved out by V, which was an excellent attempt by Ubisoft at remaking this series to its own liking.","August 16, 2014","true","124.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Frankly, I've never had problems with Uplay, and a second layer of DRM on top of Steam (which is DRM in itself, we must all remember) does not bother me.\n\nWhen it comes to the game itself, I greatly enjoy it; a breath of fresh air into the HoMM series, which since Heroes III, has been based on the same formula which quite frankly has been getting somewhat stale. The amalgamation of all the tedious resources into one, crystals is, in my opinion, a good idea. Whilst it simplifies the game, the introduction of the region system means it would be very tedious to capture all of the resource production buildings, even more so than in HoMM III & V.\n\nThe graphics, even now, as I write this in 2015, are gorgeous. The creature design in this game is the best it has been in the series. The units are original and the art direction in general is great.\nSimilarly the introduction of deeper RPG elements makes the game more interesting and helps the player invest themselves into the world.\n\nWhat can I say, I like this game.","February 21, 2014","true","32.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For context, I'm a shameless HOMM fanboy; I started back in the day with HOMM II, and recently replayed III, IV, and V, just for the nostalgia (and in preparation for MMH7's release).\n\nThis game did have some game-breaking bugs in its early days; today, only one remains that I can detect, and that is the "NVidia card causes black town/combat screen" bug.  I actually picked up a Radeon card just to get around that bug - that's how much I enjoy the game.  When the game first came out, it had one bug that I found highly amusing ... if you chose to speed up the combat animations, the sound would also be sped up, to the point where it sounded like a bunch of mice screaming and yelling.  Maybe I'm easily amused ... but the bug still exists in the Dungeon campaign (SoD), which I recently re-played ... and it was still worth a chuckle.\n\nNearly all of my gameplay has been campaign - I enjoy those more than anything else, although I can't easily explain why.  This installment, when you include Shades of Darkness and Pirates, has numerous campaigns, which allow you to fully explore the various factions and reputation paths.  The whole dynasty thing was moderately interesting, but tended to offer too much temptation to lean on "dynasty traits", which could really upset the balance of the heroes.  The dynasty weapons, which attain new abilities as they level up, are the highlight of the dynasty system, in my opinion.\n\nI'm not going to nit-pick the pros and cons, as other reviews have already done that in great detail - I'll keep them simple:\n\nPros:\n\nVery open skill tree (also see cons)\nCutscenes are interesting and relevant (Pirates had some amusing content)\nA tremendous variety of combinations of factions, artifacts, etc., keep things interesting\nSpell cooldown during combat, while limiting, is realistic and forces you to use your brain a bit\nReduced resource granularity helps to keep the focus on playing the game, versus constantly juggling resources\nHaving all creatures in all towns available to hire from any town ... nice!\nFixed perspective camera, versus the crazy controls in HOMM V\nTakes full advantage of 2560x1440 monitor\nGreat musical score\n\nCons:\n\nThe skill tree doesn't let you go as far with certain skills; consider Grandmaster Pathfinding in HOMM IV (no terrain penalty, +50% movement).  In MMH6, every hero can have logistics, but it's limited.\nSome campaigns tend to be a bit suffocating\nWhen morale gives a stack an additional move, it's not a full move; less movement, and less damage\n\nThat's really it.  Overall, 9/10 from me.","December 25, 2015","true","659.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The music and faction/unit versatility is on par at best, though being able to split your upgrades in the previous iteration makes unit upgrades in VI seem like a step backwards. Spells and gear are fairly versatile, though once more there is the issue of an optimal" gear set and spells which effectively make 3/4 of your arsenal obsolete.\n\nOne of the  two places where the game falls short for me is the story and character script, which whilst brilliant for most games, just isn't as captivating and moving as previous iterations of Heroes. The second issue, which happens to be the largest deterrent, is the sheer amount of bugs, glitches, freezing and crashes which makes playing the game incredibly frustrating.

It appears to use the same engine/assets for many things, which by itself is not necessarily a bad thing. This is probably the nicest thing I have to say about it. The story seems to be set in the same world as the previous game, but is completely unrelated. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, if not for the fact that the delivery of said story was far worse than in HoMM5. The voice acting was mediocre, and the writing is on the same level. While I could not force myself to further the story to try the gameplay in later missions, there doesn't appear to be anything new. Not that I expect there to be, since it is still the same engine.\n\nThe real warehouse of nails in this game's coffin is the fact that it forces you to use uPlay. Why Ubisoft feels the need for more DRM in top of Steam is beyond me, and why they decided to make this DRM as bad as it is is a rabbit hole down which I dare not go. In any case, expect to spend close to an hour trying to figure out why uPlay is crashing, failing to patch, and not linking to Steam (a feature it claims to have). Oh, and this is all assuming the servers are up. When you do get it to work, you will still probably have to work around uPlay "features", like it's overlay, which interfere's with Steam's overlay, and the strange GFWL-style secondary menu that looks like part of the game but isn't.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to literally no one. If you're new to the franchise, do not start with this game. See if you can find a friend with a copy of HoMM5, preferably on a disk so that you don't have to deal with Ubisoft's DRM. If you're a veteran, you probably own one of the other games already. I would suggest modding them, or just replaying the older ones, until the 7th installment of the series comes out. Not that I have high hopes.\n\nIn summary, incredibly mediocre rehash of the last game with no improvements, difficult to set up because of uPlay being terrible.\n\n3/10\n\nAt least, if you do get it working, the custom games aren't too much worse than before.","December 31, 2014","false","32.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

If you want to get from one point to another there are only a few corridors you can take.\n* Uplay.\n\n\n\nSo to summaries I would not recommend you to buy this game for full price. IF it is one 75% sale then yes it is worth the money. But otherwise I would recommend the third game in the series.","December 21, 2014","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But the game itself is a lot of fun, and the story is very good.  I've been playing the games since Heroes III and Might and Magic VI (played Heroes II later) - I enjoy the references, the way things tie in and yes, the fact that some basic game mechanics have stayed at least similar/familiar.\n\nIf you are a Heroes fan, this is still a must-have and a decent game!  If you're new to, it's still very entertaining turn-based strategy.","December 21, 2014","true","188.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Heroes of Might and Magic 6. Now this game is amazing! Some may say that the new castle system is weird or bad or just completely messed up BUT this game is the step from the Heroes 4 and 5 back in teh way of heroes 3 which, as many say, was the best of them all. As many of us know by now, game requires much more than flashy graphics and cool animations to provide good and stimulating gameplay. Esspecially if it is a strategy game where you can just skip the combat (not that anyone who knows how to play does it) and you see the same animation over and over in a long campaign. And frankly I think Heroes 6 delivers. The new addition of Dynasty is interesting but considering the Ubisoft features and the Conflux with it along with all the facebook liking and skype shenanigans might have been a step too far towards the community. The thought is good but I'm pretty sure we all know how to switch on skype... I hope.\nBut concerning the game: Briliant! Esspecially if you want to play with more people online in a set up party. Great castles, very very well worked through passive abilities and active abilities in mosters and amazing heroes with teh new Blood and Tears system!

This profile leveling allows you to expand the set of options for your heroe and the coins to acquire more habilities and other stuff for your set.\nIt's interesting and fun developing your profile as if it as an in game character, and it gives extra game hours.\nThe game itself is pretty much like the series, you have castles, armies, heroes and resources and you are in a row for conquering it all. The AI is decent enough, the creatures have a nice variation of habilities and magic is interesting although narrow.\nIf you like the series, this is a good call. I personally didn't like the Heroes V, but this one I did. There's plenty hours of game in.\n\nAgainst:\nUbisoft have been showing a tendency to shady business in recent developments, and this seems pretty much it.\nThe games have loads of bugs that will probably never be fixed, it crashes, hangs, etc. also the Uplay is mandatory for this game, but there are bugs syncronising content making the loading a pain. Almost every time I open the game I have to wait for a long attempt to syncronise content with their server, eventually it fails for time out, and only then I can play.\nAnother hint that Ubisoft do not really care much for fair play is that this is not a full version. You'll not find the Dungeon available, the only way to get this is to buy another fully independent game by a price way above a game pack. I'm also not sure if this is the only thing missing as I originally bought two game packs along with this because of a sale.\nBugs and shady business aside there's one more annoyance, if you are a fan of multiplayer or stand alone, to take the most of the game you'll have to at least play one campaing with your favourite race, aside the introductory campaing. This is the only way to unlock some special items that will be attached to your account.\nThe introdutoring campain is boring like hell but is "short", the race campain I can only tell about the Undead which is not bad.\n\nAll in all, there's no other game like this. Falling Enchantress gets close to beat Heroes, but it misses some fundamental stuff. Others are too simple to be interesting for long... so in my opinion this is worth for the simple reason that there's no competitors for this game style, specially if you want to play with friends.\nIf you are looking at games at random and not after this game style in specific, then stay away.","July 6, 2014","true","74.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

UPlay is a terrible idea and it doesn't work well.  this game looks nice, but they removed the town pictures at first, then we cried and we got it in a patch.  the storyline was mediocre.  sadly, this game just isn't fun to play.  the computer can become severly overpowered ruining single player experience.  having Uplay go down while you are playing means you get boooted from the campaign and then can't continue your 'online' campaign.  happened too many time so I turned it off.  I honestly played this game for nearly 2 hours but was booted from Uplay so many times that I uninstalled it and said never again.    hopefully if there is a HOMM7, they will learn from the terrible mistakes of this game.   as a long time fan, of the series  I was pretty dissapointed.","December 29, 2014","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

UBI PLS DIE! OMGG CONFLUX NOOBS":\n\nA lot of complaining from a lot of people who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of. Give them no heed! Sure, it's tied with Uplay, but I like it. My game crashed the second I launched it. Googled uplay fix, they told me run uplay as admin not through steam, and it worked like a charm. I have no issues opening from steam directly anymore. If you want to play offline, you still can, but be careful that online/offline saves are not the same! If you start someway, stick with it! (though it has no consumption at all, so you might as well just use your 3G)\n\n\n\n\nAs for the actual game:\n\nIt's a great game, nice challenege, amazing graphics and HUD, pretty decent story (as far as video games go). I've played Heroes 5, and I can honestly say I liked this one more. Combar is more intuitive (no, the same creature can not act a billion times before your creature gets a turn), you can see info about every creature on the battlefield directly in a MUCH neater way than before (including what's affecting them and what that thing is) -- like I said, amazing HUD. Gameplay will get boring if you spend all your time waiting around for reinforcements! If you're playing it right, you should never be just waiting around.\n\nMagic is now a little less varied but more reliable (you pick what you want to learn and spend a 'skill point' rather than getting random ones in guilds) Same for skill level up. You have a build in mind? Go with it, don't hope you get the relavant skill when you level up.\n\nYou can also convert towns (THANK YOU!), and summon creatures produced in multiple towns from the same town (no caravans, no 20 sub heroes shipping to the same main hero, just one place and go on with your life)\n\nOh, and once more, the HUD is really really nice. It feels so fluid (unlike the VII one, sadly).\n\nNo one online for multiplayer though, so don't buy it if that's your aim, but I'd definately recommend the game.","June 3, 2015","true","60.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game was just not well planned. I've loved the HOMM series since day one but they majorly dropped the ball on this one. Maps are enormous - which means it takes forever to finish them. And it turns into a real grind because when you're way over on the other side of a map the AI is taking over all your stuff. So you're always chasing them down. That or running from them. I found a lot of the game to be very poorly balanced on some maps. On the water maps for example I simply cannot get past the 3 map in the campaign even on easy. I just get my ♥♥♥ handed to me repeatedly. And there are other maps like it. It just ends in massive frustration. This is one HOMM you can and should skip.","February 20, 2014","false","167.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a visual glitch that causes the screen to be darkened almost to black which cannot be resolved. I initially read other people's complaints about this and thought "it can't happen to ME" but sure enough it did - it's not a hardware issue, it's an actual problem with the game itself. The devs fired their entire crew after the game was released and this issue was never patched. After spending some time trying to troubleshoot the graphics from inside the game, Steam refuses to refund me my money because, according to them, I played an unplayable game for more than 2 hours. Simply don't buy it, even if you love HOMM because it's not going to work. Steam - it's amoral AF of you to a) sell a game you know won't work and b) refuse to refund it when it's unplayable regardless of how long your clock runs. I don't think I'd even had the game downloaded for 5 hours, let alone running for that period of time.

UBI PLS DIE! OMGG CONFLUX NOOBS":\n\nA lot of complaining from a lot of people who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of. Give them no heed! Sure, it's tied with Uplay, but I like it. My game crashed the second I launched it. Googled uplay fix, they told me run uplay as admin not through steam, and it worked like a charm. I have no issues opening from steam directly anymore. If you want to play offline, you still can, but be careful that online/offline saves are not the same! If you start someway, stick with it! (though it has no consumption at all, so you might as well just use your 3G)\n\n\n\n\nAs for the actual game:\n\nIt's a great game, nice challenege, amazing graphics and HUD, pretty decent story (as far as video games go). I've played Heroes 5, and I can honestly say I liked this one more. Combar is more intuitive (no, the same creature can not act a billion times before your creature gets a turn), you can see info about every creature on the battlefield directly in a MUCH neater way than before (including what's affecting them and what that thing is) -- like I said, amazing HUD. Gameplay will get boring if you spend all your time waiting around for reinforcements! If you're playing it right, you should never be just waiting around.\n\nMagic is now a little less varied but more reliable (you pick what you want to learn and spend a 'skill point' rather than getting random ones in guilds) Same for skill level up. You have a build in mind? Go with it, don't hope you get the relavant skill when you level up.\n\nYou can also convert towns (THANK YOU!), and summon creatures produced in multiple towns from the same town (no caravans, no 20 sub heroes shipping to the same main hero, just one place and go on with your life)\n\nOh, and once more, the HUD is really really nice. It feels so fluid (unlike the VII one, sadly).\n\nNo one online for multiplayer though, so don't buy it if that's your aim, but I'd definately recommend the game.","June 3, 2015","true","60.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It surprises me that they took so long to come out with 6. (4 and 5 don't exist. Sorry.) Overall, I think it's a big step up. Except for one fatal flaw: The game crashes constantly.\n\nI like the unique and diverse creatures and abilities, modified talent/spell trees, and focusing the game more on the combat and exploration. Overall, while they're not next-gen, the graphics are pretty good. The AI's are improved, but still somewhat predictable. On the merits of the game itself, I'd rate it a solid 8/10.\n\nBut then comes all the user experience things that Ubisoft managed to screw up. Like, forcing you to create an Ubisoft account, and use Ubisoft's (terrible) launcher and cloud system for your saved games. Assuming it doesn't break partway through, it's really slow on the upload. Oh, and did I mention the game breaks more often than a union employee? Finish a computer-initiated battle? Well, let's lock up. Trying to enter one of your domains? I'm sorry, Dave. And these crashes are common and unpredictable, with no common factors, which is the biggest problem. The game becomes almost unplayable, because Ubisoft can't be bothered to debug its code properly. You might get a 2 hour stretch. You might get 2 minutes. Roll the dice.\n\nTaking the crashes into account, I give it a solid 5/10. When it works, it works; it's just dealing with all the time it doesn't.","September 7, 2014","false","147.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The fact that they introduced a "in game free currency" is kind of silly, because you actually need it for some good dynastical perks that can change your game alot. Also there is quite the imbalance when it comes to campaign heroes, whereas mage heroes can take off a whole army while might heroes can only do warcries that aren't even that good. Heroes of Might and Magic V actually had a better balance compared to this game, but in this game some factions are insanely overpowered, granting them the power to revive their best units with just gold, and with that when a person has map control they can continuosly attack your town without giving that much of a care. Netplay in the game works, but its the same as playing a full game of Civ, in which it will take a extremely long time and it will be excrutiatingly painful. The conflux orb idea was indecent because you could only type up so little for a guide, and even if you wanted a guide it would be better to make some kind of strat. guide instead of just placing them all around the various maps. To continue, the pacing in the story maps was really quick, and much of it didn't make sense. X or Y died every so often and there isn't much you can do about it. Many weird and funky plot twists were included to make sure "you were getting your fill of cool gamer storyline grub". To conclude this, the campaign mode was too short and extremely buggy, netplay is really slow, textures are extremely lowres and unnapealing.","December 14, 2013","false","21.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I think the designers have finally removed most if not all the issues with the Heroes of Might and Magic series.  (I have been playing since 1 back in the day).  I have enjoyed this one the most so far.  Let me list the issues with the last games and how they have been fixed in 6...\n1) Crossing your fingers whenever you hero goes up a level, hoping you get the skill you are looking for.  In 6 you may select any skill that you want.  Of course some of them require other lower level skills  and some have hero level limits.\n2) I have 3 town and they are so far apart, it is going to take me a week just to combine my armies.  In 6 the number of creatures you can buy per week is shared with all towns so as long as your town can build a certain unit you can recruit all of them.  (Works with special building that give you bonus units as well).\n3) Gosh the enemy took all my mines again and if I retake them I cannot get back to defend my town. (Not enough movement).  In 6, you can take a mine for the turn if you leave your hero on it, but as soon as you leave control returns to the player who has the closest town.\n4) Issue I have with 5 - Gee that phoenix has taken 3 moved before my Earth Elemental ever got a 1.  How unfair.  I lose no questions. (Unless I am the phoenix, in this case I hope you enjoy cheese).  In 6 they do have the initiative bar but each unit only gets 1 move a turn.  Much better, so yeah all my units might take an action before yours but only 1 action.\n5) Wow that is the 3rd chain lightning in a row, magic is so much stronger than might...  In 6 each spell has a cool down time, so no more chain lightning each turn until my 3000 units are toast. Most spells are every 3 turns.\n6) Alright I am going to build a magic tower, cross fingers...  Oh crap I already have all those spells...  In 6 spells are hero abilities so you can pick whatever you want, no randomness.\n7) (Not a issues but a cool new thing in 6) - Units have a might and magic attack and defense.  Not just 1 value for attack and 1 for defense.  So you can have the magic user who gets destroyed by the sword but spells / magic attacks do very little to him.\n\nMy only complaint so far has been the difficult, not that it is too hard but it is out of balance.  90% of the fights I can just hit auto combat and go have a cup of tea.  But the "boss" battle at the end of the map usually requires my hitting next turn for a  few weeks to get enough units to win. (This is after I exploed the whole map.  Perhaps it is my style of play.  I am an explorer not a rusher).","May 5, 2014","true","131.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
