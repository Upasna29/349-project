I had no job. I had no friends. All I had was my sole aspiration: to become a Forensics Specialist - Dynamic DNA Profiler. I spent every evening alone, playing chess into the early hours of the morning. I would paint random images throughout the day on my easel, stopping only to sate my appetite, or occasionally wash my bodily odour away. I didn't talk to anyone. I didn't need anyone. I just needed this job. I was going to be the best. And then that day came. I had reached the pinnacle of my profession. Finally I could stop worrying about my career and enjoy the finer things in life. But being at the top is perhaps the loneliness place you can be. I still had no friends. No lover. No relations of my own. I tried going out to community lots but by this time I was old and the youngsters found me creepy and odd. I once again found myself spending the days alone in my home, trying to be the best at everything. I'll show them! I don't need anybody! I've come this far on my own! But, whereas time had once been my greatest ally, it had now become my sole enemy. Yes, I was the best at all things. But I had no one to share it with. I sat alone in the place I had once called home, surrounded by all of my beautiful creations, and I felt even more miserable than at the start of it all.\n\nNow I'm going to try out this game.\n\n10/10","December 23, 2014","true","27.4"," 816 of 859 people (95%) found this review helpful 1,167 people found this review funny","95","816","859","167","19"

Now you're probably wondering why the big red thumbs down? Well... First of all, the game costs 400$ for all the DLC and there's Micro-transactions! Micro-transactions should not be in games I pay for or in single player games! This is a complete waste of money, were I can buy about 30 games with $400 rather than getting a bunch of DLC that are a complete waste of money. I don't mind buying/paying for DLC but when I buy a game, and I have to pay for extra content to get the full experience and it will cost me $400 and I have already bought the game and if I want to have couches, fridges, clothes, expansion packs, etc, it will cost real money, this just makes me question how stupid does EA think we are? I would recommend buying the game, but the DLC will make the game actually a lot better, so its recommended to buy the game on sale and pick it up for about $100 I sure as hell thought the game was fun and had a lot of things to do, but paying huge amounts of cash into a game is way too much for me and pretty sure for anyone else.","February 4, 2014","false","4.3"," 1,508 of 1,767 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","508","1","0","47"

I leave my home town in search of a new life following my dream of becoming a world class culinary artist. I have near enough no money to my name, but with the help of some sort of demi-God I'm suddenly drowning in cash. I buy a beautiful new home and join the local bistro to kick start my career. After just my first week I have plenty of acquaintances and decide to throw a party to deepen my relationships and make some life long friends. The party is going smoothly, and I even get close to a girl and give her the old one-two in my way too big for just me bed. She stays the night and the next day I propose. There's no going slow in this town. Bad news; turns out she's my boss, I gained a step daughter, and she's also pregnant. She soon hits the elderly stages and I end up having to sleep with what looks like a dried up ballsack. I'm still young and have a granny for a wife and a baby who definitely isn't short of being "special". Not to mention my step daughter hates me. Is my life cliché? I wouldn't let it end like this. I throw party after party, befriend a highschool girl, and once she hits the ripe age of 18 I snag my first kiss with her; all under the watchful eyes of my wife. Needless to say, we're divorced now, and for some reason the little ♥♥♥♥ who caused it is no longer interested. That's okay. Time goes by and I bed a tubby tess in my ex-wifes bed, before throwing rejection in her face. My new target is the maid. She has too much to drink and I take her to bed in, you guessed it, my ex-wifes bed. My ex-step daughter walks in on us so I teach her a few choice words on her way out. I decide to marry the maid and have another child with her. A week later I have a little black baby girl, and my first daughter is a teenager now. Although I sleep with my wife and ex-wife in the same room, things are going good. Or so I thought. My new maid wife turns elderly and I've only just hit 30. My life takes a weird turn next, as the ex-step daughter who once hated me is now coming onto me hard. I say ♥♥♥♥ it, and bed her. My maid wife catches me and we get divorced, so naturally I marry the step daughter while she's in her prime, and of course we need another baby. My first wife is now my mother-in-law, and my daughter is also my sister-in-law. Not that she cares. No matter how many wives I go through, my two daughters are still my best friends. Because they're the only two people in this world I can't ♥♥♥♥.","September 11, 2014","true","189.1"," 297 of 328 people (91%) found this review helpful 320 people found this review funny","91","297","328","320","17"

I didn't know that I could hate EA anymore than I already did, but I do.\n\nThe fact that there is a Sims 4 with a similar business model means that taking advantage of its customers seems to be a viable way for EA to make money.

While the base game only has the basic game content, you can still spend hours building houses, making your Sims successful in life or hey, even killing them if that's what you're into. Each expansion adds hours of awesome stuff to lose yourself in, whether it be tons of new jobs with Ambitions or new types of characters with Supernatural, each one adds it's own little something.\n\nWhile the game is incredibly addicting, it also has lots of bugs. Some bugs have been around since the start, like the game crashing (happens mostly when you haven't saved for several hours and you just finished building your dream home), others only turn up when you start installing expansions or custom content, like the strechy babies and the hand-bowl (not actually sure where this comes from).\n\nSo, yes, I recommend the game, but just be prepared for glitches, crashes and a slight addiction to new content.","November 25, 2013","true","343.6"," 603 of 758 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","603","758","4","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shonito/recommended/47890/","Shonito","Shonito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shonito/","185 products in account","In The Sims 3 you create and control simulated people and watch them live their lives. It's a good life simulator. Perhaps a little too good, because just like with real life, it will destroy your hopes and dreams.\n\nWhen The Sims 3 works it can be a fun game, but unfortunately that isn't very often. The game is notorious for lagging, stuttering, freezing, crashing, and having all sorts of other game-breaking bugs. If you don't believe me, just Google it. I've spent more time trying to fix the game than actually playing it.\n\nThe Sims 3 becomes frustrating even before you start a game. Depending on your system, and which DLC you have installed, it can take several minutes to several hours just to get into the actual game. But this is mostly the fault of the game itself, as even high-end systems experience the same problems running The Sims 3. In fact, the loading times are so long that the developers added a barely functioning mini-game to play while you wait for the game to load. The Sims 3 has THE WORST loading times I've ever experienced in a game, and that's saying a lot.\n\nSpeaking of worst, The Sims 3 also has THE WORST camera controls I've ever experienced in a game. The camera controls aren't just clunky and clumsy. They slide around even after you let go of the button, causing the camera to overshoot the intended target. Other times it feels like the game is actively fighting back at every key press, pushing the camera in a different direction from the one you're moving it in.\n\nTo make matters even worse, you CANNOT customize the controls in The Sims 3. Not at all. This isn't even a console port. This game was designed for the PC, yet you cannot customize the controls. There is no option to do so in the options menu. There isn't even an option to look at the keyboard controls so you know which button does what. And the Q key quits the game, so be careful.\n\nTo add insult to injury, EA has made The Sims 3 one of it's biggest cash cows. Not only are there numerous over-priced expansion packs, and even more garbage that EA wants you to buy from their online store, but they constantly remind you of these products via in-game pop-up advertisements. That's right... Pop-up advertisements in an offline single-player game. It's utterly disgusting. And when the DLC does go on sale, it's usually cheaper to buy directly from EA's online store rather than from Steam.\n\nI just can't understand how any professional game designer or publisher thought it was acceptable to release a game in this broken state. The Sims 3 has been out since 2009 and these issues have never been fixed. And now The Sims 4 is coming out, so I doubt The Sims 3 will be getting better anytime soon.\n\nEA and the developers of The Sims 3 should feel nothing but shame over this poorly-coded excuse for a game. It's no wonder that EA keeps winning the award for the worst company in America. Don't make the same mistake I did and pay actual money to play The Sims 3. I cannot recommend it to anyone unless you are a masochist.","December 22, 2013","false","126.5"," 411 of 517 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","411","517","0","11"

Even when its exploitation and laziness isn't shoving itself in your face, the gameplay contradicts the primary appeal of the game (it's a sandbox game that takes you away from its sandbox to clean your toilet, cook a meal, go to work, and do other "watch a bar fill up" menial chores far too often). If you're a creative type, you'll likely still have fun with this game, as the sandbox elements, while contradicted by the gameplay style, are quite extensive, and impressive if you're willing to put your time and money into them.

Pease read:)\n\n- Important quick info about my relationship with ts3 : I have all the dlcs, and most of the worlds from ts3 store, which I have bought on origin, before I was aware of steam. I have played over 4500 hours offline (due to limited internet). I own all the dlcs, and most of the store stuff.\n\n- Should I get ts4 or ts3? : I currently own ts4 with 1 dlc. Below are the pros and cons for ts3 and ts4.\n\n- Ts4 pros\n\n1. Your sim can multitask\n2. Their mood effects them more in their everday lives than in ts3.\n3. CAS (create a sim) has better graphics, but your sims are less customizable than in ts3.\n4. Creating your house is quicker when it comes to building walls, foundations, etc.\n\n- Ts4 cons\n\n1. The world is realitively small, and their is only a few small lots you can build on.\n2. Their are no cars, and as of now they have still neglected to add toddlers to the game.\n3. Their are more loading screens than on ts3 for xbox 360.\n4. You can not see where your sim works, and traits are limited.\n\n- Ts3 pros\n\n1. Open world, you can edit every lot .\n2. CAS comes with a lot of stuff to make your Sim family and simself.\n3. The only loading screens in the game only pop up when you go to another town.\n4.  Their is over 60 traits with just the basgame, so you can truly play with life.\n5. Houses and community lots are fully customizable, and their is no limit other than your budget when building.\n\n-  Ts3 cons\n\n1. The game is addicting, and the possibilities are endless.\n2. You can't walk on water.\n\n- When buying the game should I buy on steam or origin? :\n\nIt is best to buy ts3 game series on steam, so that you can keep your favorite games at your favorite place. When you buy on steam some of the major benefits, are the sales and that when you buy ts3 on steam you can register the same game on origin, which virtually gives you 2 for the price of 1. When you decide you want to get the game I would recommend you save your money for the steam summer, or winter sale, so that of you don't like it, you don't have as big of a loss.\n\nNow this is what I have to say about the game itself :\n\n-  What does it mean when the game says Stuff pack vs. Expansion pack?\n\n- There are 2 types of dlcs they sell for ts3 and ts4, stuff packs and expansion packs.\n\n- Stuff packs - which normally come with more furniture and clothes.(occasionly some traits)\n\n- Expansion packs - which comes with loads of new game content for your sims, and almost always comes with a new world for your Sims. Plus it adds a lot more stuff to CAS and build and buy mode.\n\n- Why are their so many negative reviews on the dlcs? :\n\nMost of the reviews for the dlcs are of people who never truly looked into the game about whether or not they wanted to buy it, and the rest are mostly compliants about their pc not working. (Which is not because of ts3) This game runs great with all the dlcs for me, and all the dlcs enhance the gameplay with different chracteristics that I cant live without.\n\nWhat of game play is this game? :\n\nIt is not just building houses, and creating sims, its meant for you to show your creativity, and play with life.\n\nI would recommend you just buy the basegame or the game bundle to start with, and see if you enjoy the game! If you are also on the short side of cash, check out the tsr website for loads of free cas and house stuff.\n\nMust read!!  ➡ Do not think this game is innapropiate, because of inappropoate mods. Their is no nudity in this game, so please dont mess up this game with bad mods! The humor is great, the playing is great, and the friends are great,\n\n- On the funny side : This is what happens when I play ts3 :  First 5 hours, I spend making my sims,  2 hours on my house, 1 hour in-game, and already my wife ended up starting an affair with the neighbor. I ended up getting divorced within an hour, and eventually died when trying to fix the dishwasher.      11/10","February 4","true","127.7"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","86","66","77","22","12"

The Sims 3 is a fantastic simulation game where you can create your sim, get married, become the president who raises a son who ghost busts on the weekend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/47890/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nThe Sims 3 is a life-simulation-sandbox developed by a division of EA known as The Sims Studio, the Sims 3 was released 2009.\nThe general idea is to progress your character/family through the game by building/buying a house, purchasing items to supply your Sims basic needs; Hunger, Social, Bladder, Hygiene, Energy, and Fun.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: I personally admire Sandbox games because of the flexibility you have with story, and game elements. Each person will have their own personal story playing through the Sims. (If you don't care to hear the story of my first Sims game: Skip to Gameplay)\n\nI created a Sim that looked like me, and proceeded to move into a house and begin to work on building my life. After getting my first job, the car for work showed up earlier then I expected, and I sadly didn't have time to eat my Waffles, so I left them on the street and went to work.\nAfter putting in a hard eight hour work day, I returned to my waffles on the street. (I had watched them the whole time from my above view. I watched them... mocking me.) Now, any sane person would know not to eat waffles left on the street for eight hours, but I'm not sane, I ate those suckers after getting home. Then proceeded to vomit in the toilet for the next few hours.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511831776\n\nEventually I became familiar with the weird 3D controls, married a lady who turned into a grandma the day after we were married ( *Condescending tone* Being the noble man that I am, I reloaded my save file. In my defense, she didn't tell me she was three times my age when we dated!)\n\nAfter getting married, becoming the leader of the free world, and having a kid... I died of old age. This is when I realized my terrible mistake; I shouldn't have made an avatar that looked like me. Eventually My son brought me back as a ghost, but I felt wrong after seeing myself die in a video game like that.\n\nGameplay: It's hard to articulate how weird the controls are for The Sims 3, you can zoom in and out, rotate the camera, switch between Sims, the GUI (Graphical User Interface) isn't the weird part about the controls... It's when you're trying to learn the key-bindings, “which mouse button does what”, clicking and holding the scroll wheel, among a host of other keyboard shortcuts.\nIt took several hours of play time to get familiar with the controls, I suspect I might have been helped or hindered with my experience working in 3D modeling programs such as 3Ds Max, Source SDK, and Blender.\nThere is a lot that can be said about The Sims 3 gameplay, but the best way to sum it up is that this is “a Sims game”. This was the first Sims game I played since trying it at a friend's house when I was younger.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511831787\n\nAchievements: There are no Steam Achievements on the Sims 3, however if you're objective or goal oriented, there are in-game accomplishments that you can work on earning. These accomplishments are shown on your Sims 3 community profile page.\n\nPrice: This is where The Sims 3 gets sticky, and I start to get cynical... The Core game is priced at $19.99, that's an extremely fair asking price for the core game. But wait, there's more!\nIf you look in your furniture section within the game, there are advertisements for more furniture that you need to spend real money to unlock! (Really EA? We didn't spend enough?)\nBut wait, there's more! Each DLC pack (19 packs in total) costs $19.99! This is where many people start mumbling about EA having a money grubbing exploitative business model(Or maybe just me). If you do want to get the DLC for the Sims 3, it's recommended you look for bundle deals that are on sale to get the most out of your purchase.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=510203419\n\nConclusion: to recap, Story: flexible and unique. Gameplay: takes some time to get used to the controls if you're new to the series. Achievements: None on steam, but accomplishments in game. Price: Fair for the core game, however the marketing design is to shake you down for more money.\nI recommend this game to people who enjoy simulation games, play casual games, and like building houses.\n\nDo you like the way EA sells DLC for The Sims 3? Or do you think they should include more in the core game? Feel free to let me know in the comments, thanks for reading my review.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update August 1, 2015:\nPunctuation correction made by Angfucious, thank you :)","September 3, 2015","true","61.2"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","45","57","10","3"

It was much more complex than the Sims 2, and it was overwhelming. I became accustomed to all of the options and possibilities, however, and now it is my favorite version of the Sims! Although I like the new Create-a-Sim Mode on Sims 4 that uses click-and-drag to determine Sims' looks, I miss all of the options for hair and eye color in Sims 3. The Sims 3 also had the Create-a-Style option which allowed the player to personalize virtually anything in the game by selecting patterns and colors for it. I once made an entire house with everything inside it entirely in plaid, just because I could! And it was fun!\n\nAnother reason I love the Sims 3 the most is how the map is continuous and you can watch your sim travel from destination to destination in their car, instead of having a load scene while switching lots.\n\nThe Sims 3 also has the most career options, which I appreciate. Sims 4 really lacks variety in this area. It doesn't even have a medical career track, which was even in the first version of the Sims! The stuff packs and expansions of Sims 3 are also really fun if you have enough money and space to accommodate them. A con of the Sims 3 is that it takes more power and storage space to run it than the other versions.","January 2, 2015","true","16.9"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","26","28","2","1"

The only reason I bought it is that I don't bother with downloading pirated copies anymore and the game was on 'sale'.\n\nAnyway apart from the absurd pricing (not even AAA titles released around 2009 still cost this much) the DLC grab is the worst I've ever seen (compared to it Payday 2 and Rome Total War II shine for their decency) and the game is so incomplete without any of them that you will have to purchase at least one, or get a cracked copy of it.\n\nFinally the only reason I'm wasting my time writing this, really, is that as I mentioned above the game doesn't work properly. Compatibility problems with W7 and 8 are massive and the troubleshooting required is at times just too much. I've been able to play some 4 hours and after relaunching the game everything turned wrong. First the costant crashing every 10 minutes, then every 5 and finally the freezing (every 2 or so). I tried to update again my gpu drivers only to find out the game does not recognise it and pick the built in intel card (playing on a laptop). Not saying the game will never work, but like Bethesda did with FO3 a label stating there are issues with newer systems and graphic cards should be added to the store page.\n\nAfter so many years few will still buy this game but for the ones considering that option, just stay way. This game is begging to be downloaded ('illegally').","December 28, 2015","false","28.3"," 71 of 104 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","71","104","7","2"

If you're an action geek, you probably won't enjoy the title, but most players who don't mind a casual experience will enjoy the game. Players who've played previous titles will find this incarnation the most fully featured yet. The experience has been great, and I have to recommend it highly to gamers and non-gamers alike, If your PC can run it, and you'd like to give playing games a revolution, this is the right title for you. If you're a gamer and you like games with a lot of depth, and open-ended gameplay, you'll probably enjoy the Sims 3 i've enjoyed my time with the Sims 3 for several days, so I have to give it very high marks for replayability.

I will now attempt to rectify that. For more on the game, go to the paragraph that starts with "Gameplay:".\n\nLet's establish the difference between "Expansion Packs" and "DLC"\n\nExpansion Packs are like mini sequals to games. They add new features and expand upon the old ones. An example of a Sims 3 Expansion Pack would be World Adventures or Island Paradice. These two added signifigant ammounts of content to the game, as well as add new features like treasure hunting, and exploring, as well as adding new areas and features to base game items, such as the training dummy, and board splitter.\n\nDLC is usually much smaller than an expansion pack in that the ammount of content added is neglegable to the overall experience of the game. This can be seen in things like texture packs, or more specifically to the Sims 3, "Stuff Packs". Or the cutting of features such as the ability to make your own towns, and replacing that with the ability to buy more (non customizable) Pre-made towns.\n\n*Just making the quick note that while you can still create custom towns for the Sims 3, it has been made a far more tiedious process, requireing you to download a seperate program with a less user friendly interface, as opposed to the town creation system used by the Simes 2.\n\nIn short, Expansion Packs are reasonably priced additions that improve the overall quality of the game, while DLC is a form of nickel and dimeing justified by the additions of insignifigant content, and should never be the same price as an expansion pack, or full game.\n\nGameplay: The Sims 3 does not make any great bounds in inovation from the Sims 2 (The sims are a bit smarter, they won't drown if you take the ladder out of a pool now). It's still the same Point & Click style "God Simulator" where you can create your own sims (less customization options for vanilla, more added with each expansion pack), create your own house or customize a pre-made one. (While there is decent variety in furnishings etc. the developers still push the microtransactions with an in-game "Sim Points" store, and DLC page).\n\nYou can still do (more or less) all the same things you could do with your sims from previous games, go to school, take several different carear/job paths (more interesting options with DLC), go to university (DLC), get married and start a family (streamlined without DLC), or even more outlandish things like go to the future (DLC), go live on an island with mermaids (DLC) Become a fantasy creature, things from fairies, werewolves, etc (DLC). Become a preformer (Limited options without DLC).\n\nYou can also controll the longevity of your sims. Change the lifespan of a sim from 30 days to 1000, your choice.\n\nThe game is owned by EA.

This is a feature that was missing in previous games.\n\nThere are a wide variety of expansion packs to provide additional functionality for just about anyone.\n\nYou can pretty much play the game however you want, you can make your sim an upstanding citizen, a socialite, an excentric recluse, a crook or anything inbetween.  You can have your sims befriend everyone and be known for being nice, use them to express your darkest desires to ruin all your neighbor's lives, or even ruin their own lives if you so chose.\n\nThat is not to say the game doesn't have it's problems.   It is probably the buggiest game ever released by EA, and that includes Sim Copter and Streats of Sim City.   It is using an archaic branch of Mono which makes the Mono releases chosen by Unity3D look new, and has a severely garbage collector that leaves unnecessary cruft everywhere and instead vacates other objects from memory as soon as you leave the lot they are on.   It seems either the core programmers didn't know how to mark something as a cached asset, or just didn't bother.   Despite the size of the game, there is no attempt to use either a disk heap, or a secondary virtual memory segment to store cached assets, and until recently it didn't even support over 2GB of game memory space.\n\n\nTech support is nearly non-existant, but fortunately the game has finally stopped being update to support expansion packs, which would commonly break the game completely for older expansion packs, so there are fewer issues.\n\nTo put it simply, the game itself I give a wonderfully positive rating as a near perfect game for it's category.  It is everything a Sims game should be.  However, the backend is flawed at best, and often downright broken, while tech support is downright non-existant.   Frankly, I think EA could care less about technical support or keeping their older games functioning on newer technology, and I think recent reports of having the worst customer support in the video game industry are not only accurate, but an understatement.\n\nStill, if you can put up with these faults, The Sims 3 is certainly worth your time and frustrations.","November 2, 2014","true","057.8"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","26","32","0","5"

I personally enjoy the Sims 3, due to the open world nature(opposed to the Sims 2, just in your house, or Sims 4, with locations, but not just one big world), and the enormous amount of add-ons that can go in to customize your game. Want retro 70s clothes? They have it. Seasons? Check on that. Pets? Hell yeah. Vampires, witches, and things that go 'bump'? You bet! With dozens of worlds, thousands of outfits(and what can only be billions of combination outfits), and hundreds of building materials/household items you can buy, this game is already incredible. But the best part is in life simulation. Every sim, no matter how much you try, will look different, act different, and have different wishes. Even minor things like having a hotdog will propel your sims into a whole new world of wishes and hopes, from cooking, to a new job, to opportunities that accompany this. A brief pass with someone at the supermarket can bloom into a relationship, a family, and any number of other possibilities. Every single playthrough is different, and that allows you to experiment as many times as you wish. Even with a single game is varies greatly day-by-day. One day, you could have an aspiring author, the next, they want to join Sunset Valley's Finest, or their worst. How they react, is up to you.\n\n\n11/10 for me, endless fun, and a wide open world.","September 21, 2015","true","59.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","20","22","3","0"

I have no issues paying for expansions or DLC but you I don't think you should be able to put photos up that make your customers think they're getting more than what they actually are without declaring *some of these photos and videos show expansions* somewhere up-front. I recomended the game to a friend since we were both long time sims fans only to be asked "where is the college" and "how do I get to the island stuff." He thought he would be getting these with the game and so did a lot of other people apparently based on the preview pictures. If you put a decient amount of time into the game there's really not that many options for things to do unless you buy the expantions or dare to look at the free community made sections (not through steam but through the official EA sims site) some items of which are game breaking. If you would pay for all those said expantions you're looking at over 600$ and some of the expansions are less than a gig of new content. It's a great game, I purchased expantions for the earlier games, but the new content is a lot of money for little content at the pricepoint it's being sold at.

This expansion adds new traits new loifetime wishes tons of objects and interactions four types of pets with endless pure breeds and mutts, it also add a new freaking world.

Want to roll around in money? Want to travel to Egypt, steal treasure from tombs, and have an affair?\n\nWith Sims 3, you can. If you only have the base game and none of the DLC's, you can easily get mods for the game that will add an endless amount of things: instant money, incest, custom jobs, etc. With Sims you can have the character live the life you imagine for them.\n\n♥ Relationships.\n\nThis is by far why I've played Sims 3 for as many hours as I've had. In Sims 3 you can find a boyfriend, marry him, cheat with his brother, and divorce - all in the same day. Sims 3 doesn't have morals and doesn't want you to have them either.\n\nFor that reason, you can cheat as much as you want, have as many kids as you want, or embrace the single, celebrity rockstar life. If you want to have an arch nemesis and revel in kicking their trash can, you can.\n\nOr you can be the seemly modest grandmother who writes erotic tales at night and takes care of her grandchildren, plays chess with her husband at the park, and bask in your retirement during the day.\n\n♥ Everything is up to you.\n\nFrom the design of the house to the look of your Sim to their likes and dislikes, you control anything and everything. You aren't limited in any area for even their needs you can control. If you use a cheat code, you can easily make their needs (hunger, sleep, etc) to 100% meaqning you'll have more time to focus on the fun aspects of their life.\n\nWith Sims, the character is entirely in your hands.\n\n✘ This game lags.\n\nA lot. It's known for crashing without warning, freezing at any vital moment, and can be quite fussy to run. I've learned that when you first launch the game - DON'T DO ANYTHING. Just let it play through the cutscene and go to the main menu. Don't try to skip it, don't try to rush it.\n\nThe same goes for when it freezes and lags.\n\nOtherwise it's going to sulk and quit on you just when your Sim becomes famous or is about to have their baby.\n\n✘ The base designs are...bleh.\n\nI used to think they were amazing - the blocky hair, the ill fitting clothes, the ugly looking earrings. However once I discovered the world of mods, I learned how awful the base items are. Unfortunately installing too many mods can severely lag your game - so you'll have to be strict about which ones are worth keeping and which aren't.\n\n✘ There are bugs.\n\nA lot of them. University can cause errors with assigning you to "study" when you aren't enrolled in school, a Sim that is aging up can end up with their bones disjointed and their head all stretched, your Sim can decide they can't walk forwards because dust is in their way, etc.\n\nOverall the Sims 3 is by far the most beloved of all the games I've ever played, aside from Harvest Moon, and is a MUST play. Absolutely amazing as a simulator/choice game.","May 28","true","891.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","12","13","5","3"

Can you say, "Intervention"? It takes a special breed of people to play the Sims. People with no life.  That is what you will have once you start playing this addictive game. It crashes and freezes all the time, so please keep all weapons far away from your computer, less you do something to it that you will regret. Alas, it is not your poor computer's fault. I have played this game on ten different computers - and had the same effect. Maybe one day I will be able to afford a solid state hard drive- maybe Sims won't crash with that kind. (Insert some famous quote about fools / false hope, the definition of sanity, etc...). Seriously, I have been playing Sims since the original Sims. I have literally wasted years of my life playing all of the different Sims games out there. Kray Kray, I know. What is worse, I can't wait to finish this review to load up a new game.

I don't even have all the expansions yet, so I won't be getting Sims 4 for years now (my son played it and compared it to a steam pile of slag, less features / game play than Sims 2, nay; an insult to compare it to Sims 2). Anywho, I only buy the expansions when they are on sale (which is rare through Steam, but a couple times a year through Origin). So if you decide to buy Sims3, it was nice knowing you (say goodbye to yourself as well). :) P.S. No proof - but I do think it numbs your brain to the point of killing off your braincells with all of the monotomous gameplay (I probably misspelled that word on account of brain rot from playing the Sims for so many years). Can you say Love-Hate? It's like darned Wal-Mart. jk","December 16, 2014","true","807.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","11","12","5","0"

It should be the other way around. The support line from EA when I have had an issue with this game is horrid to say the least. And along with any addons through origin cannot be moved over to the steam version which just wants you to get a cracked version of this game. This game is in a grey area for me to give any sort of review sadly so Im stuck with just giving bland answers :/","February 27, 2014","false","182.3"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

Sims 3 expands on a lot of the features from the previous installments, including adding some new features and then Electronic Arts to my surprise removed some features in this edition.  One of the features they removed that was in the Sims 2, was the ability to create new lots.  In the Sims 3 you are basically stuck with the pre-installed lots and then of course like the previous installments you have to buy all the expansions.\n\nBuying the expansions is not what bothers me. What bothers me is not being able to make my own neighborhoods and customize them to my personal tastes like I could in the second game.  I still wish I had it.  I only have the original content version so that is what my review is based on and not any of the expansions.  So I am not aware if they have changed that rule about you being able to create your own personal neighborhoods in now since later expansions have come out.  As I may or may not have read somewhere, The neighborhood creation feature is really the only thing that bugged me, other than that everything else right down to the increased character personalization options was incredible, not to mention I was rather impressed with the realism in the way the characters looked and acted.","December 25, 2013","false","33.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

These are pretty solid dlc's and ones that add a fair bit of content to the game. I wouldn't reccomend buying the stuff packs as all they do is add items into the game that being honest aren't all that amazing.\n\nHonestly i really want to bash this game for having so much dlc and dlc that cots what it does, but this game is an excellent experiance and is so fun to play. it's just a real shame it costs so much\n\nso in conclusion i guess i reccomend the game, but only on a sale because to get the full experiance you're going to need to buy most of the EXPANSION PACK dlc.

And don't even get me started on the microtransactions, that's just disgusting and not even worth the effort of raging over.\n\nThe Sims 3 is a great game with lots of content....if you spend the $400 or so on the expansions which do nothing but add content to the game that should have either been released at launch or patched in for free later on. Sims 3 truly sets the bar for how awful microtransactions and DLC can be in a game that could have been great. At this point just wait for the Sims 4 and pray EA has learned from their mistakes....not that that's ever happened before!","June 24, 2014","false","20.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Some very important features, such as Create A World, aren't available unless you download the game through Origin (or screw around with your registry, which isn't a good idea). Fortunately, you can uninstall your Steam version and re-download it through Origin for free, but I've heard that once you do, any expansions or stuff packs you get through Steam will no longer work, so don't plan on saving on sales.

Individual Sims are still as fun, weird, and entertaining as they've always been, and the "open neighborhoods" introduced with Sims 3 just lets that fun spread.\n\nMy main criticisms of this game are first: it's a resource hog, so it can be very difficult to run on an older computer or one that's been weighed down with a lot of other active applicatoins.  Two: it has a lot, lot, lot of outstanding bugs.  Many of those can be dealt with through the use of third-party mods and scrupulous computer maintenance, but really, I do wish the game developers took bug fixes more seriously.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knightshiva/recommended/47890/","knightshiva","Knightshiva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knightshiva/","39 products in account","This game is ridiculously huge to begin with, but for some strange reason it doesn't seem to have enough of the essential content to create a good story with the sims. I mean, in some ways it's a lot like Sims 2 (which I have loved for so many years), but in other ways, its frustratingly different. For example, in Sims 2, I felt satisfied with the game that I bought -- even though I hadn't bought any expansion packs yet. The game was able to stand on its own and impress me without having any extra content. With Sims 3, I feel this horrible dissatisfaction with the content, dispite the superior graphics and the exciting new *live* neighborhood. Oftentimes I can ignore the feeling, but some times it is dishearteningly glaring.\nThere is always this subconsious push to run back to steam and grab up more DLC so that the game can achieve some kind of tolerable level of "rightness" -- almost as though EA was trying to do this on purpose. It seems awful, but I am starting to believe that they just broke the game up into pieces, called it DLC, and tried to sell it to people piecemeal!\nAn additional problem, and a rather gamebreaking one for me, is the sheer size of this game. Once you build it up to a reasonable level with "Pets" "Ambitions" and "Nightlife", things start to go seriously wrong. Bugs and glitches that once were just annoyances become major problems, lag that was pretty tolerable before is now making you mad, and loading times that were originally only a lengthy 5 minutes are now running into the range of 20 minutes -- and this is on the lowest settings possible! I have also begun to experience issues with the game essentially *growing* the more I play it. It automatically starts to get fatter and more sluggish every time. Not to mention the crazy amount of inconvienient game crashes!\nAll in all, I suppose coming so late to the game, I should have heeded the bad reviews and steered clear of it, but as you all know, sometimes, in pursuit of a dream, a gamer is tempted to try something that they know probably sucks.\n\nI would only recommend this game to someone with a ton of patience and a 5 star computer system :P","May 2, 2014","false","378.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Once you start, don't get a job. That ♥♥♥♥ is for dumb people. Go to a house that is huge, so that you know the people who live in it are rich. Go inside, meet a girl. It doesn't matter how old, as long as they are out of high school. Flirt with them until you guys become romantic interests. Don't forget to do a lot of romance/flirt interactions with them to make this happen quicker. It usually takes about 5 minutes to get them from stranger to romantic interest.\n\nThen, invite them over to your house. Relax on the bed, and invite her over to cuddle. Go to interactions, hit more, and hit try for baby. MAKE THAT ♥♥♥♥♥ PREGNANT. Don't worry, it won't cost you any money. At the moment I have 9 kids with 7 different woman, and I haven't met any of them. Make sure you try for the baby at least 5 times, so that'll guarantee that she gets pregnant. The upside of that is so when she gives birth, your mood goes way up.\n\nNext, go to romance and hit "propose going steady". She'll say yes, because you're a ♥♥♥♥ing MAC DADDY, then go to the same place and hit propose marriage. She won't give a ♥♥♥♥ that you just became boyfriend/girlfriend, you're a ♥♥♥♥ing mac daddy and she says yes. She'll move in with you, and you get all of her money and her car if she has one. She usually has around 10k that you get and a car that sells for 5-16k. This whole process will take you about 10 minutes. After you get married, make sure to try for a baby a couple times again, just to be sure.\n\nLast, interact with her, go to mean and hit break up. After about a minute, you realize all these ♥♥♥♥♥es aren't worth your time. You'll break up, and your mood will go down a bit, but not for long because she was a colossal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. All you need to do now is hit her face on the side to take control of her sim, that go to her cellphone, call the realtor, and hit move. Once you are on the move screen, check the box that says kick out, and rename her new house. It will be your last name by default, but that ♥♥♥♥♥ DOES NOT deserve the honor of having your last name. I named my first ex-wife's new house Cun!t, then the rest I just named Ex-Wife #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, and much much more. Now just repeat this multiple times and soon enough you'll be living in a mansion with the most expensive stuff.\n\nIf only it worked like this in real life.\n\n10/10","December 29, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","6","7","8","0"

Despite the graphical advancements and optimization that make Sims 3 a much smoother game than previous titles, Sims 3 fails to deliver an actually game experience that is rewarding. This and atrocious advertising by EA/Maxis make the game a flop. Here are the reasons broken down.\n\n1) In game advertising. This was such a new low in all my time of playing video games. At every turn, the game is selling you something more. IN THE GAME!!! And if its not useless then its obviously removed from the final product. Selling 20 DLC is one thing (that I object to FYI) but selling you furniture in the game building menu, loading screens that were for DLC, and then asking you to post your screen shots on Facebook... wow that is just putrid. Your playing of the Sims 3 is not a game, but an extended infomercial.\n\n2) I simply found Sims 3 to be a series of mini-games rolled into one. Career advancement, needs, lifetime aspirations, friendships, it was all just so boring to check off one task after another to satisfy each 'aspect' of the game. None of these things made a difference with each other.\n\nDont go to the bathroom and ♥♥♥♥ yourself? no worries, this has no affect with the sim you're talking to. Cheat on your sim significant other? who cares, you'll still get a promotion at work. Achieve the lifetime aspiration? not a bid deal, since you'll get one more pointless talk bubble with another sim that wont mean anything.\n\nIts just frustrating to see that the game has so many aspects that play like mini-games since they have no bearing on anything else. You'd think a close sim dying would remove options for your playing sim since a traumatic death would scare/encourage certain developments. Nope\n\nAlso failure in the game means nothing. Got rejected from WooHoo? Got fired? Got a sim cheating on you? this will not hinder or alter the game for your sim’s life. How can this be a game mechanic for success?\n\nIf you are of the perspective that in game sales aren’t a big deal, well then this failure of gameplay can’t be ignored. What a sad story this franchise has had, going from on eof the most popular games out there (16 million units sold for Sims 1) to a laughing stock example of DLC cash cows.\n\nI'm sure this review is irrelevant now, seeing the Sims 4 being pushed heavily, yes you called it, in the Sims 3 game right now. I waited for Sims 3 to hit rock bottom retail price since I only really wanted the housing design aspect. But having enjoyed Sims 1 and Sims 2 for the game itself, I am disheartenly justified in waiting so long to get this game at 80% off.\n","February 2, 2014","false","114.6"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","1"

No worries - slide the bust meter all the way up!\n\nThis is a game that you can play until you get over it but then be able to come back and pick up where you left off or start over from scratch.\nI bought Sims 3 + Multiple DLC packs for $80 (RRP was roughly $200) a few years ago and I dont regret it. Even though it sits there for a while collecting virtual dust due to it becoming repetitive and stale - I am currently back into it. I grab the DLCs while on sale and the additions keep it fresh, interesting and a good variety!\nPS: You can complain about the price of the DLC all you want or you could actually be patient and wait til it goes on sale and buy it then...

It also teaches about the Career Ladder, of which many workplaces may have, depending on your skills (which is also implied on the game) and if you have a healthy relationship with colleagues. On top of the fact that this game is educational, its very enjoyable and has its cool and humourus moments, which the game can automatically allow you to save and remember them. There are many aspects on which I find halarious, from the reaction to a fire, and the most saddest parts, like an old sim passing on.\n\nDespite an all round brilliant game in its graphics, which comes to my concern, it requires a very fast processor, one that most of the cheaper computers won't be able to handle, like mine. So therefore the last time I played it, it completely disheartened my gameplay experience as my computer was unable to cope and crashed many times.

Their AI isn't horrible, and they will self-perserve as best as possible without your input (although they're still horrible at it). There are also a lot more interactions with the world and other sims that help flesh out your little community.\n\nCons: You need the DLCs. Maybe not all of them, but you need at least one of the larger expansions and a few content packs. The base game is okay, but it's obvious that a lot of things that should have been in the base game, such as modifications and extra options for various careers, were not in specifically so EA could sell it to you later. And as always, the more add-ons you have, the worse the game performs, so there's always this balancing act.\n\nPro?Con?: You will wonder where the last 8 hours of your day went... frequently.\n\nVerdict: I can only recommend this game earnestly if you are okay with buying some of the DLC. If not, then you're in for maybe 15 hours or so of enjoyment before you get bored of having the same items, doing the same careeers, and generally following the same path over and over again.","June 30, 2014","true","95.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

This game is addicting and for a period of time, took over my life. The sims allows you to do whatever you want with people. I usually make OTPs and ships on the sims or my friends when they date irl. When one breaks up with someone irl i kill their sim. this is game super fun and expansion packs make it better. although i wish expansion packs were cheaper. You can do almost anything in Sims 3. One expansion pack that is my favorite and that I highly reccomend is Generations, I love playing as families on Sims 3 so this expansion pack was perfect. It adds so much to the game. It adds a new trait, new things you can interact with sims and also imaginary friends which is super fun. It also adds many more useful items like potions. Pets is also a very good expansion pack but I find i crash sometimes when i use it so save often. Pets adds, well pets and other animals that you can collect. it also adds new traits like the Cat Lover, Dog Lover, Animal Lover and etc..\n\nHere are some expansion packs i reccomend you buy at your own risk:\n\n1. Island Paradise\n\nI bought this pack a few months ago and it was so cool, there were boats and houseboats and even a new neighborhood! There was so much more too, hot tubs and resorts there was so much that i cant even begin to tell you. Thats probably one of the things that causes the problem. The problem is that the game lags really badly and crashes every 15 minutes sometimes less. Its probably because of all the stuff in it. The expansion pack would definatly be my absolute favorite if it werent for the lag and crashing\n\n2. Supernatural\n\nIts cool and all with the different creatures but it takes over your game. Thats really all I have to say\n\n\nThose are the only two I really reccomend looking out for but consider I have not bought all the expansion packs considering how steam has a summer sale once a year and how I am broke most of the time.

I have an Irish wolfhound, and a burglar broke into my house and stole my things, all without a peep out of the dog!  Seriously?!  The dog had already been told to guard the house several times - which let's face it, you wouldn't have to do with a real dog, especially a breed like this, we're not talking chihauha here!  The dog should be programmed to automatically guard, and the burglar should be afraid of it.  Also, your dog runs away if you only feed it for a couple of days or so, and don't hug it, or play with it, or walk it, treat it, brush it ....\n\nIn other ways, the game is eerily realistic.  By the time my Sim gets up, showers, brushes her teeth, makes some breakfast, feeds the dog, plays with the dog, hugs/treats/or brushes the dog, takes out the trash, and recycles the newspaper, it's time to go to work.  And my sim only has a part-time job!!  Then she has to come home, make dinner, do the whole dog thing again, maybe find a bit of time to read a skill book, and go to bed.   Way, way, way too much like real life.  Except that I have a full-time job in real life.  Why on earth would I want to play a game that was as filled with mundane tasks and routine as my own life?  People play games to escape from that!\n\nI know, you can change the time speed.  But shouldn't the devs have already set it up as a default that the routine things don't take so long to do, so you don't have to constantly play with the time settings?  and shouldn't they have set it up so your sim knows what to do after you've done the same routine at roughly the same time on the same days, and your sim just goes and does it superfast, leaving you more time to go off and do other things in the game?  am I supposed to set this up, making routine lists and feeding them to my sim?   If I leave my sim alone to do things, she does stupid, pointless things like reading and re-reading Where's Bella, over and over again.\n\nMaybe I just don't know how to play this game, I know it's a popular game, and maybe there's a way around these problems that my 20  hours or so of playing hasn't been enough for me to find.   I get bored quick, though, so if a game can't me interested within that 20 hours, forget it.    Sims3 gets a big thumbs down from me.","December 28, 2013","false","106.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Stability problems, freezing and random quitting were some of the problems I've experienced.  It's a shame because I've always enjoyed the series.  But it seems that the more expansion packs you add, the more problems seem to show up.  It was running OK for a while when I had just installed Night Life...I only noticed some slowdown here and there.  However, I picked up three expansion packs during the Steam Winter sale.  In doing so, my game became unplayable.  My previous towns were all suddenly gone and any game that I created thereafter always became corrupt.  It's rather frustrating and I wish I could get my money back at this point.  Forums don't seem to be of much help either.  I just had my computer built in Spring 2013 with WIndows 8, so my computer is not the issue.\n\nIn the end, I DO recommend the base game to loyal fans.  However, just be warned that the expansion packs may completely ruin your ability to play, regardless of how new your computer is.  Since the expansion packs are what previously made this game's replayability so high, overall it's a disappointment and I regret having wasted money on broken expansion packs.","March 2, 2014","false","52.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's really fun to play and it's like no other game made ever.   You could easily waste away hours on such a entertaining game.\n\nWhy do I not recommend it then you ask?   Easy.   Nothing ever works right.   The developers are more worried about getting the next DLC released so they can get more cash.   They really don't care if all the features in the game or the DLC don't work.  Oh?   You sent our sim to university and then it just vanished making the game unplayable?   Who cares because we already have your money!  Fun stuff.\n\nIt's really a shame that we, as consumers, put up with garbage like this.   If a game isn't complete it should not be released as a complete game. Then telling people the new DLC (which cost more money) will fix the problems. Then that DLC causes problems that you have to buy the next DLC to fix.   See what I am getting at?  This game is fun but the people who made it are more worried about coming up with ways to squeeze more money out of you than they are making an enjoyable gaming experience.\n\nWhen you look at the number of players in the community and the number of DLCs for this game it doesn't take Adam Smith to figure out this title is raking in the cash.  You would think with that kind of money flowing the developers could at least spend a real effort getting rid of the bugs.   After two or three years games should not have bugs that make it totally unplayable.\n\nAsk yourself.   Do I really want to experience the frustration of spending money on something that infuriates me before I get through the registration process?  Am I going to spend money on a game and time creating a sim just to have them vanish when I try to use the extra content?\n\nI wish somebody would file a class action law suite against these guys.  If they had a real threat to their money perhaps then they would start making software that functions as advertised.","March 6, 2014","false","58.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am dissapointed and um... angry actually. This is one of the most dissapointing games I have ever played. Not because of gameplay, that part is great... when and if it happens. This is the most buggy thing I have ever played. I read the online reviews which warned me, but I have a great gaming computer with lots of resources and processing power, what could go wrong? My real issue (as far as I can tell) comes from the paradise island add on which consistently stalls and has a huge bug... I tried setting everything down way low but it was still stalling all the time. I would just go elsewhere (like university) and all would be fine, so I mostly played there. But i went on an 'adventure' and when i 'returned home' i got dumped on a tiny island with no ability to move physically at all and I mean at all,  no home no money no access to the other panels for phone or anything else. I have repeatedly gone back to my save and tried again but its the same thing and I can't go anywhere else... the worst part is that when the 'adventure' times out it just takes me there again and I can do no more. When you invest a fair amount of time building a character, which is what sims is all about, and then it gets destroyed by a glitch it really is annoying, and for a game that is this incredibly expensive it's inexcusable. If you still decide to pour your money down this money grubbing hole, don't get paradise island and really look at the forum for issues others are having before considering any other add-ons.  And hey Maxis, when you make a game this badly perhaps you want to take the time to fix it before putting out another rendition.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeeNargles/recommended/47890/","SeeNargles","Luna Lovegood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeeNargles/","110 products in account","My review of this game is easily mixed, the game is very fun to play and enjoyable, but much more so with the downloadable content, or only a fraction of it.  Most of it is about half as expensive as the game itself where other content is even more expensive than that, there's plenty of useless add ons that only add a few cosmetic changes and nothing else.  More or less it's devided into two seprate groups.  Actual content and "Stuff" packs, the actual content is viable if it weren't more expensive, where as the "Stuff" packs only add a couple new stuff, ussually stuff that won't affect gameplay in the slightest outside of just being able to buy a couple extra stuff for twenty dollars.\n\nEssentially the only reason I got this game due to the price was because of a 75% sale that was going on, doing research on every little pack just in case I missed something, I've narrowed down some essentials to get if you purchase this game, but I'd only do so when it's on a 75% sale due to the fact all the DLC is over 250 US$ not including the game itself.\nNeeds:\nSeasons: Adds a couple new traits, a lot of new winter coats plus normal everyday clothes ussually themed with seasons, as well as adds dynamic weather and a threat of dying from weather or getting miserable sun burn.\nPets: Adds a bunch of pets to the game, from cats, dogs, and horses which you can control to birds turtles and other non-controlable characters.  You'll spend a little less time speeding through your day when your sim is taken up at work or asleep this way.\nGenerations: Adds quite a few new traits and a new theme, scrapbook, which stores your memories, the pictures are taken a bit wonky half the time but it also lets you pick your wish no matter what which is always a plus.\n\nThe rest is based on oppinion such as a couple I haven't gotten, supernatual comes to mind on this one.\n\nYou should avoid at all costs unless you feel 100% sure it'll add a lot to your experiance is all the stuff packs.  Mostly servering souly for role play aspects (Which the modding community glady contributes as well for free) your packs come with generally a couple new things for males and a handful for females (very lopsided men are less important than females in this game it seems) these packs server only to take your money, in fact my suspicion is that the reasoning behind using your codes on the sims 3 website you get with your games is souly because EA Games is so terrified people will find out it's a bad deal and just hack the stuff into the game, which wouldn't surprise me given their more or less monopolistic aproach.\n\nVerdict is the game is a avoid at all costs as you'll want to get a bunch of map packs, it's saving grace is that the stuff I found contributed to a great game is spending 60 US$ durring a 75% sale going on, but that's about 240 US$ out of a sale just to have a good game and that's only buying less than half the downloadable content.  Don't waste your money, wait for a sale or have been born very rich to not care, but this game so isn't worth the expense out of sale and DO NOT get this game if you don't have high end hardwear, this game will give issues to some better designed computers in its own.","March 6, 2014","false","85.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

LIFE!!!!!\n\nThe game is complex and well designed enough to let the gamers enjoy the possibilities of "life" as we know it.\n\nIt is vast enough for the gamers to see every corners of life first hand but it isn't detailed enough to show\nevery little miniscule details.\n\nDepending on how creative "you" are, the game can get extremely fun or extremely deadbeat-boring if you arn't.\n\nThe game offers some intense customisation\nHouses, sims, jobs, family, are some aspects that are fully customizable down to every individual faces.\n\nIt is a must try and a worthwhile buy(base game) quality wise.\n\nThey have their own version of a contents sharing communitites, the gamers are able to download various player made people, buildings, objects from the internet.\n\nSimilar to EA's spore, this is one of their trademark franchise that has not failed them, (for a damn good reason.)\n\nThe pros are explained above, the cons are:\n\n-The game greeds money, it really WANTS you to make purchases for ingame items, DLCs etc.\n\n-DLCs make the game more fun, THEY ARE INDEED FUN but imagine how much money you'll have to pay for various DLCs\nyou want.(if the prices have dropped to primal dollar values then reconsider the statement above)\n\n-The game can get addictive, it can seriously chew up some valueable time.\n\n-After you play the game for a long bit, it can start to lag horribley due to cummulated cache and such, so consider ventilating a bit.\n\n- Sims4(or versions above?) would be out. It would be more versatile than the previous sims3 and possibly more fun.\n\n-It is reccomended you use Origin :(\n\n\nIf you "love" and "somewhat respect" their game, consider buying it... If you wish to be frugal and do not want to spend every penny for their DLCs then please torrent safely :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","August 15, 2014","true","37.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I gave this entry a fair shake, but ultimately didn't like it. My biggest criticism might be that building and designing your house is a thousand times more complicated than the last game, which some people might actually consider a plus. I consider myself to have an obsessive attention to detail, but this game overwhelmed me. Do you want to position your furniture at an angle? What about BETWEEN grid spaces? Do you want to decide the precise shade of every single object in your house? Again, some people might love these new features, but I missed the days when everything snapped to a simple grid and color options were limited. A few constraints allow creativity to blossom, you know? My biggest problem with building and designing, however, is not the overwhelming amount of options but the fact that it just felt less intuitive. In The Sims 2, I knew what all the building tools did and if I had a piece of furniture in mind, I had a pretty good idea where to find it. Not the case with this game.

I give this a 9/10, you should try it for yourselves, if you have not already.","July 16, 2014","true","188.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Many people will say that The Sims 2 or The Sims 4 is better. The Sims 3 is the best Sims game because it has open world. I can't imagine a Sims game without open world. Open world allows you to travel to anywhere in the town. After the initial two-three loading screens, the only loading screens you'll encounter are when you use a mirror to change appearance, a dresser to plan outfit, or if you move, and even then these loading screens are quite short. You can customize your Sims fully, with all of the basics and many more clothing, accessories, hairstyles, and outfits available. Whatever you don't have, you can most likely get from The Sims Store, which you need an account for. You use your money to gain SimPoints, the currency used. While The Sims Store is overpriced and it will cost hundreds of dollars to buy all of the items, if you want to make an emo Sim, you will be able to buy all of the emo clothes, haircuts, and furniture without spending too much money.\n\n\nEnough about The Sims Store. The Sims 3 is great because of the endless possibilities. You can have an amazing variety of Sims, all with different personalities (which are fully customizable,) careers, houses, families, and Lifetime Wishes. The game runs very smoothly on my computer. There are also Skills and Opportunities, somewhat similar to real life. Opportunities will randomly be presented to you, with a brief description of the Opportunity, usually with some humour added in too. Opportunities often require you to do something in exchange for a reward. You may have to visit certain areas, fix broken objects, make food for certain establishments or Sims, or stay in late after work ends. Rewards vary, and may include better relationships with co-workers, bosses, or other Sims, job or school performance, Simoleons (in-game money,) or Skill gain. Opportunities often have a deadline. Skills are like skills in real life. Skills include Writing (typing), Painting, Gardening, Cooking, Handiness, Charisma, and many more. You can build Skills by practicing, which is different for each Skill, or by doing tasks that improve that Skill, as each Skill is useful for a specific task. You can also build Skills by reading books, watching TV channels, learning from other Sims or by having certain Traits.\n\n\nOverall, The Sims 3 is a good game that has unlimited replayability. It has its cons, however. The same old Sims get boring quickly, as Sunset Valley, the town that comes with the game, always has the same Sims when it is first started. However, the starting Sim's babies and descendants can vary. By creating an account, you get another town for free. A few other cons are that in a household of 8 (the maximum amount) Sims, it is really hard to have fun. You are constantly taking care of their Needs, which are Hunger, Bladder, Hygiene, Fun, Social, and Energy, and the rest of the time you are building Skills or Relationships, or improving job performance. Also, the stuff packs and expansion packs don't add very much, and are overpriced. The Sims Store is also overpriced.","January 23","true","70.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Over the years I've tried the different sims games, the graphics gets better, the interaction gets more varied but it really just boils down to a simple thing. It's your personal soap opera where you're the director.\nThe core components are basically the same with each sims version. Aging and other effects create a slightly different dynamic. Would I buy Sims 4? Only if it came in a bundle sale on steam and had smaller game save files. Do I have fun with it? Sure, but then I can have fun with a lot of simpler games. It's cheap to get if you grab the bundle on holidays and hours of play if you like Storytelling. Yes, its basically playing with a digital dollhouse or "action figures." Then again, most games are in the most basic sense the same concept of make believe and playing hero or bad guy.","October 7, 2014","true","245.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Then you can cloth and add your desired attributes which takes a lot of times, therefore you can play the game endlessly much by adding more stuff or even killing your Sims. You can even buy and add new expansions to add a lot of new cool features to the game such as supernatural Sims and lots of other things. The already big in-game content can be even supplemented with lots of custom content from the internet which is much sexier than the standard content. It is a hugely time consuming game which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys playing simulation games.

If you have played any of the other sims games then you know what to expect, make a sim (person) give them a job, find them a girlfriend/boyfriend and start a family. The sims 3 really changed alot with the other sims for example the city is now an open world city so not more one lot houses now the city is your lot. There is so many new things involved with the sims 3 that you cant describe it, you need to just jump in the game and find it.\n\njust stunning\nYou may also notice that the graphics got a smooth upgrade. Sims now look more like real people than worn out dolls. Also your needs such as hunger got an update as well so you dont have to eat and use the bathroom every 5 minuets which gives you more time to explore the city or maybe call up a friend and hang out. There are way more sims in the city than there was in the sims 2 cities which leads to a more realistic tone in the game.\n\nrewards everywhere\nAs the game is fun you will find that the longer you play the more rewards you can get for example you pay have spent all night at a night club and found some girl to talk to and then later got married to her just to find out she is very famous. Even looking into a telescope at night can be rewarding as you can find new planets and stars and name them and get paid for find them. The game can get a little boring for a while doing the same thing over and over again but anyone who is a die hard fan will love the sims 3.\n\nverdict\nThe sims 3 is a game where you can do anything and i have not seen anything like it. Even though the game can get borning after awhile its still fun, enjoyable and a great way to pass the time in the real world. I give the sims 3 4/5 stars.","May 9, 2015","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The love we dare not speak its name.\n\nI remember playing the original and thinking that it was a lot like a game I had played way, way back in DOS land. Then Sims 2 came out and competely blew my mind, giving a whole new spin on the idea of the virtual dollhouse. It was a game you could walk away from, come back to, watch passively or interfere with. So imagine my surprise when Sims 3 said that the entire town was going to run simultaneously. I was shocked, outraged, and said I wouldn't play it.\n\nI take everything back. The Sims 3 is a solid upgrade to the Sims 2 (though it crashes just as much, it seems) and the up-and-coming Sims 4 still appear to have everything that made the franchise great amounts of money for EA... and people are still waiting in the wings to give them more. Yes, EA, you've taken my money again and I gave it with a smile, a prayer, and a pony.\n\nRating: 9/10","June 27, 2014","true","137.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Sims is a great series and The Sims 3 doesn't fail to impress me yet again. However, EA has taken DLC and thus 'milking' their product to the next level. Max Profit, as less effort as possible.

Create Sims, send them to work, try to upgrade your house, maintain relationships, all are included! It's so addicting, fun, and equally frustrating.

I love this version the best out of all of them. Not just for the game mechanics or graphics, but because It truly defines the world around the sims in way I have not seen before . In many ways allows more modding than The Sims 2 franchise. They also made it so I wanted to buy the expansions (not necessarily a good thing financially), but that really speaks to me of the quality of this game series in particular because this is something I didn't do with the older versions of the this game series. I feel so comfortable with The Sims 3 I actually have no intention of right a way switching to The Sims 4. I might get it if it on sale next year in Holiday Steam Sale.... but I'm okay with sticking with The Sims 3 for a few more years.","December 26, 2013","true","611.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalanken/recommended/47890/","Kalanken","Kalanken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalanken/","119 products in account","..are there any actual serious reviews for this game? Eh. Here I go.\n\nCONS- DLCs are all the same price- some bring some lackluster minor content, while others bring a whole new game. It depends on the DLC- oh, and not to mention, the game is basically worthless without the Pets DLC. At least, in my personal opinion it is. The only reason I'm not playing the Sims 4 is because there is no Sims 4: Pets released.\n- After a certain amount of time, the game lags and freezes up. Sims get stuck on things, and if you can't find out who they are and do the required 'resetSim [firstname] [lastname]' cheat, it'll move at a snail's pace on even the best computer.\n- EVEN AFTER YOU MUTE THE DAMN MUSIC, IT STILL BLASTS YOUR EARS EVEN WHEN YOUR VOLUME IS SET TO 10/100. Chill. Music. Music needs to chill, and this bug despartly needs to be fixed. DESPARTLY. Please. Ow. My ears. They are bleeding.\n- No, but seriously. There is something wrong with the volume settings. They do not work. At all. The game still blasts your ears.\n- Did I mention loading screens? ..No? Well, be prepared to meet them. For thirty minutes at time. Every time you change towns. Every time you go to university. Every time you go to visit china to try to find that stupid thing you can destory bolders with but you NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS EVEN AFTER HOURS OF PLAYIN--\n\nNEUTRALS= I.. umh. Limited customization options for the pets? Also, if you give your sims high free will they will do nothing but stuff the dog's face full of treats or spam pet the horse. It never ends. N E V E R.\n= DLC's are needed to make the game interesting if you aren't doing challenges. Some things should just have been added to the game since they're so minor. Also, where are the patches? No? They've moved onto the Sims 4 without fixing some of these major bugs the game has had since day one? Oh? Really? That's okay. Toootttalllyyy okay.\n= Aliens, no. Nobody asked for you. Stop abducting my Sims while I'm trying to spam level my Logic skill to get a promotion. Stop.\n\nPROS+ What the sims is known for: CUSTOMIZATION. You can make your sims as realistic as you want, as crazy as you want, as stupid-looking as you want, as insane as you want, as perfect as you want, as.. well, nearly anything that you want. It's one of the game's core features- to grow and develope the family you have produced over many hours of hardships and learning, only to have things set back or your only sim killed by a meterorite in the lands of China. Yes, that actually happened. Not fun. Not. Fun. Otherwise was okay!\n+ Random things. You may only start out with one town and you DO need the DLC's to do most of the interesting things, but otherwise it's pretty grand. If you get the DLCs, say, one every four months, the game actually has a long lifespan. Try to go for 'Generations,' 'Pets,' or 'World Adventures' first. Those are just my personal reccomendations- not even I have all of them yet. Someday. Someday...\n+Traits and interactions are fun, and can cause a few good laughs every now and then. Yes, it can be unrealistic- you can get married the same day you enter a steady relationship with someone- but really, it's the Sims. What else do you expect?\n+ There's mods for.. just about anything. This game has been modded to hell and back. Plus, on top of that, the amount of challenges this game has(see '100 Baby Challenge,' it's one of the most common ones) causes replayability. Just remember to save!\n+ You can bribe Death with a flower.\n+ Unlucky sims are basically immortal- they cannot die from any way other than natural causes.\n+ Did I hear genertics and hidden traits, anyone?\n+ I'm going to add more later, but this is a good game. If you haven't played it already, or seen a video on it.. I'm so, so sorry for whatever rock you've lived under.","February 16","true","876.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me a while to move from Sims 2 onto 3 and i'm glad i finally made that choice. It's by far the best for running things, the amount of mods and different things you can get for this game too is ALOT.\n\nSims 3 is great to kill time either to build houses, make families or just have fun by creating your own stories.","July 15, 2013","true","439.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a funny, tongue-in-cheek game with loads of opportunity and replay value; I'd say stay away from the overpriced DLC (and Sims 4, too) until/unless you are totally, irredeemably bored with this one, because the base game alone provides plenty of traits, jobs, skills, etc. to keep you busy for a while.  The base town with the same cast of NPCs does start to get dull after a while, but you probably only need one or two DLC towns at most and if you don't wanna pay, then you can create your own town with your own people.  If you have a decent/recent PC, it should run fine -- a little laggy, but nothing that destroys the experience.\n\nOne of my personal all-time favorites; it's not a perfect game, but if you enjoy dicking around with other people's lives and relationships, you will not be disappointed.\n\n10/10 would forget to go to my own wedding/first childbirth again","May 24","true","70.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

They did a nice job of getting your sims out of the house and into town. The vanilla version though I think is pretty low on content in some areas, too few hair, clothing and accessories to choose from. But the customization options for almost everything in-game is very very well done. You can take a wallpaper and change it to look like metal, or take a car and make it look like a wooden toy. I always loved building my own house in Sims, and in Sims 3 I got more room for creativity than ever. The "face-generator" could use some work though, as many sims look very much alike.\n\nShamefully many DLC though, at shamefully high prices. Not cool.  But I have my hopes for the future of the series. Maybe nr 4 will allow me to truly build a palace, and make the game harder in some way, I found it way too easy to build a fortune and make friends in this game.\n\nAnyways, a good SIMS game.","February 25, 2014","true","224.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Having played the Sims from day one i have watched the Sims evolve over the years and each game is more and more fun to play. You can play the game properly and try and achieve your Sims needs or if your feeling chaotic like myself at times you can create families and just cause havoc and watch them fall apart in messy households running riot. Its also a game my girlfriend and myself can play at the same time, i make the money and do all the hard part and she spends it on customizing parts of the house and garden or buys the next sized house for us to do up haha. There are many many DLC packs for the Sims 3, some that are fun and others that wouldnt interest me but thats ultimately down to personal choice. Sims 3 and Sims pets is all we need to have a laugh for a few hours here and there! Looking forward to the Sims4. I hope this helps some of you that may be considering buying this, any more questions feel free to message me!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChicanoDucky/recommended/47890/","ChicanoDucky","Murder Mountain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChicanoDucky/","330 products in account","While the base game isn't much, the true power comes from the expansions. All expansions are made to work in synergy with the other and create more content exponentially linked to the number of expansions you have.\n\nSo the base game + supernatural + ambitions means the ambitions system now works for supernatural careers like alchemist and unlocks "synergy content." Without ambitions, the system wont be there for supernatural.\n\nAs your game grows, the synergy content grows as well. When you own all the major expansions (not the stuff packs), you get an absolutely massive amount of synergy content.\n\nSo far here are the expansions:\n\nAmbitions - adds interactive jobs, new jobs centering around craft skills. Adds scrap metal robots that become obsolete when you get into the future. Adds scrap yard, fire station, and other job based commecial lots.\n\npets - adds pets. Nothing special. Not much synergy content. Requires NRAAS mods or the wild life bogs down your game. Adds pet park commercial lots.\n\ninto the future - this is VERY unbalanced and practically cheating. You can create overpowered sim-bots that can max every skill, then teach your kids those skills or craft an infinite amount of high end items. They can even hold max level jobs meaning a single sim bot turns the sims into easy mode permenantly since sim bots dont age. Adds futuristic commercial lots like a future lounge, a fancy bar run by robots.\n\nUniversity - this adds social groups, "drugs", alcohol, multiple commercial lots like coffee shops, comic book stores, and bowling alleys. Adds plant sims. Adds science skill, and science objects like the science station. In here, you can clone practically anything and everyone. You also The science objects here are overpowered. You can even buy a brain enhancer to respec your entire personality whenever you want, even random strangers. This expansion also adds social networking, where you run a website and gain followers based on what you do. For instance, talking to a ghost and blogging about it is good content. This applies for other expansions as well, where you can boast about a good performance in show time or a cleared dungeon in world adventures. A good blogger can also get famous in late night.\n\nSeasons - This adds seasons that tie into other expansions. Island Paradise resorts are effected by what season it is. No one will want to go to a resort in the snowy winter. Adds aliens, and alien technology like the weather controller and UFO car that you can use to terrorize the city.\n\nSupernatural - adds supernatural creatures,  huge addition to  crafting ingredients, lunar cycle, and magic. The lunar cycle means that 1 night means there is a full moon, which means all sorts of supernatural creatures come out like zombies. This sounds cool, but it turns into an annoyance. The zombies become loud, annoying hobos on your porch after a while. Adds supernural lots like the vampire lounge (fancy bar), and the werewolf bar.\n\nlate night - adds fame, which ties into all other expansions. Adds even more powers to vampires. Adds nightlife commercial lots that tie into the commercial lots of all the other expansions.\n\nIsland paradise - adds all sorts of water activities, boats, house boats, and the ability to run a resort or hotel. Adds mermaid sims. NOTICE: YOU NEED NRAAS BUG FIXES TO USE THE ISLAND PARADISE NEIGHBORHOOD WITHOUT ISSUE.\n\nGenerations - adds a whole bunch of rewards based on what you do in your sim's life. Adds a bunch of inspiration rewards for living a good life, often in overpowered items. Adds another science object, the chemistry set that is  just as overpowered as the other items from university.\n\nworld adventures - you travel the world, complete dungeons, and if you have late night you can get famous doing it. Adds objects from Egypt, France, and China. It adds TONS of rare and expensive collectibles including rebuilt sarcophigi, statues, and dive wells. A good haul of artifacts can make you a very rich, or the museum very profitable if you own it. Adds mummy sims.\n\nshow time - ties into late night. adds performance careers. Adds genies. adds a whole bunch of items that should have been in late night like the DJ booth.\n\nIt all depends on what you want from your sims.\n\nCONS:\n\nHUGE LOAD TIMES WHEN YOU LOAD ANY NEIGHBORHOOD.\n\nVERY CPU INTENSIVE GAME, WITH ALL THE EXPANSIONS AN INTEL I5 2500 HAS PROBLEMS KEEPING UP DUE TO THE GAME LOADING EVERYTHING AT ONCE LIKE IN THE CAS MENU.\n\nNEEDS NRAAS BUG FIXES TO WORK MOST OF THE TIME.","January 24, 2015","true","196.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Building on the Wishes mechanic of the second game, this one has Lifetime Rewards, where you can gain points for keeping moodlets high and fufilling their various desires.\nThese points can be cashed in at any point.\n\nPersonally, I recommend getting the Supernatural and Late Night expansion packs if you like cities, and like an easier way to be immortal but still allow aging. Being a vampire is pretty fun.\nLate Night adds a small city to play in, which admittedly feels a bit... empty. You'll want to play custom towns off the Sims3modding website.\n\nBeyond that... Sims 3 is a mostly open world, non-instanced Sims game. It has problems, sure, it's buggy, it can do a lot of things at once meaning when you save your game it takes forever, you will find horses hanging around a single empty lot if you have pets.\nAlso, don't get seasons: much of the weather effects are really resource intensive and may kill your game.","February 1, 2015","true","91.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I will let my secrets and anger build up inside, then, I will tell a stranger all my secrets, when he is walking all, alone, at midnight. Then, once I'm finished, I will stick him with a exacto knife right into his torso, separating the diafraghm from the spholo cavity, then one last fatal stick to the insular cortex, immobilizing him, let him bleed out right in front of me, feel the blood trickle down my hand, setting my teeth on edge. Then, I will continue stabbing the corpse, separating the octuplectic nerve, from the Vegas cavity in the spine as his spinal fluids dribble out like rain in the winter, just beginning to freeze. Then Whisper my last secret into the mutilated corpses ear, "know body will live to tell the secret" I say. I pat the corpses slashed, separated spine as if "good luck" then continue my journey.

I can even remember watching my mother playing Sims 1 when I was like, three. When I played Sims 2, I owned every EP. I once was able to call this my absolute favorite series, until I came to the realization that the game plus all the expansion packs cost around $400, and as amazing as the game is, I don’t think $400 is worth it. It’s extremely difficult to play this game and not drool over the expansion packs, so I just kind of stopped playing it. I recommend this game if you have amazing self-control, or have $400 to waste. Don’t get me wrong, hours of fun are to be had with this excellent game, but the fact is that the developers and publishers are evil when it comes to the EPs. Even though playing as a vampire fireman who aspires to be a stunt double, living with robots, racists, and poodles, then watching them all try to kill each other is amazing, $400 for the full experience? ♥♥♥♥ you EA.","September 14, 2013","true","68.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Buy pools, spas, outdoor living areas, decorative garden plants, televisions, exercise machines, kitchen appliances, cars....the list is huge!\n+ Work as a master criminal, a journalist or even a detective. Go travelling to...Egypt, France and China (with DLC). This game is packed with plenty to do.\n+ Many different skills for your sims to level up, from science to cooking. So you can have a very varied gameplay experience.\n+ Several neighbourhoods to play in, each with a unique layout.\n+ There's a large amount of playtime in the Sims 3 for players of all sorts. I managed to get about 100 hours out of it.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- While I acknowledge graphics aren't a major focus of Sims gameplay, it could definitely be improved. Aesthetically, this game is disappointing.\n- Despite the vastness of Sims 3, it can become boring after awhile. Once you're earning a high wage, built a mansion filled with valuable items and had a family, there's really not much else to do. This game has a cycle of repetition, whereby you continue to do the same tasks over and over, just in different ways. Sure, the kids in your family grow up and you're able to control their lives, but it's like starting from scratch again, where's the sense of accomplishment in that? It's the balance between fun and repetitive content which Sims 3 suffers from.\n- The game is quite expensive, even though it's now 5 years old (as of 02/03/2014). DLC is also pricey, so make sure you absolutely want this game before paying in full, or wait for a sale.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10\n\nThe Sims 3 is a nice, relaxing game with many interesting features. For fans of the series, it's really worth checking it out. For those that are new to the game, I recommend grabbing this too, but just be aware of the flaws prior to purchase.","March 2, 2014","true","106.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

And yes, I will admit that having to pay for multiple little cool things in a game is a horrible idea. But the base game alone is worth adding to your collection of games. It is a unique simulation and can provide some expirimental, time-wasting fun. And it also provides a great base for the modding communtiy to get their creativity on. But without the mods or certain expansion packs, I must admit that it is a very lack-luster and thinly spread game. Comparing the base game to either a modded game or a game with all of the expansions and "stuff packs", it is an overly-simply good idea than anything else. Creativity is at play, yet the microtransactions are strong in this one. I'd make sure to download many mods and to turn off the in-game payment system in the Options to get a very true and personal experience with this fun simulator.","March 22, 2014","true","183.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

She is dying in the place of someone she loves, and the narrator does not regret any of the choices that brought her to this point. The past few months have been extraordinary, and she can’t complain.\n\nZip! Now we’re following the life of Isabella “Bella” Swan, our seventeen-year-old narrator. Bella is moving to Forks, Washington, to live with her dad. We later learn that she volunteered to do this so that she wouldn’t hold her mother back from spending more time with her mother’s new husband. Forks is isolated, cold, dreary, and wet, and Bella’s relationship with her dad is distant, since she was raised by her mother in Phoenix. Bella's new life is dull until she gets a glimpse of the Cullen family – five gorgeous, mesmerizing siblings who attend her high school. She learns they do not socialize with anyone but each other. One of the boys in particular, Edward, pays her close attention and seems to regard her with alarming hostility when she's forced to sit next to him in Biology class. The next day, he is absent from school.\n\nBella continues to adapt to her new life in Forks. She gets a lot more attention from boys than she was used to in Phoenix. She makes several friends quickly. A few days later, Edward finally is back in school. Now he’s friendly to Bella. His mere presence excites her. That afternoon in the school parking lot, a boy’s truck almost hits Bella after skidding on some black ice, but Edward uses his body as a shield in order to save her. Wait, how’d he do that?! Bella is totally baffled by this, but Edward refuses to explain his inhuman strength. She begins to have dreams about Edward, but at school, he gives her the cold shoulder. His behavior is very confusing, indeed.\n\nBella gets asked to the upcoming school dance by not one, but three boys, all of whom she rejects. The next day, Edward gets Bella to talk to him during lunch – for the first time he’s spending lunch apart from his siblings. Knowing that she's trying to make sense of his strength and how he saved her, Edward asks for her “theories” on him. Next, it’s let’s-figure-out-your-blood-type day in Biology class, and Edward’s skipping class. Bella becomes faint at the mere thought of blood, and gets taken to the nurse’s office (Edward appears outside and intercepts her from Mike, one of the guys who has a crush on Bella). Edward insists that he take her home.\n\nThat weekend, during a trip to a beach at La Push Indian reservation, Bella meets Jacob Black, who tells her about “the cold ones” (vampires). Word around the reservation is that the Cullens are vampires. When Bella gets home, she does some internet research and things start falling into place. Bella decides that she’s too in love with Edward to resist him, even if he is a vampire.\n\nSoon after, Bella takes a trip to Port Angeles with a few friends, where she gets lost looking for a bookstore. Some thugs almost attack her in a dark alley, but Edward appears in his shiny Volvo and saves her. They have dinner together, and he drives her home. He reveals that yes, he is a vampire. Edward doesn’t want to be a monster, though, and actually only drinks the blood of animals. Bella knows now that he does thirst for her blood, yet she still is in love with him. Edward repeatedly warns Bella that she should be afraid of him and stay away, if she’s smart.\n\nEdward and Bella take a mini-field trip together and spend the afternoon in a nearby secluded meadow, where Edward shows Bella that his skin sparkles in the sun (which is why vampires only come out at night or on cloudy days, which are common in Forks). They are completely in love. They kiss for the first time. Bella learns more about Edward’s family and their past. Edward struggles with abiding his morals (not tempting himself by getting close to a human) versus what he desires – to be near Bella.\n\nEdward spends the night in Bella's bedroom, watching over her as she sleeps (without her dad knowing, of course). Bella visits Edward’s house, meets his family, and learns more about their “kind” – vampires who don’t feast on humans. They go back to her house where Jacob and his father Billy Black show up to see her dad (Billy and Charlie are friends). Being a Quileute elder from the La Push reservation, Billy knows about the Cullens' secret and is worried for Bella's safety. He warns her to stay away from the Cullens. After the Blacks leave, Edward returns in his brother's jeep to pick up Bella. They’re going to play baseball. It's a Cullen family bonding ritual, evidently.\n\nWhile the Cullens are playing their crazy version of baseball (they're all incredibly strong and fast), three other vampires show up. One named James takes a liking to Bella (in the “I want to eat you” kind of way). Edward and his family get Bella away from James long enough to make a plan. They know that James is trying to track Bella, so Alice and Jasper (Edward's adoptive siblings) whisk her away to a hiding place in Phoenix, but James lures Bella to him by telling her that he has captured her mom. He’s about to kill Bella when the Cullen clan shows up. The only problem is that James has already bitten Bella. If Edward doesn't suck the venom-infected blood out of her, she'll become a vampire. Though it's difficult for Edward to control his urge to suck all of Bella's blood, he manages to cure Bella without killing her. The Cullens kill James and get Bella to a hospital, where she starts to recover from her many injuries.\n\nOverall Bella’s OK, though banged up. She and Edward are more in love than ever. However, they argue because Bella wants him to bite her and make her into a vampire so that they can live together forever; Edward refuses. Regardless of their different species, they are devoted to one another completely.\n\nIn the Epilogue, Edward surprises Bella by taking her to the prom – she's horrified because she's uncoordinated and worried about dancing in public. Jacob shows up at the dance and delivers a message – Billy wants Bella to dump Edward. He also wants her to know that they “will be watching” (Epilogue.118). Anyway, Edward and Bella go outside to have some time alone – it’s twilight outside. Again, Bella asks Edward to make her into a vampire, and he refuses. Edward says to Bella, “I will stay with you – isn’t that enough?” and she replies, “Enough for now” (Epilogue.204).\n","June 8, 2014","true","47.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Especially considering:\n∙ The game is relatively ancient.\n∙ They're getting set to release a new version of the game.\n∙ As soon as this version was released, they literally turned off support for the last version of the game.\n\nI play the game like an RPG.  Subsequently, I end up working to keep my character "young," even as the world ages around her.\n\nThe game allows for an immense amount of freedom, and has very interesting content.\n\nUnfortunately, for a game that costs as much as this one does, they seem to have some pretty big major oversights:\n∙ They have a micro-transaction system that isn't micro and requires buying points.\n∙ Their in-game store does not work with the Steam Wallet.\n∙ Some of the expensive content in their store could well - and probably should - be offered on Steam as DLC instead of from their store.\n∙ The game should have Steam Workshop integration.\n∙ They have a free toolset that will not work with the Steam version - unless  you're willing to edit your registry and perform a wide variety of other advanced tasks in order to trick it.\n∙ The game has some pretty basic bugs, and have always had those bugs, and requires mods just to keep the game playable.\n\nPlease note most of the problems I've noted just wouldn't be "problems" if the game wasn't still so expensive.  For example:\n∙ Simply releasing a version of the game with all the content available for it included in the purchase price, even at a cost of around forty dollars, would render my complaints null.\n∙ Either making the base game "free" as in beer, and bringing the costs of the DLC down to no more than a few dollars each.","March 12, 2014","true","245.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have sunk in a lot of hours on that clunker on how much IMPROVEMENT it had over the Original Sims and it's console counterparts. It introduces Aging, towns, the Supernatural, 3D archetecture, Floors, and just...so much stuff that it is hard to comphrend how many things it has done.\nSims 3, however...isn't that. It kinda...uhm...isn't really as fun.\n\nSims 3 looks and runs a LOT better than Sims 2, don't get me wrong. The visual design works in it's favor of making characters look realistic as well as adding a town that doesn't require a long-crack loading screen. But when I bought Sims 3 and started playing it, It felt empty rather than full.\n\nNot once did I actually play the In-Game families, when in Sims 2 I took a big love of the single mom and her dedicated son, the three dudes and the little alien baby (...Just got that reference) And the Goth Family just being cool again. But with Sims 3, I cannot recollect a single memorable sim that just made me think: "Yeah, that WAS a fun family to play with". But...I GUESS you can play as a custom sim? You know, the one with only a dozen or two default hairstyles?\n\nAnd let's get it out of the way. The Sims is just a dollhouse simulator for adults and kids, and we just like building our little 'family' to play around with. But with Sims 3, it feels more like a Lego simulator, where you have to buy all the hairparts and\nthe brick parts and the clothes parts and the blah blah parts, and all of them are just so god dang expensive!\n\nEven without the price tag, each DLC actually kind of RUINS the main vanilla flavor of the Sims 3 base game. It use to be where ghosts and the unknown were strange scary things, where the threat of death can come at a moments notice and surviving through to old age means you are a cool dude. Now, there are werewolves running around my town with a full moon every few nights, a dozen deer just running around yukking it up, and FESTIVAL EVENTS ARE COMING UP even though you bought the DLC to just get the hairstyles! It just muddles the main point of where I just want to let my sim live a normal life, not to become a immortal werewolf fairy vampire who has the big bucks and is married to Chuck the plumber.\n\nI would love a Sims game where you can actually customize the length of the hair, the fabric and length of the clothing, the dreams and desires of a Sim where the actions can't be overridden, I just want a Sim game where it just takes place in a house, and you raise a sim from being a baby sim into being a dead ghost sim. Just...please.\n\nWould I reccomend this game: NO\nThe graphics and visual design are an improvement over Sims 2, but the Sims 3 feels downright stale and claustrophobic compared to the open sense of discovery with it's predecessors.\nSuggestions to Game Devs: Try to focus on making a game where the character's personality actually defines how they dress and how they interact with others. It would be SO MUCH FUN to just have Sims interacting without our guidance.","April 9, 2014","false","171.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was a little laggy and had some weird glitches occassionally but it was running alright. After the origin website slashed some more of their expansion packs' prices in half, I bit. I bought two. Horrible decision. My game is now unrunnable. Well, it'll run but all of the items I had paid for before buying the newest two expansion packs are inexplicably "missing." A "missing items warning" pops up when I start the game that informs me that all of my missing items have been replaced with random basic items. This includes the clothes my sim was wearing and my hairstyle. I have tried redownloading and reinstalling the items from both the website under my purchase history, from the launcher, and from the in-game downloads dashboard. MULTIPLE TIMES. On top of my items that I paid for and had already been playing with going missing, the game is unbearably slow. So slow that I can't stand to play it. It freezes for a moment after every command. WASTE OF MONEY. I don't know why I haven't learned my lesson with EA. Oh yeah, and I contacted them for help. After waiting a good deal of time to chat with an associate, they somehow mixed up my conversation and directed me to EA FIFA help. Yeah.

Especially considering:\n∙ The game is relatively ancient.\n∙ They're getting set to release a new version of the game.\n∙ As soon as this version was released, they literally turned off support for the last version of the game.\n\nI play the game like an RPG.  Subsequently, I end up working to keep my character "young," even as the world ages around her.\n\nThe game allows for an immense amount of freedom, and has very interesting content.\n\nUnfortunately, for a game that costs as much as this one does, they seem to have some pretty big major oversights:\n∙ They have a micro-transaction system that isn't micro and requires buying points.\n∙ Their in-game store does not work with the Steam Wallet.\n∙ Some of the expensive content in their store could well - and probably should - be offered on Steam as DLC instead of from their store.\n∙ The game should have Steam Workshop integration.\n∙ They have a free toolset that will not work with the Steam version - unless  you're willing to edit your registry and perform a wide variety of other advanced tasks in order to trick it.\n∙ The game has some pretty basic bugs, and have always had those bugs, and requires mods just to keep the game playable.\n\nPlease note most of the problems I've noted just wouldn't be "problems" if the game wasn't still so expensive.  For example:\n∙ Simply releasing a version of the game with all the content available for it included in the purchase price, even at a cost of around forty dollars, would render my complaints null.\n∙ Either making the base game "free" as in beer, and bringing the costs of the DLC down to no more than a few dollars each.","March 12, 2014","true","245.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So ill describe this games awesomeness with my character Mowgli Mann.\n\nMowgli is a simple member of the Mann family, he sports his massive hunk of black fat and muscle. He's got a fountain in his front yard that he installed because he could, despite his inability to afford property taxes. Besides wanting to become the emperer of all evil, he spends a lot of his time with the most fked sleep schedule any human being could have. Has breakfeast at 1Am and has to sleep at 6pm, despite needing to go to work at 7pm. He always jumps into the car pool car smelling like a pile of sht. His house possess no toilet, only a urinal, so when he needs to go number 2 he has to run to the public pool across town to use the stall. After nearly burning his house down twice with similar freak spagetti cooking accidents, and the consistensy of the repo man breaking into his house and stealing the tv, Mowgli decided to move to another location. This "location" was a two story mansion that had a lazy river on the side of it. A lazy river Mowgli can swim in to escape his crippling debt.\n\nAfter a long while Mowgli eventually made bank. Once he became the emperor of all evil and also owned half the real estate in the city he was able to buy his mansion back again. He lost the house twice. After settling down Mowgli set his eyes on a new prize. He was three doors down from the single moms home. For some reason single moms put blasting radio on all the time, or at least this was the case whenever Mowgli came over. Even at 2 in the morning, to look through the windows creepily. Mowgli's gaze rested on Molly French, he wowed her with excessive romantic jokes and he then had many a 'woo hoo' aka sex that night. He demanded a woo hoo everytime he visited, which was every day he didnt have work. aka 4 times a week. They have woo hooed in every bed in the singles moms house that isnt the kids. Theres like 5 other moms. Mowgli then worked on his sex skills with some random lady that must have been 70, he met her in the park and because i bought every romantic perk he wowed her in a matter of minutes. They were woo hooing as soon as she took a cab to Mowgli's. He didnt ride in the cab with her though, thats to selfless, he got in his car, the fastest car in the game, and met her there. He didnt bring his car to the park though! So i guess he bought a google car when i wasnt looking. Im still surprised he didnt break her hip.\n\nHe is still in the process of marrying Molly French, so he can make a baby and mowgli can then die like we all must, his son Mowgli Junior will lead the empire of evil once more. Mowgli has planted his seed on this world. Beware of the future!\n\nMy first character was some dumb cop that got robbed by some guy who broke into his house, three days after he became a cop. However more of this review is coming soon, as Mowgli's story developes to a close.

He didnt bring his car to the park though! So i guess he bought a google car when i wasnt looking. Im still surprised he didnt break her hip.\n\nHe is still in the process of marrying Molly French, so he can make a baby and mowgli can then die like we all must, his son Mowgli Junior will lead the empire of evil once more. Mowgli has planted his seed on this world. Beware of the future!\n\nMy first character was some dumb cop that got robbed by some guy who broke into his house, three days after he became a cop. However more of this review is coming soon, as Mowgli's story developes to a close. Long Live Mowgli!","September 11, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Spent most of my time building up a character with a huge range of relationships with people.  Lost that one to a bug, but kept on keeping on.  Now I'm back to where I was again and still am enjoying playing the game.\n\nAlso, locked everyone but myself out of a fraternity, took everything and sold them for some delicious simoleons.  All this was followed by seeing every single person at the fraternity dropping dead outside the dorm.

All the way back with Sims 1. Lots of endless fun, especially if you get yourself some of the DLC. There's always a lot of DLC for each Sims edition, but one can definitely have fun with just one or two expansions, or just sticking with the base version. Certainly keep an eye on the sales. That's when you'll want to buy new Sims packs. Also, you definitely want to make sure you computer is above the Recommended System Requirements, because the Sims can be very resource-demanding. All that said, it's a great game, and I've never been bored with it!
