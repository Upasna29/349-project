It does have fall damage, so you can die, but thats about the only thing that will prevent you from finishing Drizzlepath.\n\nYou will find beautiful sights along your way, and you can explore almost anywhere you wish to, but for the most part its pretty linear. The details get less when you decide to walk off the path, as its designed to look great along it. The main path will take you maybe about 30 to 60 minutes to reach the end, depending on how fast you take it, it is not a very long experience. But is an idyllic one for sure. The music highlights certain parts of the way, and there could have been more of it.\n\nThere are also things that could be improved, Subtitles for example would have helped me greatly to understand the voice of the female narrator, which has a Spanish accent that made me sadly unable to follow much of what she said. I didnt think the narration held any deeper significance and served more as a tool to accompany the character on his way.\n\nAlso there where graphical oddities when i wandered off the path, and the waterfalls didn't look right for me, but that might be an issue with my hardware. The game dosent offer much in terms of options for graphics or other settings, but it did run well for me. All in all Drizzlepath looked stunning while following the main path, I think it is a great use of the CryEngine.\n\nYou most likely will get value out of this experience, its relaxing, even if it doesn't offer much in replayability. Especially with the very reasonable price point this is offered. Just don't expect something that will keep you busy for a long time, its about taking a short walk along a beautiful path, and thats probably something we all don't do enough =)","March 17, 2015","true","3.5"," 117 of 132 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","117","132","0","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/recommended/355760/","somnivore","Chewable C++","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/","2644 products in account","TL;DR\nDrizzlepath is a subpar "walking simulator" that essentially fails to accomplish its goal and is fraught with issues.\n\nBut it did slightly increase my motivation to actually go outside, and it does have very nice music (about 15 minutes total).\n\n\nA Lazy Knock Off\nFor those familiar with Dear Esther, this is something vaguely similar, but much more poorly executed, albeit using a newer, fancier engine.\n\nThat's the thing. This game basically consists of what seem to be stock CryEngine assets with a few musical narrative interludes interspersed (you just walk along a path up and down some hills). The amount of effort and resources that went into this seem to be minimal.\n\n(In fact, glancing at the game data, the package seems to include a large variety of stock and example assets that are never used in the game. The package is MUCH larger than it needs to be. Sloppy! Furthermore, after an hour of playtime, there was a 50MB log file full of errors and warnings.)\n\n\nPretentiousness Simulator\nThe female narrator's thick accent makes the abstract poetry even more difficult to understand than it would have been had there at least been subtitles to help you out. What little of it I was able to make out sounded pretentious or simply nonsensical.\n\nThis is the impression I had from the beginning, but when I heard the phrase "void of finite infinity", I said to myself, yep, definitely pretentious and nonsensical.\n\n(Just in case, I actually looked up "finite infinity" to check whether anybody had managed to use it in any acceptable manner. Turns out, Emily Dickinson used it in a poem once. I read the poem. It worked for me. But nothing in this game did.)\n\nSince I actually set out to write a review, I thought I'd double check so I fished out the voice files from the game data (Drizzlepath/GameSDK/GameSDK.pak/Sounds/wwise_project/Originals/SFX) so I could transcribe it. Here's the full version of the verse where that phrase comes from:\n\nShe was damned since the moment she ate that frog from the swimming pool.\nShe just couldn't stand [a/the?] chance to lock tight and look right for another [course/curse?].\nJust like dwarfs from a shiny little town, she disappeared into a mist formed by droplets of nothingness that precipitate upwards into a void of finite infinity.\n\n\nBuggy, Too\nThe few graphics settings that exist seem to be a bit glitchy (you must always re-apply the current settings, otherwise they apply... incorrectly).\n\nThere are also quite a few obvious geometric problems that break immersion.\n\n\nSteep Hardware Requirements\nEven running at essentially max quality settings, I wasn't particularly impressed. If you have anything less than mid-high end hardware, I suspect the game would look even worse.\n\n\nGreat Music\nThe one aspect of the game that is actually good is the music. Alejandro Padilla Coronel deserves credit there. The OST is included with the game. You can hear a selection of it here: https://soundcloud.com/alejandro-padilla-coronel/sets/drizzlepath\n\n\nJust Watch a Playthrough\nThe full game takes about 30-60 minutes, but the parts with music and narration comprise only about 15 minutes, which you can see and listen to here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy4wMe4mVNY\n\nGameplay Tips\nIf you do decide to play it anyway, there are a few important things you should keep in mind:\n\n* Follow the path and do not look back. The game is designed to only look good along that rail. If you deviate, you will merely harm whatever immersion there is. Also don't look down at your feet or your dorky shadow.\n* You can't save, so do not exit or close the game until you are done. If you need to play with the graphics settings, do it in the very beginning - the resource requirements are consistent throughout.\n\n\nDeveloper\nThis is the developer's first title. For what it's worth, he seems like a decent guy and I'm interested to see where he goes from here. I hope this review does not discourage him from working to improve his craft.\n\n\nDisclaimer\nI received the game as a gift. Thanks again for that! Even though I ended up not recommending it, I do appreciate it as I was curious about the game.","May 26, 2015","false","1.5"," 66 of 80 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","66","80","2","17"

Though that's by itself an impressive feat, it should not cloud any appreciation, which needs to focus on the merits of the game by itself.\n\nThe game may be small, but the world in which you can walk (not run!) around certainly is not. Using the CryEngine, Bodur has created a world of exceptional beauty, with far-reaching views over sea towards towering mountains in the distance. The world feels rather tropical, but not in a lush way: animals are scarce, and the mountains are extremely steep and imposing. Sometimes it felt like I was walking like somewhere in the Andes (the setting of Macchu Picchu came to mind at a certain point), at other moments I felt like being in a completely unreal world out of a fantasy setting. The game allows for a fair amount of exploration off the beaten track (a path one can follow across the land and up to a mountain top), but there are hardly any incentives to do so.\n\nRather, staying on track is more rewarding as every couple of minutes the game offers a quiet, beautiful sound snippet and an enigmatic piece of text read by a female voice with a heavily accent. The "format" of the game, so to speak, has clearly been inspired by Dear Esther, but the finished product is nowhere as polished or as inspiring as that game was. The hard to understand spoken texts let the game down, as they prevent the player from experiencing any kind of story. I made up my own story while playing, feeling like someone who went up the "drizzlepath" (drops of rain drizzling on my face all the time) in order to perform some initiation rite while experiencing a growing sense of danger, and maybe this kind of "fill it in by yoursefl" is what the game is all about.\n\nGraphically, although the landscapes are impressive and the lighting effects stunning, some of the textures are very bland and in some areas graphical errors abound. This makes the game feel almost like a study on "how to use the Cry Engine", but a very impressive study nonetheless and certainly one which I enjoyed playing a couple of times.\n\nRecommend, but only to those who enjoy a relaxing game of exploration","February 29","true","3.8"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","37","43","0","3"

Really quite ebautiful at times, although at other times, the scenery was somewhat washed out. Strange disparity there.\n\nThe music was fantastic. I would definitely buy an OST for this game. Lots of kick ♥♥♥ guitar tracks and some other cool piano and orchestral pieces as well (and even a harmonica piece at one point). For me, that was actually the highlight of the game even though, as mentioned before, it was also quite visually appealing.\n\nSadly, the dialogue was sort of drowned out at times by the music and the narrators accent was so thick that it was often difficult to tell exactly what she was saying even when you could hear her voice clearly. I could have done without it as, for the most part, I really couldnt tell you what she was really talking about. Forunately, the ending sums up the meaning of the story fairly well in a few sentences, lol.\n\n\nAll told, it was a pleasant hour long walk from the beach to and up through the mountains.\n\nOn an unrelated note, I always check to see if you can die by walking/jumping off a cliff. You cant die, lol. You can however put yourself in a position where you end up having to swim for a while trying to find a bank to climb back out of the water as I did, lol.\n\nAnyway, my actual play time was right at an hour, and I was pleased with the experience overall. Would walk again.\n\n7.5 mountains traversed out of 10 possible. If you like exploration games/walking simulators, I think you will enjoy this.","September 15, 2015","true","2.9"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","32","35","2","2"

Although this is very linear like Dear Esther, Drizzlepath has much more of an open-world feel with less invisible walls. The atmospheric sound-effects were too few and far between for the first half of the game, which drew too much attention to the monotonous footsteps in the midst of near-silence; whereas Dear Esther is chock full of immersive environmental sound-effects every step of the way.\n\nThe musical interludes were for the most part too short, too similar and too infrequent to be enjoyable/rewarding for passing through checkpoints; longer songs would've slightly improved the game imo. Given that both Dear Esther and Drizzlepath are very similar types of games, and both have roughly equivalent pretentious elements, I'd recommend getting Dear Esther instead for the extra immersiveness, or Drizzlepath for the extra open-world feel; or both if you want any game that's more interactive poetic film than game.\n\nPlease, if any game-devs are reading this, improve on this genre by making similar games that actually reward exploration, while offering thought-provoking philosophical dialogue rather than (imo) inconsequentially poetic nonsense; a pretentious example being "void of finite infinity."","March 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 45 of 62 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","45","62","0","0"

First of all Drizzlepath is created on cryengine which is really beautiful game engine. Yes the nature looks really good, ambient occlusion, animals and everything. To compare Ethan Carter is on the same engine and just watch how different it looks. I am writing this because I spent hundreds of hours in cryengine SDK. What I see here is really bad level design. Chickens AI is not set correctly and they move under the water. The terrain is really rough, I don't know why, there is this tool to smooth the terrain to make it looks more natural. Textures are misplaced somewhere and vegetation is placed in a lazy way. Makes you wonder "why? The view looks so good!", yeah just go a few steps away from the path and you will see missing vegetation, underwater grass and empty slopes. Its really not a bad game, but it doesn't have much to offer, better play Ethan Carter.","September 18, 2015","false","3.8"," 81 of 124 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","81","124","3","4"

The first 10 to 15 minutes of gameplay will consist of moving your character in the First-Person perspective, along a twisting, winding path, as you traverse the Island from one Biome into another, with only music and a narration-style monologue accompanying you as you reach various checkpoints. The Narration is done in a heavily accented English, making it difficult to understand at times, as your attention keeps being drawn to your surroundings.\n\nSometimes the path forward no longer appears obvious, but if you get off course you can load from a previous checkpoint. You will pass by abandoned buildings, old ruins, and more as you make the slow, steady climb.\nEven though the beginning is slow, I found it to actually be very fulfilling. It isn't often we get to play a visually stunning game and just enjoy the surroundings without being attacked or the need to interact with others. The music is simplistic, consisting of acoustic guitars, andI found the experience leading up to the Camp to be calming and soothing.\n\nEventually you will reach a camp in a snow covered mountain area, where the GAME ENDS. That's right, that's it. Drizzlepath is a Walking Simulator. Once I reached the camp, I thought okay, this must be where the journey, story, or adventure begins. No. This is where the game ends. This is sad in so many ways, because it would have been a wonderful beginning to a game, had there actually been a game once you reached the camp. I wanted so much to write a thumbs up review, because the visuals alone make it worth that, but I can't in good conscience give a thumbs up to a game where the entire objective is to walk from one place to another. If you are interested in doing that, pick up a game like Skyrim, and walk around. You will get stunning visuals and have the option as well as ability to do other things and actually play a game as well.\n\nAs much as it pains me, Thumbs Down.\n","June 1, 2015","false","2.1"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","1"

I don't even know what part of the world this mountain is modeled after, the Andes? but it's a mostly linear path, with visible and invisble walls (try swimming anyplace) and some surreal objects sprinkled around. I couldn't make sense of it and, by the end, was glad that it was over. Since the narration is just soundbites and music triggered at certain points along the path, and since it bears little relation to your actual surroundings, no amount of exploration was able to help me make more sense of it.\n\nThe game lagged a bit on my system. It generated an error log 20 MB in size consisting mostly of bbox errors, which reeks of shoddy modeling.

However, this does not change the view on the game.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬▬●\nDrizzlepath is a CryEngine based atmospheric walking simulator, developed and published by only one person named Tonguc Bodur and released in March 2015.\n\nThe journey begins at a small cabin on a seemingly uninhabited island, with the aim to reach the top of the "Mountain of Fire". The player will not find any deeper meaning behind the story, since the only purpose of this game is to relax the mind.\n\nThanks to the choice of CryEngine, the well made ambient lighting will draw attention to the even more beautiful landscape. On the path, the player encounters several different landmarks and also treacherous weather the closer he gets to the mountain. The 3D effects such as snow and rain give this game a special feeling, Raindrops as well as snow fall onto the field of view and run down slowely, as if the player would look through a thin layer of glass. However, the path can get very uneven and not smoothed out well, which does not change the feeling in any way though. The landscape is still made with passion and love for detail what might keep the player longer at one spot.\n\nCheckpoints are not only savepoints but also a trigger for beautiful soundtracks and a small story-telling. Sadly, even though the soundtracks are incredible well made they drown the voice of the story-teller who is already difficult to understand, caused from the strong accent. The missing possibility to enable subtitles or change sound options at all complicate this topic even more, but as already mentioned earlier there is no deeper meaning behind it so the player can enjoy the soundtracks without being worried to miss something important. The remaining soundeffects including bird's twittering, the sound of the wind and waves at the shores help to dive deeper into this game.\n\nThe controls are as smooth as expected from a so-called walking simulator and are compatible with a controller as well. Unfortunately, options for the game are very limited. The player will be only able to change the mouse sensitivity and reverse, resolution, fullscreen mode and quality. You might need a stronger system, depends on your PC build. To find out what system I am using check out my profile.\n\nAccording to the developer the game length should be around half an hour. Yet, if the player is curious enough to check every place and tries to find a good spot for some screenshots Drizzlepath can keep some busy for around 1 1/2 hours.\n\nAs Tonguc Bodur's first game some minor things can be excused and Drizzlepath starts out to be a well-made "walking simulator" project! What are you waiting for? Let's start walking!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬▬●\nI have never really tried out any of the walking simulators in the past. You can call Drizzlepath as my very first experience with this kind of genre and still, I am impressed. The CryEngine shapes the whole game very well. But besides of the graphics, my absolute highlight were the soundtracks in this game, which are composed by Alejandro Padilla Coronel[www.soundcloud.com].\n\nDrizzlepath is a worthy shot, expecially for those who love this genre. Still you can also wait for a sale or skip it completely for its follow-up called "Drizzlepath - Genie".\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Amazing graphics and great atmosphere (CryEngine based)\n[✔] Great 3D effects such as Rain, Snow and Ambient Lighting\n[✔] Landscape made with love for detail\n[✔] Incredible well made soundtracks\n[✔] Smooth controls\n\n[✖] Very limited options, no sound options at all\n[✖] Story-teller is hard to understand, no meaning behind the story\n[✖] You might need a stronger system, depends on your PC build\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy4dCT3ipuM\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=633723833\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

The enviornment is inconsistently detailed with some areas looking lush and picturesque, while others look like the outskirts of a Crysis 1 level, just bland patches of the same plant for miles. In walking sims it's important to take time and explore the enviornment, but this is one game that actually NEEDS barriers/invisible walls, as there's nothing but grass when you venture off the path. Near the last few minutes of the game, you find a beach that looks like it could be worth exploring, but doing so only takes you to another grassy plane of no man's land and after about 2 minutes of walking, you run into a randomly placed lighthouse that you can walk through...As far as audio goes, the enviornment is almost completley silent, and what little sound there is ends up being not heard at all because you have to turn your volume down to avoid jumping out of your seat when the loud 10 second guitar samples and narrations awkwardly start playing. As far as the narration goes, I had a hard time understanding her due to her heavy accent and the music would sometimes drown her out.\n\nThis game would have been worth the time if it was free, but as it currently stands, it doesn't deserve your money.","March 17, 2015","false","0.7"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

If you are expecting an interactive game or a story driven narrative, then I think you will be disappointed.  If, instead, you are looking for a relaxing experience just walking around (and not much of a game), then you will enjoy this.  The music is phenomenal and the graphics are as pretty as you'd expect from Cryengine.  Many of the other reviewers commented on the accent fo the narrator.  While I do agree that she was sometimes drowned out by the music and hard to understand, I actually ended up liking the alluring nature of the combination of her voice and the music.  In the end, I really enjoyed Drizzlepath and found it to be worth what I paid for it.

Look no further!\nDrizzlepath is a really beautiful game. Now, I do not recommend this to everyone. This is a walking simulator game, literally. You can't interact with anything at all. You just walk. But that's why I like it. It is relaxing, calm, and nothing too shocking will come out of it. It isn't a ''OMG SHOOT THE BAD GUYS AND SAVE THE WORLD 111!!!'' type of game.\nThis game seems to have really mixed reviews, which I do not understand. It's a great game. It might be short, but I blame that on the players for not taking their time to explore properly. Many people seemed to finish it in around 10 minutes, but I took my time and finished it in 50 minutes. And I'm glad I did. Just by following the path, you miss out on some great areas. It has really beautiful graphics and great music. If the developer ever feels like uploading the soundtrack, I'd buy it. Just saying. I got this while it got a discount, and it's 2.40 TRL. That's like the price of two bottles of water, and a piece of gum. Even a toast costs more than this game does, which is great. One downside of it is that it is REALLY buggy. I was recording my playthrough with bandicam and whenever I went to pause the game it restarted it. Also, the ''last checkpoint'' option does not work at all. It also sends me to the beginning of the game. There were also a few collision issuses I had, but I didn't mind it that much. Another downside is that the narrator's voice is a little hard to understand. Subtitles would really help :P. One thing I would want to see in this game, is making more houses enterable. You can only enter the first house in the game, the rest are just kinda sitting there being useless, even though they do add more flavor to the path. This game does not have some really well-done plot, it's basically a mountain climbing game, so if you want a good storyline, you probably shouldn't buy this.","November 20, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It tries to be "enigmatic" as the game description indicated but in the end, it was just shallow. It is problematic enough that the character movement was not natural - you have the same momentum climbing up and walking down a hill - but the game is also quite empty. Sure, the map allows you to explore but there is hardly anything worth exploring. You will find yourself sticking to the path that is visibly laid out in front of you. The music is cheesy until you get closer to the end. The female narrator has a really thick accent which makes it almost impossible to understand what she's rambling about. Not that the things she said had any importance because from what I could gather, there was not even a real cohesion to the narrative and you will roll your eyes as you come close to finishing the game.

However, it's also really cheap, and I believe the developer is capable of making a great game, so I'd like to support them. So, basically, but this if you like the walking simulator genre and would like to support a developer who's capable of making an amazing one.","November 27, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You follow a path (or explore) for an hour or so, taking in the scenery, and listening to the occasional voice over with musical accompaniment, until you reach a destination.\nIt's a little rough around the edges, the environments are more sculted than natural looking, it doesn't have the beauty in the environment that has been achieved in games like Dear Esther / Skyrim / Far Cry... but then few games do.  And when you consider it was essentially made by one person you can overlook stuff like that.\nThe cryengine is interesting here, in places it really adds to the experience - the way it handles lighting / shadows / and super detailed ground textures.  However in places it is super distracting, with foliage pop-in and a crazy warping effect on steep surfaces from the bump map.\nThe voiceovers were kind of poetic, but didn't really add much.  I soon found myself completely ignoring what was being said and just letting the words drift over me (It doesn't compare natatively to something like Dear Esther).\nOverall while I was playing through it I kept finding myself knitpicking lots of little issues with the game... but I didn't stop playing it.  It was interesting enough that it was worth seeing through to the end.  There were some very pretty set up scenes, and a few occations when the surroundings were interesting enough that I took some detours to explore the environment more (note to the developer: you may want to add clipping to the lighthouse).\nI think on the whole it was worth playing through, especially since the price was very reasonable.","April 8, 2015","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Worth getting if you want to try something about mood and wandering, and support an experimental game for a very low price.  Otherwise, probably not for you.\n\nYou know those moments in Skyrim and other sandbox games where you just wandered around and wondered?  Drizzlepath is what happens when someone makes a game out of it - and there's more too it than it sounds.\n\nThe idea of the game is to have you travel to the top of a mysterious mountain, or wander around aimlessly and see the scenery, or both.  However as you play you find strange and interesting things, a mysterious narrator discusses your past in surreal terms, and moodly music suddenly plays.  It's an experience that is both rather realistic due to the visuals, and dreamlike and weird.\n\nMy reaction to the game was, in this order:\n1) This looks cool.\n2) This is kind of boring.\n3) I'll see what happens if I follow that path.\n4) What's going on?\n5) I think I'll keep going to find out.\n6) Woah, wait what was that?\n7) Wow.  That was kind of neat.\n\nIt's a short, well-crafted experience that I found compelling.  You can play through it in about an hour and get to "the end," though I can see some people may want to replay to see what they missed.  There's no sense of rush or urgency.\n\nThe biggest flaw I think is the lack of subtitles - at times it was hard to make out what the narrator was saying.\n\nThe biggest advantages are the nice visuals and the great soundtrack.\n\nIs it perfect?  No.  It's an experimental type game, perfection isn't the goal. However it did achieve something - namely it got me curious enough and engrossed enough to play what is basically a walking simulator in order to see what's up.    I'd say I got my money's worth.\n\nIf this sounds intriguing, remember it's only about $4, so set aside an hour, get the game, and enjoy the experience.","April 18, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it is perfect for that. It is beautiful and realistic and fun for the right person.\n\nA lot of the reviews rate it negativly because all you do is walk. Well yes, if they bothered to even look at the game description, it's a WALKING SIMULATOR. I mean you can swim too and the animation for breaking out the water and the endless depth you can go makes this game even more amazing. So know what you are getting yourself into, all you do is walk, swim and jump if you want. (side note: if you jump in the water you actually dive and have to swim back up. An intresting quirk I love)\n\nMy only con is that when I play fullscreen, no matter the graphics setting, it is choppy and slow. Which makes this game terrible and tedious. I hate how I have to play it at a 1080 screen size on my 3200 screen. I don't have the recommended graphics card but I have better than the min.

Would I recommend this game for someone else to play? Absolutely not, and not because it is bad, more like, it doesn't give a completed experince. The entire time I was playing it I felt more like a Tester than actual person going on this adventure. The visuals had a mixed reaction from me, they were very good... at times. Or when you got close to the ground textures, which happens a lot because of how low the camera was, you realized, that they were stretched beyond what they could handle. I feel like there should have been more of an interaction, or at least some sort of reward for adventuring off the beaten path instead of just running into an invisible wall. The most exciting part was whenever I came arcoss a checkpoint, and the music would start playing, and pieces of the hard to hear story would be told to you.\n\nWhat irritated me the most was, from the start, the game looking was set to inverted by default, which in my opinion is HORRIBLE, and the distance you walk without anything really be shown or to do, felt like you were walking for days not a matter of mintues.\n\nI beat this game in 39 and that's only because I gave up on exploring off the beaten path because there was no real sense of doing it. There was nothing to explore, which is kind of saddening. Will I refund though?

From a visual standpoint, it's absolutely excellent, but it doesn't match the level of execution or narrative it's presumed source of influence achieved.\n\nWhilst I can't deny that CryEngine 3 is a damn beautiful thing to look at, getting the game set up to begin with was a bit awkward, with CryEngine itself crashing on multiple occasions until I got a lucky break and it kept running (this is with a mid/upper range PC as well). The game itself looks to be a little heavy on system requirements, as some framerate drops were quite noticeable in the odd place where activity is going on in the background.\n\nWhilst compositionally the music isn't bad, but it's incredibly jarring 90% of the time and completely fights against the atmosphere that's been set in the scenery that surrounds you. This killed a lot of the immersive experience that games of this type are supposed to be strong at delivering. Once those passages pass, even the background ambience is fairly mute which meant outside of those distracting segments with untelligible narrative, you were headbobbing in more or less complete silence.\n\nThe female narrator is heavily accented, without subtitles and speaking up only to "compliment" the jarring background music means for the most part shes drowned her out. Saying that, due to the accent it's more or less a guessing game until you make out a key word here and there. After looking through various dialogue from these sections I'd conclude it serves as incoherent poetic ramblings that serve no greater purpose to the "plot", nor offer any real context to the situation you find yourself placed in. Just incohrent dribble that tries to be edgy and ends up making little sense. Said plot basically involves; get up the mountain (requiring 99% walking, 1% jump), find your camping buddies, well done "hero", game over.\n\nEven exploring off the beaten path yields little interest. You may find the odd cabin or randomly pathed creature wandering about, but there's nothing to read, experience, or take in that you can't get from just going from A to B, aside from the occasional pretty looking wooded or mountainous area.\n\nThere is unfortunately no way near enough substance, story, or context to the environment for me to recommended this game. To get an idea of what these Walking Simulators are mostly based on and look to achiev, then have a look at Dear Esther, which I would argue has been the champion of the genre before you look at this particaulr game.","October 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Reminds me a bit of the PlayStation game "Journey" - I wish it was on the PC. But since it isn't, this is the closest I can get to that game.\n\nDrizzlepath itself is a good idea and if you follow the path as some other reviewer said, your experience will be good.

You're meant to look forward to where ever the path goes.\n\nIt's execution in terms of models and geometry of the ground could be better, but it's okay.

Enigmatic, definitely but it seems to be an experiment and not a game. Graphics are so-so. They are pretty enough but not exceptional as there are smearing and distortion issues from time to time. The mountains look very unrealistic compared to the foreground, which, as I said, is mediocre. The basic sound quality is very good but needs to be balanced better between the narrator and the music. The music tends to overwhelm the narration and makes some of the narration unintelligible. The narrator sounds like she is in a studio and not as if she is walking along with you or is a voice in your head. Turn down the reverb. The narrator has a strong accent and needs to better articulate her english as some wording just does not make sense.\n\nThe script is what makes it enigmatic but comes across as amateurish and pretentious. Boring.\n\nThe guitar playing needs improvement as the guitar player tends to "whiff" his strings. This is that effect you get when he slides his fingers on the strings rather than placing and unplacing them accurately. This distracts from the quality of the performance and damages the immersiveness of the game.\n\nI did not complete the game because it crashes regularly and sends you back to the beginning rather than your latest checkpoint. This is a big disincentive to continue playing.\n\nThe game is cheap and deservidly so. Buy it if you are courious and liked Dear Esther.

This is a bad Dear Esther clone. The screen shots are pretty because this is using a good engine, most of the work there has been doubtless done by the engine creators, not this game's developer.\n\n- Like Dear Esther you are basically on a path to the top of the island.\n- Like Dear Esther there is nothing to do but walk and hear dialogue.\n- Like Dear Esther there is music in the background.\n\nHowever, the  *island* is a simple height field. There’s no beautiful caves, no interesting rock features, the vegetation is either simple grass and bushes or complex trees. I think I decided the level design was no work of art, when I randomly came across a fridge-freezer, just randomly located on a hill just off the path. No music, no dialogue, no interactions, no effect on the story and no relation to it. At least a rock is part of the overall canvas of the background. This was a random object placed for no reason.\n\nThere is absolutely very little cohesion to the music, there’s a lot of guitar pieces, but then there’s also some quite dramatic synth based pieces and even a full-band-with-drummer-and-bass-player track somewhere. I believe music is meant to help shape your mood or accentuate the landscape. Here, it was too loud (there’s no sound options to reduce it), and contrasts at most levels with the game.\n\nThe dialogue is horrible. It's full of clichéd phrases that would have any creative writing teacher committing suicide. Not only do a lot of the metaphors appear to have been de-contextualized by being run through google translate at some point, but the writer does not appear to understand the basic point of metaphor. Which is to represent a situation using indirect symbolism (i.e. "rivers from eyes" = "crying"). Every single sentence in the dialogue uses a different metaphor, brand new.\n\nThere are no threads of metaphor which infuse with the story (if there is one, and yes I've completed the game), they don’t add up to anything. In short, the dialogue to not lead to an understanding of the story on any level. Even its total absence would have improved the game.\n\nMaybe I've missed the point of this game, but it's surely been blurred out behind that industrious depth of field filter that’s ever present in this game. If there is, however, one shining raindrop of hope in this experience, it is that it is a relatively cheap game, however, I don't consider that justification for a positive review. If we praise bad things just for being cheap, we advertise that there is no market for quality products.","July 19, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This isn't due to the type of game it is or the overall style (if you buy it, I assume you at least know it's a walking simulator, so you're not getting something that's stylistically "not your kind of game").  The problems I had with the game simply overpowered the beauty of the rest of it.\n\nThe biggest issue I had was simply performance.  I have a brand new laptop with a brand new video card and 12g RAM, and my system would barely run this game with the graphic settings on low.  I don't have a top-end gaming computer by any stretch, but there's no reason why I should've struggled with this game on the setup I have.  Just a caveat for people with older systems.\n\nBut I was determined to finish the game despite the video lag.  So I set out along the path, cringing at the motion blur, which apparently cannot be shut off; if motion blur makes you nauseated, best to back away now.\n\nThen I discovered that the voiceover at each checkpoint was barely understandable; the woman speaking had a very thick accent and the game did not offer subtitles.  Her voice was pleasant but I could only understand about half of what was said (possibly less, because some things I thought I heard didn't really make much sense).\n\nThen, the game crashed.  That's when I realized that despite dutifully informing me each time I hit a checkpoint, the game did not actually remember those checkpoints.  I would have to start from the beginning.  So I did, trudging along down the path through the video lag and incomprehensible voiceovers.  And then the game crashed again.  And then again.  And then, crashed so hard it took my whole laptop down with it and I had to restart everything.\n\nThat's when I uninstalled and wandered over here to write the review.  Now, the game does have some good points.  The graphics, although I was struggling with them, were very pretty even on low setting.  I managed to get one nice screenshot for my collection.  But the rest of the issues just overshadowed the beauty too much for a recommendation.\n\nThat said, I will be glad to update my review and change my mind if at some point I find out that some of the issues I've had are addressed in later patches.  I think the game has a lot of potential, it's just not working quite right yet.","April 5, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's not a graphical masterpiece - some of the map is jagged and unrealistic looking, the actual textures of the ground itself are lacking and snow morphing and shifting about infront of your eyes may give you Malaria to look at. BUT those trees though..\n\nThe narration is plain, I found myself just tuning it out after the first few times. Don't expect to be excited by it, but don't feel bad if you don't really listen, this game is made more to look at, not listen to.\n\nAlso, props for the 'rain on screen' effects. Extremely realistic as far as games go, especially an indie one like this.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nRelaxing game with a nice 35-45 min playthrough.

It might be disguised as a walking simulator and if you get past the visual roughness here and there and sometimes hard to understand narrative, it's very rewarding in the sense that it makes you think why certain objects and details are there. I believe everybody will have their own personal experience.\n\nThe game may not seem complete to some people but considering its price and comparing it to other pompous AAA games where you pay !@#$ ton of money and you get rewarded with a subpar product this game is well worth its price. For those who complained about odd graphics pieces and music quality, I think the developer is doing his best to remedy these problems.

Subtitles would have been great - there are only a few snippets of narration, and the narrator's thick accent made them very difficult for me to understand. The instruction to "jump" near the end of the game was rather immersion-breaking. Speaking of jump, it's nice that they told us to do that but the game never tells you how. Of course most people will try spacebar but still, showing us the controls somewhere would be great. Letting us remap them would be even better. Through experimentation I discovered that F2 will take you back to the start of the path, and pressing C will toggle crouch.

Basically, a demo (of sorts) for the Cry Engine, and not a very good one at that.  The best parts of this "game" are in the video trailer, and that's it!  The music is as half-♥♥♥♥♥ as the game itself - unfinished, quickly rendered and poorly thoughtout.  Charging ANY money for this...experience... is just wrong, IMO.\n\nI generally enjoy so-called walking sims more than most people, but this was just not interesting!  The mountain shapes were silly and unrealistic - they reminded me of first day Bryce 1.0 renders.  The music starts and stops with all finese of a jump scare, and often just plays a few bars, then abruptly stops - hardly adding to any relaxing experience.  This would have been a great place for wandering noodling of the guitar or piano, but instead it's as choppy and disjointed as broken CD player.\n\nAnd the overall graphics were lackluster and uninspired, and bordering on rushed and incomplete.  Like walking through a countryside with nothing interesting to look at.  I usually take scores of screen caps in cool looking games - I could only find two views interesting enough to capture here, and two snaps were of trees. The whole experience was just a crashing bore for me - and  I AM the fan base for this type of "game"!\n\nMaybe games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter haved jaded me for realistic walking sim graphics, but this was so dull and boring!!!  This engine demo might have been cool back in 1985, but it so failed to do anything but bore the hell out of me!  I appreciate that some nice folks spent some time creating something different, but so much more work is needed to the graphics, music, and story to make this even acceptable, to me.  So many flaws and quick fix ideas - the result is a huge fail, for me.  And it saddens me to say so.","February 3","false","0.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

For example it rains, why is there no sound of rain? That would add so much to the atmosphere and make it an even more relaxing game to play.\n\nThe "story" is not good. It doesn't make any sense so after a while I just ignored the voice acting and made up my own story which was way more enjoyable.\nSpeaking of the voice acting, it wasn't good. I don't get why you would get a voice actor with such a thick accent and it also, some times, sounds like the voice actor is reading the lines for the very first time.\nSimply bad voice acting in my opinion and it was a bad decision to not have a voice actor that can speak English fluently.\nI strongly recommend that you make up your own story which I do almost always with walking simulators anyways, it is way more enjoyable than listening to the nonsense that doesn't make any sense that this game tells, it's almost as if it's trying to be philosophical but fails horribly.\nThe music was beautiful to listen to though, it was very nice.\n\nIf you're trying to make a decision on whether to buy this game or  Drizzlepath: Genie, buy this one.\nIt's shorter but way better. This game is way more beautiful to look at, the voice acting in this game isn't straight up cringeworty like Genie and this game respects the fact that it's short, it doesn't drag itself out for 4 hours of nothing like Genie did.  Drizzlepath: Genie  was dragged out way longer than it needed to be which destroyed that game for me, amongst many other things obviously which I explain in  my review  on that game.\n\nThis game is a must buy for any person who loves short and relaxing walking simulators, and only people like that. Don't buy this if you're not familiar with walking simulators and you're expecting an action packed adventure. It's a relaxing, atmospheric adventure walking simulator, and it's quite clear about that before you buy it if you spare 10 seconds to read the TL:DR Description of the game.\n\nThe games price is just right as well in my opinion.\n\nIt's not all positives though, there are some huge flaws with this game as well.\n\nThe options menu is straight up crap. You only have 1 graphic slider which goes from Low to Very High.\nWhy wouldn't you add a full options menu? It doesn't make any sense, this game is almost entirely on how beautiful it is, it's almost entirely dependant on the world you're in and you couldn't put in the effort to add a proper graphics menu, that's really lazy and sloppy work from the developer.\nThere's also no volume sliders, yet another idiotic choice by the developer.\nWhen you're in-game playing you can't even access the options menu, which makes no sense at all.\n\nThere's some weird graphical bugs where it looks like stuff is like morphing or warping in on itself, I don't know how to explain it but yea.\n\nNo save game so if your game crashes(which happened to me twice) or if you just need to go you can't start where you left off.\nYou can jump in this game which is actually a huge positive because for some reason many Walking Simulators doesn't let you jump, but, the jumping is un-natural. There's a delay after you press space to jump before you actually jump and when you're in the air it feels like you're on the moon or something, you're in the air for way to long, it's just un-natural and stupid that there's a delay before you jump after you press space.\n\nThe lack of subtitles is also horrible considering the fact that most people will probably have difficulties understanding the voice  actor  due to the accent.\n\nYour resolution settings doesn't save, so the next time you start the game it will be in the default resolution.\n\nThere's no option to turn off the head bobbing when you walk.\nAnd again, there's no sounds of the rain, I can't fathom why the developer didn't add sounds of rain.\n\nThe sound has problems, the music while the voice  actor  is talking very often drowns her voice out, again, another reason to just add some freaking volume sliders.\n\nBut, over all. This game is good for what it is. It's a very beautiful walking simulator and you're getting exactly what you're told you're buying. Don't buy it if you don't already enjoy walking simulators.\n\nMust buy for any walking simulator fanatic.","April 10","true","4.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterofthechips/recommended/355760/","masterofthechips","Deuterium the Sentient Mattress","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterofthechips/","1236 products in account","Drizzlepath is an interesting game. Being a CryEngine game it looks very. VERY good, but it's also very graphically intensive - sometimes much more so than one would expect. At times I just couldn't get up to 60fps, and that's with a GTX 970, so certainly nothing to be sniffed at. As for the story, it's told by a heavily accented narrator over rather loud music with no subtitles, making it quite hard to make out at times, which detracts from the experience greatly considering it's a "walking simulator". All in all it just feels like it's trying to pull a much brighter, better-looking Dear Esther, but like the game it rips off it has little interactivity. On the other hand, unlike Dear Esther it also seems much more linear, there seems to be less to explore and while it is hard to find your way at times it feels a bit like you're being sheperded along the path. The story can only get you so far, and after a while it just gets a bit boring to look at the scenes, no matter how lush and gorgeously-rendered they are,\n\nPros:\n+ Gorgeous graphics\n+ Nice music\n\nCons:\n- Linear\n- Short\n- Graphics seem more intensive than they should be\n- No subtitles make the story hard to make out.","March 23","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The moodier pieces remind me of Akira Yamaoka's foray into acoustic guitar on the early Silent Hill games.\n+ Atmosphere.\n+ There are noteable game assets that can only be seen by going off the "set" path.

I like the use of someone with an accent of this nature but it really is an incredibly thick one,\n- What she does say is convoluted and pretentious. Not in the way that The Begginer's Guide or Dear Esther are. In those games you can at least debate over logical meaning in the game.

It's what I imagine English sounds like to people who barely understand it.\n- Some texture warping.\n- Very short.\n\nDespite giving more cons than pros I do wholly recommend it.

This game is graphically very beautiful. Cryengine 3 meets walking simulator.\n\nI honestly do not know how someone could down vote this. The experience you get, for only 4 bucks, is amazing. Ran great on my GTX 760 in ultra settings.\n\nI say buy the game, support this team.","March 12, 2015","true","0.3"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","0"

It took me all of 32 minutes to complete, the graphics in the distance were awful, cartoon like, the narrator's voice was pleasant but so thickly accented that I couldn't understand some of the sentences. You may be thinking I didn't enjoy it...but...I did...I really did. Some of the points on the path are truly beautiful, the sun streaming through the trees, a light rain spatters the screen when you look up, the gentle acoustic guitar, it's quite lovely at times.","October 9, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it looks pretty in most areas and the guitar pieces, when they are there, are nice there are graphical glitches in some places and textures that don't stand up to the rest. The story is not cohesive, and left me wondering what the narrator was even talking about during each snippet. There are no subtitles so if you need those, sorry. The gameplay is walking forward, and you only use the jump button once near the end. Wasn't too surprised by that since it was a walking sim.\n\nSo, it's nice if all you want is a relaxing walk around a tropical island for a while.","March 24","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Almost like a Far Cry map but without any of the 'interaction' or game associated to it. The young lady narrators heavily accented wittering didn't enhance things for me either.\n\nNot sure about the whole walking sim genre, although I did enjoy Dear Esther because of the atmosphere and story. Sadly this is no Dear Esther.\n\nI know there are those who will say that going for a walk in reality has no point (other than the exercise benefits) so why should this need more on a PC but, even on oculus rift, this needs additional content/interaction.\n\nIf this had been linked to say a Wii Fit style running/walking sim then it may have been better suited and have some validity. As it is, the seemingly pointless wandering really start to irritate rather than relax me, which I'm presuming is the opposite of what the 'game' was designed to do.\n\nThe novelty wore off after 5 mins and then the laborious trudging set in. There must be something new to see or do over this next hill I hoped... but alas not.\n\nI probably won't be returning to this one. An exploring sim with no point is, well, just pointless.\n\nIt does initially have nice enough graphics but they do start to look VERY 'samey' after just a few minutes and the landmarks that have been scattered around are too infrequent and uninteresting to hold my attention and give me impetus to continue the trudging.\n\nI don't want to sound negative I wanted to like this one, I really did, but it's just not for me.\n\nMaybe the sequel Genie will add more content and improve the experience but I won't be spending 5 quid to find out.","May 18","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just don't expect any actual gameplay or story. The few times you're still tempted to wander off the path are not rewarded with anything meaningful.","May 21","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like looking at it. It's not a story game. It's not a fun game. It's a pretty game. And you have to have pretty specs to enjoy it. And if you do, it's great. I wanted a pretty game that I could do nothing but walk around in. I found what I was looking for in Drizzlepath. I hope its sequel is a bit more open-world and explorable.","May 28","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
