Why is that? Isn't the game aimed at children familiar with "Bob the Builder"?\nWell, in theory that's the case, but in practice the game suffers from its unpredictable physics; if you had hoped for a sandbox-y experience, there's little opportunity of that, and the game does punish exploration by making you drop through the floor or otherwise fail in many "wtf" ways.\n\nSop you follow the obvious path through a level (which is most often the only path the camera angles actually allow you to see), doing the obvious forklifting/craning, with obstinate controls (rotating crane control is especially weird: instead of rotating the crane and moving the trolley, you move the position of the hook up/down/left/right, which can result in some erratic movements). Stacking crates one atop the other with the forklift is practically impossible; it works when the base is wide, i.e. one crate rests on two others. Sort of. Stuff just goes wrong or behaves unexpectedly a lot.\n\nThe physics interactions in this game are quite few; if the devs had not gone with a general physics engine, but written code for these interactions separfately "oldschool" style, the game would have been a lot better. Crates and vehicles don't need to topple over. The crane hook doesn't need to swing around at the end of "fake" cable. The physics code should've allowed the player to execute a solution plan in a predictable fashion. Currently, that's just not the case.\n\nSo who is the target audience for this game? It can't be small children because of the wonky contrrols (no gamepad support) ; it can't be puzzle players because the puzzles are easy; it can't be physics game fans because experimenting with the physics in this game is rarely rewarding.\n\nGet this if you like games that are sort of weird and sort of bad and sort of cheap. You won't miss anything if you don't.","November 22, 2015","false","5.4"," 62 of 70 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","62","70","4","6"

You'll only admire it for the first half-hour, but thats it.\n\nAlso, I am now aware that the developer has released the final build on Steam.

But I personally love it. Why? Because it's interactive, original, fun, and I can also play it with my 4 year old son. The different machines that you control (cranes, forklifts, cargo trucks, etc.) add interactive layers and scale - for example, you can use a crane to transport a vehicle that can deliver cargo.\n\nThe game can be very tedious and annoying at times, but I never cared about this as a player. I like the core concept, the puzzles, the system, and that's enough to keep me going. I'm not writing this to recommend it to everyone, or to my Steam friends. I'm writing this for the person who is attracted by what they see on the screenshots. If you like the trailer, the screenshots, and don't expect AAA polish from a game made by just one man... and, most importantly, if you're patient and are not easily frustrated, definitely buy it.","July 9, 2015","true","7.4"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","28","40","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/recommended/375710/","tablis","Tablis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/","741 products in account","Picture this example: you're working on a puzzle for, say, 20-30 minutes now. The "solution" requires stacking containers and crates, and you're struggling against the (rather bad) physics engine but overall making progress. And then due to some random not-your-fault physics bug, a key element of the puzzle just flies off of the building and is not recoverable. You must suicide your Mr. B and start over, effectively forfeiting these 20+ minutes of work. How would you react?\n\nBecause if this would make you angry (and honestly it should) then stay well away from this game. This kind of thing happened to me, and more than once. But the strange thing is, I found the game amusing enough that I managed to plough through all of this and actually enjoy it. But that's just me: I enjoy quirky (bad) games.\n\nAnd there is a lot of "quirkiness" here indeed. The graphics are plain terrible, even by my (lax) standards. The crazy physics simulation is your worst enemy. The music, while decent, is some sort of open source thing because I am 99% confident I heard it in another Unity game recently. Controls seem kinda floaty yet are suprisingly precise if you have the patience for them. The level design is... pretty good sometimes; it has its moments. I'd recommend getting this only at a significant discount. There is some weird amusement to be had here but extracting it is not for the faint of heart.","April 9","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Level 9 took literally an hour and a half, Level 10 took like 10 minutes, or at least it felt like that in comparison; like I said everything is very slow. Also the machines and vehciles, despite being slow, often get stuck in the ground or anything else really, rendering them useless. That is all I have to say, never buy this game.","April 28","false","8.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In between you solve physics puzzles which will probably not challenge anybody above age 4, except when trying to execute the solution. The physics and camera are the real challenge in this game and will test your frustration tolerance.\n\nPros:- nice music and it's available for free from http://incompetech.com I really like four of the five tracks used in the game:\nCall to Adventure, Radio Martini, Run Amok, The Builder\n- some parts of the physics work really well. I only managed to glitch through one closed door that was supposed to be an impassable level border during the whole playthrough. Jumping onto crates is assisted, making it really easy\n- good variety of challenges, most of which sadly suffer from playing like Surgeon Simulator\n- nice setting, family friendly. All you do is make your way through a huge construction site. With smoother edges and more variety it would even look good\n- some of the puzzles are fun, even if they are easy. I especially liked the balls through pipes puzzle (level 22 or thereabouts)\n\nCons:- bad camera: it's incredibly difficult to exactly place a pallet on top of something, jumps are hard to judge (the jump target marker is frequently wrong and absent for the deliberately difficult jumps)\n- bad physics: Imagine trying to solve a series of puzzles with Surgeon Simulator controls. Add to that a bunch of glitches: balls that are supposeed to roll somewhere get stuck, stuff sinks into the floor a lot making it impossible to pick up with a forklift, good luck trying to pick up a flipped over pallet or putting it right side up again, vehicle tires can get stuck in miniscule gaps, vehicles tend to get completely stuck on top of empty pallets, and so on\n- the puzzles are a joke. The two times I was stuck for a while were both cases of not finding/recognizing a piece of the puzzle right away\n- walking simulator: you spend 90% of your time crawling around the level, and most other actions are equally slow\n- Mr. Bobley is the ugly, geriatric brother of Bob the Builder, complete with red nose and a waddle that suggests serious pelvis displacement.

Seems fun. Being able to drive and use heavy machines? GREAT! Sadly, this idea wasn't made into something cool. Somewhere in half of levels I got bored with it. Finishing up to 2 or 3 levels was maximum what I could do. Some levels are really hard to beat - not because of difficult of puzzles or level design, no. Some of levels are hard to beat because doing it in normal way seems impossible. I can't count how many times my fork truck got stuck somewhere, box flied out of map, I couldn't jump from one place to another or hitted something invisible while driving. There was always more easy way to do almost everything and it's called bugs. Finding one to beat level was more fun and more easier instead of getting tired because rolling over some machine wasn't possible or it landed in some strange place, leaving level reset as only working option. Also, the last level made me laught, because I thought Mr. Bobley will commit suicide because of all those strange things he needed to do. I had some fun but not enough to recommend this game. Maybe if you don't mind bugs and enjoy strange 3D platformers, you could get it. Otherwise stay away from it.","February 11","false","13.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I took the slow, plodding character through levels that introduced concept after concept, but never asked me to do anything challenging with any of them.  After a half-hour of play, Mr. Bobley still felt like a tutorial.  The controls are awkwardly implemented, calling for keys too far apart to be hit with one hand, but also the mouse.  Some design decisions, like having players take elevators up or down floor-by-floor, when only two floors are actually revelant to the level, seem amateurish.\n\nUnity is somewhat overly maligned as a game engine.  There really have been some good games made in Unity.  Mr. Bobley, however, is not one of them.  Since, in thirty minutes of play, it could not manage to deliver up a single fun moment, I have lost hope that it ever would become enjoyable.

His sinister pop up box said 'go ahead and get into a car', but there was no way to get into any of the cars! i was ready to take my own life, but then i realized the big secret... dev is short for devil! oh foulest of demons, you almost tricked me! Fortunately i am confident that with the help of almighty jesus, we can use this review to keep you from acquiring any of the souls you so desperately desire.\n\ngod bless amen\n\n","July 1, 2015","false","4.3"," 27 of 79 people (34%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","34","27","79","37","3"
