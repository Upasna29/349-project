"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladunch/recommended/416850/","ladunch","snek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladunch/","152 products in account","The dev sent me a steam key for this game last week after I made a big list of local multiplayer games on reddit and mentioned that I have LMP gaming parties every weekend.  He asked if my friends and I would try it out before release and give him some criticism. I had no idea it would be out so soon and we didn't get a chance to play it till the weekend, and even then I'm such a do-nothing stoner that I put it off till just now.\n\nLuckily for him I don't have too many comments or criticisms to lob at the game. It's pretty much the Rolls Royce of Asteroids style, single screen, 4-player arena games. You get dumped into a ship builder screen at the start, most of us just started designing a cool looking abstract spaceship avatar (pick a nose, a midsection, and a tail), not understanding that each design carried different weapons. Once we saw the hint in the top corner saying to hold L2 to show the descriptions of the weapons the real game was on. Matches can be over really quickly once everyone gets a handle on the controls and starts focusing more on attacking instead of learning the mechanics of the really weird weaponry. Thankfully it's a single button press to immediately begin another round. It turned into a bit of a chess match with guys counter-picking against the top dog who usually discovered some new "OP" weapon and abused it until evolution forced somebody to discover it's counter.\n\nI'm not saying it's The Witcher 4, but what it claims to do, it does as well as any of it's vast list of competitors. We also played Stardust Vanguards which certainly has more depth to it than something like Astral Gun, with a cool pixel-art mech art style and multiple gamemodes, but it's also 5x the cost. My only real advice to the dev was going to be that he needed to price it very competitively because the steam market is so flooded with clones of these type that I'm choosing to not even buy some that are very highly regarded. I see they went for around the $2 price, which is right where I think it should be. Some kid can sell a few steam cards, make a couple bucks, and get a quality game out of the deal. The rest of us won't even notice 2 bucks missing from our wallet, so why not.\n\nOne definitive thing I will declare about Astral Gun though, is that this game has terrific music. We love blasting music ridiculously loud while playing if it's good, and if a game has an awesome soundtrack like Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime or Pivvot it always gets booted up for at least 10 minutes just to listen to it, if nothing else. If you didn't compose the music yourself, Mr Developer, please give the buddy of yours who did a bigger cut of the pie. We were all in agreement that it was the high water mark of the game; but like I said, we're all a bunch of dirty know-nothing stoners who probably overvalue an awesome soundtrack compared to the layperson.","February 2","true","3.2"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","36","40","4","0"

I would like to see it expanded upon, add more maps that differ from the current "Don't hit the white space." Online multiplayer would be nice, no matchmaking or anything like that, just the ability to invite your friends. The lack of options and no custom keybindings is basically the only major problem with the game, the key layout isn't good.","February 3","true","0.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It's simple enough that anyone can easily pick it up, and it has enough stuff that it can keep you playing for hours. Games are short and sweet, with a hectic fast pace that makes it addicting. It's one of those classic-feeling 'sit on the couch with your friends and enjoy' kind of games. I would definitely recommend giving Astral Gun a try.","February 4","true","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
