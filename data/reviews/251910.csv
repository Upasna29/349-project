The thing is: you can easily see the good points of this game. Visuals are decent and it has a good atmospheric music to go with it. And even the controls are okay...perhaps even decent.\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you is that it's hard. Extremely hard. To the point of insanity, even. Sure, quite some portion of that is me being not good at lunar landing kind of games. As such, this isn't the first of this sort of game I've just quit because I can't avoid one insta-death astroid without setting a deadly course to the second.\nThe thing is: where games like solar 2 and osmos accept this difficulty of steering and don't get overboard with other things, solar flux adds more layers of frustratingly hard stuff. Stay too close to a sun and your shield melts away. Most levels have flares to pick up while traversing through insta-death asteroids, which means you have to do a pretty much perfect run. Some suns tend to explode, so there's that that may send you off into an object or deep space. Others have timers or require you to set a path you can barely see from your starting position.\nOh, and you have limited ammo, so better use it wisely (which is in most levels 'close to none', as you have to time your flare-to-sun injections perfectly so the resulting explosion sends you of to where you actually want to go).\n\nNow don't get me wrong: I like hard games, and to a degree, it certainly is challenging. But I feel quite some of the difficulty should've been reserved for a hard mode (like the limited fuel and shields). Or that there'd be an easy mode without those things. And if recent hard games have learned us anything, it's that the levels should be short (which is, admittedly, more or less the case here) and shouldn't hinder the player. That's certainly an issue. After a crash, it insists on a showing a 'you crashed' message where you have to click to restart, and even then it insists on repeating the objective every freakin' time.\n\nSo in the end, I'm thumbing it down because this really shouldn't be your first space sim. The difficulty curve is, IMHO, just too high. It should be okay (and perhaps even great) to those who fully mastered the movement of games like osmos and are looking for something harder. For anyone else, I'm sorry, but I'd always advise those games first. :-(","March 27, 2015","false","0.6"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","26","30","3","2"

Most people who generally enjoy the genre of “puzzlers” will probably be able to enjoy it; it can appeal to both casual gamers and those who thirst for a good challenge.\n\nThe game can essentially be played in two ways.  Simply beating each level is not a daunting task, and, coupled with the ambient music and pretty art style, can provide a gameplay experience that is peaceful and “zen.”  Anyone who may enjoy a nice, serene game experience can find one here.\n\nAlternatively, if you are someone who wants to achieve 3-star ratings on every level to unlock all the achievements, then this game can provide a quite challenging and enjoyable task.  Be warned, however, if you are someone who would want to aim for 3-star ratings, then you should be aware that there are a few levels that may cross the threshold from challenging to frustrating.  That said, I personally felt Solar Flux was mostly fair, and properly challenging; and I believe most people will find it to be as well.\n\nThe beautiful graphics and fitting soundscape are definitely the strongest positives of the game.  The controls are fluid, but may take some time to get accustomed to.  The tutorial sufficiently explains everything you will need to understand in order to beat the game, although some levels will require understanding deeper mechanics to 3-star.  There are plenty of levels and a decent amount of variety, despite the fact that the levels don’t really evolve much as you progress through the game.\n\nSolar Flux should have a level of substance and quality that can appeal to most people who are fans of the genre.  It isn’t the most profoundly innovative puzzle game out there, but it certainly offers gameplay marginally different than most games which share the genre.  Bonus points for anyone who can appreciate the aesthetics and may be a fan of celestial bodies.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","June 19, 2015","true","8.7"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

Each level is a puzzle you have to figure out, then you have to use mouse clicking skills to actually complete the puzzle. I like the puzzle solving aspect, but I find the skill side a bit frustrating because your timing and clicking often has to be perfect, or you have to do it again, and again, and again... This can get a little tiresome if you're stuck on a particular level.\n\nNice relaxing music though, and it looks pretty.

Its "novel" control system of smushing your ship away by clicking feels simultaneously floaty and yet too-precise. They don't believe in using words for menus and such wherever possible, which means it's sometimes obnoxious to navigate things. Core gameplay is not very engaging (again, to me) because it's about delicate swoops and fast reaction times. I can definitely see where other people could have fun, and it has a nice trance-void-techno aesthetic, but if you have similar tastes to me (meaty puzzles and RPGs, keeping twitch-gaming to FPS and the like) the game is going to feel immaterial and bland. 4/10, but depending on how much you enjoy the presentation/style this could go up to 8/10.

This is not correct. Well, there is an element of strategy to each and every computer game, so let's reserve the 'strategy' label for RTS (="real time strategy", after all) games and the likes. But more importantly: this is not a puzzle game at all. You see, this is not a game of brain teasing puzzles or anything remotely like that. You don't even need to think about "what's the solution here?". The solution is very clear from the start of each mission, but the challenge is executing that solution. So this is a game of dexterity and timing.\n\nSolar Flux is challenging, I have to give them that. The problem is that the challenge quickly becomes a full-blown chore. In the first few missions, you are introduced to the basics of the game: you need to collect plasma bubbles with your space ship and then fire that plasma at the sun(s) to stabilize them. I had fun with these missions, so the basic idea is sound, although I couldn't imagine executing half of the missions perfectly (what Solar Flux calls "win 3 stars in the mission"). So I thought: "Ok I'll leave the 3 stars challenges to the people who want to go for that and I'll just try to at least get through all the missions once ('one star quality')." But that soon became too much of a chore, as well, so I call it quits. A game should be challenging but not utterly frustrating. And in my opinion, Solar Flux crosses that line.\n\nWhen browsing the reviews for Solar Flux, you'll notice that almost all the reviews that are longer than 20 words call this game frustrating in some way, even when the reviewer recommends the game. If you like a challenge to the point of frustration and if you take note of the fact that this is a game of dexterity and timing and not a puzzle game, you have all the elements you need to decide if this game is for you. However, I would strongly advise against paying full price (€8,99 atm) for Solar Flux. Games like this are on sale often enough.\n\nA word about the Steam Achievements: 22 of the 32 achievements require you to complete the missions perfectly (the '3 star' thing I talked about earlier). So the more casual player will only be able to get 10/32 achievements at the most. 8 achievements are easy to get in the first few levels, and 2 achievements are granted for completing all the levels. I don't think the devs really thought this through. This means that 70% of the achievements require you to complete their game in the equivalent of 'nightmare mode'. And the casual gamers earn all the achievements they will get in the first half hour of the game. If this would have been better spread out, the achievements might at least have been an incentive for some people to put up with the frustration of playing this game.","May 23","false","2.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However about 30 min in the game starts to get a little annoying. If you are able to actually beat everything like I did you might end up hating the game. This game has got to be one of the most frustrating games I have played in a while. The game itself isn't bad. The sounds and visuals are all fine. My only, but also huge gripe with Solar Flux is that the whole game's premise doesn't actually add up to a fun game for me when you include the other elements of the game like dying in one collision or taking massive damage from star radiation. The problem is that you are controlling a ship in space. Because you are in space, friction does not exist. Therefore movement becomes extremely clunky. For space simulation this is fine. But when precise movements that determine whether you get 3 stars or die a horrible death are required, this movement system is simply not fun.\n\nThat being said I am still recommending this game because I think true fans of the genre will still enjoy it. Since I tilt really easily from games like this it was probably not made for me.\n\nAlso in my opinion there is not enough content to justify 10 USD.

Slingshotting my spaceship around a moon should feel exhilarating rather than tedious. To the extent that this game succeeds as a series of puzzles to be solved, it also fails by making the execution of solutions a bore to carry out, robbing the player of any joy in their triumph. On top of this gameplay loop, the after-mission scoring punishes the player for not conserving enough fuel/succeeding quickly enough/etc. The idea of playing through the same mission again to conserve an extra one percent of my fuel is painful enough to make me turn back from the game completely, and the promise of trudging through another solution is not intriguing enough to keep me moving forward.","January 19","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Each mission involves you attempting to save dying suns from oblivion either by feeding them plasma to either increase their power, or to reduce their power to prevent a supernova.  Your ship has minimal thrusting power and so you must rely on the gravitationaly pull of nearby planets and asteroids to slingshot around the sector as you collect the plasma. In addition to this, whenever you shoot your collected plasma into the star, a solar flare is formed, which you can ride along to get an extra boost. The closest game I think Solar Flux reminds me of is Captain Ludwig for IOS. Both have a very similar physics system (look it up if you like, Ludwig's also a pretty good game). Apart from collecting plasma, you've also got to worry about your shield strength - which depletes whenever you are positioned in the sun's lght (you can hide in asteroid shadows to replenish this). There's also the fuel meter to keep an eye on, use all your fuel and the ship will be dead in the wat.. um space dust. This is wheere the game adds the replayability. Much like how angry birds challenges you to use the fewest birds, Solar Flux rewards players for minimal fuel consumption, indeed many missions are possible to complete without using a drop! The satisfaction from zero fuel usage you get is pretty good.\n\nOverall, the game is a great little puzzler, easy to learn the basics, but still with plenty of challenge. Adding to that the minimalistic visuals and great space ambience music, Firebrand having done an excellent job of porting an already good tablet game to the pc.","March 20, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You control a space ship which has to re-feul/de-feul suns.\n\nGameplay is the main selling point here. There are 4 systems. Each system has a few levels for a total of over 70 levels across all four systems. Each level tasks you with either feuling suns or de-feuling them. In order to accomplish this, you need to collect plasma and then fire it at a nearby sun. Each sun shows a percentage of power it has (e.g. 20%) and each time you collect plasma you ship indicates how much plasma you have (e.g. 20%). You have limited shields and feul. Moveing your ship uses up feul, which when you run out means you die. Shields are delpleted by getting to close to suns and also results in death when you run out. You can refeul your ship at the luanch station, and you can regain shields by moving away from the suns. To further hinder you are asteroids, which when crashed into immediately kills you. The puzzle element come into play when you have to manage all these factors and try to re-feull the sun/s without over extending your resources. Each level will reward you stars based on how little resources you used to accomplish your goal (e.g. low feul use or shield damage etc).\n\nThere is limited audio in the game. No background music is played during levels. Sound effects sound good though.\n\nA plot and voice acting are also absent from the game.\n\nMovement relies highly on physics. To move your ship you need to click behind it (unless you change movement in options menu), which propells it in the direction that you pushed it. The more you push your ship, the faster it goes in that direction. At the same time, the more energy you used to push your ship, the more that is needed to stop it and change direction.\n\nGraphics are decent. The suns as well as the background imgaes look good and detailed. the asteroids don't lookm as good, but they blend in well with the background. Your ship doesn't appear impressive.\n\nIf you love phsics based puzzles as well as space, this game will satify your cravings.","February 20, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acecool/recommended/251910/","Acecool","Acecool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acecool/","1154 products in account","This game appears to have been created with Mobile in mind; that being said, it is much better than other games targeting the same market because the icons make sense and the options aren't as limiting as most other; ie you have a music slider, sound slider, invert thrust option, resolution setting and fullscreen toggle but there is not an option for borderless windowed which should be included ( I use a separate app to enable it on most games called Borderless Gaming although it is bugged being it won't save favorites on any version I've tried from 8.1 and up to 8.4 ). I won't be judging this game as harshly as other mobile games because of the extended options, high quality graphics, clean ui / menu and overall quality of code and lack of bugs ( as of right now I have yet to experience a bug in the game ).\n\nSolar Flux is a Space Puzzle Game with limited physics in place ( space craft thruster, no friction, no gravity pulling you into an orbit, etc... if you launch directly at a planet you will enter orbit which I'm not a fan of; with suns you will crash into them and you can not orbit them unless you enter planetary orbit which is orbiting the sun.. all of the orbiting is on rails ). I wouldn't identify it as strategy because solving puzzles often requires thought\n\nThe aim of the game is to refuel dying stars, or remove excess energy from stars that are pulsing ( plus actions I have yet to experience; believed to be destroying asteroids, etc... ) by using no fuel or as little fuel as possible and ensuring your shields are not damaged ( self-replenishing after delay ) or damaged as little as possible.\n\nThe controls are simplified; Click and Right click. Right click will let you aim a space station to launch your vehicle and click with activate thrusters ( HOLD ) which can be toggled to invert ( thruster adds velocity towards your cursor ) or default ( away from cursor ).\n\nThe graphics are quite nice.

The puzzly part of the game is that you have limited amounts of time, shields, and fuel which means you need to use gravity and solar flares to your advantage. If you are really into puzzlers and are a completionist, then you'll have fun with it as it is a good challenge.\n\n\nHowever, I had no motivation to get 3 stars on every level as there is nothing on the line. The game commits the cardinal sin of locking off levels until you score a certain amount on the previous levels but if the levels are the same, then I don't care. There is no story (which is fine) but without that, it's just boring and I was glad that I finished it. The game is also short (ignore the 19 hour time reported as I left the game on to get trading cards).\n\nOverall, if you are really into puzzlers or got it for pretty cheap, go for it. Otherwise, get something else.","August 16, 2015","false","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acecool/recommended/251910/","Acecool","Acecool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acecool/","1154 products in account","This game appears to have been created with Mobile in mind; that being said, it is much better than other games targeting the same market because the icons make sense and the options aren't as limiting as most other; ie you have a music slider, sound slider, invert thrust option, resolution setting and fullscreen toggle but there is not an option for borderless windowed which should be included ( I use a separate app to enable it on most games called Borderless Gaming although it is bugged being it won't save favorites on any version I've tried from 8.1 and up to 8.4 ). I won't be judging this game as harshly as other mobile games because of the extended options, high quality graphics, clean ui / menu and overall quality of code and lack of bugs ( as of right now I have yet to experience a bug in the game ).\n\nSolar Flux is a Space Puzzle Game with limited physics in place ( space craft thruster, no friction, no gravity pulling you into an orbit, etc... if you launch directly at a planet you will enter orbit which I'm not a fan of; with suns you will crash into them and you can not orbit them unless you enter planetary orbit which is orbiting the sun.. all of the orbiting is on rails ). I wouldn't identify it as strategy because solving puzzles often requires thought\n\nThe aim of the game is to refuel dying stars, or remove excess energy from stars that are pulsing ( plus actions I have yet to experience; believed to be destroying asteroids, etc... ) by using no fuel or as little fuel as possible and ensuring your shields are not damaged ( self-replenishing after delay ) or damaged as little as possible.\n\nThe controls are simplified; Click and Right click. Right click will let you aim a space station to launch your vehicle and click with activate thrusters ( HOLD ) which can be toggled to invert ( thruster adds velocity towards your cursor ) or default ( away from cursor ).\n\nThe graphics are quite nice. The background is multi-layered so some stars appear closer than those in the bottom-most layer. Shadows also appear and look good when they appear; some levels revolve around using them ( either for aiming rebounds or to hide to prevent solar flares or bursts from affecting the craft ).\n\n\nIn terms of how long it'll take to beat the game, here's an idea of how many levels there are:\n\nThere are 4 galaxies: Helios with 6 sectors and 69 possible stars ( 3 per level = 23 ), Oceanus with 3 sectors and 54 possible stars ( 3 per level = 18 ), Hyperion unknown, Cerberus unknown - haven't unlocked unknown yet so this review is will the first galaxy completed ( doesn't take long ) and the second only partially looked at ( I, at first, thought there'd only be one type of sun, the yellow star like our planet Earth, but there are different types and they're beautiful ).\n\nEach level can be solved anywhere from a few seconds onward depending on how well you time the bursts to ride on, of which you ride the tangent.
