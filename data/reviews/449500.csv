It is notorious for producing a lot of poorly made and cheap thrill caliber cash grabs. The Steam catalog is literally full of them. Anyone who has had a Steam account for any reasonable length of time can rattle off several of them without even thinking about it. But to be honest I’ve enjoyed quite a few horror games this year. Many of the ones that I have reviewed have impressed me. For example, in the past couple of weeks I featured Downfall and a few days later followed that with Shadows Peak which I believe is the best horror game that I have played since last year’s Until Dawn on the PS4.\n\nThat brings me to today’s feature on Hush Hush: Unlimited Survival Horror. It was released – remembering I use the Australian Steam store – on March 26 which is a week as I write this. Sadly, the game already appears to be heavily hidden in the Steam library as the game possesses just the single solitary review which is also a private one. I assume that it is the hefty $19.99 ($17.99 when it was on its debut discount) price that have scared the punters away.\n\nAnd then when I try to open the game I realize why nobody has reviewed the game and there is already a documented case of it in the Steam discussion forum. The game doesn’t download anything whatsoever when you attempt to download the game from Steam. Of course the report that it feeds back is missing executable. I’ve reported the issue and will return to the game at a later date.\n\nReturning to the game the next day the issue that I had has been repaired and the depots have been repaired enabling me to play the game. Anticipating fun I load the game. Getting the value proposition out of the way early, unfortunately, I can tell you that in my opinion – the missing executable aside – the game is in no way worth the current $19.99 asking price. The content in the game just isn’t engrossing enough to be anything more than your mid-tier indie game.\n\nFirst of all the character that you control’s moves are quite clunky. Clunky actually does a very good job of describing the game in its totality. The camera – although there are at least three camera options (left, right and centre) are not the best. Field of vision is mediocre. The graphics are okay at best. The gameplay is mediocre as you wander around caves destroying crystals and hiding and moving away from ghosts and other horrors. It shows some potential but it misses the mark because of the clumsy play and certainly at this price point.\n\nPricing your game appropriately is a tough challenge. You don’t want to mark it too high because people wont buy it and you definitely don’t want to put it at a too low a point and miss out on important revenue. This one is in the too high zone because of its downsides. I could possibly overlook it if they weren’t asking you to pay this much and would consider half the asking price to be a much more reasonable expectation.\n\nI do hope that the development team keep working at creating games even if I would give this one a miss.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","false","9.1"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","31","43","2","1"
