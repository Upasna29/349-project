The game at the moment is riddled with bugs but for the first full two days of gameplay, it didn’t bother me whatsoever, each time I disconnected I found myself rushing to get back in to return my endless search for keys and then the doors for those keys.\n\nOne thing that I found that is a bit negative towards the game is the Phantom, I don’t consider it overpowered but I consider it is… how to put it. Not used correctly. The game is suppose, in my mind be a survival horror. In other words I find that the goal of the monster whatever type that may be, should be to try to scare the survivors in any possible way, from talking creepy in the microphone to chasing a survivor, and letting them get away. I’ve found the best matches I’ve had are with people who just installed the game, the environment is new, they don’t know the mechanics of it yet and pretty much anything give them a little jump. Nothing is more satisfying as the monster to hear them scream and run when you spawn behind them, and give them a little growl. I don’t think the majority of the community follows this ideal of the monster however.\n\nI’ve noticed in most lobbies people let everything stay on random. But, sometimes you have someone select something, and nearly 99% of the time they choose the Phantom. Then exactly what I expect happens, the phantom rushes the spawning points kills all the survivors in cramped narrow hallways then proceeds to give remarks like. “Yes!” and “Owned!” in the lobby, like they actually accomplished anything more than simple spawn killing. The impact on the survivors is that they didn’t care, they didn’t get scared, and it was a match that wasn’t worth there time or will ever stay in their memory.\n\nNow, I’ve had a few good matches with the Phantom, but I can count on my hand how many times it happens. Now I don’t think it should be removed, it is a perfectly valid monster and I think it is quite well balanced for what it is. But perhaps one thought. From my understanding the monster works on player proximity and sound from traps, to footstep and flashlights being turned on and off. We as a player base do not fully understand the Phantom, but perhaps, the proximity effect should be removed, and replaced with an ‘aura’ the Phantom could put up from time to time, anyone in that aura would be detected. This move would need a decent cool down timer so that the Phantom could just not hang out in doorways and spike it whenever. To balance this more if a player springs any trap whatsoever the phantom should be alerted no matter the distance, this would strike fear in the heart of the player not knowing how far the phantom is, but knowing he is now on his way, and they need to calmly, slowly move away. This effect could be done with something on the Phantoms over display, perhaps a pulse that gives off slower intervals far away and faster intervals closer. The trap and the player would have a shimmering outline around it, the trap until the Phantom reached the location and the player the standard time as currently.\n\nI feel as a player the next thing that should be looked at should be the crashing issues, and also allow players to save there log in information and password so on the occasion they do crash, they are not scrambling to enter their information to rejoin their friends.\n\nOnce this is corrected I feel that monsters in general should have scaring non damaging moves and abilities with great range to keep the players on edge and fresh. Jump scares are great but if they are used over and over again it loses its effect, think Dead Space. It would be great if for example the lurker could enter a non-damage form, he could see the players but they can’t see him. He could make things move, blood drip from the walls, doors slam as players draw closer to them, fade a players vision to black, move them to another location on the map and then allow them to see again. This games potential is honestly non ending. I feel like this could turn out to be the greatest horror game of the next decade. I wish the game developers much luck and I hope they read all of this, and consider some of what I said.","November 29, 2013","true","27.9"," 347 of 369 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","347","369","0","16"

Don't pick up the batteries just because they are there. The batteries you pick up replace your previous battery. Meaning that if you pick up 2 you waste 1. Wait for your battery to be low before picking another up. This will save you in the late-game.\n\nRule 2. Voice chat is C, stop asking\n\nRule 3. When a monster is chasing you, DO NOT RUN TOWARDS TEAMMATES. All monsters are good at killing clustered survivors. Run in the opposite direction and let the others survive.\n\nRule 4. Help any new players with the basics. The more you help, the more chance this game has of seeing a real release.\n\nRule 5. Be aware of your surroundings. Know where you could go in case of emergency (this will depend on the monster you fight).\n\nRule 6. Sometimes things bug, get used to it.\n\nRule 7. I decide what qualifies as a "rule", get used to it\nAnti-Lurker\nThe lurker is the OG monster. So if you be creepin' up on his turf, gonna get a beat down!\n\nBut, if you can't help it here are some tips.\n\nLurker fact: The lurker has a "ghost" form and a physical form. He can HEAR you in ghost form (like, the gamer has to use his actual ears (unlike the phantom)), but he can only KILL you in human form.\n\nLurker Fact: IF THE MUSIC CHANGES THAT MEANS HE'S NEAR! GET TO COVER!\n\nLurker Fact: The lurker sets traps by clicking on items in the environment. When YOU set off a trap (e.g. you set off a grandfather clock), be careful. He might have heard you.\n\nLurker Fact: The lurker CANNOT stay in his physical form for long. He has about 30-40 seconds in his physical form to kill you. If he stays in physical form for the whole time, he will be unable to use physical form for a while (2 minutes?). The shorter he stays in physical form, the less his cooldown will be (down to 13 seconds from a <2 second physical form)\n\nRule 1: Avoid traps! If you are playing against a monster who's main way of tracking you down is traps... AVOID THEM! Stay away from clocks, radiators, boards, light fixtures, toilets (these are the worst), ladders, wiji boards, and jack-o-lanterns if possible.\n\nRule 2: In the beginning of the match you have about 45 seconds of free time before the lurker CAN appear. Use it wisely and progress as much as you can in this time. Remember to stop running at least 20-seconds before you think that he'll appear (to charge sprint to maximum).\n\nRule 3: Doors! On maps with lots of small rooms, you can just go in a room, shut the door, and block it with your body. He can't get in... so.... it's good!\n\nRule 4: Tables! On maps that have wide open rooms, your best bet is to sprint away from him or to put a table between you and him. Then, just keep moving away from the side he moves to.\n\nRule 5: Flashlight! If the lurker didn't see you when he spawned, TURN IT OFF. He has bad eyesight and hiding is possible.\n\nRule 6: Don't look at him when running away. You'll slow down and die. A quick glance will suffice.\nAnti-Phantom\nThe phantom is the least fun monster to play as, and the most fun monster to play against. He is hard to learn how to play against, but once you get the hang of it, it's really quite fun!\n\nPhantom Fact: THE PHANTOM CAN'T SEE YOU. STOP RUNNING AWAY ALL THE TIME!\n\nPhantom Fact: READ THE ONE ABOVE AGAIN!\n\nPhantom Fact: The phantom can HEAR what you do. When you do something loud, the player that is playing the phantom will have you appear as bright white that can shine through obstacles and walls on his screen. Avoid: clicking the flashlight, overly clicking on doors and safes, RUNNING, walking very near the phantom, RUNNING, walking on top of the phantom, setting off traps, RUNNING\n\nRule 1: STOP CROUCH WALKING, IT DOESN'T HELP, AND IT MAKES YOU LOOK STUPID.\n\nRule 2: DON'T RUN TOWARDS TEAMMATES WHEN HE'S CHASING YOU!\n\nRule 3: NO RUNNING\n\nRule 4: If the phantom does "see" you, run as far away as you can. After about 5 seconds, the music will become more peaceful. When this happens, IMMEDIATELY CHANGE DIRECTIONS. This will send the phantom looking for you in a part of the map that is empty.\n\nRule 5: Leave all doors wide open, he can't see them. Closing them will just get in YOUR way.\n\nRule 6: STOP RUNNING, I'M SERIOUS! YOU JUST KEEP DYING!\nAnti-Mary\nMary is scary!\n\nMary fact: Mary gains energy over time. She uses this for her 2 main abilities, Teleport and Frenzy.\n\nMary Fact: Mary gains energy if you are near her. This does not include when there is a CLOSED door inbetween you and her.\n\nMary Fact: She's really slow most of the time, but when she frenzies, you CANNOT outrun her.\n\nMary Fact: You can look to the left, you can look to the right, you can look behind you, you can look under your bed, you can look under your dresser, but don't look up... she doesn't like to be seen.\n\nRule 1: don't get near her\n\nRule 2: don't get near her\n\nRule 3: don't get near her\n\nRule 4: all of the above\n\nRule 5: So... you got near her... idiot! Well if she frenzies you still have a chance. Start sprinting in RANDOM DIRECTIONS. Mary is super fast, so it's really easy for her to overshoot you. Doing a random pattern of sprint can save your life. You only need to survive for 8 seconds anyway.\n\nRule 6: DON'T GET NEAR HER\nConclusion\nDon't die","November 1, 2014","true","21.9"," 272 of 300 people (91%) found this review helpful 99 people found this review funny","91","272","300","99","3"

First and foremost, play this game with a group of friends who are bad at the game along side you and can get better with you. Playing with randoms online will not help you learn in this HIGH stress environment and the current how-to guides online are only so helpful.\n\nHere's what you get:\nYou're one of the survivors in the haunted hotel/asylum/hospital, and your on a scavenger hunt for keys to open the various locked doors on the map. As you creep around, you deal with randomly generated hauntings that do aweful things like make the dark screen darker, mysterious spooky noises play in your ear, or keyboard keys can even be disabled. All temporary.\nAnd thats all before your friend takes control of one of three monsters and attempts to murder you before you get the silver key and escape.\n\nThe keys and tools are all hidden in obscure places, anything from in drawers of desks to the garbage can in the woods. But never somewhere completly random like the middle of the floor of a ball room. They are hidden well, but not unfairly at all. The rest of the challenge is finding what doors they unlock. Eventually leading out.\n\nThe Three Monsters:\nAs of now there are only three creatures to threaten you and they all garner a different approach to avoid. Here's the long/short;\nLurker sets traps to try to pinpoint your location and materializes in a blink for a few seconds at a time. You pretty much just run from him like an old monster movie. Bracing doors and sobbing until he's gone.\n\nThe phantom is 'blind' and only sees players who make a lot of noise. People complain about him being Overpowered but  thats mostly because they run around and get slapped instantly. You need to be sneaking when this ghoul roams the halls.\n\nThen there's mary. She randomly teleports around the map, and if she fills up her spooky-meter she frenzies and can run at you rather than her usual trundle. Think the Witch from Left 4 Dead, popping and locking through the dining room looking for victims.\n\nThe Good:\n-Very different kind of game play. If you have a group of friends you dont mind never wanting to talk to again, team up and go scavenger hunting.\n-This is a HORROR game, not an FPS. When you see the monster you run. There are no guns, just a flashlight. This might sound like a negative, but it really helps amp up the FEAR\n-Atmosphere. This might be a little generic, but they really do try to use your less obvious senses to pick up on the creepy factor. You get trained to listen for traps and musical queues, little details, that when you finally do see something. It hits hard and helps you scare.\n\nThe Bad\n-Crashes. There seems to be a lot of crashes between my friends and I. Hardware capability dont seem to be the issue, and if someone drops midgame, they wont be able to get back in. They'll only be able to spectate.\n-Genuine stress level. It might not be a problem to everyone, but I get genuinly stressed out. Legs tight. Hands sweating. Worrying about ever little step. This is why you play with friends. Let the strange monster creeping on you be your pal. Not some mook on teh interwebs.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nLove it. Go in on a 4 pack with your friends. Maybe hope it winds up on a sale. Hopefully the crashes get patched out and new features like new monsters and  different playable characters get added. But this is not a game I can compare to any other experience very well.\n\nIf players could jump back in if they were kicked and the crashes were resolved I would say full price is worth it. As it stands now, $19.99 is a little steep for what feels like early access material. However I still love the experience. And few things are as satisfying as hearing your friends fill their diapers over skype as you pop out around the corner.","December 15, 2014","true","41.9"," 156 of 176 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","156","176","10","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/banjack/recommended/251170/","banjack","Banjack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/banjack/","1311 products in account","My reviews are primarily on the silly side (because I am a buffoon), but for this game I think I've got time to sit down grab a brew and do a full review.\n\nI got this game waaay  back when it initially released, with it's 1 monster (Lurker) and 4 maps. (Back then, I was heavily into Amnesia: The Dark Descent and the mods being created for Amnesia; so horror was my Wheaties, couldn't start the day without it). So suffice it to say, when this game came to my attention I was like "Heck yeah, horror gaming with friends! GIMME!". So I sat myself down, enveloped in complete darkness with no source of light save for my monitor, and played...\n\n[Gameplay]\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that the game plays much like Amnesia! Hell yeah! Albeit, a somewhat less intuitive version, still fun though. The game goes essentially like this, find lousy keys to open doors to find better keys that open doors that lead to a silver key that goes to a door that leads to your freedom (along the way you'll want to find a crowbar or something to unblock the escape door, meh). All the while listening for sound cues to let you know whether the monster is nearby or not.\n\n[Conclusion]\nUpon finishing a session, my friends were somewhat dismissive, whilst I saw the potential in this game and could ignore the rough edges (random crashing, Amnesia click and drag bugginess). I continued playing the game month after month, update after update, and found my experience never altering; to this day I keep thinking to myself "This game has potential". And that's where I am today, while this game has seen the additions of two more monsters (Phantom, and Mary) and is now at a total of 12 maps, has added the 'Insanity' mechanic (seeing things that aren't there), and has come out of Early Access, I still feel that so much more can be done with this game. In fact, I think at the end of this review I will whip up a list of additions and alterations that I believe would improve this game.\nBut before that, I would like to say,\n\nAs it stands this game is indeed worth buying if you are a true fan of horror genre gaming, and to those that ARE NOT, wait till a Summer Sale or something because the $19.99 price tag might be a little high for most people.\n\nOverall, this game gets my stamp of approval (for what it's worth), good job 9Heads Game Studios! You proved that a multiplayer horror experience IS possible.\n\n[Extras]\nOh good, you're still here! You're probably here for my personal Additions and Alterations That Would Improve This Game ( aka. AATWITG, working title).\n\n1. Why Lurker No Go "Here's Johnny" On That Door?\nI think that considering that the Phantom and Mary are just straight up more dangerous than the Lurker, that giving him the ability to break down doors would add to the primal terror of a vicious creature that wants your innards to be outtards. I mean his hands don't even look like they can even grasp a door handle let alone turn it.\n\n2. Insanity, I See Goofy Faces...\nOverall, I love the Insanity system, I love it to death. But the faces, those goofy looking faces are just silly! Have you ever walked around in the dark, and had a sensation that you were about to come face to face with something, like you think you can see something that is just out of sight and out of focus, when all of a sudden it's right up in your face like a deranged dermatologist! You couldn't tell what it was, you just know it gave you semi-whiplash. Yeah that, do that!\n\n3. Insanity, Why My Legs Be Broken?\nOkay, this one is a little finicky. But sometimes when your Insanity reachs the point where you can't move or see, is alright, accept when you're trying to escape a monster! I get it, you see arms coming out of the walls grabbing at you, you slow down and think about your life, but when a monster wants to push your ♥♥♥♥ in! I think you got bigger problems. (Disable Insanity temporarily when in danger, that's all I'm saying GG).\n\n4. Insanity Addition: Tunnel-Vision.\nSome horror games are doing it! Damned sure as shootin' can! You know that optical illusion that causes you to percieve the room or floor or what have you to stretch out further and further away. Yep that's a winner!\n\n5. Need Me a Little Pick-Me-Up.\nThis just a suggestion, but how about the ability to revive buddies? Like a chance that they survived the attack from a monster and are knocked unconscious, whilst unconscious the incapacitated player engages a nightmare scenario that they have to beat in order to wake up or wait until an other player resuscitates them. However, if blood begins to pool, that is a sure sign that the victim is beyond saving.\n\n6. More Scenarios for Success.\nEscape is a fine solution, but for those more brave souls why not include an alternative. Excorsism, Slay the Monster (aka. Monster Bane), Sacrifice (appease the monster). I don't know suggest your own! I just think that more can be done here.\n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment, add your own suggestions if you want to. Thank you dear reader, for listening to me babble! You're good people.","April 4, 2015","true","16.8"," 84 of 93 people (90%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","90","84","93","14","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzousisohvat/recommended/251170/","dzousisohvat","*NOB* Dzou Sisohvat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzousisohvat/","244 products in account","I think that this game deserves a honest and detailed review because of all the negative reviews it received. I will try to remedy that, but I will also address the technical difficulties me and four of my friends faced while we were playing. If you are not interested in reading a wall of text, there is a TL;DR version at the bottom so feel free to check that out!\n\n\nWhy do I recommend this game? Because it shocked me and it blew me away. It crushed all of my preconceptions of what is and what can be a good horror game. And here are a few reasons why:\nI've never before played a scary co-op horror game.\nNever ever. And i honestly thought I never will. Then this game almost made me fall from my chair in one instance and I even wasn't the last person alive. Though, I only recommend playing this game with a group of friends, because playing on public servers can really ruin the experience. Trust me. This game is all about the atmosphere.\n\nMonster design is in my honest opinion superb.\nThey are given unfair advantages and the developer understands that is the thing that makes them scary.\n\nGame forces players to adapt their tactics and their approach to the level they are facing based on the monster they are playing against.\nIf you want to add a little bit of additional suspense you can actually play with "all random" setting and not check the player list when the game loads to see which monster you are facing. That way actually you really don't know what you can and cannot do. For example. If you are playing against Mary you can run but you should not have your flashlight on. If you're playing against Lurker you don't want to communicate through in game voice because it can hear you. If you are playing against Phantom you absolutely must not run or keep switching on/off your flashlight because you will die almost instantly.\n\nBeing a monster is not all about winning and ending a game soon, it is about creating the experience for the survivors.\nLet me give you an example - Today we played a hour long game in which we faced Mary (basically the girl from "The Ring") in the old abandoned factory. My heart was racing for the whole hour, especially when we lost two players and my friend and I were the last ones left. At one instance we actually bumped our faces in the monster player because he had the luck to teleport in front of us. He didn't kill us and just gave us a good scare before teleporting away. Why? Because as the monster you are the "creator" of suspense and fear. Good monster will miss a chance for an easy kill from time to time. He will stalk his prey, instill fear into the survivors and create really scary situations. That is why I recommend playing with friends, because it's not about the winning, it's about having the best possible experience. We did all die in the end, not because of a lucky teleport, but because of our own mistakes.\n\nPlaying against human controlled monster is terrifying.\nYou can not glitch him out. He has no clear pattern of behaviour you can exploit. He adapts and learns about your patterns of movement and tries to adapt his strategy so he has the biggest chance of finding you. Human intelligence far surpasses any artificial intelligence (AI) and makes this game truly unique. Every one of your friends will have his own way of playing certain monsters.\n\nWhen you are the last one alive the stakes are raised tenfold and the game really shines.\nOther players can spectate you and can hear you talk, scream and get freaked out. But you are alone and defenceless against the enemy you can only outsmart but you cannot beat.\nWhat do I recommend for the best game experience?There are a few things i reccomend you do as it will vastly improve your game experience:\nUse in-game voice chat (automatic voice detection setting turned on) with 3D sound enabled.\nWhile the sound quality is not the best I have ever seen, it gets the job done, and it really adds to the atmosphere. One monster in particular (Lurker) can use your voice to locate you when he is in his corporeal form. Three-dimensional sound is really well done and it can often help you find your friends. Another neat feature is that you won't be able to hear your friends when you die (it would really ruin it for me if I could hear my friends support me when I am the only one alive)\n\nPlay with premade five/four player groups. Do not play with random people!\nIt ruins the experience to hear monster sing his national anthem in a squeaky voice. As I've said, you need to get into the character because otherwise you won't get the best experience. You need to want to be scared. If you don't have a group of friends that can take the game seriously i advise you not to buy it as you won't get the enjoyment out of it. Even if you don't have the fifth player the game plays just fine with four people.\n\nWhen playing the monster, don't play just to win.\nEverybody likes to win, but it's your duty to make the game fun for other people. Play to scare. Play to make your friends enjoy this really great game. Toy with them. They will thank you later.\n\nPlay on "all random" setting and don't check which monster you are facing.\nIt raises the stakes and creates permanent suspense.\nTechnical stuff!Here are our experiences. We DID NOT have major problems with this game so far, but i will update this review if we get more problems down the line - we ran this game on seven systems so far (two of us have laptops) so I can give you somewhat detailed performance breakdown and you can compare these specs to your own specs. Also note that "Film grain setting is OFF across all systems because we simply dislike the effect as it brightens the view.\nGame runs smoothly on my main rig (Nvidia GeForce GTX 295, Intel Core i7 940, 4GB RAM @ 1920x1080) - Stable 60FPS with Shadows on Medium, FXAA OFF, Anisotropic Filtering on High,  Ambient Occlusion OFF, Volumetric Fog OFF, Film grain OFF, Depth of Field ON.\n\nGame is playable on my laptop (Nvidia GeForce 635M, Intel Core i7 - 3630 @ 2,40GHz, 8GB RAM @ 1600x900) - 30 to 50 FPS, with Shadows on Low, FXAA OFF, Anisotropic Filtering on Low, Ambient Occlusion OFF, Volumetric Fog OFF, Film grain OFF, Depth of Field OFF.\n\nGame runs smoothly on my friends rig (Nvidia GeForce GTX 770, Intel Core i5 3570K, 8GB RAM @ 1920x1080) - stable 60+FPS on max settings with Film grain OFF.\n\nGame suprisingly runs great on an older rig (Radeon HD5670, Core 2 Duo processor, 3,2GB RAM @ 1440x900) - stable 40-50FPS with Shadows on Medium, FXAA OFF, Anisotropic Filtering on Low, Ambient Occlusion OFF, Volumetric Fog OFF, Film Grain OFF, Depth of Field OFF.\n\nThe only computer that had real issues running this game was an older laptop and even it could run it without crashes.Second part - Game and network stability!\nThe game did crash a few times but it only once obstructed our game experience. Game tends to crash when switching to full screen, but a simple game restart fixes it.\nWe've had almost no problems with network connectivity - game lobby just once froze for me as a game host but it wasn't anything a simple re-host couldn't fix. Game didn't crash while we were playing and we had just one random disconnect (i blame my lousy upload).\n\nTL;DRFour of my friends and I had none of the issues other reviewers pointed out. I've had a lot of fun with this title and would honestly recommend it to you if you have a group of friends that will get into character and won't actively work to ruin the atmosphere. Even though this game has a learning curve it is quite rewarding.

But its a gem.

What can i say? Its Alpha 0.42 so theres not much to say really.\nBut what i can say, is that this game is awesome! So heres my opinion/look on it.\n\nWhat is Damned?: Its a co-op/multiplayer horror game where you can play as either the survivor that has to get all the keys and escape, or the monster that sets up traps to scare the hell out of everybody and causing panic and has the job of "getting rid of the survivors".\n\nMap designs: I do like how the maps are designed, but sometimes its very hard to find the keys, but i like that it spawns randomly. I like the maps though.\n\nGraphics, music and sound effects: The graphics arent bad, but neither very good either, its decent. But at the moment theres a need for optimization to fix the FPS issues that are there. It is Alpha after all. It runs just fine on my pc though, but it still seems kind of laggy, even with 60 FPS.\nI really like the music and sound effects in this game, creepy, unexpected and makes it all much more scary, which is good. This has a connection with the traps that the monster can set up, i like it.\nI just think that the monster has a lack of sound effects, he has none actually. So, i think it would be great with some creepy ones added to the monster(s).\n\nPlaystyles:\nPlaying as the "Survivor": I will say that i dont dislike playing as the survivor, cause it can actually be quite fun, for me at least. Gathering keys, sticking together with your teammates, escaping the monster when hes chasing you and stuff, its all quite fun. You have a flashlight which you can turn on and off, its very useful if the monster is chasing you, you can just turn it off and youre pretty much invisible.\n\nPlaying as the "Monster": This is a playstyle ive never seen before, to be honest, which is cool. It was quite confusing to me in the start what to actually do, but i figured it out quite fast. If you know where you have your survivors, its just hilarious to play as the monster. There is 2 forms that you can go in to;\n1. The physical form, this is where you can see the survivors, kill them, and they can see you. You walk very slow but can one-hit kill people and still set traps.\n2. The ghost form, this is where you are invisible, can walk through doors and set up traps around the map.\nIts quite fun, because you can just spawn right in front of them and scare them and see them run away.\n\nConclusion: I like this game, its unique and very fun (and scary).\nIf i should rate it, i think i would rate it 5 or 6/10, just because its very good, but it can also get boring very quickly. What i think it needs, is just updates, which is coming. New monsters, maps and objectives. Theres a new monster thats in work in progress right now actually, im excited for that.\n\nEnd thoughts:\nSo, to end it off, gather 4 friends if you can and play it together, thats the most fun.\nAlso a good LAN Party game. It doesnt cost much and its a lot of fun. The developers seem to work quite good on this game, so im looking forward to the future updates!\n\n6/10","October 5, 2013","true","14.9"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","36","45","0","3"

That being said, there are a number of problems with the game:\n\n1. The premise is very narrow and wears thin quickly. At first it is scary and you die all the time. Then you realise that you cannot possibly complete this game (see point 2) without studying the particulars of the monster you are facing. The minute you do that, the scary aspect pretty much disappears, or in the very least much of it is lost.\n\n2. The game is extremely hard for the survivors. The only way to beat it is to treat it like any other computer game and learn specific strategies... but in a game so dependent on atmosphere and fright, this ruins things.\n\n3. Once you have your strategy in place, studied the monster to the point where there is nothing scary about it, and are ready to play, you will soon find the game becoming very repetitive and tedious. You will essentially wander around in the dark trying to find that one damn key that no one could find to the door that is still locked. After 20 minutes of going around in the same circle doing nothing but trying to imagine where on earth you forgot to look and you will be ready to pull your hair clean off your head.\n\n4. The door opening and closing mechanism is moronic. You will not believe how moronic it is if you did not try it.\n\nAll in all, not a game I would recommend. Interesting idea, but not very well executed and also lacking in content to make it interesting in the long run.","October 29, 2014","false","6.0"," 160 of 258 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","160","258","3","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/251170/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","Damned is a 4 vs 1 cooperative game where 4 survivors are trapped inside a location such as an asylum, hospital, or hotel trying to escape the horror that lies within. In order to escape, keys must be located and boards must be removed to open the final exit door all while avoiding a deadly monster. There are 4 different types of monsters that a group can play against. Each monster has its own unique abilities to locate and kill the survivors and each survivor has a different set of attributes. This leads to a lot of cat and mouse tactics in knowing where to look and when to run and hide.\n\nThere's about 10 different maps, a few different game modes, and key placement is randomized each game.\n\nThe game has a small learning curve which involves each monster's playing strategy to efficiently locate and kill the survivors, and as a survivor understanding where keys typically are hidden and learning to avoid and escape each monster. It is a very satisfying game after learning the fundamentals, but until that point I felt kind of lost.\n\nThere are typically a handful of games going although it is often difficult to find a public game because the game has a very small player base and the majority of games available are private. You may also have to wait several minutes for a spot to open up or people to join your game, but if you already have a small group of friends that won't be a problem.","January 4","true","23.6"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

There is the promise of a good game here, which promises to be a lot of fun with friends. It's just not that playable at the moment. The game should not have been released in its current state, since it is glitchy to the point of being impossible to play. Your game will crash, your voice chat will not work, you will be unable to connect, you won't be able to perform certain actions, etc. (At one point, I asked if it was still in beta, because it's absolutely unacceptable as a final version.) Even if those glitches were fixed, there are some serious design flaws. The stages are extremely dark and murky, which may create an atmosphere but makes it hard to see the tiny items that the survivors need. This decision might be okay if the game wasn't already so imbalanced. The survivors don't have enough options to get away from or defend themselves from the ghost, who has a one-hit kill. They also aren't given any indications about what keys open what doors, so it becomes an exercise in trying every key in every door. Worst of all, the ghost and the survivors are in the same voice chat, which makes it impossible to coordinate with the other survivors without the ghost hearing all your plans and knowing where you will be. So, in its current form, I cannot recommend it to others.","December 18, 2014","false","1.3"," 110 of 182 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","110","182","2","13"

I was wrong.\n\nHaven't had the chance yet to play as a monster (only played a few rounds), but playing as a survivor is awesome. It is like playing Amnesia or Outlast withoutt the hiding in wardrobes but with 3 other people but you don't know where they are, there are no indicators. If you see them, good, but you can lose track of them if you don't pay attention or wander off. The maps are quite large with lots of rooms and corridors so it is also a good thing.\n\nWhen you are walkign around and suddenly see a sobbing, slowly walking girl in the corner of your eyes, or a ghost flying around which can only see you if you make noise and then you accidently activate a trap by walking past it, you know you are probably dead.\n\nYour objective is to collect keys, combinations for safes, hammers/crowbars for barricades and find the exit zone, which can be anywhere (I guess it is random, in one of my rounds it was a random small cell).\n\nIt also makes it more fun that you cannot run from the monsters, most you can hope for is that you can outsmart/outrun them but even then you only win a little time till they can enter into physical/attack form again. The fact that the monter is controlled by a player makes it more fun, more random. Some people like to hunt everyone down as soon as they can while others prefer to play with the survivors and go after them one by one (I like it when I get this one against me).\n\nNow the cons:\nThe game does seem to need a bit more polishing, it doesn't seem to optimized but , while I can run Outlast on maximum settings, I have to leave this game on medium to get 30+ fps which is weird.\nAlso, I hope they will keep adding monsters (some slenderman-type would be fun or perhaps one that can mimic the form of a survivor to deceive them etc.).\nLater, some additional maps would be nice.\n\nAt the moment I can recommend the game if you like horror, want to try something new (I haven't experienced this kind of online scary coop fun before) and if your machine can handle it. If your answer is no to either of these, perhaps you should wait a bit. As far as I know, this game has been on for a while but only gotten to Steam recently, I hope it will make it more popular and they can keep on improving the game from the income.\n\nTL;DR: The game is fun, new, scary but not really optimized.","October 23, 2014","true","6.8"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

The only downside is the size of the tools you need to find (batteries and keys) that are easily missed if you don't look VERY carefully, as well as having no on-screen indicators of how much battery you've got left etc. But i think it was inteneded to make it more "realistic" and the amount of screams we've all shared proves that. Great game if you're looking for something similar to amnesia co-op where one of you gets to be the monster ;)\n\n9/10 could use minor improvements in the future.","October 30, 2014","true","26.5"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Totterson/recommended/251170/","Totterson","Totty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Totterson/","101 products in account","E: This review was written a day before the July 28th update.\n\nHello~ as of this review, I've clocked 62 hours on Damned.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving this game a thumbs down will become apparent quite quick.\n\nI'm not going to give overviews, so I apologize in advance if anything sounds off to someone who knows nothing about the game just yet. Simply put, despite how much fun I have with the game, a lot of my friends DON'T have fun, and I'm going to list all of the problems here.\n\n1. The insanity system is bogus. E: This has been fixed as of July 28th, about two days after I wrote this review.\n\nSeriously. Having so many bad effects happen throughout the game is annoying, and un-needed unless you happen to be playing against Mary (because she moves slow enough to warrant them). Late in a game, survivors see things that aren't there, but still physically affect them, turning them blind, slowing them down, or making them deaf; often all at once. This seriously needs to become an optional thing, but for now, it's extremely crippling to any survivors that manage to last long enough against monsters to begin with.\n\n2. Mary's teleporting is bogus. - E: Still a problem, unfortunately.\n\nTonight I've had a game where Mary's teleported into the same general area 5 times, sometimes right next to where she was previously, successfully edging survivors closer to their spawn point with no way to progress. This speaks for herself: Mary's teleportation mechanism is NOT random, but is more biased to teleporting into the same room despite how big a map is, and needs a system countermeasure.\n\n3. Phantom's camping is bogus. E: Still a problem, unfortunately.\n\nThis one speaks for itself. Phantom needs a penalty for staying in one place (sometimes to camp a corpse or deliberately trap survivors) for too long. Otherwise, he's fine. Applies to a lesser extent to the Lurker as well.\n\nThose are the three big issues that my friends tend to have with this game. Personally, I've beat the odds and have continued playing despite these major flaws, and can still manage to have fun in the game to this day. And these problems don't even touch the plethora of other problems, such as...\n\n- Frequent client crashes\n- Host disconnecting from a game crashes the game\n- Connection issues cause duplicates of corpses to walk continuously into walls\n- Maps such as the factory spawning unwinnable for the survivors due to key placement\n- Lack of care / content / fixes from the developers (E: As of 1/30/16, it appears as if they've deleted their community forum)\n\nSo with that being said, I definitely cannot recommend this game, since it's nowhere close to being worth its full $20 pricetag. Know that if you do end up buying this game, whether it's for the full price or on a sale, that you'll be paying lazy developers that are more talk and less action. If you can somehow see past that and can see a glimmer of fun trapped deep within the potential that is Damned, then I shall see you there.\n\nOh, and don't forget. The monsters can kill you in one hit. But I don't have a problem with that. I just want to actually SEE the monster kill me instead of getting blinded before the climax. What kind of a climax is that?\n\nE: Having the ability for people to change their usernames was a bad addition, so I'm not going to be changing the recommendation of my review. The game's files are predominately client-sided and can be edited by hackers. Now the hackers in the game can change their names, and we'll never know who we're playing against anymore, so thanks a lot 9heads.","July 26, 2015","false","258.6"," 32 of 55 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","32","55","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LilWhyWhy/recommended/251170/","LilWhyWhy","Whyme (bro)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LilWhyWhy/","271 products in account","Damned has the potential to be a good game. Unfortunately there are some...damning...problems...heh..heh...Okay I'll get serious.\n\nDamned is a 5 player COOP game. 4 players versus 1 monster. The player's goal is to escape, while the monster's goal is to kill them. The players goal consists of running around the map looking for keys to unlock doors until you get the required items to leave through the escape(A hammar or a crowbar, and the Silver Key). The monster has to kill all the survivors before they escape. Sounds easy right? Well currently there are 3 monsters, and they are pretty balanced in my opinion. Of course, you can be a ♥♥♥♥ and just kill everyone off the bat on certain maps, if you know what you're doing, but that's no fun. It's way better to play it smart and try to scare the players rather than just kill them. And holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game scary. I didn't think a multiplayer game could be scary but I was wrong. The way the monsters are designed and the atmosphere of the levels make this a very tense experiance.\n\nSounds good right? Unfortunatly the game is buggy. It was an Early access title, but for some reason they decided it was ready for full release.\n\nThe game runs at 25-60 FPS on my rig(Specs below), up and down constantly depending on where I am and what I'm looking at. It can be very distracting and take me out of the game. Sometimes the game will just lock to 30FPS and you have to restart your computer to fix it. No idea why, devolopers haven't explained it, they just gave the solution.\n\nI host most of the games with my friends because I have the better connection(105Megabit down, 20Megabit up), but that doesn't stop the game from lagging. Normally in other games when someone hosts something they don't lag locally, but the people connecting to him will. Not in this game, everybody feels it, sometimes the game will just freeze for no reason. This game runs off of 9Heads servers(They are located in Brazil), meaning you have to create an account, and log in from within the game. That means whenever something happens to their servers, you can't play the game.\n\nNow, the most damning problem my friends and I run into when trying to run this game happens before the game even starts. We all get in a lobby, select our favorite characters, select a map, start it up. Host loads in just fine, waiting for other players. The other players get to the screen that says "Waiting for the host to start the game" only...they haven't really loaded...they're still loading(At least I hope that's what's going on), but for some reason they show that screen and their game is frozen. They can't do anything until it finally loads. Loading times can be anywhere from 10 seconds to 5 minutes. We're so used to this that we routinely ask if anyone is frozen when we start the game. "I'm good" "I'm good" "Frozen..." "Alright let's wait..." When the player can finally press TAB and see the player list, they've loaded in and we can start playing.\n\nThe devolopers are kind of active on the forum. They try to help people with problems but they aren't permenant solutions, problems always come back. They say they're working on an update, but don't have an ETA on when. Only "This year". At the time of writing this review(2/19/2015) we haven't gotten an update since November 5th, 2014. And the only planned update for 2015 is a "new monster" Nothing else. The devolopers are not native english speakers and are few in numbers. I feel as if game devolopment is a side project to their real life activities, there is no other excuse to the few comments and updates.\n\nIf you're intersted in purchasing this game, I reccomend you have good patience, and a good group of friends. Their isn't a lot of people playing this, during sales the player count may jump but it always dies out. It's scary, it's fun, but there are just too many problems getting in the way to reccomend this to anyone.\n\nGPU: EVGA GTX 670 2GB\nCPU: Intel i5 2400 3.1-3.4GHz\nRAM: 8GB","February 19, 2015","false","119.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

While this isn't perfect, it IS made by a small team, and they have done an amazing job at creating that suspenseful, horror feeling.\n\nThe first time I played, It was in alpha, I spawned inside of a bathroom, walked over to the door, only to have a gas heater make a bang and start hissing as it spewed out gas, scaring the living daylights out of me, and that was only 15 seconds into the match.\n\nI tried to open the door, but it was locked, so I figured i'd look for a key.\nI heard this very strange eerie noise, which I later discovered was the noise of the monster when it was nearby in it's ethereal form, it gave me chills, and I had nowhere to hide but some toilet cubicals....which...having watched The Relic...I did not want to go into the toilet cubicals at all, as it pretty much means death.\n\nSo I ran into a toilet cubical anyway....hid for a moment by shutting the door, and all was ok, so came back out, looked for the key to the other bathroom door, but there was that noise again, that spine chilling, hair raising noise, which I thought might be the noise of the monster being nearby, so I quickly ran back into the cubical, hastily shutting the door, and standing dead still.\n\nI then hear this wierd "boom" noise, like a subtle bass drop, thinking that maybe it is just ambient noise. I hope in my mind that if I turn around, there won't be a monster, so I turn around inside of the cubical.....and there it is, towering over me, staring at me with it's angry, evil, googly eyes, scaring the living ♥♥♥♥ out of me, and causing me to scramble to try and open the door in terror. Thankfully, before he could do anything, he disappeared back into his ethereal form...but after that, I had to quit, I had a near heart attack.\n\nIt is very rare for a horror game to give me that kind of suspence. The culmination of almost dead silent ambient music and sound, with dusty atmospheric environments, lit only by subtle lighting, or narrow lighting of the player's torch, along with sound cue's to let you know when the monster is nearby, as well as objects that do something sudden, to both scare you, but let the monster know where you are (it can't see you in ethereal form)....is just downright creepy, and I like this very much.\n\nAnd THAT is just when you play as a human!\n\nWhen you play as a monster, you can have so much fun, toying with the little humans, messing with their minds, trying to catch them out, trap them and kill them, or just pop up in a toilet cubical behind them while they hide, then suddenly disappear again :P\nThe variety of monsters to choose from, may be limited, but it does change the gameplay dynamics, making it interesting and unpredictable for everyone.\nThe environments are also very well done, large enough to get lost in, but well designed in every aspect, from textures and details, to the actual layout and interactivity of the environment.\n\nIt costs me nearly $20 for lunch in a day, and that lasts me maybe 15mins. $20 for a game that has given me hours of enjoyment (if you like pooping yourself) isn't really that much at all.\nIt pains me to see that gamers expect $20 games to be AAA quality with billion dollar budgets with an army of developers. I would gladly pay twice the amount, or even 3 times the amount for this game....in fact, I have, I bought my friends some copies too, because it's so damn awesome.\n\nBuy it, you won't regret it!","October 6, 2014","true","10.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

Two of us crashed trying to change the options, and I even crashed myself just trying to register an account so I could play the game. After we got ingame, it became quickly apparent that this game was made purely for youtube "Let's Players." In terms of gameplay, the controls are very simplistic. You move around, use objects with left click, and right click activates your flashlight. The map design tries its hardest to be scary, though its ruined by the objects that are left lying about (i.e. the jack-o-lanterns). Character design looks mediocre and the movement looks very stiff. As per usual in all of these types of games, you can only sprint for 3-5 seconds, and the battery in your flashlight is limited. This forces players to try to progress through the map to try and even see anything. This leads to the next problem: The maps are incredibly confusing. You basically wander around aimlessly grabbing keys or objects hidden in sometimes VERY difficult to find locations. Most of the time these keys only open up 1 or 2 of the ~10-20 locked doors throughout the map. Your ultimate goal is to try and escape, but I don't see how thats really possible given the nature of the game.\n\nThat brings me to my next point, which is the fact that the entire game hinges on the monster. The monster has the ability to kill pretty much any player at any time if he feels like it. You will almost NEVER win a game unless the monster lets you. Mary for example, can teleport around the map and moves very slowly until players get near her. When they are near her, she charges up and can then dash at incredible speed and instantly kill players. As the phantom, he can only "see" noise. The thing is, everything makes noise except for standing still, which leads to players just freezing up and the phantom wandering around aimlessly and occasionally accidentally killing someone. The lurker places down traps that make noise when players get near them, and then spawns himself nearby for 15 seconds. Players do have a chance to escape the lurker, though this again depends on the monster being merciful. Nothing is stopping him for respawning himself almost immediately after he disappears and chasing you down until he inevitably kills you.\n\nThe game has promise, but its ruined by the fact that its poorly optimized and the gameplay is ruined in many aspects. The game crashes a LOT, and you get pitiful framerates no matter what your system specs are. The actual gameplay boils down to wandering around aimlessly finding keys and hoping to god that it actually opens up the ONE door you need to progress through the map.\n\nCan this game be fun? Sure. Can you actually win as a survivor? Sure. Can this game be scary? Sure. The odds of any of those things happening though are very slim.","December 19, 2014","false","1.6"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","24","41","0","6"

Seemed creepy B.) Let me play as a monster C.) Was on sale.\n\nI'm glad I did, because Damned, low budget that it surely is, is pretty much what I'd want in a multiplayer horror game. The environments are creepy, the monsters all play quite different and it's pretty easy to get spooked as one of the survivors. This is also one of those games that I think is best played with friends.\n\nCurrently there are ten maps, all variations on scary locales. A few asylums, a couple of hotels, a warehouse, some sort of factory, and a restaurant(of all things). Survivor's currently have 4 characters to choose from, but really it's just an aesthetic choice. Monsters have 3 character's to choose from:\nThe blind Phantom.\nThe phasing Lurker.\nSobbing Mary(my personal favorite).The Phantom can only see players if they make noise or it gets close enough to them, the Lurker phases in and out of reality, only able to track players by setting traps, and Mary must slowly approach while being teleported randomly, until she can let out a scream and sprint right upon her victims.\n\nHaving said all of that, I do have a few issues with it:\n\nPlaying as the survivor is much more challenging than playing as one of the monsters, to such a degree that picking any of the monster choices seems like a guaranteed win. The map variety also seems a little lacking. The largest issue however is will crash a little too often for my taste or require you to CTRL+ALT+DLT and end process.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's worth what it's currently priced and good solid fun.","November 2, 2014","true","14.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Is not even Beta. It's hardly meant to be playable, but it most certainly is.\n\nNow then; After hours on hours in this, I can only say it's absolutely fantastic for an alpha-stage game. Crashes will happen, but it is to be expected. Counting in the voice chat and scary levels, and an absolutely terrifying monster (Lurker - Phantom's hardly scary, more like annoying.), this is bound to have you both screaming and laughing. No promises, of course. You kind of have to like being scared and maybe be easy to scare to enjoy this fully.\n\nThe more and more of your friends dieing around you only intensifies the experience, if you're not one of the few to die first. Knowing -you- are the primary target of the monster is enough to have you go ";_; Halp" and hide in a wardrobe. Which, I might add, is perfectly possible. You can hide in wardrobes. But I'd recommend hiding in a proper room with an inward door, so you can push back against it. Outgoing doors, like those on wardrobes, are bound to get you killed.\n\nAnyway; This game is awesome. The devs are working on it constantly. The community is 'okay'. Worth more than what it sells for, even as Alpha. The only things negative about this game is trivial things that are there only because of the stage of the game. These issues are bound to get fixed. So that leaves only the good parts to go \o/ The amount of fun this gives is endless.","March 2, 2014","true","81.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xafron/recommended/251170/","Xafron","Xafron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xafron/","682 products in account","Damned is a 5 player horror game.  There are two playable roles in the game: the humans, and the monster.  It's a pretty great idea they have here.  As humans, you have to try and escape.  There's 4 different humans you can choose to play as, but it doesn't really matter which you choose.  You start with nothing but a flashlight and need to search for batteries, as well as keys and other things that can help you escape the monster.  Navigate the very dark buildings and try to get out quickly, because eventually you start to see and hear things in game and when you run out of batteries it's a lot harder.  As the monster, your goal is to kill all the humans.  There are currently 3 available monsters to play as: Bloody Mary, the Lurker, and the Phantom.  Each one has some advantages as well as some handicaps and they each play very differently.\n\nI will get the negatives out of the way.  This game has some pretty bad bugs that hopefully will be fixed soon.\n- You can lose connection to the match for no reason (at least on your end).\n- The lobby might not recognize you have joined, and won't include you in the game when it is started.  You may have to back out and rejoin a few times, or have the host restart the lobby, for it to work.\n- Sometimes the game won't allow you to choose which human/monster you want to play, even though the lobby allows you to choose.\n- Every once in awhile the main menu from the start of the game, will pop up over the game while you are playing.  You can still play while it's up, but you can't exit it and after that happens when you talk in chat your name won't show up.\n-When you are killed, sometimes your corpse will still be standing.  Sometimes it will even walk into walls and will still let you spectate it.\n\nThese bugs are very annoying, but the game is still incredibly fun.  Get a group of friends and hop in.  Some will say it's a very scary game, some will say it isn't at all.  What is and isn't scary is very subjective really and will differ for everyone.  For me personally, it has had some pretty scary moments but a lot of the time it just gets really tense.  If you're playing with friends you can have some really hilarious moments too.  The idea of this game is pretty genius and it is definitely worth picking up, though if you can get it on sale that'd be good.","November 3, 2014","true","12.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","3"

The developers have not yet abandoned the project, but they are a small, inexperienced team. This may be better as a sale purchase if you're uncertain.\n- There are a high amount of technical issues in the current build. Many players report unplayable, slideshow framerates no matter how powerful their rig, though this sometimes randomly resolves itself through reinstallation or other fiddling. There are also occasional crashes that can ruin a match. I've only had one so far after several hours of play, but it's still frustrating. Thankfully, host migration is fairly seamless.\n- The playerbase is fairly small at the moment. While it's possible to fill up a lobby with random players, and there are generally a small handful of public servers running at any given time, you're much better off having a consistent group of friends to play this with.\n\nWith all that said, I'm having a ton of fun with this game and it just comes down to the great idea and clever design behind it. The levels are all creepy, dark abandoned buildings like hospitals, asylums (lots of asylums), hotels, a factory, etc. The monsters themselves all have unique mechanics that require patience and vigilance from both the human and monster players. They're all deadly and can take out a survivor in a single blow, but have some sort of limitation on when they can attack, or how they move, or even how they see. It means that even as players become more experienced, the battle of wits and "does he know that I know that he knows..." mindgames make for exciting matches. Despite the competitive nature of the game, there isn't a big emphasis on the competition and it's more about having fun. The monster player has to be very very patient, naturally keeping twitchy, aggressive players out of the game.\n\nThe simple requirement for the survivors to explore and find keys keeps things active and prevents extended campfests, though it can be rather difficult to coordinate an escape in a public game with all the different players grabbing different keys and not communicating about what they're unlocking. But it almost doesn't matter, because even with random strangers the tension and buildup and panic make things exciting and fun, and creates one of the most friendly communities I've encountered in a PvP game so far, mostly devoid of the usual rudeness you might expect. A shame there only tend to be a few servers at a time, because managing to keep a full lobby going from beginning to end of a match makes for a great time even with strangers who don't speak your language.\n\nI really hope the devs continue to add to this product, as the groundwork here is already a lot of fun and there are a lot of great ideas on display. I also wish this game would have caught on a little more, because the idea of a competitive game with emphasis on wits and evasion and awareness rather than just fighting each other is a sadly untapped niche for the most part that could do with more love. Even as someone who generally hates PvP games, I'm a big fan and want more.","September 23, 2015","true","15.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

This game was released majorly unfinished, and is still very clearly meant to be in a testing phase. Frequent crashes, a command prompt opened up upon play, and frequent glitches plague this game.\nTWO: Do not let one fool you either, by no means is this a bad game, and has a pretty excellent concept behind it with a fair enough execution.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, the largest two issues with this game are this:\n-Lack of lots of testing and polishing that allow this game to truly shine.\n-Lack of content to add variation, such as a larger list of monsters to truly vary up the gamplay.\n\nThis game is very rough as it is, and could certainly do with some well-needed polish, which, thankfully, the devs are providing. However, I feel the most necessary implementation (after polish, of course) would be Steam Workshop support, allowing the devs to iron out kinks while the community works to try and make some monsters, levels, and even seperate game modes themselves.\n\nHowever, I still enjoy the game, and I feel that anyone with enough friends willing to play it (three at the very least, don't play public games) would find amount of enjoyment in this clever little horror game.","November 29, 2014","true","53.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

I had recommended this game in person when in early access however since it is now a "complete game" I cannot reccomend it.\n\nThe game is still unpolished and is missing a lot, updates will only come out every 6 months as the devs feel they have completed this game, also they are talking about making a Damned 2 so literally just hold out for if that ever happens.\n\nAside from that, yes the game can be fun if you have a monster who likes to scare people instead of be boring and just kill you, as with all games there are players who have played it so much that they have being a survivor down to a science, and some people who are so good at killing as a monster that it makes the game not fun sometimes.","February 21","false","44.7"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","16","27","2","2"

(I apologize to the people who rated my older review. I'm not sure if it will reset those votes or not.)\n\nThis game is, put simply, fun. It's unpolished, it isn't pretty, and it's a delicate little thing prone to crashing. Not your everyday "ctrl+shift+esc" type crashes, I'm talking like the Hindenburg or Titanic.\n\nBut when it works, it works. Sure the monsters have strategies for avoiding, and baiting. And sure there's more or less surefire ways to avoid death (Door battles with the Lurker / Mary anyone?) But it feels a little like you're under fire. "Just remember your training and you'll be fine."\n\nExcept you won't. The Phantom will find you, the Lurker will trap you, and Mary will run you down. Your flashlight will betray you giving away your position, your sense of direction will be tested in pitch darkness, and you'll grow to hate toilets.\n\n10/10 would die again.\n\n\n**ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW**\n(I would also like to point out, I bought this game about midnight-ish my time in Eastern USA, and was trying to play it pretty late at night. There were about 10 lobbies and they were mostly overseas, which could maybe explain why the game was running so poorly. Anyway, I'm glad I gave it a second chance, the server list is very populated around more reasonable hours and the connections are noticably better.)\n\n1 out of 8 attempts succeeded in getting the game to work. ONE.\n\nFirst one, died early, had to spectate a box.\nSecond through sixth attempts all crashed at various points. Usually while joining a game.\nSeventh attempt worked properly. I played as Mary, got a kill, but spent a little too long figuring out the controls and they escaped.\nEighth attempt, crashed.\n\nHad I bought this from Gamestop, I would have already been on my way back to the store to return it.","October 29, 2014","true","25.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I was introduced to this game through a good friend, and he convinced me to purchase it. I can't begin to explain how much fun and enjoyment this game can bring when playing with a group of friends. If you ever decide to get Damned, please I encourage you to play it with friends.There really are not many Multiplayer Survival Horror games out there in todays market, but I feel like this game proves that it can be done. This game is no where near perfect, a few bugs here and there but nothing that absolutely kills the game. Some that maybe frustrating from time to time? Yes, but nothing that keeps the game from being fun with friends. Maybe it is personal preference playing it with friends, but I don't find as much enjoyment playing it online with other people. It makes it personal.

The gameplay does get repetitive, and eventually you get tired with the constant issue of starting a game, only to have 1 or 2 people disconnect and not be able to join back.\n\nThe game is fun if you have 4-5 friends to play with. When I say friends, I mean friends you can talk to and communicate with. My friends and I would have the humans all in a group call and then the monster on their own. This made the game pretty damn fun, as we could communicate.\n\nThe gameplay gets pretty boring after 9-10 hours of playing. You basically run around looking for keys while avoiding the monster. Each monster has different abilities, meaning you have to change your strategy slightly depending on the type of monster. Currently, there are only 3 monsters.\n\nThe Lurker - The Lurker has a physical and nonphysical form. In its non-physical form, it cannot see players and players cannot see it, but it can place traps. Traps make a loud noise, notifying The Lurker where the humans are. The Lurker can then transform into physical form (if it has enough charged up) and try and kill them.\n\nMary - Mary moves very very slow, and Mary can see humans and humans can see Mary. Mary has the ability to teleport when charged up (also randomly teleporting if you do not for a long time). Mary also slowly gains "Frenzy". Frenzy mode allows Mary to run faster than survivors and kill them. To charge Frenzy, you have to get close to a survivor. The closer you are, the faster it charges up.\n\nThe Phantom - This one is personally my least favorite. The survivors can see the Phantom at all times, but the Phantom cannot see the humans unless they make a noise. If a survivor begins sprinting, the Phantom will hear loud music and that survivor will be able to be seen through walls. You also can't turn your flashlight on and off when the Phantom is around. Basically, the closer you get to the Phantom, the less sound you have to make, by crouching or walking.\n\n\nLike I said, the gameplay is fun with friends, but over time it loses its luster and becomes very repetitive. I bought it with 4 other friends when it was only $5, and it was definitly worth it. Rarely we got to do 5 player, but 4 player is still really fun.\n\nIf you can manage to find 3 or 4 friends to play it with, get it on sale. The bugs are pretty irritating, mostly the main menu bugs that require me to verify the integrity of game cache every 30 minutes. But the bugs are also tolerable because the gameplay has its ups for a decent amount of play time.","January 18, 2015","true","13.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

After you get over the initial scares there isn't a huge amount to keep you coming back.  I don't mind the graphics and I can handle the dark levels.  When I first played the game opening the doors while a beast was chasing me led to semi squirts of urine pumping down my trouser legs but after a few games it just becomes frustrating rather than terrifying.  I find that the monsters are overpowered and tend to camp dead  bodies (which is the only place you will find certain keys).  The levels are not large enough to really run away or hide in, making it easy for the overpowered monster to find you.  Maybe if they release a sequel it could be good but this game in its current format needs work.","January 1, 2015","false","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumflargin/recommended/251170/","kumflargin","kumflargin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumflargin/","205 products in account","This game is a great game to play with friends.  It is very fun being a monster, moreso when you mess with the survivors rather than trying to kill them every chance you get.  Playing as a survivor will get your heart racing and wake your roomates.  The ambiance adds a serious chill to the air as you desperately look for items to aid in the escape, all the while being on your toes looking out for the monster.  Swinging your mouse to open doors and cabinets like the Penumbra games gives you more control, and more chances to make mistakes trying to slam doors on chasing monsters.  Sounds like a game to give a whirl right?\n\n\nNot so fast.\n\n\nYou might want to rethink that purchase.  This game is absolutely loaded with problems, mainly with nuances in the design and the framework of the game itself.  Right off the bat, this game is written in Python, meaning you will have to install Python first, however Damned will install Python for you.  After installation you may have to restart your computer to fix any initial problems you run into.  Restarting a machine to get a video game to work is unacceptable in this day and age.  This game is not optimized very well.  High shadows, lighting, or AA will tax some machines more than it should with unremarkable differences in the quality of the graphics.  Connection issues can be spontaneous, and freezing can at some times be common.  This game has moods.  One day it will work relatively fine, the next it won't.  Hope you like verifying your game files, because you will be doing that a lot with this game, and you will almost always find at least one file missing.  Even after reacquiring that missing file your game may still not work properly.  It's not uncommon to spend more time than should be necessary just to get everyone to join the game proper.\n\nThis game has horrible balancing issues.  The monsters are quite powerful, with some maps making it just downright impossible to win as survivors.  There are no limits to setting traps as the monsters, and there are loads of things that can be trapped.  Many maps have narrow corridors with overhanging lights that can be trapped and impossible to avoid.  Survivors also have no way of knowing what is trapped without springing it.  In order for the survivors to win, they must find the silver key, hammer/crowbar, and the actual escape door, all while avoiding the monster.  The key and tools however are usually behind some locked door which requires some other key to open.  Of course there is no indication of what keys open what, with some levels having many locked doors and you will find yourself running back and forth looking in every nook and cranny for every key you can find and testing them on many doors until you can open one.  Insanity, the condition set upon survivors as the game drags on, is designed to keep survivors moving, but uses cheap jump scares and annoying hands to do the job.  Also darkens the screen or flickers the flashlight sometimes which is actually nice.  The maps are dreary, abandoned, gritty, dark places, a staple of horror.  But they can also be confusing and tedious, especially when trying to find that one key to open that one door.  Of the 11 maps, 3 are in an asylum.  Sometimes items may glitch out and cant be picked up, or cabinet doors that's shouldn't be locked won't open.  There are also jack-o-lanterns all over the place.  Is this a halloween or horror game?\n\n\nEven after all this, I would still recommend the game if not for one thing:  The asking price.  $20 USD is highway robbery for a game in as bad a state as this.  Maybe the developers believe they put in effort worthy of selling for $20.  I don't see it.\n\n\nBuy this game?  No.  Sit on it.","December 20, 2014","false","89.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are bugs with it and it rarely gets updated which is frustrating but I've met many people through this game, one of them is my best friend now.

Moving the camera with the mouse was unbearably laggy and, without any better words to describe it, 'twitchy'. This would lead to deaths and getting stuck in spectator mode, which in turn bugged out only allowing watching the game from the death camera of another player.\n\nFrom what I understand it's basically an item-finding game, where you walk around a map looking for very small items that you can use to progress to the end of the level. Even without the monster to harrass you all the time, it's very hard, tedious and sadly also very boring. The premise wears out very quick, as it's basically just another Slender clone with new monsters and a multiplayer mode built on top.\n\nIn the small amount of time I played the game I got it to crash 6 times, mostly when joining a server and getting stuck in the "Waiting for host to start the game" screen.\n\nI can't see anyone paying 20€ (or actually paying any sort of money) for this in its current state, so if you're interested, get it now while it's on Humble Bundle for the average price of the pack.

Every single time I boot the game up I have to restart the entire game (exit the game completely) at least 3-4 times.  Half the time when i go to log it, it says that I can't log in because my account is in use by someone else.  Eventually I could log in, but the problems don't end there.\nI tried joining his game, but half the time just joining his game it was broken to where I joined his lobby, but neither of us were actually there and we couldn't start it.  That requires me restarting 3 or 4 times.\n-I first tried playing as the phantom with my friend on a one on one match.  Eventually after floating around for half an hour I asked him if he could see where I was, because the survivors should be able to see the phantom, but not the other way around.  I lined his sight up so he would be able to see me, but in his game I was not present. (I would know, I'm sitting right next to him)\n-From what I could tell the lurker seemed to be fine from my experience.\n-Mary, oh mary, where do I even start?\n--I played Mary and I literally could not play her.\n--The first game I played i was trapped in a room, so I teleported out, normal right?  Well then I tried to teleport out again and it never let me teleport again that game.  I was literally stuck in that small room with no escape.\n--Eventually we started up a new game and I did the same thing, except I teleported into a larger room the second game.  I was walking around for half an hour while my friend walked around the map figuring it out.  Eventaully he said he just got scared because he saw me...except I never left the main room I was stuck in..  I looked over at his screen and my character was moonwalking in his room and then randomly teleported out.  So I asked him if he could walk into the room where i was stuck.  Apparently that room that I was stuck in was one he had also been walking around for 20 minutes as well.  He literally could not see me, and i could not see him (I'm still playing as mary at this point), and all the doors that were open for him, were still closed for me, which is why I never knew he was there.\n--We booted it back up (after me restarting three or four times) and i tried Mary one more time.  Except this time I did nothing.  I did not move from the starting location from where I spawned in on the map as Mary.  I then went to his screen and watched him, hoping to help him find my room to simply see if I was there.  But not only did he not find me, a random mary once again was in his game and teleported right in front of him and was moonwalking.  Obviously this both freaked us out!  Except...I'm supposed to be Mary walking around....and my Mary never moved from her starting spot.  At that point I just turned the game off. (yes all of these games I am in his game/player list currently playing)\nAll in all this game is not worth the time most likely unless it is fixed in a major way.  This game is in now way worth 20 dollars especially in this state.  I'm dissapointed that I paid for this, as it was not a wise purchase from what I could tell.\nBuy this at your own risk, as it is broken beyond all belief atm.  If anyone has any help to give me, I'd love to hear it, as I would love for this game to work, but as of now, it's impossible for me to play.","February 26, 2015","false","11.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It was a buggy, unoptimized mess. It could barely be played despite the lack of graphics and...really, anything in the game. It would crash constantly on the simplest things.\n\nIt is now the summer of 2015, and on first loadup I found that not much has changed. Among the multiple bugs I encountered, one was that I couldn't reach my graphics panel without minimizing, then shrinking the window. The moust simply would not move over on the window, it became locked in place. Then when I clicked on the graphics options, the game crashed.\n\nI reloaded the game. Crashed before it started.\n\nI reloaded the game again. It loaded! I started up a test game to see how it would run, and it finally runs well! So yay for optimization! Then I joined a real game and it crashed on startup.\n\n2/10 due to unplayability. If I could actually play it it would easily be an 8/10.

It has a brilliant premise, and is very creepy with it's stalking monsters and malicious spirits. But it has several catastrophic problems that render it next to unplayable. It is incredibly laggy (and not to do with my connection, which is ultra-fast on all other things I do) and suffers from FPS stuttering to quite a bad degree. Sometimes when survivors die a copy of them stays around, walking endlessly on the air until they are killed as well, leaving two corpses. It has other weird, glitchy bugs like this and I find it difficult to want to play combined with the lag and framerate crawl. It needs a lot of work, to clean up the bugs and made it a smoother game. I wouldn't recommend it until those bugs are ironed out and the game runs smoothly.

The player will get a message 'The servers are down/disconnected' Or the player might get stuck in a lobby, unable to join a game or accept invites.\n\nIn-game there are not that many bugs i have encountered myself, although there is the odd random floating pumpkin here and odd floating non interactable keys there [Since the games objective is to gather keys this may or may not have an affect on the experience]. The game is currently quite stable.\n\nThe game is labeled as a 'Horror'. And it isn't that bad of a one. I can compare the game slightly to that of Slender Man, only it being 5 player online and you don't collect pages you collect keys. With three monsters to choose from and an interacial gang of meddling kids that need to escape from a spooky house or forest before Jim can 'Fix-em'. The game is quite promising.\n\nAlthough the game doesn't quite have that real 'I just ♥♥♥♥ my pants' feel, it will give you quite a few jumps scares and a mild heart attack every now and then. [Well... Unless it's Mary, then you will probably need to go and change.]\n\nSo all in all it is quite a good Horror. And looks like it could develop into something quite good.\n\nIf i could rate this Half & Half i would, but i'm going to stick with the positive for now.","December 20, 2014","true","19.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","1"

I got 30 fps with a 770GTX, an I7 3770 CPU and 16Go of ram! And that's with VSync disabled. I'm forced to launch the game multiple times to play because the menu will fail randomly, either because it will freeze on the login screen, or because the mouse cursor won't move (or become invisible!

Bear in mind this is early access and a lot of things may change. The game is great, it has some flaws but thats ok. Currently there are 3 monsters to play as. They all work differrent and can take some time to figure out, but I like it that way. Every game you have to adapt your play style to the map and monster. Each map has keys and other items scattered around. They spawn in different rooms each time so people can't memorize where they are each game. Playing as a survivor is exactly the same for each character, you have a flash light, you can opne doors (which is way more challenging than you'd expect) and pick up items. Items do different things so be sure to memorize which do what. The gameplay always varies and no game feels quite the same. There are a few bugs, but that'll get fixed. All around the maps are fun and challenging, the gameplay is scary, fun and working. This game is much better with friends toshare your screams and laughs.

To my surprise, little to nothing in this game is fixed, and in fact seems worse than before. 9 times out of 10, you can't just join a game. Instead, you'll crash and burn! Over and over again! The login system is still as useless as ever, and is just a waste of time. Useless DRM.\n\nLike I mentioned in my last review, unbalanced monster mechanics, locked to 30fps. Although, they recently fixed the frame-drops and general terribleness so that's a plus. Still not worth the $15 price tag. Get it on sale or don't get it at all and save yourself the frusturation of restarting the game constantly (and I mean constantly).\n\nThis game being Early Access STILL does not let it get away with being near unplayable and broken. They've had almost a year to fix these issues, but instead of fix things they add more 'features' onto the game.\n\nSide-Note: Even if you don't crash, your friends sure can! Which means you have to restart the entire lobby just to play, and sometimes the entire game. It's better to just restart your game after every round.\n\nThat's not to say this game doesn't have potential, it really does, but in its current form its awful. Steam really needs more quality control.\n\nEDIT: As of right now, apparently boards only go away for some people. So some people can't finish the game but others can walk through them.

I read a handful of reviews because I don't understand the fun part of this game.\n\nThe level design is not bad and the game has potential but the gameplay is horrible IMO.  I like the part where the monster can set up traps so he knows where the survivors are and the limited time interval to manifest as a physical being but the "monsters" doesn't look scary at all to me :/ maybe due to the stiff animations. It would be great to upgrade them with better animations which include  custom usable scare animations only to scare the hell out of the players :)\n\nThe objectives for the survivors could be more dynamic. At least where I played last time it was mostly to find keys so you can open doors which leads to the next area and this will be at the long run tiresome and boring for the survivors.\n\nAnother note that I almost forget to mention is that you need to create another account ingame to be able to play the game :P\n\nAll in all I think it is the best to watch some gameplay footage first before buying this game and I recommend to play this game with your friends for a better experience.","June 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If no, then stop right here. You don't need to read anymore. If yes, then the next question is: do you value their friendship? If no, then doh, you rebel, you. If yes, then my very last question is this: do you want to keep them?\n\nThis game is absolutely terrifying and clearly, is best played with strangers.\n\nNo, no. I kid... definitely play this game with your friends. Strangers might end up scaring you more. Beg for their mercy if they're playing as one of the four monsters. Beg them to spare you and leave you alone - "take the other person instead!". This is all you can do in Damned. Loyalties will be tested and friendships strained. Expect a few harsh words to come your way from someone whom you once cherised.\n\nCan you escape the hellish halls and paths that the cursed walk upon? With just a flashlight and a weak battery, are you strong enough to pervail and, ultimately, survive? If yes.... your adventure awaits...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPros+ Mary, oh Mary...\n+ Great game to play with both friends, strangers, and AI's\n+ Monsters have been updated (Mary is absolutely terrifying now)\n+ Simple horror game with one objective: escape the house. Very straightforward yet satisfyingly fun\n+ Sound effects and music play a very important role in this game: they serve to scare you witless\n+ Honestly one of the most fulfilling horror games that I have played in a very long time; true jump scares are in store for you....\n\nCons- Developer's are not as active as one would like them to be\n- Some elements are hard to interact with. Maybe it's just my game, but it's difficult to pick up items at times. Furthermore, it can be difficult to open things (very easy to just accidently close something you mean to open)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nDamned is definitely one of the best horror games that you could possibly ask for and play with friends. It is unique and refreshing, something that is hard to find within this genre. Your friendship will either strengthen or weaken with this game, so put it through the ultimate test. Can it survive a test from the damned?\n\nOverall7/10","December 25, 2014","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I say Scary, I mean it. One Jump scares, another paces around 'blindly', and the other Stalks you with traps. Not only is this game scary, but it is a blast to play with friends (So much Trolling and purposeful scares without wanting to kill them yet). To think that this game is in Beta, it makes me anticipate what more they could add to such an already great game. Personally, I love it, and I recommend it to everyone.

You have to register to play.  Gameplay is okay but not all that scary. Basically you run around trying to find keys while a monster hunts you. Being a monster requires a lot of stratagy. setting traps and timing your exposure. I thought being a monster would be more fun but it really is boring. some games can last over 45 minutes.

Sometimes this results in a crash and makes your game freeze and you have to use taskmanager to close it. restart... Now you probably want to fiddle with the graphical options as the game look and runs terrible. turning down the visual options helps getting the FPS from 8 to 25 easily...this game looks like it was made in unity like all the easy-to-make-horror-games of the last few years. However changing the graphical options makes the game hate you and freezes again, open task manager and close the game again.\n\nNow we get to join a room and this is where the fun begins. Because it's ALWAYS a gamble if you wil connect correctly. Sometimes the game joins a room but places you in a kind of limbo that shows no other players and doesn't allow you to start a game in any way, shape or form. the other kind is where it freezes upon start, open task manager bla bla bla...\n\nThis game has a good concept and is really fun when it works however before you even get it to work you're already half an hour further and that is just not acceptable nowaday.

You spend ages in an almost atmospherically devoid environment looking for keys and various other crap without a clear objective aside from 'escape (insert random room here).'\n\nThen comes the random ♥♥♥ ambience. You hear random things like what sounds like a hotel clerk bell and little bits of laughter for no reason.\nWith these immersion-disrupting sound bits tearing through your skull and the random screen darknening which is also jarring, you are very aware that you are playing a game. There is no mistaking it, the immersion leaves a lot to be desired.\nAlso, the enemies aren't particularly scary. If you see an enemy, you die silently. I tend to just run straight into the enemies because I feel 0 fear at all after the ambience has disrupted everything. The enemies are creepy-ish in their models alone because they arent particularly well done and it leaves a dirty-ish gross effect. Aside from that the game has pretty much nothing going for it.\nCool concept, poorly executed design, no immersion, not worth the 5 dollar sale.","December 19, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, Damned is an amazing game; the 10% of the time you can actually play it. But in it's current state it's simply unplayable.\n\n- The game crashes much more often than it doesn't. When you start a match it's VERY common for at least 2-3 of the 5 players to drop out because their game crashed. Judging by the fact the game is using 1,000,000k+ memory when I kill it, there's a memory leak somewhere.\n\n- Upon rebooting the game, there's a myriad of random glitches. The most notable is the broken login screen. Others include sound simply not working, and lobbies not forwarding you into matches.\n\nOutside of these glitches, there's a missing element to this game that's required for horror. There's almost no sound effects. Lurker lurches up to you and ravages you with his giant claws? COMPLETELY SILENT. There's spookity music playing, but you die without a sound. This is a huge problem with Mary, a little girl monster. If she stands near a survivor long enough she goes into a frenzy, and can completely wipe the whole party in seconds. You'd expect for there to be some sort of audio cue when she's nearby, you know to scare you, but nope. There's supposed to be a sobbing noise, but it's so faint(even with that audio maxed) that you can't realistically hear it.\n\nThe last problem I have with this game is that fact that monsters can cheese really hard if they know the map. Last night I witnessed a match where there was 1 survivor left, who had all the items he needed to escape out the final door. The enemy monster, the Phantom, was simply floating in front of the escape, slashing the air in front of the door. There was nothing the survivor could do. He had to open that door to win, and if he tried he would get killed.\n\nThe game has great potential, but until they fix their codebase you'll be fighting with the game's menus and glitches a lot more than playing the game.","December 22, 2014","false","4.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If the monster is playing to win, then the monster will win. EVERY. TIME. The monster has to 'play along' and try to actually scare the players, otherwise people will just drop dead and not understand why, as nothing is particularly clear and monsters will instantly kill you often before you even see them.\n\nThe maps have confusing layouts with no real logic tying them together with items strewn about in a random fashion, there are so many locked doors and rusty keys that it gets confusing very quickly.\n\nThe monster design is pretty horrible as well.\n\nMary just waits on a charge bar (that charges faster if the survivors look at you) then goes into frenzy and can instantly kill a player in a dash.\n\nThe Phantom can't see players unless they make sounds, except literally everything bar standing still makes sound, so basically it becomes a game of 'stand still and stare at the monster to survive', which can be easily abused and makes for a pretty idiotic mechanic\n\nThe Lurker is probably the only decently designed monster, as they place 'sound traps' where if a survivor trips it, both the survivor and the lurker knows it, the lurker then spawns in the area and looks for the survivor. However the lurker is on a 15 second timer giving survivors a chance to actually survive.\n\nFinally, the game is buggy and fairly unfinished, with crashes around every corner, mysterious performance drops with no relation to hardware, horrible netcode, and connection issues.\n\nBasically? DON'T BUY THIS GAME, IT ISNT EVEN WORTH 20 CENTS LET ALONE 20 DOLLARS.","December 19, 2014","false","1.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Works well with 5 friends, not so much with random people. Unless said random people all leave their mics open or join a teamspeak server and share in good laughs when they get freaked out by a monster appearing in front of them or tearing them to pieces.\n\nUltimately though, this game is lacking variety right now. It is an Alpha, so I will give it that. The gameplay is simple, find the keys or codes to unlock doors or safes to find more keys and codes. Eventually, you'll find a tool to pull wooden boards off of a door. After that door is unlocked you escape from the monster. There are a few maps so far, so it does get repetitive eventually. Withut any dynamic events happening, I don't think it will ever stop being repetitive. Anyways, there are only two monsters aka creatures. One of which is not as fun as the other.\n\nThere's the Phantom. Which is the not-so-fun monster. As the Phantom you float around as a half decayed torso imbued with some evil magic or something. You float around decently fast and are allowed to pass through closed doors. Which is the only thing scary about this monster. From only a few play attempts it was clear to me that it was pretty overpowered and did not provide that great of an experience, both for the monster player, nor the character players.\n\nThe second and so far final monster, the Lurker is a rather intimidating piece of work. Though when I think about it, I find that it also resembles the Phantom in a way as they share a common trait. They both can get through closed doors. The Lurker is a little more difficult to get through though. There are two phases to this monster. Your "ghost" phase, and your "flesh" phase. In the ghost phase you are unable to see or hear the players, but you're allowed to set traps. The traps range from pianos, to kitchen timers, to creaky boards. Unfortunately there are no visual traps like falling chairs, chandeliers, or candles that would blow out or anything like that. Then if you are near a trap you set that goes off, you click and change into your flesh form for a limited time. In this time you are to chase down and kill the player near you.\n\nFor the Alpha that it is. Damned is definitely entertaining. If you are a streamer, this is a good kind of game to play with friends while live. Especially if you're easily scared/really jumpy. But don't play it too much or you'll get bored!\n\nFor the Alpha that it is, I give it a 6.5/10.\nIt definitely needs some updates to add some more fun to it. More creatures, more maps, and hopefully eventually some more dynamism.\n\n- Codewow","May 20, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Although I would recommend having the option to play with friends to maximize the fun) Despite still being in the alpha phase and in early development and having some bugs and errors is the early access well worth it being what it is, a excellent horror multiplayer.\n\nThis game will haunt your human fears and bring you back for more and more even if it sometimes can possibly get repetitive when you are at that point when you know ALL the maps and monsters, but still the devs will most likely add more monsters and more maps and even possibly modding options over time to make it less repetitive and even more fun. If it wasn't for the minor bugs and (not so common) freezes/crashes and server crashes that need to be solved, I would have given it a 5/5 no doubt! But for being in alpha and being visually pleasing and auditory horrifying it is more than worth a buy especially when on sale as when I bought it! Buy if you have the money simply I consider it worth it!\n\n+ Scary as in you will scream a lot of the time.\n+ Fun as in it is a fun game to play simply.\n+ Great range of maps.\n+ Great monsters.\n+ Great atmosphere\n+ Visually pleasing and great sound design.\n+ Hosting private and public games.\n+ It's (really) hard to win as a survivor and I enjoy that.\n+ Mary. End of story.\n\n- BUGS etc.\n- Missing some HUD options that would have been useful. (Light battery indicator etc.)\n- IMO quite few monsters but as I said will most likely be added new ones with time\n- Could be fun to add more survivors and monsters in a game such as a game mode with 2v6/8 instead of 1v4 in a near future.\n- registering/login through their own servers and game. (Yet "+" for the devs, by highly decreasing piracy etc.)\n- Door mechanic when opening/closing can be quite frustrating.\n- Very small keys and batteries so you have to quite careful when searching.\n- Nothing more I would add as a minus at this point really...\n\n4/5!\n","November 3, 2014","true","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In its current state I feel it falls short of what it could be.  I first bought this game roughly a year ago, and I'm disappointed with the amount of work that has gone into it since then.  This game doesn't need *more* content, it needs *refinement* of the existing content. I sincerely hope the developers will consider making some of the following adjustments:\n\nCriticisms:\n1) Communication.  Typically, most players choose to have their character randomly assigned.  The unfortunate side effect is that you don't know who YOU are playing as (assuming you're a human). Trying to tell your fellow survivors where items are becomes very difficult when they cant match your voice to your character.  Simply adding a portrait of your character on screen somewhere would help greatly.\n\n2) Prolonged stalemates.  Most of the games I have played follow the same pattern, monster gets an early kill, eventually kills off a couple more, and then 3 players are stuck watching a stale mate of 1 monster vs 1 human for 20 minutes.  To exacerbate the problem, the dead players can't communicate with the living, which leaves both parties wondering if they should just give up for the sake of starting a new game.   I feel like some kind of mechanic needs to be implemented to bring the game to an end when it gets stalled in this way.  At the very least, players need to communicate how long they are willing to wait before abandoning the game.\n\n3) Limited flash light usage.  When I first read about this in patch notes, it sounded exciting and a way to make the game more suspenseful.  In reality, it seems to bring the game to a grinding halt for all parties.  As a human, when your battery dies you cease making progress, and end up walking in circles aimlessly.  As the monster, your prey becomes harder to find, and the game reaches another stalemate.\n\n4) Anti-climactic endings.  Regardless of which side wins, the game often ends with a yawn.  If a monster sneaks up and kills you from behind, you just fall over dead with out much idea of what happened to you.  If the survivors win, you just abruptly get notified that the game is over and are sent back to the lobby.  It would be nice if player deaths had a little more animation or violence added (it is a horror game after all), or if the survivors attempting to open the last door triggered some kind of global warning that would give the monster a brief moment of opportunity to get to the exit and stop them.\n\nI really hope the developers will address these issues, as I've been a huge advocate of this game to many of my friends and coworkers.","November 3, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are looking for a Co-op survival-horror game with decent graphics. cheap price for what you want, and countless hours of game-play? then this is for you.\nA run-down of the game : three monsters to choose from. about eight maps to play. When making a server, just hit host and boom. No port-forwarding, and no more wasting 20 minuets trying to download a program that automatically port-forwards. Great game-play physics. A monster can set sound traps, and appear right in front of you, which is great for scary gaming moments, great with the lights off.\nThe only downsides to this game are the kicking system, the host can kick you instantly. (Which is fare, but i don't like it, i think it should require a vote.) And the optimization. Game-play can sometime be laggy. Which is fine, you should get at least 60fps if you have a decent video card, processor, and RAM. you can also see the specification recommendations on Damed's store page.\nThanks for reading, overall, 9.4/10","November 11, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Insanity System is literally one of the most annoying and disappointing things I have ever seen for a game. I hate horror games, movies etc, but I love it when the scares derive from the PLAYERS in the game, like in this one! But just less than an hour ago the Insanity System has caused me to stop playing due to fear.\n\nI didn't even know this feature was in the game until earlier when I was hiding from a friend playing as Mary (who is TERRIFYING) and a CREEPY AS ♥♥♥♥ FACE FLASHED ONTO MY SCREEN and I think I pooped myself. Yes I get scared a bit easily but again, this had the potential to make me enjoy a horror game which I usually don't like as a genre. I play Depth, a game with sharks and the ocean, when I am terrified of BOTH, and I love it, because the scares are natural, balanced and fair.\n\nThe Insanity System saps all fun from the experience as the scares are no longer being produced from a balanced, real system. When someone is playing as the monster and you get scared, it's OK because you know they were simply using the game's features, which you understand and have the ability to counteract based on your knowledge of the monster.\n\nNow it's not ALL bad. Some of the features include strange noises/music playing, the lights flickering, and even your keyboard keys losing response. Despite the keys thingy, I think those ideas are alright as long as they create TENSION and not FEAR. The one feature of the Insanity System that RUINS the experience are the face jumpscares (I think it's the people who have died flash onto your screen?) that occur when you have been alive and hiding for a while.\n\nWhen a face flashes onto your screen, you have absolutely NO idea when, where or why it appears and it's not even controlled by the player as the monster. It's an unfair system that ruins the balance. The monster and humans have an equal environment to win. A face flashing onto your screen is random and unfair.\n\nOverall a very fun game but the Insanity System is making me fear playing it again in case it shows up again. If there was an option to remove it, I would love this a lot more. Would love if the faces got removed or turned into an option, considering how the devs have been aware of the dislike for this feature for about seven to eight months.","March 7, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Really.And it gets a lot scarier once your mates die. The fact that the monster isn't some dumb AI that you can habitually outplay makes it more scary than anything. You truly do not know what to expect.\n\n-Very fun with friends using Skype, TS or something similar. More on that later.\n\n-Very-very interesting, unique gameplay. This is the biggest point for me.\n\nThe bad:\n-Sometimes too scary. This wouldn't be a point if there weren't some group pressure on you to open that door behind which there MAY be a monster. In single player, you save or simply go out for a drink if you had too much. Here, there is no getting away from the fact that you HAVE to keep going, even when you feel like you just can't take it anymore\n\n-Much-much worse without voice communication. Apart from the practicality of not being able to scream : "OH ♥♥♥♥, TURN AROUND AND RUN!!!" You can easily get lost and separated from your buddies, and not being able to communicate fluently makes the game irritating instead of terrifying. Lack of communication really hurts your experience, and not having people to play with can be bad, because random people won't talk to you.\n\n-You're kinda not supposed to actually win as a survivor. The point is the promise of survival which you can actually google or find on youtube: is possible. But there is an invincible monster that 1shots you between you and victory and this turns the odds heavily in the monsters favour. So although you CAN win, I wouldn't count on it happening more often than 1 in a dozen games or so (I still haven't won). So while you are actually terrified, the one who gets the most 'fun' out of it is the monster.\n\n-Bugs, crashes everywhere. I have issues starting the game about every 3rd match.\n\n-THE DOORS!!! HOW HARD CAN IT BE to code them properly? They are a real struggle to operate. I wish they just abandoned the idea of making them drag-or-push based and instead just click on them to open, at least I could open and close them whenever I want to with security.\n\n-Some levels are just crap. Some of them are very-very simple where you progress from room to room, say, you need to find key 1 in room 1 so you can get to room 2, where you need to find key 2 to room 3....the problem with this is that the monster knows EXACTLY where you will be, and apart from juking him around the tables there is very little you can do. (As the monster: They will be in room 2. Just go there and kill them)\n\n-Mary is just unfair. You can play around the other two, and if you get killed you can find an error in your gameplay. With Mary, you die because she ported next to you. GG.\n\nThat's about all I could think of. And while I listed more bad points than good points, the good ones still weight more heavily than the bad ones.\n\nGet this game if:\n-It's on sale\n-If you have friends to play with\n-If you are a hardcore horror fan and can stand the pressure\n-If you are a lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and count on being the monster more often than not\n-If you have the nerves to grind out the neccessary game experience to win despite paralyzing terror.\n-If your name is Mary.\n\nOverall: great game, but not without buddies, and not so much if you are a ♥♥♥♥♥ like me. :(","March 10, 2015","true","38.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Was playing with several friends, and we were taking turns playing the monster.  I had a ton of fun tormenting my friends as Mary, a monster that is basically the little girl from The Ring.  I would see their flashlights shining around, and I would just try to stand somewhere just out of sight, so they'd turn the corner and see me standing there motionless, and then yell and run.  Once, a new friend joined the game, and he saw me standing still, and wasn't sure if I was the monster or what.  He just kept his light on me and was asking in voicechat if the girl was a monster or a friendly.  Then I suddenly went into frenzy mode and rushed directly at him.

You may also not be able ot walk over the slighest obstacle, an Ouija board for example.\n\nTheres also no level editor, which makes me sad.\n\nDoors, drawers and lockers can be very difficult to open, as the game has a very severe case of mouse acceleration, along with a bit clunky controls.\n\nIt can be EXTREMELY hard for the survivors to complete a match, since some of the maps are very VERY linear, and with keys being difficult to find at most time. The phantom monster is very OP, since you only have to camp at a door in one the linear maps to win the entire game in just a few seconds. I highly suggest you play with life mode and set max deaths to 6.\n\nThe game has a real neat 3D voice feature, which means the host can change it so that you can only hear people speak if they were close to you. This can be frustrating though if you're playing a large map with many ways to go.\n\nTotally not worth 20 euro in it's current state, but if its on sale and you get it for 3,99 as I did, you should totally get it.\n\nI rate this game 6/10","January 4, 2015","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Scary, Jump Scares, When the damn lurker is just walking at you while you're screaming "NO!"\n2.Finding Keys and other objectives, Closing doors to try and cover up your tracks\n3.Setting off traps and scaring the ♥♥♥♥ out of yourself\n4.Trying to find your friends after getting slipt up from getting chased by the monster and much more\nHonestly it's a game I keep comming back to ever sense we got it we have played it every day. Deffinitly recomending this game, Although keep in mind it's still in Alpha so don't ♥♥♥♥♥ when ♥♥♥♥ gets a bit weird and you can't click on your character or other such problems, We've run into minor problems but even with the minor problems theres tons of fun.\nIm hoping to see in the future they add more monsters with jump scare abilites like the lurker, Poping up behind someone, other such things, All in all GREAT game can't wait till it's fully compleated!","January 5, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another problem that frequently occurs (for me, at least) is that when I, or one of my friends, kill someone as a monster, there is a dead body on the ground, but a new body spawns in. Granted, the survivor is still dead, but this causes an unfair advantage for a monster like Mary, who can just sit beside this new body and build energy. Also, while this could be attributed to bad ping or something like that, I find that the hit detection in the game can be absolute trash. Either as the monster, swinging at a survivor, my hand going through them, but them still living, or as a survivor, when I spend a good minute trying to open a door or drawer, and then the next time I attempt it, I do it without effort. One last problem would be the insanity. While it sounds like a good idea on paper, it becomes very annoying, very fast. At first, it adds an extra sense of unease, which is good for a horror game, but there's a fiar amount of randomness that comes with it. Eventually, it can get to the point where your entire screen goes dark, mixed with being slowed down, to the point that it's just unfair.\n\nIf you insist on getting this game as it is now, I definitely suggest you play with insanity turned off, and with some friends  to liven up the game even a little bit.\n\nIf the developers ever end up fixing all of the problems, then this game would definitely be one that I recommend.","January 19","false","55.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The goal is to escape whatever map your on by getting all of the keys, finding where you need to go, and staying clear of the monster. It is a very interesting genre to say the least and the time I did spend on it was a blast. It was scary and well thought out in my opinion. However. I would only be able to give this game a thumbs up if the servers were not as awful as they are. I can hardly ever find matches and when I do the ping is at 8000. Now you might be thinking, "Oh his internet just sucks" Well you wouldn't be wrong, but even when I find i server with decent ping I join and other are getting disconected.

This game is an exciting horror escape game that feels kind of like a point and click game given a first person engine, only because you're running around to specific rooms and running through them to grab at keys to open new rooms etc. Knowledge is probably the most valuable weapon in this game because an inexperienced player is almost always going to lose, but that's all part of the horror fun as the monster gets to toy with them a little bit beforehand. All in all the game has its unique charm, but you will most likely have to have a group of 5 friends to really enjoy the game to its fullest.","May 1, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

At the very least its a really good cat and mouse type game.

I know a bad game when I see it and this is not one of them.\n\nI encourage you to either wait to play or add me to talk about it.

I'm a wimp when it comes to anything horror, but the multiplayer adventurer in me as drawn me in. It is brilliant to have four different human survivors as a team versus one human-controlled monster. And the three current monsters are terrifying, along with the ten existing levels full of creepy ambiance and atmosphere.\n\nEscape is difficult but not impossible for the survivors, who need to find keys and codes to unlock and open doors and safes, use batteries to power their flashlights, grab a crowbar or hammer to smash wooden boards, and eventually escape the monster or fall victim to it. The longer it takes to complete a level, the more the survivors become insane and the more difficult it becomes to escape.\n\nIn game chat:\nI really enjoyed using the 3d audio with a microphone headset. It makes a huge difference in the game. Everyone can hear you speaking, so if you want to keep the monster guessing use the in-game text chat (brought up with the enter key). It's also good with chatting in-between rounds in the lobby.\n\nGame play seems to favour the monsters, but smart survivors will be able to team up to outwit their pursuer to escape. Even in death, survivors can text chat with the living to give helpful hints, such as “You missed a key in the sink,” or “I have a crowbar with my body on the main floor.”\n\nLobby:\nAfter logging in you can setup your options and either join or host your own game. Hosts can have an open game lobby or set a password to have a private game amongst friends only. Some people have complained about being kicked out of games but I think most people who want private games have figured out how to the use password now. Those of you still kicking people, stop being so lazy and use a password for your private games (May the Lurker devour your soul...). The people hosting and the people I've played with in this community have been courteous and fun to play with. Thanks people for making this game even more fun! Most people seem to be on the servers during the weekends.\n\nLife mode seems better if you are casually hosting players – people can join in whenever they feel like if there is a spot. Normal mode is more hard core with only one life to live or die with.\n\nLevels:\nThere are currently ten levels consisting of three hotels, three asylums, a hospital (asylum set), a restaurant (hotel set), a warehouse (hotel set), and a factory. Each are different sizes and have different strategies. Some have two exits which help prevent monster camping at the exit. Some have stairs and different levels. Some have too many damn tables. Each level is creepy and atmospheric. I AM HOPING FOR GRAVEYARD TYPE LEVELS FOR A FUTURE UPDATE. There are only three different set types for levels (asylum, hotel, or factory).\n\nSurvivors:\nThere are four player controlled survivor models:\nMia the emo; she appears to be Asian and wears miss-matching shoes.\nScott the jockey, sporting his Eagles college jacket.\nJacob the nerd; he is of African descent and a little stout.\nFather John the priest; he totes a Bible but it's not compelling monsters to go away.\n\nThe survivors typically start in a room and have to find keys and codes to unlock doors and safes that will eventually allow them to escape from the level. The survivors are equipped with a battery burning flashlight that needs to be replenished or they will be forced to grope around in the dark. The longer the survivors take to complete a level, the more insane they will become. Others tools survivors will need include either a crowbar or a small hammer to remove boards from exit or storage doors. [A shovel is needed in the graveyard level.] - oops, sorry, don't know how that got in there... There are no weapons or way to attack the monster, which makes then all the more scary. Repeat, there is no BFG to save you!\n\nMonsters:\nThere are currently three monsters that one player can choose to hunt down the survivors. I feel the monsters are generally well-balanced. Some people feel the Phantom is still overpowered, despite all the tweaks it has been receiving as of late. Survivors must adjust their game-play for each monster in order to escape.\n\nMary is the scariest monster and my current favourite. She is a great monster with pretty blue eyes, but she has some posture issues. She seems well balanced with her movements and attacks. Her walk mode is a little slow, but her attack is long reaching and swift. Quick manoeuvring for survivors is the key when you hear her scream. Mary has some movement issues over objects and the Factory catwalk.\n\nThe Lurker is a muscular hulk with two forms. The first form is spiritual and allows the Lurker to freely roam the level, unencumbered by doors. In this mode it can set sound traps that go off when a survivor is nearby to help it locate the players as it cannot see anyone in this form. Once the Lurker is powered up by time it can enter its physical form where it can visibly stalk and kill remaining survivors. After a while the Lurker will revert to its spiritual form where it will have to wait until it recharges and takes physical form again. The longer the Lurker remains in physical form, the longer it take to recharge in spiritual form.\n\nThe Phantom is a roaming skeletal ghost (the creepiest monster for me until Mary joined) that can see survivors via sound such as the clicking of flashlights, running, or setting off a trap. Then it's either run away for the survivors and try to escape the Phantoms detection radius or get eviscerated by it. When the Phantom hears a survivor, it can see a white shadow, even through walls or different levels, of where the player is.\n\nTraps are set automatically for the Phantom and Mary, whereas setting traps is part of the Lurker's strategy. They are generally objects strewn about the level. Each trap makes a different sound to alert a monster to where a survivor is.\n\nSound:\nThe music is great for a horror game. Each monster has its own terrifying theme music when it appears near a survivor. Ambient sounds like footsteps, breathing, traps, and screams add to the atmosphere. The 3D audio chat really adds to the game-play; it is great to taunt the survivors as a monster. Dead players can only text chat.\n\nInsanity system:\nThe insanity system increases game difficulty by darkening a survivor's screen to the point of complete darkness, making the flashlight flicker on and off, causing the player to hear random sounds, losing hearing, losing colour vision, having arms emerge from the ground that slow or halt a survivor's progress, randomly disabling a directional key on your keyboard, and flashing images of possessed survivors across your screen. The effects are temporary but potentially deadly.\n\nThe insanity mode is a great idea and has been toned down from beta 1.0 to occur less frequently. It serves its purpose of making the game especially difficult the longer the survivors take to exit. Apparently the jump scare faces have been fixed so that they don't blind you, but I have yet to see the new effect since my game currently freezes before it occurs. I feel the jump scares are not necessary in this game. Also annoying for fair game-play is the keyboard/mouse movement disabling effect.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nDespite bugs being ironed out during the beta period, I feel the game is a very enjoyable if not a mildly terrifying experience. It's best played with all five people, and the up to four survivors really need to cooperate to escape from the monster. Recommended for beta and if all bugs (especially game freezing/crashing) get squashed for the retail release.\n\nEdited 2014-08-26 - [Version Beta 1.12a]","June 16, 2014","true","113.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although it is still in Alpha, it has an eerie atmosphere and keeps you on edge. The basic plot is to find your way out of the building using keys and codes. At the same time, you must be stealthy and aware of the monsters. This can make gameplay very fun and strategic, and certainly gives you chills. In my opinion playing with a headset on mic with your teammates is the best way to play this game. Despite its simplicity, it does take a lot of effort to finish the games. One particular monster is OP which makes gameplay mostly irritating but sometimes fun. There are a lot of annoying bugs, the most significant one being not being able to log in and having to restart over and over again until it works. Also, you get disconnected a lot and your whole computer will freeze.","February 18, 2014","true","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","10"

As stated in another players review, they recommended a way of allowing the Lurker to interact directly with objects to scare people, without actually being able to kill them. Beyond that, I find the Lurker insanely fun with setting traps and waiting for the careless humans to set off my traps to alert me to their location. I remember once I waited for the traps to alert me, and as soon as one right next to me went off, I turned physical, staring face to face mere feet away from 2 humans, who both panicked in their attempts to run away.\n\nIn addition, I feel that the Phantom should have its range reduced a bit and if possible, sound waves emanate from the area sound was made, whether from a trapped item, or from a persons steps, and make it easier to track a person through small bits of sound, but in areas where theres lots of sounds going on, it could become confusing to the phantom what sounds are actually people or are the items. Either that, or make it so the phantom has to actually attack like the lurker does to kill, and not just walk through the person.\n\nAnother suggestion I would have at the moment (not knowing if/what monsters will be added as well as maps) is to have specially designed large maps that can support up to 10 players, and 2 players play monsters. Imagine them working as a team, the Lurker setting traps and turning physical right in front of people, and in their panic, they run away, attracting the attention of the Phantom or continues the chase. I feel it would be a much more intense experience for people if it were balanced properly.\n\nOverall, I feel the game has immense potential and am really excited to see the game grow.","December 27, 2013","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Though it is a good game just expect more work done because its an alpha. I like the gameplay just I feel that sometime the phantom is a little over powered. lurker however.

You and 4 friends can play. One of you plays either a Phantom or a lurker, that persons has to stp the others from finding keys and escaping the darkness. The job of the Survivors is to find those keys then get out fast. This I would have to say isn't what makes this game a rush, for me was litening to my friends scream when I came corporeal as a phantom or even a lurker. I have never laughed so hard or been so scared playing a game with friends. I recommend this game to anyone who wants pure fun with friends.

Right now the game is excessively difficult to play and unbalanced in the favor of monsters. There are two types of characters, the survivors, who search for things such as batteries (to power your limited flashlights), tools (to help you open barricades) and keys (to help you open locked doors).\n\nTo open locked doors, you have to hold left click, then push or pull the door in the direction the door opens. This is cumbersome, and with all the other issues in the game, such as the extremely imprecise cursor, it is a feature of the game that really should have taken bakesat to fixing other things. Doors should just open and shut.\n\nI am a 260 pound man and I think the survivor characters run like a bunch of chain smoking grannies with rusty walkers. I could outrun them after a night of no sleep. That's saying something.\n\nUltimately, the game has a lot of potential, but right now, the difficulty of finding the tools you need to escape, the anticlimactic escape situations, the absence of a story line and voice acting, the poor.

A survival horror game for 5 players (Maximum) where four play scavenger hunt Point A to point D item findings, and one player plays one of (Currently 3) monsters to murder your friends. Fun for everyone, especially if you have friends who enjoy screaming very loudly at your music-cue arrival. Lets get down to it.\n\nGamplay involves item-based problem solving. Simple stuff. Find key, key goes to Locker, locker goes to safe, safe goes to kitchen, kitchen goes to crowbar, crowbar goes to wood over door, escape through door. Not always that simple, but basically always that formula. You have to find keys, unlock doors and safes, and escape out of the final door while eluding the monster player. Not always so easy.\n\nThe Monster player has 3 monsters to choose from (At the time of this review) being Lurker, Phantom, and Mary. Lurker is your tall and gruesome skinless hulkbeast who spends a majority of the game in "Phase mode" which is where the player will move around quickly, phasing through doors (Cause you cant see them) and players (Who you also cant see) and setting traps. Since you can't see players, you need to use the traps to figure out their locations. Once they set one off, and it lets you phase in, you pop in and slice them to ribbons.\n\nThe phantom is like a satanic stevie wonder. A floating torso who is completely blind to anyone unless they make a lot of sound. This means running, and clicking your flashlight. And getting too close. Make too much noise, and you'll show up in his vision as a white life-form that he can go maul. It's a fairly simple system, and I've nearly had it gotten around when I played him.\n\nMary is your near-typical japanese-horror esque girl. Similar in design to popular ones like the Ring, or grudge. For a majority of the game she moves slower than a 95 year old man walking through hot tar. She also randomly teleports as a way to balance and make your life easier. You might teleport in the same room as the players, might not. You can also manually teleport, but we'll get to that in a second.\n\nMary has the ability to enter a /frenzy/ mode when her meter (Which you dont see) fills. Stare at the players enough, and you can activate frenzy mode. a 10-15 second burst of quadrupled speed in which she screams violently, goes all scary faced and comes bullrushing you. You can also exchange a bit of the frenzy meter for another teleport, if you dont wanna wait for the freebie random one.\n\nThere are about 12+ stages right now, with the most recent (At the time of this review) being a forest/camping area. The game does have some flaws, like optimization issues, data leaks, and minor coding bugs. Updates are also somewhat slow, but when they come around they are very nice. Running on my toaster I get about 25-30 frames in a map. Apparently a high-end gets about the same, due to optimization issues. It happens.\n\nI can't really rate it with a number right now, but I am giving it a yes. It's a nice game, for a beta.","December 12, 2014","true","8.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

The main idea of the game is very original, and I've had some heart attacks playing the game, yes, it does scare you ;). To think that the game is an early beta ( sorry for so much early beta early beta :p ) and it scares is something that makes me think that the game has potential, yet the game is buggy, since beta bla bla and the performance is rather poor. But that is something that can be fixed! :)\n\nThe maps are also nice, the only thing I don't really like about them are the exits, you reach one room and ta-da! you've won. You could die in that room also irl, I'd make something better like getting out of the building or whatever, with a little cutscene.

And gameplay is simple yet very complex.\n\nThere are 4 humans trying to escape a building.  Throughout each map are keys and other items that the humans need to find in order to escape.  The placement of the items and paths randomize on each map so you have a different experience each time.  As a human you use a combination of left mouse button and mouse movements to open and close doors and drawers.  You also get a flashlight and you can sprint for short periods of time (with a slow regen of sprint).  You can't fight the monsters; all you can do is run, hide and die.\n\nThere are 2 types of monsters with very different abilities.  The basic mission for the monster is to kill all the humans which is often easier said than done.\n\nThis game is very fun to play as people will regularly freak out and scream sounding like a little girl.

When you're being hunted by the monster you get frantic looking for keys, and when you're the monster it's amazing just trying to plan out when you're going to get survivors or if you just want to scare them for a little bit.\n\nSince this is an alpha, there are a few glitches. Some people have issues with alt-tabbing, other times players apparently can't connect. There is also the occassional crash (I haven't crashed or experienced any bugs except the following one). The only game-breaking bug (as in you have to go to a new round) is when you spawn in a room and cannot get out or if you cannot continue, however this is extremely rare.\n\nThis game shows a lot of promise and is currently extremely fun.

There are three monsters implemented so far to choose from, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. The survivors collect keys and batteries and try to open enough doors to get to the exit. A very simple premise to a game that can be loads of fun, but also equally annoying when you meet someone who just uses the monster to wipe everyone out in the first minute.\n\nDamned is a game about chilling fear, amazing atmosphere and occasional jump scares. I think a lot of people underestimate the value of stalking a completely frightened prey, instead of killing it immediately. It’s priceless. I’ve seen things in this game that only happen in the best Horror movies, and have left me spooked to death.\n\nLet’s be clear, it’s not perfect. There are still numerous bugs, sometimes the map or a character will get bugged and you won’t be able to progress. Is it still worth the money? For the full price, maybe (simply because it's buggy and laggy).

This game is very entertaining with friends especially when in a skype call  hearing them scream. xD\n\nGameplay is fun but can get tedious at times, especially with occasional choppy fps. I've also had a time where i was unable to find the key i needed to progress, looked literally everywhere but was forced to quit- a shame as it would have been the first time i completed a game succesfully. There is a sense of acheivement though especially when playing in smaller maps because keys work on specific doors- that was a good idea.\n\nGraphics are impressive compared to other games i'm able to play on my low end computer- definately the best i've been able to play with on this pc. Level design is varied slightly so you aren't getting the same thing everytime but the good, dark, ominous atmoshpeare stays consistant throughout the game.\n\nConnecting with friends is easy and quite stable. However, there used to be a bug which prevented the host starting the game. Another one was when i was invited to play and joined the server but the host did not appear to be there. I'm not sure if this has been fixed yet or not though.\n\nSome things i'd love to see in the future is ai monsters, that would allow parties of two to both experience scares at the same time and work together. Pulling off ai that doesn't immediately just pop up and ruin the scare factor of the game would make me very impressed. Also a campaign would be great! giving the characters a background story to help us connect to them emotionally would definetly make an exciting experience. Great work from the developers so far, i cant wait to see what they bring in the full release.\n\n\n","October 31, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's a lot of variety in the monsters. One person gets to be the monster while the others are humans trying to escape. The monster player can choose from a handful of monster types, including a blind ghost who can only see by sounds (like sprinting, opening/closing doors, etc.), a ghost girl that's basically Samara from The Ring, and a large brute creature that can turn invisible.\n\nSadly, the game seems to be dying. The last few nights that I've tried to play, I haven't been able to get into a single match. There's always a private server with 2 or 3 players in it (the game is 5 player max), and then one sole person sitting in a server, but no one else joins (and 1v1 isn't very exciting in this game).\n\nIt's a great game, and by far the best multiplayer horror game (White Noise Online is the only other one I can think of, though), but while I do recommend it, I only recommend buying it if it's on sale (meaning there'll be more people playing it while it's on sale) or if you have at least two or three other friends wanting to also play it with you.","May 1, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And gameplay is simple yet very complex.\n\nThere are 4 humans trying to escape a building.  Throughout each map are keys and other items that the humans need to find in order to escape.  The placement of the items and paths randomize on each map so you have a different experience each time.  As a human you use a combination of left mouse button and mouse movements to open and close doors and drawers.  You also get a flashlight and you can sprint for short periods of time (with a slow regen of sprint).  You can't fight the monsters; all you can do is run, hide and die.\n\nThere are 2 types of monsters with very different abilities.  The basic mission for the monster is to kill all the humans which is often easier said than done.\n\nThis game is very fun to play as people will regularly freak out and scream sounding like a little girl.

When you're being hunted by the monster you get frantic looking for keys, and when you're the monster it's amazing just trying to plan out when you're going to get survivors or if you just want to scare them for a little bit.\n\nSince this is an alpha, there are a few glitches. Some people have issues with alt-tabbing, other times players apparently can't connect. There is also the occassional crash (I haven't crashed or experienced any bugs except the following one). The only game-breaking bug (as in you have to go to a new round) is when you spawn in a room and cannot get out or if you cannot continue, however this is extremely rare.\n\nThis game shows a lot of promise and is currently extremely fun. There is proximity chat which can be hilarious when the lurker uses it!","January 6, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's a lot of variety in the monsters. One person gets to be the monster while the others are humans trying to escape. The monster player can choose from a handful of monster types, including a blind ghost who can only see by sounds (like sprinting, opening/closing doors, etc.), a ghost girl that's basically Samara from The Ring, and a large brute creature that can turn invisible.\n\nSadly, the game seems to be dying. The last few nights that I've tried to play, I haven't been able to get into a single match. There's always a private server with 2 or 3 players in it (the game is 5 player max), and then one sole person sitting in a server, but no one else joins (and 1v1 isn't very exciting in this game).\n\nIt's a great game, and by far the best multiplayer horror game (White Noise Online is the only other one I can think of, though), but while I do recommend it, I only recommend buying it if it's on sale (meaning there'll be more people playing it while it's on sale) or if you have at least two or three other friends wanting to also play it with you.","May 1, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A player is randomly selected to be the monster, and each monster requires a different playstyle both to hunt, and to dodge.\n\nObjectives are random and strewn across the map, but scripted  in such a way that that requires you to cover the entire map to escape.

It's got some real entertaining moments, but there are too many little things that ruin it. The game is heavily biased in favor of the monsters. It's very rare for the survivors to actually win the round. The maps are garbage and cluttered with too much stuff that gets in the way. And the biggest issue is that when people leave the game, which they do frequently, the character they were playing as goes away, but late joiners can't replace them. So usually the game quickly turns into a 1v2 instead 1v5. Maybe they'll improve it in the future. Like I said, it's fun. Anyone who wants a quick fix survival horror game will enjoy it for a while, but it's got too many problems to last.","November 22, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I got this game on sale a while back and it was a big mistake.\nThe idea of the game is fun, but the idea has been done much better on other games.\n\nThis game rarely gets updates. The community on the game is not high. The monster selection is low and the surviver selection is low. If you play one to two matches with each monster then you will get the game. When the monster you would think it is fun, but no it isn't. As the monster you spend most of the time running around hoping to bump into someone. As a survivor you run around hoping to find a key. You will only get a fast, maybe interesting, game if both monster and players know the map by heart and memory and where stuff tends to be located. Sometimes the game will bug and you can't pick up a key you need or open a door even if you have the right key. Also, if you are playing and the person as the monster leaves the game your entire game is ruined and you are ♥♥♥♥ed. The game wont end automatically nor will it put someone as the monster like any good game mechanic would do.\n\nThe game itself is really buggy. The engine this runs on is apparently poop so thats a thing.\n\nHere is their official website:\nhttp://www.9heads.com/games/damned/\n\nThis link should illustrate the quality they put out. Here is a quote from the devs, "9heads also uses free programming libraries and engine such as Ogre3D and Bullet Physics proving that you can achieve very nice results with exceptional free/open-source stuff out there."","November 1, 2015","false","14.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Three types of monsters, each with their own playstyle that the survivors will have to adapt to in order to survive.\n\nBut surviving is not enough, as the longer you take, the less sane you become. You not only imagine sounds that others cannot hear, but you see the faces of the dead, your flashlight flickers without cause, your hearing becomes impaired, and worse.\n\nYour ultimate objective is to find a key to unlock another door that hopefully has the one key you need to unlock your only escape. Be sure to check each drawer, stove, counter top, table, and bucket, because the keys-- and batteries for your flashlight-- could be anywhere, just like the monster.\n\nDid you see Mary when you turned that corner? Hopefully not, because that means she saw you. Did that clock make a loud noise as you passed it? Hope you are just going crazy, because that means the Lurker found you. Did that strange apparition spook you as you turned the corner? Hope not, because any noise you make as a result brings it right to you.\n\nWhile the game itself is extremely fun with friends who have microphones and with a monster who would rather toy with you than kill you right away, there is a noticeable lack of optimization. I used to be able to run this game well enough 45+ FPS normally on my mid-end system, but it suddenly dropped to 15 and less.

However, just as other players have suggested, some of the monsters need to be better balanced. Some monsters are way too OP (Phantom and Lurker especially) while the others (May and Fallen) are very hard to play with. I like the idea behind Fallen especially, but only having 7 seconds to attack a running player at walking speed after spending 5+ minutes trying to get energy is taxing on the fun.\n\nI am also slightly concerned about the price of the game given the amount of content that it has and also how the product itself appears in its current state. There is much potential to this game as it is very unique in that it gives a personal horror experience that is fun with your friends (which you can have up to five of them playing including yourself). However, in its current state, it is not worth $20. I got the game on sale for around $7 and I don't feel I wasted money, however, if I had paid $20 for it, I may have been slightly disappointed. I think $10 would be a fair price for the game in it's current state.\n\nSome suggestions that I have personally is adding some new monsters, like maybe a clown (an omage to Pennywise from IT), warewolf, alien (like alien vs predator)... the more options the better. That goes for the survivors as well. While there may only be 4 survivors total in a given game, giving more characters too choose from would be awesome. There is only one female to choose from in the list of survivors, while there could be an all male team, or an all female team. Giving more options allows players to connect better through the character they choose.\n\nAnother critique is that some of the locations are identical. While there are plenty of locations to choose from, the hotels look very similar to each other, and so do the hospitals. It takes away each location's uniqueness. The forest and the diner and warehouse are good locations. But if there are going to be multiple hotels and multiple hospitals it would be wise to consider making them vastly unique from each other.\n\nOverall the game is great, but I would say that the biggest con is that it is overpriced given the amount of conent that it has. When this game is on sale, I recommend getting it, as it is fun to play with friends.","March 14","true","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Voice chat (default C) allows everyone (even the monster) to hear you so don't give away your position. Text chatting on the other hand is only seen by survivors.\nMemorizing the map layouts and how to avoid the certain monsters is very important, music changing is a big key in knowing there's a monster near you.\n\n\nItems:\n\n-Only pick up batteries when your flashlight is about to die, and don't pick up more than one you can only carry the one in your flashlight so don't waste them.\n-The crowbar is used to pry off wooden planks blocking doors from pressing left click on them.\n-Numerical codes written on paper open only certain safes.\n-Keys also only open certain doors so you'll be running back and forth a lot\n\n\nMonsters:\n\nLurker\nA demon that has a spirit form where they sprint around the map invisible but unable to see or hear survivors. In this form the monster right clicks glowing objects to activate a trap, when a survivor walks past the trap, the object is set off alerting the monster the presence of a survivor. After 20 seconds of the start of the round you can activate physical form which makes you visible, and able to attack but walk much slower. The humans can out-run you and this form only lasts 40 seconds before going back to ghost form. Depending on how long you stay in the physical form, the longer the cool-down is for you to change back from ghost form to physical, so turn off physical form when not needed.\nIf you're being chased, turned off your flashlight and sprint away, closing doors on them will block them out since Lurkers can't open doors.\n\nPhantom\nThe phantom is a ghost that can see you by hearing what you do, so shining your light on it and starring it down doesn't mean it knows where you are. When you do something loud such as sprinting, or anything interactive such as opening doors, turning on/off your flashlight and the phantom is near you, he will see you appear as bright white character (reverse silhouette) that can shine through obstacles and walls on his screen and chase you down. This ghost can go through doors, so don't bother closing doors, leave them open for your convenience! This monster requires more stealth then the others since you need to casual walk and stay still most of the time.\n\nMary\nA ghost girl that is an insanely slow character so if you see her just run away. Hiding from her is possible only if you can hide behind a door since that blocks her from charging her attack. Mary is ABLE open doors only in casual walking mode (as long as the doors are unlocked), so if she shes you in a room make sure to hold left-click and keep the door closed to prevent her from opening it behind you! Mary's main attack is Frenze which gives her 4x speed and attack to kill al survivors in her way! Luckily, she needs to charge it up to use it, mainly by being close to survivors. If a survivor is near, shines their flashlight on her, of if she even walks underneath a light (anything that "disturtbs" the witch) she gains energy towards Frenzy mode. Her second ability is teleporting so she can very likely teleport in the room you're in. Her primary ability is a frenzy attack, if she stares at a survivor for roughly 10 seconds she can charge (twice as fast as your sprinting) for about 8 seconds and kill everyone in the way. The longer the round, the more energy Mary gains meaning that she can use her abilities faster and more often.\n\n\nI would highly recommend this game for a group of friends looking to co-op on something, or if you're into survival horror games working as a team!\nThere are still a lot of bugs but it's pretty stable.\nAlso looking forward to the new monsters and features in the new future!\n\n10/10","February 22, 2015","true","70.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even 3 if you have to. Great time. Maps and graphic optimisation drag the game down a bit, there are a couple that seem identical, if not deserve to just be merged into a bigger one because they look very similar in terms of color, style etc. Graphic optimisation here is tough. Not something you should worry about though because the graphics aren't much even on max, and you aren't here for that anyway. The horror is good enough to give this game about 7/10. Above average and greatly worthy of your money and time if you can round up at least 3 people including yourself. If not, you're not a big loss as you can always find good people to play with and the population of lobbys never seems to have decreased. I do feel however that the monsters you can play as, need very VERY close watching from the developers. There looks like there might start to be this trend of: monsters that are just out to kill, not scare the players. This is why I fear the Lurker more than any other monster in the game, because killing the survivors in this game isn't the prime focus, it's more of a balance between wanting to scare them too.\n\nI want people to note that the game's soundtrack is by far one of the best I've seen in a while. For a small time composer, it definetly in my opinion rivals the soundtracks in bigger ones, because the composer (Matt Collins, whom if you search for the Damned soundtrack on youtube, you can find) has just a vast knowledge of how to orchestrate such dynamic, classic and grand pieces.. pieces I hope to see more of, but I doubt I will. Quality soundtracks are hard to come by, not every game's complete soundtrack is actually worth listening to. That being said, please give this game a try if you can gather 2 friends to play with, I promise you're in for a treat. And please remember to note down and give credit to Matt Collins for the game's score, he's talented and you'll see.","January 19","true","36.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Back when I bought it, sitting in a lobby for over a minute without the host starting the game basically guaranteed hard crashes for all involved. This has been (mostly) fixed, the game will still randomly kick people for no reason, and isn't very well optimized, but if playing with people you know you'll be hard pressed to find a better multiplayer horror experience when everything DOES work.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game is multiplayer slender with amnesia click-and-hold door controls and a battery/flashlight system that would make Jim Sterling cry. You find keys (rather than notes) and use them to open doors to find more keys until you escape, all while being hunted by one of the various monsters (played by a real person). Each monster has their own little twist on gameplay, and by far the most tense moments of the game are when you're limited in where you can travel (no keys) and don't know which monster's playstyle to counter.\n\nThat's what the gameplay is, but is it fun?:\nYes. Play. Damned. With. Friends. Hop in a VC, que it up, and make the monster mute himself except for the occasional brag directly after scoring a kill. You'll be amazed how quickly you can betray someone, locking them out of a room and leaving them to die in order to ensure you stay alive. You'll feel genuine relief when you cycle keys as a team to finally open that last exit door. Resource management with batteries usually feels like a tacked-on timekill mechanic, but in Damned you have to share those resources amongst 4 people, which adds to the urgency quite effectively.\n\nPlaying as the monster is a blast too. Sometimes you'll get a series of bad ports as Mary, or noone will hit your traps on Lurker, but setting up a legit jumpscare makes it all worth it. My friends and I have tons of stories along the lines of "remember that time I made [friend] scream like a little ♥♥♥♥♥?" Very few games give you that opportunity.\n\nGraphics:\nMeh. Mary and Fallen work well because they are meant to look stiff and plodding, but lurker looks like the monster from "Boogeyman," and only will make you jump if he pops up right on your ♥♥♥ (which he often does). Character models are functional, as are animations. Environments are sufficiantly mood-supporting, but a LOT of the levels are "re-arranged assets from our asylum level." The most important thing is that the graphics rarely detract from the horror experience.\n\nAudio: Absolutely essential to have a good headset in order to get the full experience with this game. Most monsters set "traps" by interacting with objects in the environment that give off a sound que when the players pass by them. There is no worse feeling than stumbling through a hallway and triggering 3 or 4 traps in close succession, basically ensuring the monster knows exactly where you are. Ambient sound when the monster is close or is attacking further crank up the intensity, and the plinking minimalism of the rest of the audio just accents these bombastic moments even further.\n\nOverall: 6/10, 8/10 with lobby of friends. If you can, buy it on sale or in a 4-pack with friends pitching in, but $20 is a relatively fair price on its own.","November 25, 2015","true","23.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Voice chat (default C) allows everyone (even the monster) to hear you so don't give away your position. Text chatting on the other hand is only seen by survivors.\nMemorizing the map layouts and how to avoid the certain monsters is very important, music changing is a big key in knowing there's a monster near you.\n\n\nItems:\n\n-Only pick up batteries when your flashlight is about to die, and don't pick up more than one you can only carry the one in your flashlight so don't waste them.\n-The crowbar is used to pry off wooden planks blocking doors from pressing left click on them.\n-Numerical codes written on paper open only certain safes.\n-Keys also only open certain doors so you'll be running back and forth a lot\n\n\nMonsters:\n\nLurker\nA demon that has a spirit form where they sprint around the map invisible but unable to see or hear survivors. In this form the monster right clicks glowing objects to activate a trap, when a survivor walks past the trap, the object is set off alerting the monster the presence of a survivor. After 20 seconds of the start of the round you can activate physical form which makes you visible, and able to attack but walk much slower. The humans can out-run you and this form only lasts 40 seconds before going back to ghost form. Depending on how long you stay in the physical form, the longer the cool-down is for you to change back from ghost form to physical, so turn off physical form when not needed.\nIf you're being chased, turned off your flashlight and sprint away, closing doors on them will block them out since Lurkers can't open doors.\n\nPhantom\nThe phantom is a ghost that can see you by hearing what you do, so shining your light on it and starring it down doesn't mean it knows where you are. When you do something loud such as sprinting, or anything interactive such as opening doors, turning on/off your flashlight and the phantom is near you, he will see you appear as bright white character (reverse silhouette) that can shine through obstacles and walls on his screen and chase you down. This ghost can go through doors, so don't bother closing doors, leave them open for your convenience! This monster requires more stealth then the others since you need to casual walk and stay still most of the time.\n\nMary\nA ghost girl that is an insanely slow character so if you see her just run away. Hiding from her is possible only if you can hide behind a door since that blocks her from charging her attack. Mary is ABLE open doors only in casual walking mode (as long as the doors are unlocked), so if she shes you in a room make sure to hold left-click and keep the door closed to prevent her from opening it behind you! Mary's main attack is Frenze which gives her 4x speed and attack to kill al survivors in her way! Luckily, she needs to charge it up to use it, mainly by being close to survivors. If a survivor is near, shines their flashlight on her, of if she even walks underneath a light (anything that "disturtbs" the witch) she gains energy towards Frenzy mode. Her second ability is teleporting so she can very likely teleport in the room you're in. Her primary ability is a frenzy attack, if she stares at a survivor for roughly 10 seconds she can charge (twice as fast as your sprinting) for about 8 seconds and kill everyone in the way. The longer the round, the more energy Mary gains meaning that she can use her abilities faster and more often.\n\n\nI would highly recommend this game for a group of friends looking to co-op on something, or if you're into survival horror games working as a team!\nThere are still a lot of bugs but it's pretty stable.\nAlso looking forward to the new monsters and features in the new future!\n\n10/10","February 22, 2015","true","70.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Tons of bugs and glitches everywhere, really bad performance issues. There is no tutorial or anything to help you, well you wont really need any help because all your gonna be doing through the whole game is PICKING UP KEYS AND UNLOCKING DOORS!!!!! Where is the variety guys? C'mon....\nThe maps are decent but not too special, and how come being a monster just really sucks!?! You would think that you would feel pretty cool being a monster but in this GAME you feel so cheap and pathetic. I was hoping you could do many cool things as a monster like trigger things, make people hallucinate and like fly around and drop in right behind a dude and scare the living daylights out of him. BUT NO! You can't do that, well atleast from my playthroughs I couldn't. As a monster in this game, you run around the area searching for people for hours and hours and hitting them then in one hit, they're dead. Very misleading... I wasn't frightened one bit in this game, the only thing I could say that scared me much was the freaking music that plays when a person is running away from you while your the monster, it just suddenly pops in, scaring the bajeezus outta you. But one poor decision that I hate in this game is that when your the lurker, you can't see anybody until you manifest. I find it very stupid but some people might disagree with me. Only my opinion\n\nAll I can say left about this game is that the premise of it sounds incredible but the dev's executed it poorly. I know it's in a earlier stage of development but still feels like a very VERY earlier version of the game that the dev's should only have. PLEASE DEVELOPERS LISTEN OUT!!! Sorry for being harsh but please change some of these decisions that you've made, it would definitely change my thoughts about this a lot.

However, this is seemingly impossible. There are maybe 3 hosted games at most at any given time- and there's a good chance only one of them is public (the full one.) Hosting a game is a futile gesture because no one is playing, no one is joining, and you can't play a game alone.\n\nI tried, and I ran around as a ghost with no one to scare or kill for 10 minutes. After I exited the game, Damned didn't understand that I couldn't die (as the ghost,) and therefore couldn't disconnect from the server... ever. It took me 45 minutes to get back to the lobby and then only after restarting my computer, which isn't really a viable option to use in order to shut down/restart the game. Especially a game which requires so much restarting to begin with.\n\nThis isn't a beta, it's complete undeveloped and broken.

This game has no spark of creativity, and no loving touch at all, it's just half ♥♥♥♥♥ garbage with as little actual content as physically possible, in the form of a barely playable game. Even managing that, the game still is riddled with bugs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/251170/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","I never thought I would enjoy a game that treads to close to the "note collector genre" so heavily, but here I am. Damned is  an asymmetric 5-player multiplayer game where one player controls one of three different monsters, each with different abilities and methods of detecting the humans, and the other players play as humans trying to escape by finding keys and tools in the environment to make it through to the exit. The game has 12 maps, giving it a good amount of replayability. The voice chat system was one of my favorite parts of the game, featuring a 3D audio option that makes each player's voice come through their character's position instead of being global, encouraging them to stick together in standard horror movie fashion while also allowing the monster to taunt them.\n\nThe thing that I like about this game is that unlike other asymmetrical games like Evolve, Damned isn't afraid to kill off players. It treats the humans the same way that any horror movie would, and if they don't stick together and find a way out quickly they aren't going to survive. The keys can be pretty well-hidden, and Damned is the only game where I've ever seen a group of players slowly succumb one by one to the realization that they might not ever find the key they missed somewhere, if the key even existed at all. The tension of new players figuring out what to do and what not to do to avoid alerting the monster while finding their way out is a lot of fun, and while I haven't played past that point to know what it'll be like once I know all the tricks, I think there's enough content to it that I would still enjoy it.\n\nThe big problem with the game is that it's pretty buggy in its current state, despite no longer being in early access. When I first started playing the game it had capped itself to 15 FPS, and the only way to fix it was to restart my computer. Even after that, the game is generally poorly optimized from what I've seen from other players (I was able to run it at a pretty consistent 80-90 FPS, which isn't really ideal since I have a 144 hz monitor and a computer that should be running it at far past that framerate, but oh well). The other issue is that the game isn't exactly populated. A quick look at the server list showed 7 lobbies, 3 of which were public, and 1 of those had a ping of over 1000. This is the sort of game where you should buy a bundle and play with a group of friends instead of relying on random players, but it's more fun with friends anyways so I didn't mind.\n\nIn its current state I wouldn't recommend this game at all for $20, but it seems to go on sale in various indie bundles fairly often (I bought a four-pack of the game for like $1 or so at some point or another), and if another four-pack deal comes up and you can get it for cheap it's a great way to spend a few nights with a few friends.","October 1, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Gamergate,yo!\n\n******DONT BUY THIS GAME.****  Maybe at a sale where's its like 1 euro.. maybe.\n\nI bought the pack and for 5 a piece.. Yea haha not worth it.\n\nThe gamer experience, you may encounter when playing this game.\n\nStart up game, have a tiny window. Go to settings, selecting 1920x1080 does not mean fullscreen apparantly. Drag window after you manage to unstick your mouse. Select 'Full screen' aaand- CRASH.  Looking promising already. When killing the program dont kill the 'Game' kill the other 'Game' in your programs, killing the first one doesnt solve jack sh*t.\n\nRestart the game, oh! Full screen! .. But why is the image so small? Check Gamma settings, drag it ALL the way up to high in order to see all the individual slabs of gray, go back to the home screen and .. Woa, there was another image here? No, nope, its one image, just dark as f*ck which made you think 3/4 of your screen is just black by default.\n\nAlright! Initial grievances are forgiven and forgotten, lets do this sh*t! Start a game, looking for the lobby created by a friend. Er... its here... SOMEWHERE... FOUND IT! Locked the lobby with a password so we can be noobs amongst friends. Fill in password... Nothing happens.. Did I misspell it? I guess I did, lets try again.. Nope.. I spelled it right but it wont let me in. Its not even giving me a 'this aint the password, you fool', the password screen just poofs .. Did I crash again? Oh, nope, and you can start your search for that one specific lobby all over again.\n\nRestart the game.\n\nAlright, all in Lobby, lets do this. First impressions of the ingame enviroment. This is dark as f*ck! Where's my flashlight? Its not F, not E... Where dafuq is it? Right click?! What? .. Oh okay then. Picking up items, E? Nope. Left click. Opening doors, E? ... No.. more clicking. Well, not so much clicking as dragging apparantly. Okay I got keys, I got batteries, dont know what the hell is going on but lets do this. How do I acces my inventory? Can I acces my inventory? I cannot acces my inventory, but then how will I know what i've picked up? Dont question this sh*t, just roll with it this game will not explain sh*t to you. Mash your face against all the doors because its a hassle to try and open them and to figure out if you have the right key for this door or not.  I have 3 keys, can I toggle between them? No? So, should I assume that I use all the keys that I have on this one door that I'm currently humping?\n\nThe door may be partially open, you may smash your weight in full against the door. That thing aint opening till you click and drag its ♥♥♥ open.\n\nHOLY SH*T WHAT WAS THAT. I am legit scared.. Why are there hands coming out of the floor?!\n\nMini heart attack because my friend killed us all. Start a new lobby, now filled with extra randomers, it's all good. Start game, repeat. Running around the game for a full 20 minutes only to realise that our monster left, or disconnected or maybe more likely, crashed. Find out that you could open cabininets 'n shizzle, did I mention this game doesnt tell you sh*t?\n\nStart a new game, choose to be a monster this time. Got to be a Monster for a whole 5 seconds before CRASHHH.\n\nNot even 1 hour of play time, 3 crashes...  I'd grade this game a 2/10 would crash again.\n\n","January 6, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UmbraDragon/recommended/251170/","UmbraDragon","Umbra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UmbraDragon/","426 products in account","Quick Review\n\nDamned provides a unique spin on the Slenderman game genre of picking up keys and other objectives in order to complete a level while an evil entity chases you. Not only does it add co-op, but it adds an asymetric mechanic where the human players can work together to find the objects in order to escape the 1 player who plays as a monster, seeking to kill all the humans (can anyone say Evolve?).\n\nThe horror of Damned doesn't last very long. For the first few hours of your playtime with this game, it will be very terrifying, being stalked by one of three monsters available to the player. Moving through one of the several dark environments the game bestows upon you is unsettling and nerve wrackcing. However, the scares begin to calm down and the game loses it's horror element.\n\nThat doesn't mean the game is ruined though, as it still is a fun game of cat and mouse. The mice (humans) running around and madly collecting keys to open up more doors to find more keys is still a fun game as you try to stay alive. Unfortunately, the game is quite boring with 2 players and sometimes even 3 won't do the job. In order to experience the game truly is to have at least 4 or 5 players to play with (at least 3 humans and 1 player monster).\n\nI'd wait till this game goes on a good sale and pick up a 4-pack to play with friends.\n\n7/10","March 29, 2015","true","6.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Anything pretty much goes in this game, there are no set rules. ♥♥♥♥, it even had an identity crisis upon launch as it said "You have no activated your copy of TERROR yet." Even the lobby is bugged, when the text box appears to be at the middle of the screen, but in reality, you have to type from the bottom left corner, where it looks like it is just empty.\n\nI really wanted to love this game, but right now, all I can feel is "meh," borderline "give me a refund"\n\nThere is early access, then there is throwing out a barebones game and disregarding how rushed and empty it is just by saying "hurr durr, its an alpha."

It's extremely easy for the monster to just sit and wait on the survivors to come and then it's a quick kill. The items you have to hunt are too ambiguious and you spend the majority of the time running from room to room looking for a very small item that is easily missed then running back to EVERY door and safe you have come across to see if it opens the said door. If it does, there's a 75% chance that the door you just opened has nothing of value.\n\nGreat concept, but the items you have to find need to be made simpler because right now it just goes on forever looking for items and it's way too easy for the monster to find and kill the survivors.","February 1, 2014","false","4.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

The fact that it is doing something similar to Evolve, one of this year’s major titles, but in more of a survival horror setting and less of an eSports setting shows that. The fact of the matter is that it is poorly designed, slow, isn’t scary, rehashes survival horror concepts that are both lamented and don’t make a lot of sense to begin with, and is unpolished on top of that. It is unpolished to the point that you may be completely unable to play the game for hours on end or give up on trying before you even get to play it at all. I had a hard time getting the other members of the team I played with to stick with it for this review. That should say something about it there.

The (maximum of 4) Survivors run around the map rushing to find the different keys/codes to open doors/safes whilst trying to avoid the Monster, who is trying to kill them (there are only 2 types of monster at the time of this review). This can lead to some pretty tense moments of blubbering in a corner whilst the monster metaphorically sniffs around trying to find you. The surprising thing about Damned is that even though it's in alpha, it's still a really good game! Yes, they have bugs to fix, but lately they have really gotten around to fixing a good majority of them.\n\nAt the time of this "review", the game has a relatively small playerbase outside of the swarm of players every major update.
