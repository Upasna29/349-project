"experience".\n\nSo, you start off as a unicorn on a strange planet. It's a text adventure, but you can only do what it says you can, as it gives you two or three different things you can type in. Our first choice is "Go Up The Stairs" or "Mas.ture.bate", which clearly shows you that this is going to be a very mature game (/s). The second choice instantly kills you because it was trans-se.xual pron (Seriously). It's so ♥♥♥♥ing linear, most of the time it's "Either go this way or just fap and die because LULZ TEH RANDOMZ!" After 7 minutes of play you get a to be continued screen, not like it will actually be continued.\n\nSteam needs more quality control, because of games like this that are about going on a 6 minute journey to find a 3 pe.nis headed enemy for LOLZ. "Gentlemen in Tuxedos", please do not continue this. We don't want this on Steam, and Valve probably wouldn't either if they would actually PAY ATTENTION.\n\nTL;DR: 7 minute linear quest about a pe.nis or something.","June 23, 2015","false","0.1"," 383 of 403 people (95%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","95","383","403","44","4"

Not a text adventure, and tells you what you have to type in using no keywords like "examine" or "use ___ with" or using any of your creativity, you have to type in what they say. Creator is probably 12, don't buy this 'game' it's nothing but garbage.\n\n\nIt's unbelievable that this game got the the ♥♥♥♥♥torm of the Greenlight.\nIt doesn't have any Pros going for it, it's not even in the genre they stated as a text adventure game. Instead it's an adventure game that uses text. You can't make your own choices like you do in actual text adventure game, the game shows what you have to type in. In one part there were hanging bodies, but the only action you can type in is what the game tells you to type in. You can't say "Examine Body" it's impossible, the game isnt a text adventure.\n\nThe humor is internet memes, and stupid immature 12 year old humor (a 12 year old probably wrote this) like when you shove a key in your ♥♥♥.

All of that together makes it seem like a very suspicious file for any anti-virus with a heuristic scanner.\n\nI'll get more into the tech side of things later, but first...\n\nThe actual gameSo, I  have a thousand odd games in my Steam library, and this will be the first one that I'll request a refund on. The game is technically just plain bad: there are a bunch of dead ends, some definitely unintentional (the "main menu" has menu entries you can't return from, for instance), the text parser is horrible (because it's just a batch script with a bunch of if X goto Y statements) and the actual story is nothing but horrible memes and stupid, unfunny humor. Even if this were technically proficient, this wouldn't be worth your time.\n\nThe game is apparently also free on Desura[www.desura.com] and the Google Code repository (that the devs are using as a file storage, unsurprisingly. I'd have been genuinely surprised if they'd used any kind of SCM for this horrible mess) has about a half of the game playable for free, and also the source code, so you can see for yourself just what it takes to make a game like this (not much).\n\n\nMore tech babbleSo, like I said, the game is just a ~1000 line BAT-file, that uses nothing but echo, pause and goto statements to make the game... "work", but this isn't exactly true. It also uses incredible tricks like pinging localhost to create timed pauses. This game is almost facinating in how horrible it is, technically. I'm entirely certain the devs have spent more time packaging it into the double packed final exe-file it is and making sure it works on Steam than they have on the acutal game "engine".\nIf you want to take a peek at the games source code, here's how:\nLaunch the game\nNavigate to your temp folder (Win+R and type in %TEMP%, for instance)\nlook for the 2 latest created folders, with names like 12EF.tmp (so four hexadecimal numbers and .tmp)\nOne will contain an executable b2e.exe, this is not what you want, the other one will contain a file called batchfile.bat\nMake a copy of batchfile.bat, because quitting the game deletes both the b2e.exe and the original batchfile.bat.\nQuit the game.\ntl;drA 1000 line BAT-file with horrible memes and techical problems, your AV will probably flag it as a virus, which isn't far from the truth.\n\n\n4/20\nblaze it :weed:","June 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 84 of 88 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","84","88","9","4"

I would probablt end up with a crude junior one bedroom\n-There is no wit to the text, it half heartedly throws in references to sexual things and pop culture references and thats the crux of the appeal here. The limited novelty feeling of seeing this in a text based game dies quickly\n-You will complete the game after 5 levels by acting like a blind lab rat and end up losing. As far as I can tell the game will return a game loss screen\n-Not early access as far as the store page is concerned - so i guess this is the final version\n-You will have to continually unquarantine the executable of this game as it gets flagged as being a trojan by most common antiviruses. I have faith that the community and steam would not allow a proper trojan to use the steam platform as a launching pad but that faith might be misplaced, and even so, the inconvenience caused by this problem is equal or greater than the enjoyment that comes from actually playing the game\n-I am reaching my saturation point with trading card games, steam and the community will push the concept to its breaking point exploiting people with addictive personalities until most of them opt out and the system starts devaluing everything by lack of demand or at some point we will get horror stories like we see for gambling and we might get negative attention from the media and policy makers... Nothing I look forward to... *frowns*\n\nConclusion : Should have been made into a free flash game outside of steam for those interested, which would have been mostly nobody - which goes to show that steam really enables the showcasing of stuff people do not want and getting it onto people`s hard drives.","January 26","false","4.0"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","25","28","4","0"

No you really shouldn't get this. This game is a waste of money, and a waste of time. Before we go into what this "game" entails, let's get some preliminary stuff out of the way. To start with, it has had hundreds, if not thousands of complaints about trojans and malicious software being installed once you install it. I encountered such a problem myself, with a trojan warning appearing on my screen. After running an anti-virus scan I discovered that the "game" had installed a rather dodgy-sounding file into my Win32. The developers claim that these are all "false-positive reports" but it's much safer to not take any chances. They also attempted to show evidence that this was the case, however they used Sourceforge.net, and it has been noted that this particular site has been slipping some shady files onto users' computers.\n\nFirst negative down, many to go....\n\nTo be blunt, the gameplay in this is plain  horrible , and it should have never left Greenlight. Whenever text-based adventure is mentioned, nearly everyone thinks of Zork. Zork is much, much, much better. The options for gameplay are so linear and unimaginative it really is a wonder why the developers even thought of trying to make this. Aside from the gameplay being rubbish, the amount of dead memes and things that 12 year olds would laugh at are more than abbundant, with nearly every gameplay option containing something akin to masturbating/masturbation. At the end of each stage there is an option to continue, so being optimistic I thought "Maybe this is just a joke, and there might actually be something worthwhile".... Boy was I wrong. Each level is set in a different location, but is nearly always a rehash of the last. Needless to say, I stopped quite soon afterwards.\n\nPros:\n-\n-\n-\nNeed I go on?\nCons:\nInstalls a trojan\nBoring, linear "gameplay"\nDead memes\nOverused jokes about masturbation\nTL;DR Don't waste your money on a trojan and some disappointment","December 12, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

It was a good choice for the dev to leave out audio.\n\nGraphics : 6 Once again this developer goes light on most of the regular 2d/3d graphics, he goes for an oldschool text based, picture oriented graphic style, so when you buy this you can expect to see some nice text pictures, but not any 2d/3d graphics.\n\nStory : 9 For the average text based game, this has a pretty good story, it may not be serious or make sense but it keeps a straight forward plot and isn't too confusing, so you dont have to worry about paying too much attention to it.\n\nComedy : 8 Since this game is *probably* taged comedy so I have to address this, so to get started, the jokes are mostly based on sex, but for most teenagers, thats pretty funny, but for kids it might be a bit, uh, "unsuitable", but again, for most teenagers and up this games comedy is perfect and never gets old, and as I've also said, make sure you explore to get the most laughs out of this game.","April 26","true","0.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","0"

It has cancerous pink text that gives your eyes aids and seizures, and it's best try at comedy is making masturbation jokes. I played this game in about 8 minutes. It's pathetic. Henrique Pegache, Rafael Lima, and Nuno Guerreiro should be ashamed of themselves and re-evalute their lives. This is the biggest waste of $.84 (Steam Summer Sale -15%| Usually $.99) ever created. Some games actually try to be good, but these guys literally sat at their computers, went on Youtube, and watched a tutorial by a dyslexic 12 year-old on his parent's Mac on how to make a simple text based game. Then they googled a brony fan-fic, took a ♥♥♥♥, pushed it into their CD Drive, right-clicked on their newly published "game", and renamed it "SpaceCorn". Then they uploaded it to Steam Greenlight, and somehow someway it got approved. Gaben... please... give us our $.84 and take this steaming pile a AIDS off the Steam market. Seriously.

It was honestly so worth it.

You might enjoy it :P\n\nThis game was enjoyable and it had its amusing parts throughout but the game is VERY linear, you are dropped in a world that feels like a pick-a-path adventure book but really all choices put you on the same path or you end up starting over. I really thought this game would be longer than it was... took me a space of 15mins to read through all text and explore every  possible option. I dont mind text based games but this one was way TOO short for even my liking. Still bought it with a discount, was not expecting much and really just wanted the badges and cards that came with.
