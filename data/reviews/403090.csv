For those who have played the first game, this one is also a time management game and has the same gameplay as the first one.  Again, you find yourself on an island community that has been ravaged by terrible weather and it is your job to direct your workers to clear rubble, repair buildings, etc.-all under a time limit.  The one noticeable addition to this game is the use of gasoline, which was clearly absent in the first one.  It is a necessary feature since this time, you have to put out fires and rescue stranded civilians in addition to the usual tasks.  Also, some tasks may involve helping injured citizens although I don't remember if this feature was in the first game.\n\nIn regards to whether this one is more difficult, I'd have to say yes.  The first game did come off as easy for me but it was the first in the series so it was more like an introduction.  However, a few of the levels here did prove to be challenging, as I had to replay them a few times in order to get the expert score.  There are a total of 50 levels like in the first one so there's plenty of gameplay, and there is the house feature again where the money you earn from completing levels will help to rebuild your home.\n\nThere are no Steam achievements although there are trading cards.  I do hope that achievements can be implemented someday.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed Rescue Team 2 and totally recommend it for anyone who loves time management games and wants a good one to spend time playing.","April 25","true","7.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It is too short, 50 levels, for full price.  I bought it on sale so I am satisfied.","May 6","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
