At its heart it is very simple and the age engine itself is Imo much easier to learn than some of the Clausewitz games e.g. HOI3. True the tutorial does not explain enough and formulating strategy is the main difficulty and can be very complex in the generally bigger original scenarios. Some of these are quite formidable multi-front affairs  (for these its best to look at the AARs on the ageod forum/youtube). Hence I would advice to get most of the dlc, especially BOR, Spartacus and Parthia. These are smaller, easier to manage affairs generally. (Hannibal is great too, but 2nd Punic war is quite big) (Cantabrian wars is hard). The AI can make mistakes e.g. placing its main army in cities that can fall at a stroke to a successfull siege, and other supply stuff, but overall it is pretty capable and can be a worthy adversary/ and can win sometimes.\n\nBut what I really enjoy about these strategy games is how much history I have learned from them. Like whether Pompey was right to go to the East and the pros/cons of adapting the corvus boarding devise to the Quinqereme ship. I also love the alternative history (but based on facts) Caesar's revenge scenario against Parthia (easy Roman whitewash :) ). I cannot emphasise how much it has taught me and makes me want to read more. In summary a true Roman game for true Romans :)","November 13, 2015","true","169.1"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","2"

When battles or skirmishes take place they are resolved abstractly, though the abstraction gives a pretty detailed depiction of the tactical characteristics that were likely to be in play.\n\nThis game is part of a series that includes Birth of Rome (the later phases of Rome's conquest of Italy, including the confrontation with Pyrrhus and the first Punic War), Hannibal (the second Punic War), and the Parthian Wars (Rome's Eastern Front).  These three games aren't on Steam yet, which is unfortunate, because watching the Third Samnite War scenario unfold feels a lot like reading Livy.\n\nThis is probably the best ancient history simulator on the market.  Learning how to play it can be a bit confusing at first until you realize that there aren't actually a lot of different kind of actions to master: most of what gets discussed in the manual is just a description of what's going on under the hood.","April 7, 2015","true","11.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","19","21","3","0"

I would say, it is the best game of the Roman period  on a strategic and operational scale.  The standalone titles are pretty nice, especially BoR and PAR.  Supply routes and weather conditions are substantial part of the the game, the command chain is well done and leader abilities can change the course of war.\n\nWhere light is , there is shadow. The worst on this game is the unstable engine, especially, if you run other programms in the backround. Furthermore you can search a long time for opponents, if you don't register in Ageod's Forum, which can be difficult, because there are constantly error messages, when I have tried to register and wrote four damn  letters to them, but they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about it, so I would suggest, you better try to register BEFORE you buy this game, because once you learned it, the AI  will be no challenge and no fun at all and if you don't know anyone, who play it, you find yourself in a ugly situation.\n\nWhat is the final score? I would give the game 8/10 ( 10-2 points because of stability issues) and 0/10 for Ageod Forum. Since it is concerning the game, because there is no pbem server, I would take it in the multiplayer part and my final rating is 8/20.\n\n","January 13, 2015","true","86.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","1"

Generally speaking it has all of the necessary components for a historical wargame. The battles themselves are quite hands off, the game focuses on the logistics leading up to a battle and then the calculations are made. It seems reasonably well researched, though it's more of a spreadsheet than an immersive experience as a Roman general/politician/powerbroker.\n\nHowever, what leads me to caution others about the game is the extremely poor optimization. The load times are bad, things get kind of choppy and unresponsive, and it just makes the whole experience a drag. You know this game is going to be a time investment to learn, and that poor optimization is going to drag the whole experience down as it aggregates. In this day and age, the discerning wargamer doesn't mind playing a game that could have been made in 1994, but it is expected to run fast and stable. As such, I cannot reccomend this game, unless you are an absolute fanatic of either Roman History or historical wargames.\n\nI will happily change my review to a reccommend if they improve the optimization.

If I ever learn it, I may even still.  However, the game is not for me.  Overly complicated management systems are fine when they are less obfuscated.  The tutorial teaches you the very basics, and then you are thrown into a set up limited turn scenario where you cannot waste turns figuring things out.  I cannot figure out how the economy works.  Some of that may just be that I am currently playing multiple games and don't want to spend the hours trying to learn it.  There are only a couple lets plays, and they move pretty quickly and either don't explain, or spend 15 minutes explaining the history of a feature in Roman civilization rather than how it functions in game.  I get it, some REALLY love Rome. I enjoy but not on that level.  Basically, I learned the paradox games no problem, but this one remains vague.\n\nTo top it off, the game engine is a pig.  You resolve a turn, and the game basically freezes until you get to a battle screen.  Turns take 30 seconds to a minute depending.  I hear that the game this engine is from "Pride of Nations" was much worse.  I really want to try the Civil War 2 game based on the engine, I am just afraid at that price that I won't be able to learn it.  I have limited gaming time these days with kids/wife etc, and don't want to spend a week of gaming time learning a system.\n\nThe game looks nice, although I have to play in in a crappy low res because the ffonts are so small I couldn't read it.  The game is all about reading text and figures, and I couldn't.  Not only size, but the particular font didn't blend well with the backgrounds thru my tv.  I play paradox games at 1080 with no problem, so I'm not exactly blind.\n\nI applaud the developers, and I'm sure there is a really nice game here.  For me, as a moderate wargame tactical fan, it is just too much when coupled with the bad UI and long turns that you cant even scroll the map during.  If I ever find the impetus to learn the game and put some time into it, I may change my vote.  Not bad, but not for everyone.  Romanophiles and serious warsim people may enjoy a bit more, or if you have some experience with the engine, which I do not.","November 24, 2014","false","8.0"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","15","34","0","10"

But as a gamer who has spent a ridiculous amount of time with games like Europa Universallis, Victoria 2, and many others like it. I was dissapointed at the steepness of the learning curve and the complexity and difficulty of performing simple tasks. The incredible shoehorning of forcing the player into roughly 5 or 6 scenarios with set turn limits was extremely limiting and dissapointing.","November 9, 2014","false","0.6"," 13 of 43 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","13","43","0","2"

The reward is to play the greatest roman era strategy game that is currently available.","October 14, 2015","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would go far as to say that if this was backed by a major game company it would easily beat Rome 2.","April 10","true","38.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
