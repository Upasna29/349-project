The graphics of the game are warm, friendly and inviting. Everything is simply laid out, I’d confidently say that even a complete novice could master the point and click interface to add Tribloos to individual tasks. It is by no means a strategy game to rival the likes of Command & Conquer or Civilization. It isn’t pretending to be either, what it is though is a bloody addictive cute little strategy game that will have you entertained for hours upon end. Although it seems the developers are paying more attention to the mobile market, the PC version is satisfactory and offers fun gameplay, which the fans of this kind of games will surely love.","July 16, 2014","true","6.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

A bit more if you want to achieve gold on everything.\n\nThe game has excellent balance.   Getting gold on a scene is challenging enough that you'll end up having to play many of them multiple times, while others you'll get right away.\n\nAll achievements can be made by simply playing the game from end to end inclusive of the bonus challenges.   One note:  Make sure you click "next".  If you click "back to menu" the game doesn't register what you've done in the scene as counting towards the achievements.  I played the scenes a couple at a time so found myself clicking back to menu quite often and when I did that none of the achievements were popping up (became very obvious when I needed to fix 10 pipes and I did the one scene with six of them twice that it wasn't working).\n\nFor a couple of dollars, well worth it.\n","January 4, 2015","true","13.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It’s really peaceful and provides quite the laid-back experience amidst all of today’s more violent games.\n\nThis is a time management game. You’re tasked with getting stuff done in a certain amount of time using the provided Tribloos. This usually entails building a certain amount of buildings or collecting a certain amount of items. For example, I may be tasked to build three homes, each of which adds five Tribloos to my workforce, or I could be tasked with making bread, which is a multi-step process for the Tribloos.\n\nThe game does have a story to it, although negligible. Trey’s village is in danger due to storms. Yes, rainstorms and such. Matilda the dragon, who usually blows the storms away, is too tired to blow away these new storms and the Tribloos are now tasked with protecting themselves from the dangers ahead. I don’t see how this story actually plays into what I do in the game, however. Does making bread help protect the village? Now that I think about it, this may be because they’re stockpiling food, although I’m unsure.\n\nThe game’s graphics are all hand-drawn and look fantastic. The Tribloos themselves look great, as do the game’s various buildings. Oh, might as well throw the backdrops in there as well, which are all very well done. The game also has its own original soundtrack, which was excellent. I wonder if the soundtrack is available for download separately?\n\nThe game has plenty of content to go around, for a game of this scale at least. There are 90 levels. Each takes a couple of minutes to beat on average. This is, however, if you just play through the game without the goal of getting all perfect scores, which I had difficulty with. A lot of times I would simply run the clock until I got a bronze rating, not on purpose though. I’m obviously doing something wrong with my time-management here, not that I have any in reality (okay, maybe I do).\n\nOverall, this game is quite a treat. It may be lost in the flood of indie games coming out these days, but I can give this game my recommendation. It may not be for the more hardcore gamers, but I certainly enjoyed it, and I consider myself one.","February 13, 2014","true","0.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The main game is cheesy, all-ages time and resource management, with some interesting mini-games in the mix. The timers on each level provide a decent level of challenge, and it's always possible to work out what you could have done to finish each level in time. The game functions well, the graphics all work together, the sound is a little annoying after a while, but easily muted. All in all a good game, but limited replayability means you should probably hold out for a sale.","April 27, 2015","true","47.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

To do this you send your tribloos from the main building to take care of business, wait for them to finish, make their way back and then send them to do the next thing.\nIt's a simple concept, and there isn't much of a challenge or pressure there. Levels are timed, but there's no penalty to taking your time, and I'd advise you just play things at your own pace.\n\nThe game slowly introduces new mechanics, like special headwear that helps you navigate the later environments more safely (like hardhats that save you from falling rocks in the caves). In the end there aren't any (positive) changes that truly shake up the core formula though, which isn't fatal to this otherwise neat little game.\n\nThe only frustrating thing in the game is the later levels attempting to add challenge in the form of environmental hazards. Especially the leaky pipes, which stops any passing tribloo and sends him/her/it back to the main building. This leads to some frustrating moments where you have to time sending your units out at exactly the right time, except you don't know when that time is since the travel time they take to reach the pipe is virtually impossible to estimate.\n\nAll in all this is a relaxing puzzle game. The flaws that are there are outweighed by its charm and the light-hearted story going on between levels.\nIt's not critical to have played the first game, which hasn't made its way to Steam yet, and it's a fun enough little game.","May 27, 2015","true","8.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's not a time management game as the time is only for arbitary bonus points. Unlike Alawar and similar light strategy games that follow overhead paths, this one goes the vertical and horizontal route. Also, it is possible to use up resources the wrong way and have to restart a level whereas the Alawar ones tend to not have a way to paint yourself into a corner.\n\nSome more aspects that make this game stand out to others in its class is the unique characters and story. Instead of following the tired "inspired by history" or "rescue the whatever" pattern, this one involves completely fictional creatures, the Tribloos. The story and dialog were entertaining and kept me going to figure out how it would end.\n\nConsidering this game was essentially made by 3 people, it's very impressive. It was a nice addition to my casual game selection. There's nothing stressful about this game, the levels and puzzles can be worked out, and getting 100% achievements is simply a matter of playing the game, including the Challenge levels.\n\nThe price is a bit on the high end, especially since the game has been out for over 3 years now, so you may want to wait for a sale. However, dedicated casual gamers might be willing to pay full price.\n\n---\n\nFor more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...

You are in control of sending your workers to collect resources or working on buildings. You get a better score by completing the level faster and having more resources. The thing I didn't like about Tribloos is the artstyle. It's unappealing and the reason I never installed the game in the first place.

You control a certain number of Tribloos to break up rock, build houses, sawmills, tool shops, etc...  As you move from world to world you will find unique things that you can work on, but the basic gameplay remains the same throughout.  Once you have the correct number of resources, icons light up for you to click on so that work can get started on those things.  It's casual in the sense that the strategic portion fo the game is not intense, however, it's even less intensified by allowing you to beat the game without every getting a silver or a gold medal.  This includes obtaining all of the achievements.  This game does not have a challenge whatsoever.  The gameplay has its bugs too.  From time to time I would click for those carrying wood to bring the wood to the Tool Shop to makes tools and I'd have to wait for the Tribloos to get back home before venturing off to another chore.  Other times it would work perfectly.\n\nThen there's the annoying parts.  For a timed game where you should complete a level within a certain amount of time, it's annoying to have your Tribloos sent back due to a pipe leaking gas from time to time.  It's a difficult task to time it correctly, let alone time it and finish within a good amount of time.  Same with the underground levels where your Tribloos can get hit by a falling boulder if you don't have hard hats on.  I get that it's part of the strategy, but when it's random luck, or based on timing compared to an actual strategy, then it's just not that entertaining for a game.\n\nThe sounds aren't bad and neither are the graphics for this type of game, but due to the issues that I ran into I can not recommend this game.  Try playing 12 Laborers of Hercules, you'll enjoy it more and it looks better.","November 10, 2015","false","19.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

But let's try this anyways without going into too much of details.\n\n"Tribloos 2" is a fine example of a good "more of the same" sequels; while the gameplay is for the most part unchanged, most notable difference are the new visual-style especially the outlook of Tribloos themselves (jokingly saying: Very-long-distance Barnapapa-relatives have chapeshifted into Mogwai-Ewok-Wookie-offsprings).\n\nStory-wise not having the experience of the first game isn't required for the most part mainly due similar premise alongside very "newbie"-friendly story-telling (I.E. Characters are explained briefly-enough without need of lenghty recaps and such; I just can't remmeber the name of the "trope" at the moment).\n\nStory while simplistic (and perhaps slightly dispointing in the end to some), is still a very delightful read / exprience-through: This is mainly due nowadays very uncommonly seen genuiely seen "smart-characters". Again, the Mogwai-analoque from earlier joke seems to be rather fitting here.\nFor possible "spoilers" though, browsing though the screenshots of this game might give a rather good idea of the characters in general.\n\n\nThe gameplay is very good change of pace in a puzzle / management-market which tend to quite frustating with too strict rule-set and such.\nOr what I am trying to say is that it's very enjoyable to be able to play games such as Tribloos which don't require lightining-fast thinking-reflexes alongside the need to thinking far too much ahead. Or anything else that would onstruct completing a simplistic game like this.\nPoint being, that aside of course the initial player mess-ups at the beginning of stages (E.G. not building the Saw Mill), all players are eventually going to be able to beat the stages alongside seeing this game through; the time-bonus is mainly for completionist, although even "casuals" might find excitement to get their planning and timing bring big high-scores.\n\n\n\nOf course, the biggest question probably would be "how much worth this game is?". I personally can say that these 10-USA$ certainly were a better investement than 60€ for a 3-hours-game.","June 25, 2015","true","10.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was told this was similar to lemmings and that's probably part of my disappointment, as that's one of my favorite game franchises - none of the anxiety and feeling of need to solve the issues present in lemmings is here - it's just a timer and apparently doesn't even matter if you complete on time to progress.","July 23, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"

Being a completionist certainly contributes to my long playtime - I finished every level with a Gold time rating - but also bear in mind that there are 90 levels to work your way through.\n\nOn the whole I think that there could have been more variety with the resources and more complexity to the resource chains, but at least it does have a fair variety and does have resource chains. Although I don't mean to mislead you here. This isn't a resource management game, it's more like a gentle logic puzzle that requires some timing.\n\nGameplayThis is a bit of a god game in that you order your little furballs around. There are set buildings to construct which require resources that you must gather. Some buildings produce resources or tools which you will need in order to access all of the buildings or special resource goals for each level.\n\nAlthough the basic concepts are rather simple, you must figure out the best order to perform various actions, as well as managing your timing well. You don't want to be short on a resource for a building when you should probably already be halfway through its construction!\n\nOne big downside would certainly be the repetitiveness. Some new resources will get introduced and the scenery changes every once in a while, but every level is pretty much the same thing. It never really ramps up the difficulty or complexity of the game.\n\nControlsAll done with the mouse. You click on the blue circles to initiate a job, and then you can choose to add or remove tribloos to that job. More tribloos means it will complete faster, but you will find you need to reassign some of them to other tasks.\n\nStorylineThere is a storyline with some rather nice comic strip style artwork. These little bits of storytelling happen throughout the game. I must say though that it was the artwork I enjoyed more than the story, which seemed to be rather one dimensional and the characters flat. Nothing ever made me feel particularly protective of the furballs or very concerned about their survival.\n\nThis might not the sort of game you buy for storylines, but if you're going to go to so much trouble to create all the artwork, I think that one should go to the same sort of effort with the writing.\n\nSoundI found the sound certainly complimented the game. It was generally relaxing music, although the sound effects were fairly innocuous. I would say that the sawmill's buzz-saw noise got tiresome after a while. The sounds at an end of a level along with the giant rainbow are definitely obnoxious, but one only has to suffer it at the end of each level.\n\nGraphicsI really enjoyed the art style of the game. Sure, it doesn't look terribly complex, but there is a nice organic feeling about it. Where the sound falls down, the visuals certainly pick up the slack.\n\nPros+ easy to lean to play and complete\n+ a little challenging to get Gold\n+ lovely art\n+ did entertain me for 25 hours\nCons-/+ treats the player like a child\n- dull, flat storyline\n- gets repetitive\n\nHelp me Help youPlease\n• give me constructive criticism in the comments - tell me why the review wasn't helpful\n• upvote my Steam review if you liked it so that others are more likely to find it too!\n\nRothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can.
