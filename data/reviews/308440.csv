"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/308440/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4250 products in account","This is a pretty solid little puzzle game, and I actually bought and beat it a few years back out of interest in the concept. I highly recommend it!\n\nTHAT SAID.\n\nThere are two types of levels in the game. Some are hand-made and thus have a set style of solution (with mild flexibility). These are perfectly okay. The other, though, are entirely procedurally generated beyond "there is a gem/rock/dirt in this square", and thus it will change details every time you reset.\n\nThose levels? Not so good. Unless you reset every time you begin, you won't see them coming, and they can go from "Well, this is doable" and you'll never notice, to "having made 3 'wrong' moves the stage is now mathematically impossible, and you won't know until the very end". It's hard to explain without having played it, but basically, this can turn a stage from "you need to consider every move" to "I pushed a gem and half of the level cleared itself before I did anything" ALL WITH THE SPAWN OF THE STAGE. These are the biggest flaw on Pushcat, and the best part about it is that unless you want to clear every level with a star, you can skip them or fake it with just a stage clear.\n\nBut if you enjoy the game, like me, you're probably going to go for those stars, and god have mercy on your soul when you hit a procedurally generated stage.\n\n(Other notes: the music is incredibly fun, being a very early cartoon/calliope style, with different layers of the song appearing as you clear the stage to various degrees. Also, some of the premade stages are incredibly clever and I wish the Steam release added new levels or something.)","January 16, 2015","true","6.4"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

Interestingly, the game specifically draws inspiration from the NES version of Boulder Dash, which I have something of an irrational love for after I spent most of my childhood playing it.\n\nThe mechanics are very simple: you need to collect a quota of silver coins from each level, but first you need to create the coins by pushing and dropping colored gems into rows of three. Later, there are some other ways that coins are created, as well as some other mechanics like blobs that eat rocks and bombs that destroy walls under certain circumstances. If you collect the coin quota and exit, you can progress to other levels, but you can also aim for a “star” quota on most levels by collecting even more coins. There are about fifty levels in all.\n\nThe game has many random elements. Some levels are completely random, others are generated based on a fixed template, but the specific contents of the level will change every time it's reloaded. Naturally, the random elements will occasionally screw you over, but for the most part it works as an interesting challenge feature.\n\nBut here’s the problem: about halfway through the game, there's a fearsome difficulty spike, and it basically becomes a masochism game. Ghosts will chase you, bombs will blow you up, puzzles will become super strict, and gem quotas will be so steep that you'll need to really stretch your brain about how you tackle a level and where you push things. Levels can get really long and it may take up to ten minutes just to set up a level correctly to produce the gems you need, especially for star quotas. There is no rewinding, and so dropping one gem in the wrong place could mean you need to start the whole level over again. You might also get caught by a ghost, blown up by a bomb, or trapped between rocks and need to restart. The final boss level can only be described as torture. On a positive note, there are no time limits to be seen, except when the level design creates them.\n\nThere’s also no leaderboards, extra levels, level editor, or anything else to encourage replay once you’ve collected all of the stars. At the end of the journey, game certainly feels like it's missing something.\n\nAlthough I personally enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to the majority of puzzle gamers. It's not an easy 100% for achievement hunters, and it's probably going to be a bit too far on the frustrating side for most people. If you really love Boulder Dash-type games and you’re okay with a challenge, you might like it as much as I did. Otherwise, there isn’t a lot to appeal to the average player or ease them into the genre, and you might wind up finding a bit too much to hate about it instead.","October 11, 2015","false","9.7"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

Action & movement are similar to classics like Dig-Dug, Mr. Do, and Boulder Dash. Pushcat can move freely in 4 directions, but blocks & coins will fall down until they either land on a surface or fall off the board. In addition to pushable gems and junk blocks, there are stationary wall blocks and diggable tiles.\n\nEach level has a coin quota you must reach in order to unlock the exit (as well as an optional higher quota to earn a "star" rating for the level), and most levels offer a limited supply of gems with which to create those coins. The trick lies in planning your moves so that you can make enough matches without getting stuck. There's no hard time limit, but some levels feature a ghost which will move slowly toward Pushcat, ignoring walls.\n\nSome of the block matching reminds me of Tetris Attack (or Puzzle League/Panel de Pon, whichever). Sometimes you're moving back and forth to drop blocks down a chasm, other times you're pushing a foundation of blocks in order to transport a few on top.\n\nI really like this game, but there are two intentional features that I don't fully appreciate:\n\n-In many levels, the music is sort of incomplete - some instruments won't kick in until you reach your coin minimum. I actually like when games play around with the instrument tracks like this, I just wish it didn't take until the exit opened for the effect to take place. You really only hear these songs fully when you stick around to try to earn a bonus star.\n\n-You have to push and hold against a block for a bit before it actually moves. There are very good reasons for this delay: You pretty much can't accidentally push a block (important, as there's no "undo", only "restart"). On top of that, allowing you to push blocks with no delay would likely allow you to intercept falling blocks. This would have puzzle-breaking potential. There are times when I let go too early because I misjudge the delay, and I have to go back and push again. Yes, this is my own error, but I feel like making the delay a bit shorter would help this somewhat.\n\n\nStill, those two minor gripes considered, this is a fun arcadey puzzle game. Give it a try.\n\nMussorgsky/10","September 1, 2015","true","15.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
