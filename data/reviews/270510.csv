"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/270510/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3057 products in account","EPOCH is an arcade shooter that harkens back to the days when Guncon games were in plentiful supply. As a title that began its life on a mobile platform, it’s all the more impressive that it remains as fun and entertaining as it is, and while it certainly suffers from a few slight impediments due to its original use of a smaller screen, EPOCH shines as a wonderful example of a regrettably dying and nearly gone genre.\n\n\n--Full review follows\n\n\nEPOCH is a lightgun game, make no mistake, and a decade ago, this title would have eaten up quarters in arcades. But where titles like Time Crisis would limit you to ducking in and out of static cover, EPOCH allows relatively free movement along a designated 2D plane, made up of three to four points the player can position themselves, depending on the level. And you will utilize every point, because while you may be able to hide behind cover from standard bullets, other enemies face no qualms about launching timed explosives at your position or firing lasers that can cut right through whatever you’ve chosen to hide behind.\n\nIn order to combat the insurmountable odds that you’ll face in the short (but wholly replayable) campaign, you will have to earn (or buy) the use of several varying weapon types and abilities. There are only around a half dozen weapon types, but each is unique and requires a different style of play to succeed with. Abilities you can earn through play or purchase in the store add a little more flair to combat, as they may serve to slow time or increase weapon speed and the like. You are also allowed counter measures in the forms of multi-target rockets and hand-held grenades, both of which can hold perks of their own, like acidic or electrical damage. You will need to learn to properly utilize all of the abilities and weapons at your disposal, as some levels will all but require a specific loadout to give you the upper edge in later difficulties.\n\nIn addition to the hour long campaign, Arena mode allows for never ending waves of increasingly difficult robotic adversaries, and provides a chance at leaderboard glory. In this mode, you can complete mini-missions that reward increasing amounts of credits, such as killing a number of enemies before getting hit or not using cover. Unfortunately, the rewards for simply playing and surviving are far from ideal, and considerably less than that of simply replaying story missions on hard difficulty. It’s a shame that there’s no form of co-op play, online or off, as this mode would benefit greatly from such an arrangement.\n\nHere, I’d like to make a note regarding general difficulty in this title, as I begin to speak more to the negative aspects present in the game. When you first begin EPOCH, you’re limited to the easy difficulty level, and to unlock the subsequent normal, hard and ultra difficulties, you will have to beat the roughly hour-and-half long campaign in each. The difficulty you’re originally relegated to, easy mode, is exactly that: way too easy. My first impressions of the game were constricted to this mode, and it almost caused me to quit early and write EPOCH off as a lame mobile shooter whose anemic difficulty simply couldn’t match up with the speed and precision of a mouse pointer. Quitting at this stage would have been a mistake, as upon reaching normal and hard difficulties, the game truly comes into its own, providing a challenging experience worthy of its arcade roots. So, while playing EPOCH, try and hold your bourgeoning opinions until after you’ve beaten the glorified tutorial/training mode that is the default difficulty.\nAs little as I enjoyed the default difficulty, it does serve a purpose beyond training you. Every time you beat a mission, you earn credits, experience points, weaponry, and snippets of dialogue from members of the world’s citizenry, all of which reveal the story of EPOCH’s world, and what led to the events of the campaign. Having read a healthy portion, I’ve enjoyed what bits of story I’ve pieced together. Collecting these snippets has become a driving force for replaying missions, beyond the leveling and credit farming. The simple fact is, forcing you to play through each difficulty allows you to earn story pieces and the necessary credits to buy the more expensive weaponry, thereby reducing any potential need to grind at later difficulties.\n\nFor the obvious question, what mobile shortcomings made it in to the final product?, the answer is, not many. The store menu that you navigate has clearly been tailored to smaller screens, and the in-game symbols for your various recharging abilities hang out way up in the upper right corner of your screen, just outside of your peripheral vision, and in the heat of things, this can be a slight hindrance until you memorize cool-down times. It could be argued, too, that slight movement quirks could be attributed to the game’s original format. Moving to and from cover can feel stiff and slow, making it difficult to find a solid opening from which to return fire. This may of course be a design choice, but it bugs me nonetheless.\n\nOn very rare occasion, upon entering a new grid in any one of the dozen or so missions, my character will either initially ignore my input commands completely, or be firing his weapon without my say so. This issue has never gotten me outright killed, but it has caused me to lose several hit points in more than one instance.\n\nMy final thoughts, after having just reached the aptly named and truly brutal Ultra difficulty, is that EPOCH is an exceptionally commendable mobile-to-PC port, whose gameplay transfers beautifully to a mouse and keyboard. It looks great, and with so few of the issues that typically plague mobile ports, and gameplay that could have satisifed lightgun fanatics even in a modern arcade, EPOCH stands as one of the finer of the few remaining shooting galleries available in a home setting.","June 5, 2014","true","6.7"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","42","49","2","6"

No, really – I'm not sure the other weapons are that useful.\n\nI feel like I got my -50% sale money's worth, but the gameplay mechanic isn't that deep or engrossing. You figure out how to clear a scene (concentrate on specific enemy types first, stay hidden or keep moving depending of the enemy type) and then you move on to the next one.\n\nThere's a level-up mechanism and a shop, and once you buy better weapons and gear, everything suddenly gets much easier. That's bound to make playing through pretty unbalanced if you pick the right gear or grind already beaten levels, I suppose, but the final difficulty level certainly taxed my non-grinded build on maximum weapons and armor.\n\nI'd buy the sequel.","June 27, 2014","true","8.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Epoch will show you how.\n\nIt's a light-gun style cover shooter where most enemies take over a clip to take down, so each encounter feels exceedingly long and drawn out. Combine that with leveling AND a shop weapon upgrade system and you got the usual unevenness that comes with variable stats figuring into gameplay. All the best classic arcade lightgun games moved you along at a brisk pace. Epoch slows it down quite a bit, which is not necessarily a bad thing but Epoch just takes it too slow. The gunplay feels like you're blasting health bars rather than scrapheads and as a result, the thing you're doing all game, shooting, just feels like a giant chore.\n\nThe initial difficulty is almost insultingly easy and the game expects you to play through it multiple times to unlock the higher difficulties (Along with payouts orders of magnitude greater to give you stat-appropriate weapons for that difficulty level.), and, to its credit, the game does open up a bit on that second playthrough where you can occasionally pick out a weapon that beats the HP bar curve, but nothing new can really be introduced by this point. They had enough content for the first run and that's really it. Everything else now is just a retread that plays slightly faster.\n\nAnd that's the problem, the developers can't just go back and patch open all the difficulties from the get go as they are balanced around you having accrued the requisite grind beforehand so there is just no damn good way for them to fix that oversight. Once again, stats and grind attached to a game add negative value.\n\nI will admit the final boss is good fun but I cannot bring myself to go through the game enough times to get to see what he's like on higher difficulties.","June 8, 2014","false","1.6"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","22","35","0","2"

The most was positive and there was a negative comment made. So this made me reluctant to purchase this game at first. But then I looked through the comments again and the description the developers wrote. I've bought a lot of, in my opinion, bad games that I've either finished and will not play again or that I've not finished and did not have the desire to do so - hence my reluctance to purchase this game. Was this going to be one of those that I own which I wish I didn’t? Then I though what the heck ... the game is on special, what can I lose. To my surprise the size was very small and I thought "o yea, it's one of those". But after I have played for a bit I decided I liked this game. It may be arcade style, but nevertheless the gameplay caught on and I really enjoyed it. It's a game that I can play after a day of hard study when my mind is burned out and I just don't want to think anymore (I mean that in a good way) ... I just want to relax and blow up stuff to get rid of all my tension. So my final verdict ... I think for a good price this game is really not bad. Its fun, sometimes challenging. So for this "trash" (to use a quote) I'll give it thumbs up. Thanks guys.","June 12, 2014","true","4.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

You are either standin' and shootin' or crouching to reload. With a small selection of robots types used in many different lethal ways you will not fall prey to forgetting what the robot does as its weapon- rather to the selection of covering fire and synergy of the different weapons.\n\nWhile the game is not based around 'strategy' as such is certainly rewards you for use of stun grenades to remove covering fire, or decoys to provide a moment to reload and focus on the main threat.\n\nWhile the content is not exactly 100 hours worth, considering it was originally a phone game it is quite a lot. A bonus is the fact that when the difficulty increases the robots stats dont go up- they come in more numbers, and more combinations.\n\nOverall EPOCH is a fun, simplistic, family friendly 3rd person shooter which will keep you entertained (and frustrated) for hours.","June 8, 2014","true","14.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The basic controls are move left, move right, dodge shoot, and don't get killed. It has a underline story in the game, and well done music and visuals which help tie everything together.  The game play is balanced with the gear as you gain items from each mission and buy upgrades making your progress feel stronger the more you play. Their are different type of weapons to choose from and abilities making your play style feel  a little more like you want but no in depth customization on those items. The items have weight and feel stronger as you progress and gain stronger weapons. Difficulty scales well and while the game play may be repetitive, it is fun and fair to the players time.
