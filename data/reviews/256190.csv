A game where you play as a reistance fighter, stealing supplies and ammunition from the enemy, using sabotage and hit and run tactice to strike back at the Nazi war machine." Well then good news! Enemy Front does not let you do this.\nIn Enemy Front, you too can go on (now famous, but at the time top secret!) British SOE/Norwegian commando raids as an American journalist for some reason, or sink famous German ships that never actually sank until after the war.[www.german-navy.de]\n\nIn exchange for the ability you have unfortunately lost the power to leap over even small fences, thus making it impossible to go anywhere the devs don't want you to go, but at least you can freeroam inside the nice little linear road they've set out for you. Plus, there's those convenient little infinite ammo boxes every twenty seconds, which is good, because otherwise you'd be at risk of running out occasionally and would have to conserve your ammunition, since you only carry four reloads for any given weapon (regardless of whether this is 20 KAR98 sniper rifle bullets, 20 KAR98 bullets (which are somehow different) or like 400 PPSH rounds) at a time.\n\nThrill at the nonscripted pleasure of running away from an exploding building down a fixed, linear path, then being knocked down by an explosion and helped back up in a cutscene! Not once, but twice! It's like no FPS you've ever played before, and definitely not one that came out in 2007 and starred a man with an enormous moustache!\n\nMarvel at the time-travelling French resistance member who inexplicably gives you an STG-44 during a flashback to 1940, two years before that weapon's design was finished, and three years before the first one was built!\n\nChuckle warmly as the game provides you with a demolition objective, which is coincidentally the only destructible object in its "Engaging, destructible environment"! Clap appreciatively as you find the explosives you need literally right next to the objective - again! Wonder aloud why you can't place those charges on any of the other nearby things, even though you've done so before, then realise it's because the devs didn't think far enough ahead to provide an alternate route in their 'open-ended levels' in case you used up all your explosives!\n\nSigh indulgently as you breach through yet another door and go into slow motion to shoot all the nazis inside, not forgetting the guy who gets knocked onto his rear by the exploding door basically every single time.\n\nWhoop with joy as you destroy the Nazi war machine's vaunted Panzers by shooting their frontal armour once, with a single shot antitank weapon! Gleefully call that weapon a Panzerschreck, even though it is clearly a Panzerfaust!\n\nGet really mad because this game's devs clearly put no effort into their research and have no idea what actually happened in World War 2!\n\nPost sarcastic reviews about it instead of doing something productive with your life!","June 16, 2014","false","17.6"," 1,621 of 1,771 people (92%) found this review helpful 83 people found this review funny","92","621","1","83","63"

It is great that CI Games chose to centre their story around the Warsaw Uprising, a conflict that has previously been untouched by games and film, but the story fails to engage the player, and the characters are not developed well. The terrible enemy AI further damages the single player campaign, making many of the missions more tedious then fun to complete. All this coupled with dated graphics, and a multiplayer system that doesn't bring much to the table, and lacks dedicated servers, means that the high price tag Enemy Front demands is not worth it. I recommend buying this game when it's on sale, as a player should not expect to get more than eight to ten hours of game play out of it. Even when taking into consideration the decent gun play, sometimes beautiful environments and great loading screens, I can only score Enemy Front as 4 out of 10.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe structure of the campaign missions is good on the whole. Players are regularlygiven the choice as to what order they complete certain missions and once in the mission are free to approach the objectives how they wish. Enemy Front has a decent stealth mechanic which offers a sneaky route to victory through backstabing and hiding bodies, but this is let down by the lack of a defined cover system. Rather than have the player press a button that would draw them into cover they instead just move behind the various objects in the levels. This run behind something and hope for the best cover system often results in the player being discovered by the enemy and having to shoot their way out. By the second mission in I was so frustrated by the lack of cover system that I stopped trying to stealth kill characters and instead went in guns a blazin'.\n\nCombat in Enemy Front is a mixed bag, with a good variety of detailed weapons that are consistent with the World War II timeframe,but some of the worst AI I have seen in a long time. All of the guns on offer look great, and react as expeted, with differing accuracy, damage and recoil depending on the gun. The game offers a good sniping system with the player able to scope their target, hold their breath causing the rifle to steady and time to slow, before firing off an amazing shot killing their opponent. The sniper rifle is an extremely powerful option, which motivated me to use it in most situations, but by the end of the game I was so damn sick and tired of seeing the slow motion bullet vision of my shots.\n\nEnemy Front AI is terrible, and enemies often struggle to hide behind cover, and are all too prepared to come running head strong through doorways where a pile of dead bodies is already present.  I found the most effective way to win missions was to snipe one or two guards then wait around a corner or through a doorway for the rest of the guards to come running through in single file. During other missions I would find guards looking in the wrong direction during fire fights or staying behind cover without firing until I moseyed on passed their defences and killed them point blank. The AI of your companions is also atrocious, with them being unable to kill enemies who are standing in the open, and with them often pushing you out from behind cover as they try to follow their own scripted path. All of these AI issues are further compounded by game play and graphical glitches. These glitches didn't happen too often but I find it extremely annoying when a game crashes during loading due to poor programming.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nEnemy Front offers a couple of standard online multiplayer match options with one new match type for players to try their hand at. Players can choose between deathmatch, radio transmission and team deathmatch. Deathmatch and team deathmatch are the standard game types for FPS multiplayer, but radio transmission offers a slight tweak to the map point capturing game type. Radio transmission matches see two opposing teams of up to 6 players fight it out to control varying map points in an effort to bounce a radio transmission through a level. I struggled to find many people online and due to a lack of dedicated servers suffered from massive pings unless I made my own server. This issue of high pings along with a lack of community support made the Enemy Front multiplayer a tedious endeavour.\n\nVISUALS\nAs a whole the game looks dated with many of the enemy models being repeated, textures looking flat, and draw distances fluctuating, with objects sometimes appearing out of thin air. This game would have been far more competitive visually at the start of the last console generation, but seems out of place in today's market. Having said this it is refreshing to be able to run a new game at full tilt graphically on my old rig and even with these graphical short comings some of the European environments did look beautiful. Also Enemy Front does have some of the best looking loading screens I have seen in a long while.\n\nFor my full review and heaps of other delicious content see Glitch[glitchnews.com.au]","October 15, 2014","false","9.4"," 246 of 323 people (76%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","76","246","323","17","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/256190/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Remember the first time you parachuted into occupied (virtual) Normandy, France in the dead of night? Took out those German patrols stealthy-like? Created a distraction so your comrades-in-arms could take the beachhead and secure a landing site? Or remember being packed in an LCU (VIRTUAL), sea water and vomit sloshing beneath you; the Atlantic tossing you about like a plaything before your ship slammed into the beach? The ramp lowered, bullets chewed your men up around you; imposing, gray, gloomy skies contrasted that red, roiling surf? I sure as ♥♥♥♥ do. The developers of “Enemy Front” also remember. They remember and they want you to TOO.\n\nIt's been years since we've gotten a great WWII shooter. DAMN OUR HUBRIS. “Developers, we are SICK of killing Nazis. Come on, let's see something new,” we cried. “Okay, how about Nazi zombies?” they replied. And we were content for a time. But we wanted more. So they decided to drown the market in Tom Clancy Russian/Arab/Chinese right-wing wet dream masturbatory aid for the last SEVEN years. It's gotten more boring than WWII ever was. Because history is tangible. It happened. It happened to our grandparents. We can read books and watch documentaries and visit sites. It's real. It's powerful. Pretend future conflicts just aren't the same. They aren't bad, no! Just different. They don't have the same staying power. Remember my first paragraph? Bet you all remembered each of those moments vividly as I described them. Okay, now reflect on some of the latest modern shooter moments. OH ♥♥♥♥, REMEMBER THAT TIME YOU GOT NUKED? Yep. That was pretty heavy. WHAT ABOUT THE GHILLIE SUIT CHERNOBYL LEVEL?!? Oh yeah, that was excellent! Got anything else? No? Okay.\n\nSo I hope I've made my position in this debate clear. Now this WWII shooter might not be the savior we're looking for, but it's a fine first effort. The story is interesting, but Citizen Kane this is not. The characters are interesting but one note, underdeveloped, and underutilized. But this is to be expected from the genre. This isn't why we play WWII shooters though, is it? No. We play them to kick Nazi butt. So what little suffers from the weaker story elements the gameplay salvages.\n\nYou can approach a level in one of two ways: either come in Captain America style, rocking Nazi faces with your raw and unrelenting patriotism, or you can hit them Sam Fisher stealth style. This duality is very rewarding. The gunplay is great. I can feel the jolts up my arm; I feel the impact of each bullet, whether it's striking flesh or cover. I feel totally immersed. I'm a grimy, grizzled, Nazi-blood-hungry warrior – I'm not playing a video game in my underwear, hungry for day old pizza. The AI is serviceable. I'm playing on expert difficulty. They tend to rush in, unfortunately. Sometimes they display tactics, but on at least a few occasions I've taken a shot in an open area and fallen back, watching them funnel one by one into my death corridor. But otherwise they're competent – just don't expect “Brothers in Arms” tactics. The graphics are excellent, especially considering this is also a PS3 and Xbox 360 release. The ruined cities feel alive, buzzing and burning. The countryside is verdent and beautiful, still scarred by the brutality of war. And the sounds, last but not least, the sounds. Bullets whiz and ping, Germans shriek and shout orders, bombardments are heavy. The score is a little repetitive but it certainly is soaring and epic, fitting for the setting. If the gameplay makes this immersive, then the sound design is the icing on the cake.\n\nA few gripes worth mentioning. I'm a resistance fighter. Thank God the Germans just left open ammo crates lying around everywhere otherwise, I don't know, I might have had to drop my weapon, change things up! And I'm tired of every European out of WWII speaking near perfect English. I wouldn't have minded subtitles; French speaking French, Polish speaking Polish. Finally, the game touts open worldness as a feature and pressures you to explore. I wish there were some collectables... propoganda leaflets and art, love notes and correspondence. History. An unfortunate missed opportunity.\n\nSo for my fellow history buffs and historical war enthusiasts AND EVEN A FEW OF YOU MODERN FANATICS, I think you'll have a good time with this game. It has serious nostalgia potential. You will likely smile and reflect on your time with this game when you're finally finished playing. For thirty bucks this is well worth your time. This is almost AAA quality. You owe it to yourself to give it a try.\n\nNow go liberate (VIRTUAL) Europe.","June 10, 2014","true","7.6"," 772 of 1,081 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","772","1","3","45"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/256190/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","Enemy Front puts you in the shoes of an intrepid American reporter covering the war’s more inglorious theaters. Though it's packaged as a first-person shooter, it feels more like a puzzle game with guns. Case in point: I'm early in the single-player campaign, and I need to blow up a bridge in the French countryside. The main path to my objective is stocked with a half-dozen Nazi strongholds, and when I'm spotted, all the soldiers come pouring out as though they're controlled by an alien hive mind. After dying over and over again, I accidentally discover an alternate path that lets me flank everyone, sneak my way to the bridge, then watch it come tumbling down without firing a shot. That discovery makes me feel smarter, and it’s far more rewarding than blasting away hordes of enemies.If you’re saying to yourself “oh man, I hate stealth games”, don’t sweat it; Enemy Front still gives you plenty of opportunities to blow stuff up. There are scads of missions where you rush through bombed-out buildings in close-quarters combat, manning machine guns, sniping from church towers, and destroying tanks with Panzerfausts. These action segments are smart punctuation to the larger missions where stealth is clearly the best path to success.Almost as impressive as the variety of action Enemy Front delivers are the areas you’ll explore. The bombed-out horrors of Warsaw are strikingly juxtaposed with the bright French countryside and the bitter cold of snowy Norway. Even the loading screens contain gorgeous, original 3D visuals that depict moments in time from the viewpoint of very different character-- army officers, terrorized civilians, and nonchalant soldiers doing their duty.Enemy Front also doesn't hold back on controversial subjects. At various points, you’ll come across depictions of atrocities being committed against civilians and partisans--and if you don’t act quickly, you’ll be confronted with the nasty results. Choosing to rescue a person who's about to be executed may be a heroic act, but it also means getting discovered and attacked by the enemy. Later on, you’ll have a harrowing walk through a barely-functioning Warsaw hospital that's under constant bombardment. In its crumbling halls, dying people beg for assistance--you can choose to help them or not. There are few easy choices.That said, I can't help but wonder if Enemy Front was too ambitious a project, as there are a host of problems that really detract from the experience. Transitions in and out of cutscenes are very rough, and the sound mix makes it difficult to hear what characters are saying over the orchestral score. You meet a host of characters as the story unfolds, but the brevity of the conversations doesn't explain your transformation from a notebook-carrying reporter to a gun-toting one-man army; why exactly are you willing to risk your life for these people you barely know? What's more, bizarre moments are frequent. Watching a fellow soldier fire an invisible rifle through a window is a bit strange, as is seeing an unmanned rifle flop around on the floor, repeatedly shooting at the walls as though it has some sort of grudge against concrete structures.Then there's the AI characters and enemies, whose behaviors are often erratic. Enemy soldiers rush right at with the intent to kill, then stand there for a moment or two before opening fire.The single-player campaign is the heart of Enemy Front, but there is a functional--if bare-bones--multiplayer component as well. Featuring three run-of-the-mill modes and a handful of interesting combat arenas, it offers little depth and feels tacked-on.In some ways, Enemy Front succeeds in standing out in a crowded genre. Impressive visuals and expansive levels merge create memorable locations. And though some stages very obviously award stealthier playstyles, the gunplay is enjoyable when you're not overwhelmed with enemies. Unfortunately, a raft of weird bugs, mindless enemy behavior, and a multiplayer mode that feels like an afterthought shoot Enemy Front's potential square in the heart.Overall 6/10.","February 15, 2015","true","170.4"," 127 of 168 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","127","168","10","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/256190/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Enemy Front is a World War II themed FPS game. This game kind of snuck under the radar, as I can't remember it being released. You play as an American war correspondent who is caught up with various different Resistance groups across Europe during the war.\n\nThe game uses CryEngine 3, so you can safely assume the graphics are going to be top notch but you will need a fairly hefty rig to play them on full though. I am not sure why there is so much lens flare going on, since normally games have silly amounts of it to make up for lackluster graphics.\n\nGame play wise, Enemy Front is an FPS at core, but there are quite a lot of times where stealth is required, the stealth parts of the game are actually a lot better than the gun play, I loved sneaking around the enemies base sabotaging lighting systems, distracting guards and finding alternative routes through rooms. It's certainly not on the level of Dishonored for stealth, but it is refreshing to see a World War II include it as a feature.  Another aspect that is done very well, are the Sniper sections; what's better than sitting back hidden in the trees popping the heads of Nazis? Can't think of much! It's so satisfying to see groups of guards become so confused as their comrades slowly start dropping to the floor.\n\nThat brings me onto the AI, sadly it's not the smartest, you can be shooting your un-silenced gun in clear view of a guard, and he won't notice you; sadly this removed some of the immersion for me, leaving me a little confused at times whether a guard will hear me or not in some situations.\n\nEach of the levels in Enemy Front are giant. There are about twelve levels in total, and each one has lots of hidden secrets, pick ups and Easter eggs to find. There has been a lot of work put into the environment here which most people will probably just pass on by, but there is a lot to see if you take the time to explore buildings and rooms off the beaten path - nothing that will effect your game play though.\n\nI didn't find the game to be over difficult; there is a nice gentle raise in difficulty as you progress through the game so you don't suddenly become overwhelmed. You certainly get the "Bad @ss" feel when you manage to mow down a squad of enemies all on your own, and you will quite easily be able to take on more than just a single squad too.\n\nThe single player story took me about eight hours to complete; as I said above, there are about twelve levels to play through, each level has several objectives and secondary objectives if you wish to play it too the full. Secondary objectives only really offer ammo resupplies, so you don't really miss out on much if you skip over them.\n\nSo to conclude, I would recommend people consider picking Enemy Front up. The game does come with a pretty steep price tag, and I believe I picked this up for £10 off ♥♥♥, so at that price I think I have found a bargain, but I wouldn't say it's worth the full £29,99. Keep your eyes out for when this drops below 50%.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The problem with Enemy Front is that the controls are relic-like. When walking you feel like you are part trudging through muck and part floating through the air on a rubbery cloud. The aiming is not precise either and thankfully the AI rounds are not very lethal. You can quite literally stand up from behind cover with a Kar 98k and plink away until your heart is content. The controls make for some aggravating multiplayer as well.\nI wish that I could give Enemy Front my blessing, but unless a major overhaul occurs, it looks as though this will not be a happy return to the old WW2 clandestine days of old that Medal of Honor ushered in.

Not optimised well (horribly in fact). I'm looking at the DVD cover and some of the claims made on the box are almost a lie..it boasts of having 'Advanced Sniping Technology' and the description on the back seems to imply a sandbox game with multiple paths to take. The game is actually incredibly linear with few options available to achieve goals.\nTry and cut cross country to an objective and you'll find an invisible wall. In fact there are invisible walls everywhere (totally unacceptable in 2014)\n\nI'm fnding the single player enjoyable but I can still recognise that in many ways it's a shoddy piece of work. There's nothing advanced or new here.\nThere's one thing about games like this that is a minor irritant to me. You get so sick of countless WW2 and WW1 games actually attempting to re-write history so you can play as an American. Theatres of war that were amazing but involved other countries. If it was a conflict between England and Germany for example, then for god's sake just let the character be English or German. How many times have we played a game where the story-line goes something like..."I was an American reporter in France and now I'm fighting in the French resistance..and everybody speaks English..how lucky is that!".....or....."What's a bloomin yank like you doing in the trenches of the Somme in 1917...cor blimey!"\nPlease, game devs don't do that any more....it's a subtle insult to the countries in those theaters of war that did actually fight in them.\nIf you want to honor the dead, then please don't re-write history to suit your target market.\n\nI am enjoying playing it in the same way I would enjoy watching a badly made action movie.\n\nI would recommend this game if it appears on sale and should cost no more than $5 tops.\nYou will get the same kind of experience (or possibly better) if you buy MOH Warchest or MOH Airborne.\n\nActually MOH Airborne really is a sandbox game and may look even better than this graphically and it was made in 2007.\nAs ive said before, I can see that the multiplayer might be alot of fun but nobody is online.\nIn future I will look at anything made by this developer (CI Games) with extreme caution. They seem to have hung this game out to dry the minute they released it.","September 19, 2014","false","5.2"," 39 of 54 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","39","54","4","8"

I was hoping this was going to be a good WW2 multiplayer game, however it just isn't for quite a number of reasons:\n\n- Only 3 types of multiplayer modes: Radio Transmission (Essentially domination from Battlefield/CoD), Team Deathmatch & Deathmatch (Free for all). Lacking a Search & Destroy type gametype.\n\n- Only 4 multiplayer maps, none of which are particularly great.\n\n- I was searching earlier today during Steam's usual 'peak times' & was only able to find 11 servers, all of them unranked & 2/3's of them were empty. Very small playing community just days after it's release.\n\n- The gunplay, very, very random. I'm used to playing games like Call of Duty, Arma, Battlefield etc in which bullets go where your gun is pointing when you aim down the sights. It's fine for the most part with the single shot weapons, but for automatic weapons even burst firing, there are shots that look they should be cutting people in half but instead are missing. Very poor hit registration... or could be lag.\n\n- Controls, a lot of bugs that make them feel unresponsive. One example is in the middle of a reload, if I say have spotted someone & press shift to sprint, he stops the reload, which is fine, but doesn't sprint. Your character just stops the reload meaning you've to press shift again to sprint to cover. I doubt this is actually intended by the developers, but if it is, then it makes your character feel unresponsive.. and in a shooter it's quite important that your character moves when you want & shoots when you want.\n\nOverall the game feels very unfinished, at least from a multiplayer perspective. The game runs on the CryEngine which is the same engine used for Warface, a free game that feels far more responsive & well polished, whereas this game (at least on Steam) is £23.99.. (or £12.59 if you get it where I got it). I think even £12.59 is too much for it as I doubt the single player will even show that much worth of value. Game needs a couple of big patches I feel to take it on par with even Warface's multiplayer as well as adding more depth to the multiplayer with more maps & game modes.","June 13, 2014","false","4.5"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

This is a truly awful game, one that's awfulness will stick with you for some time.  There is nothing "modern" about this game apart from being developed with Cryengine 3.  The shooting mechanics are sub-par, the story is terrible, the AI is absolutely spoon-in-rear dumb, and the level design is more linear than the shooters it claims to seperate itself from.  The AI has no sense of awareness whatsoever, and will blindly shoot around you while you demolish them.\n\nThe game is advertised as being some new take on non-linear gameplay where you can "shoot, snipe, or sneak" your way through Germans.  Yeah, ok...  The "stealth" mechanic amounts to basically an awareness bar, which is comical considering how dumb the AI actually is.  You can crouch walk 5 feet in front of an enemy, and if done fast enough it won't trigger any kind of reaction.  It's a total joke.\n\nWhich brings us to the claim of "sniping."  The shooting mechanics are the same iron-sight/run and gun gameplay from the original Call of Duty.  I'm not sure what is "original" about run-and-gun with an MP40, right click to iron sight with a Kar98k.  The weapons are woefully underpowered, sans the scoped Kar98k... which is interesting because apparently adding a scope to the weapon increases it's power ten fold over the standard Kar98.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, it's a complete joke.  Standard run-and-gun gameplay will have you entertained for about 2 minutes.  There aren't any dedicated servers in North America, so you are stuck playing on player-hosted lagfests.  It just sucks... not just sucks, but really really sucks.  Rarely do I regret game purchases, as I can generally find something I'll enjoy, but this is an exception.  Across the board this game is a big negative.\n\nI don't write reviews very often but was driven to do so in this case.  The description of the game is a complete farse, so much so that I'm laughing writing this.  I'm not ticked that I spent the money really, it happens.  We all buy terrible games sometimes hoping for the best.

The guns aren't particularly satisfying, the AI is braindead (either running straight at you or standing behind crates and popping out every now and then) and the voice acting is dire. There is a stealth system, but it isn't particularly functional (which isn't helped by saves being checkpoint-based and the checkpoints being far apart).\n\nThe campaign levels are short and aren't very distinctive - they're almost always just a linear progression from A to B while shooting through the aforementioned braindead AI. Although the game is quite pretty if you have all the graphical bells and whistles turned on (it's CryEngine 3), most people will need to tone the graphics down (especially post-processing and lighting effects), at which point the game becomes rather ugly.\n\nMercifully, four and a half hours was all it took me to make it all the way through the campaign, at which point I was very happy for it to end.\n\nIn short, stay away - it's a bad budget shooter that is inexplicably being sold at the $50 price point.","June 19, 2014","false","5.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

First off, when the storage page promises a ''truly modern'' fps game, this is NOT what I expected. Lets go through some of the pros and cons of this game, based on the couple of hours that I, at the time of writing this, have forced myself through.\n\nThe pros:\n-The game looks good during gameplay. The enviroment as well as the characters looks smooth.\n-The voice acting is good during gameplay. The yells of both allies and enemies are clear and sound somewhat ''realistic''.\n-The game is interesting. Personally being a fan of history, especially the ww2 era, I find the story behind the game very interesting.\n\nThe cons: PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING ELSE!\n-The game is glitchy: enemies see you through walls, appear out of nowhere and do all kinds of random things, which not only makes the experience total crap, but also makes the game unplayable.\n-The controls of the character are wierd. Trying to navigate through a ruined city with a character that apparently suffers from cerebral palsy while trying to shoot enemies and figure out what the hell you're supposed to do is pretty painful.\n-The bugs in this game are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥: If you aim down the sights of a gun, you can crouch and stand back up, right? Well, in this game that works with everything but snipers; with snipers you can crouch while aiming, but can't stand back up. There are buildings that you can walk in just normal, but if you crouch and try to stand back up, you can't. The detection system in this game is also just stupid. If enemies notice you (Which can also happen if you throw too many rocks btw. I know, right?) they will alert others of your presence. That's cool even if it happens a little wierd (the enemy notices you and everyone IMMEDIATELY knows where you are), but in this game some the enemies don't know what's going on and just run around and then suddenly realize where you are when everyone else is dead. This has caused me to run after enemies countles times, because the enemy is determinate to get to where-ever is was when the others noticed me. So annoying.\n-The gun animations: If you shoot at an enemy and your character starts to put another bullet into the gun or pull the bolt of the rifle, you can't do ANYTHING. You can barely walk forwards, which is somewhat annoying when you have a gazillion enemies shooting at you.\n-The objectives: Half the time you just end up running around wondering WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ you're supposed to do. The game gives you the main objectives and the ''secondary missions'', but you don't get any info as to what you're supposed to ACTUALLY do. The first time you encounter a tank, the game says you either need a bazooka or two grenades. Well, I only have one grenade, sooo, where's the bazooka? Who knows? You have to play this annoying game of hide and seek with 90% of the things you're supposed to pick up. All I'm wondering is WHY? Why, for the love of god, isn't there any indication as to where you are actually supposed to go?????\n\nThat's all I can come up with right now. Bottom line is, don't buy this game unless the developers do some serious fixing with the game. This game is the cheap mix of Sniper Elite and Far Cry, both of which I would recommend over this.","June 15, 2014","false","2.0"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

One such things are WW2 FPS games. While everyone yells and screams on the internet that we have enough of those, I've on the other hand been dreaming about HD remaster of MOH – Allied Assault on Frostbite engine or some new COD returning to Europe’s battlegrounds of 1940’s. Buying this game, after reading all the reviews , I thought that it shouldn’t be that bad, but it really is...\n\nYou are playing as Robert Hawkins, an american journalist, who covers different resistance's actions in Nazi occupied Europe. Story mainly takes place in Warsaw, during city’s uprising against German army, however trough some flashbacks game will take you to the various locations around Europe like France or Norway. So in the terms of different levels, game has some variety to offer in it's 7-9 hours campaign. You’ll be fighting in the streets of Warsaw, snowy mountains of Norway, french countryside and so on. Story isn’t anything original and breath taking, its quite boring and filled with cliches, but we don’t play these games for story, right ?\nThis tittle also has multiplayer with some modes like Death-match and Team Death-match in it, but it’s practically dead, I could find server to play maybe 3 times, and it didn’t last more than one round.\n\nFor me the game runs fine, I had almost constant 60 FPS and game crushed once trough my play trough. HOWEVER, this title is quite populated with bugs and glitches, nothing really game breaking, but it takes you out of experience quite often. They may vary from something like it’s sometimes hard to define what is true light source in the level, sound sometimes has this weird glitch when you can’t detect from which side its coming and if the source is in some place or out in the open, and the list just continuous.\n\nEnemy Front runs on CRYENGINE, so it looks pretty good, but nothing amazing, something like 7/10, however the game is really bright and colorful, not brown and grey like most WW2 shooters out there, and it truly shows, I really enjoyed walking around some levels especially in the french country side. One thing I really liked was the music, and how it changes from whats going on in the game, also loading screens are pretty cool, but they are rendered in really low resolution, something like 360p as well as the cut-scenes and  another thing that ruins cut-scenes is lip-sinking, it’s mostly of, maybe its design for polish language or something, but it doesn’t work well with the English at all.\nLast thing I didn’t cover is the game-play, and well it’s mixed bag, since the game runs on CRYENGINE, it barrows something from Crysis games, like focusing more on stealth, marking enemies with binoculars and so on, however stealth is a bit broken in this game, sometimes it works quite good and at the other times it’s just a mess, but since AI soldiers are quite stupid, you can give-up on stealth all-together and you’ll be just fine, only in this way, the game will become more boring. One thing I Liked about game, that it introduces some new weapons from polish army like “Lightning” – the polish sub-machine gun or WZ.28, and some other new weapons, which I didn’t see in WW2 games. The sniping mechanic in the game is just weird, it’s a “Sniper Elite V2” rip-off and just doesn’t fit in such game.\n\nSo to sum it up, game has some cool ideas and design choices, but execution at the times is just awful, game also has annoying bugs and glitches, boring story, half-broken game-play and almost none-existing multiplayer. I would only recommend this title for 5 euros or less, and if you are WW2 junkie like me, who needs some fresh stuff to kill Nazis with. For everyone else - just avoid this title.\n\n\nI gave it 5.5.\nThanks for reading!","January 2","false","10.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","2"

Enemy Front does not live up to todays standards of video games other than having semi good graphics and environments (as it is built on the Cry Engine).\n\nDepsire the many game breaking and heavily distracting bugs, I still had hours of enjoyment out of playing Enemy Front. I wouldn'y recommend the game at the current store price (£30) as that is just a rip-off for the game you are getting, but I managed to pick the game up for around £7, and got enough fun out of it to warrant the price of purchase.\n\nThe story is so so (but that is pretty standard for a ww2 shooter), you are pretty much just a one man army. The environment is pretty decent. The AI is very stupid, to the point where you can just run around meleeing everyone with a pistol and they die in one swing (but this is what reminded me of MOH: Frontlines, as thats all I used to do in that game)\n\nI'd say pick it up when it's on offer if you are a fan of the classic Medal of Honor series for a fun nostalgia trip - if you are not, you may wish to stay away from Enemy Front.","December 13, 2014","true","7.0"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","23","37","6","0"

I feel like it's judged extremely harshly,It's nowhere near as bad as the negative reviews make out. If you can get it for $5 or less,and enjoy FPS's (particularly sniper orientated one's),you should enjoy this. It's basically Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 in a WW2 setting (even has bulletcam). The gameplay itself is really solid,and kept me satisfied.\n\nI've seen alot of criticism regarding the graphics too,and I'm stunned. It looks absolutely gorgeous on ultra,particualrly the lighting. The sound FX are awesome too,love the gunfire and explosions when cranked up on the sound system. It runs perfectly,100+fps consistently on my 970. My favourite too,NO stuttering.\n\nIt's linear,but nowhere near as bad as most games. Most area's are fairly large and allow roaming/different places to attack enemies from,which makes it feel less confined. I also enjoyed the amount of stuff you could blow up,and strategically placed enviroment objects you could take out to perform an action (ie. shoot a crane wire to drop log's on enemies)\n\nNow for the negatives:\n\n. The story is bland,don't pick this up If you're hoping for an engaging story\n. It is short,even with the bonus Saint-Nazaire mission (which was over in about 10 minutes) but all in all,was worth my time\n. The AI,at least in casual mode,are absolutely terrible for the most part haha. Exposing themselves far too easily/predictable bobbing,running all over the place with no real aim. It didn't take me long to figure this out,so I changed my gamestyle to all out attack and just ran through them,and thats when the game became really fun\n. You can't manually turn off the XBox 360 controller in-game without removing it from your PC,which is a slight niggle. Prompts and controls are displayed as controller buttons,and I did find towards the end it would randomly swap between controller and KBM.\n. The MP is dead,which I'm pretty bummed I never had the chance to play. I feel like it could've been alot of fun,as the game mechanics and gunplay (particularly sniping) are what made the SP and probably would've translated well. The other problem with this is there are MP achievements,so you'll never be able to 100% this game if that's your thing","April 7","true","6.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Doesn't seem that horrible right? Come to think of it - many games that have waaay more bugs and glitches have "very positive" reviews. You are probably thinking "well those games make up for it in terms of story and gameplay" and you might be right to an extend , but this game isnt that bad in terms of either story or gameplay to warrant such vigorous bashing. Sure , its a run-off-the-mill FPS , but story wise its not worse than the worse (lets say) COD games. Gameplay is a hit and miss , with mechanics from different games slapped together , you can feel the strong Wolfenstein influence , the stealth just straight up tore a page from Wolfensteins book . Shooting is OK-ish , where the game shines , and the reason I have continued to play it are the achievements and secondary objectives. Oh , this is also made in CryEngine so graphics are pretty nice , if you dont count the low res ground textures they used for some reason.\n\nBottom line - Nice game to get on sale or in a bundle.

This means the game devolves into a run and gun mess unlike the enjoyable tactical experience of most WW era games.\n\nThe gun models are ridiculously comic and the damage zones on NPCs are generous to say the least, hit someone anywhere but their legs and its a kill.\n\nI could go on and on, this game is garbage - avoid it like the plague it is and go buy Medal of Honor for a fraction of the cost.","June 12, 2014","false","7.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

No possibility to jump over a 1ft fence to sneak through a field around a Checkpoint. After reading all the previous recommendations I expected a really good WW2 Shooter but I was very dissapointed after a few hours of playing. This Game and more important Game Mechanic and level design would have been great 10 or 15 years ago but today it just looks outdated and stupid to me. I want a open world nowadays and decide myself where and how to engage the enmie if I stay hidden and not CoD like Leveldesign.

Combat is not always to your liking. Many things, if not all, are scripted, etc.\nAlthough the game is different than stated in the description, Enemy Front does provide a solid gaming experience and a nice story to connect the different missions.\n\nThe gameplay, controls, speed and reaction to input are all as you might expect from a CryEngine based game. They're top nodge. And many of the problems some users reported I didn't experience.\nIn order to get the most out of this game you should run it on DX11 though and on max settings. This makes sure that the game looks like the screenshots. Okay, a bit less polished, but in the thick of a fight you don't really care if there're 50 shrapnel parts flying around or just 45.\n\nThe sound in this game is very good. The weapons have a nice sound and the dialogs, especially the German ones are even better than the Call of Duty counter parts. They're even more interesting.\n\nBugs..,\nThe only bug I encountered once was a bug with the TNT/Dynamaite charge. After placing it I couldn't walk away. Providing my own Jihad experience. Besides of that anything during the game went pretty smooth.\n\nMultiplayer can be a bit of a hassle though, many perople report connection problems or strange lag jolts and things like that.\nBut, with the just provided dedicated server things might have changed. I haven't tested it yet, so I don't know.\n\nMy final verdict for Enemy Front is: "A solid gaming experience".\nIt might be a bit overpriced, but if you're in to WWII games, then it's not that big of a deal.","June 11, 2014","true","17.5"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","0"

The Steam regular price of multiplayer + single player DLC is way too much (like $30+more for Multiplayer).\n\nJust got done playing a multiplayer round, and it was a lot more fun then sniper elite 3, or Red Orchestra 2.\nGameplay is simple, the way a FPS should be.\n\nLots of suspence while you sneak through BEAUTIFUL maps, seeking the bad guys.\n\nMP maps are well designed, they handle 2 VS 2 all the way up to 16 vs 16. Fewer players the better in my opinion, but the bigger matches can get pretty wild too. (more run-n-gun)\n\nHopefully the publisher or developer does more "Free weekends" , and sales. This game really deserves a lot of attension.\n\nIt is Cry Engine 3, but it is optimised unlike most CryTech games. I am playing on a S*****ty Alienware Alpha , intel i3, and there is no noticeable frame loss.\n\nThe options menu could use some help. I had to disable VerryHigh post processing to simply remove motion blur. They should have and Advanced-Advanced menu too that breaks down all of the features.\nI also see no way to change my FOV. This is cryEngine though so it should be easily hacked via config file.\n\nSingle player is quite well done. The knife takedowns are somewhat believeable, None of this "wipe my blade acrossed their neck for insta death", you really seem to do severe injury that would lead to incompassitation or death.\n\nThere are no bulls***t "Silencers" either, You have to use real guns, the way they where issued. This really adds to the tactics, and to the Action. Eventually you will have the entire map alerted, and have to gun it out.\n\nSingle player is like Farcry+Sniper elite 2 + Castle Wolfinstein.","May 11","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I also met a survivor of the uprising and he told me that it was the most horrific experience he went through and he was just 19 years old when he joined the Polish Resistance. He even told me that he prayed that something like that never has to happen again and that USA does not have to go through what he and the rest of the people of Poland went through back then.

At many points in the game, I found myself up in front of an enemy. I would unload an entire MP magazine at his face and no X marks showing up on the crosshairs to indicate any hits were taken by him. As a result, I died. Quite a few times, actually.\n\n***Spoiler Alert***\nOn the bonus mission for pre-ordering the game, there is a point in which you have to electricute the Germans coming into a lower level that has been flooded. I flipped the switch on one German, then flipped it again to make sure the water was not electrified. The other two Germans started shooting at me, and of course I returned fire with zero results. I ran across the water and, once again, unloaded my weapon on the both of them, and neither took damage. I died, again. This tells me that I  have no choice BUT to electricute all of them, or I probably would not survive to continue. I must march to the beat of the game's drum.\n\nIt's things like this that really ruined my experience, especially after spending $30. On the bright side, it was just $30 and not the averate $50 or $60 that many games are going for these days.\n\nAt this current time, I would strongly recommend against purchasing this game. At least, see if any more updates come out and read future reviews to get a better idea on how the game has improved- if it has.

I honestly expected more use of the CryEngine rather than just volumetric effects and light rays through window shutters.\n\nThe engine looked beautiful at first, but then I noticed that it wasn't gritty and destructive like I expected it to be for a WWII game. It looks like a Crysis port but lost in time and ended up in World War II due to the colour of the trees and the sky.\n\nI partially enjoy the storyline, it opens up stories about the characters in the game but only briefly. I don't understand why the protagonist is an American fighting in Poland against Nazi Germany, he mentions at the beginning that his mother was Polish but I wouldn't think of that as reason to fight for the country, especially since Poland became completely occupied in WWII at the beginning. There is also the problem of it throwing you right into the action, you start off at the very beginning defending a blockade on a street in Poland, with the tutorial teaching you the controls of how to shoot and move around.\n\nAs mentioned before, I expected the engine to be used much more extensively like other titles previously on it, especially when it's the third generation of such a game engine, you would expect so. There is an option in the advanced settings for the physics to be changed from low, medium and high, but that doesn't make a big difference at all since the majority of the areas that you go into are static objects, and that also includes wooden crates and barrels which were moveable in the Crysis franchise so that was a big disappointment. The engine does use the light rays through window shutters and glass reflections which looks rather beautiful, but it's a detail that goes heavily missed due to the constant rushing around and shooting, it is only really noticed when walking down corridors on the sides of buildings.\n\nThe AI isn't very good. If you walk straight into an enemy you can completely stop them from shooting by standing right infront of their gun while they are just standing there waiting to shoot you. Some people say they can be quite difficult as they flank you and force you back a bit into previous areas of the level, which I haven't encountered at all. I have found that you can counter this situation simply by killing them as they are moving towards you. A lot of the time you find yourself sneaking towards new sets of enemies and then turning it into an instant bloodbath that also seems to end in a matter of seconds. They have some unique things not seen in other FPS games, like taking enemy soldiers hostage, holding a knife to their throat and a pistol in the other hand to use them as temporary cover, however that disappears quickly as your hostage's friends decide to willy nilly blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of their body rather than think of the loss of a comrade if they did so.\n\nThere are explosions, yes, but they are very odd. At the beginning of the game, I sneaked into a small plaza with three men doing shooting practise on a wall with a target on it. Just on their left of them I could see a giant box of TNT or something similar with wires and fuses hanging out, and decided that I could eliminate 3 of the 9 men in the situation by shooting at the box of explosives a couple of times. The box was literally 2 centimetres away from the nearest enemy, and when I shot at the box it took only one bullet to set them off, and the explosive was like as if the entire thing was soaked in water and all the explosives were duds. It was the tiniest explosion I have ever seen in a videogame. The three men simply turned around away from the explosion and start blazing rounds at me rather than look at the exploded box and think of as to why it exploded in the first place.\n\nI have an i5 3570k, 8GB of RAM and an overclocked ASUS GTX 560 Ti with 1 GB of memory.

I hear some have issues..I dunno.. all is fine to date for "me".. for less than 25 bucks.. sure.. if ya like WW2 games.. go for it.. think a sniper elite series with a bit less stealthy..ya gonna get spotted.. some areas, you have no choice but to clear out the bad guys.. Oh play it on HARD.. Ai aint the best... but u will die..:)","June 11, 2014","true","17.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","2"

One day I was looking through the newly released of Steam and there was this WWII game in the Cry Engine. I had to buy it.\n\nNow the game isn't going to topple Battlefield or Call of Duty but it is far from being an Hour of Victory. It’s a solid average game that people who like WWII games will enjoy. It’s come to the point where a good WWII game could do well in the market as it is no longer over saturated by the games.","September 9, 2015","true","3.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Atleast at its current state, although I recommend it as its still good, no, great in my opinion, the trailers are misleading. I compared it to Dishonoured, open world level stealth game, or action packed if you wanted. But, the world's are smaller than you'd think, and sometimes stealth won't work, just either too many enemies or awkward to avoid patrol patterns, which is, to say the least, annoying as hell. The online, as of writing this, doesn't seem to be too packed...at all...and games hosted by non-dedicated hosts seem to cause problems with connecting sometimes. The maps online seem to big for 6 on 6 matches, all seem made for the Radio Transmission gamemode, which isn't, of course, always played. Some frame-rate drops occured that where very bad in the second Warsaw level, even though I'm not running on the best PC ever, the other missions run fine, althought this was after a long session. The last real complaint is, the AI is about as smart as smart as some of the type of people the Nazi's wanted to get rid of, which is bad, very bad, it makes stealth so easy until the above stated reasons.\nBUT...the good things! The most important, it's fun! Stealth is fun and just trying to do it adds tons of replayability. I love the option to take hostages and us ethem as a human shield or pull them away into the shadows to slice their throats. There's a nice range of weapons from the war, the obvious German ones, but also a range off allies ones, not all of course but its nice to see not just Russsian etc, although this owes to the other great aspect, variety. In my 5 hours, I've went through wore-torn Warsaw, beutiful fields of France, moonlit German docks and snowy mountains in Norway, with differant charactors and objectives. Shootouts seem easy at times, but are still good fun. The multiplayer, if it grows, could become great fun, it seems old-school, you get to pick a charactor to play as and three weapons, all unlocked from the start, meaning everyone's equal, which is nice to see. The game looks great aswell, and the sound is pretty good, I like good guns sounds, although its not loud and scary, it doesn't make you fear the sound of "Hitler's Buzzsaw", which is annoying as its the first WWII game I got in a while, I suupose I may have expected too much from a game I knew little about.\nWorth a buy, and if anyone complains about playing as an American, the game gives a descent excuse for him to be there, and it doesn't play anything down as I thought it might. 8/10. Flawed but still so much fun.\n","June 12, 2014","true","6.9"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

He actually manages to do a number of this which only highly trained individuals during the Second World War may have even tried to have attempted (more rarely surviving). The enemy is portrayed to be all too willing to shoot civilians for practically no reason, but there are some parts (if you play stealthily) where you can see that the enemy is human (through conversations you overhear). Despite the aforementioned issues, the game has great visuals (despite framerate loss happening at random points throughout the game). The guns in the game have fairly realistic sounds, animations and handling. The story is alright (again I have issues with the protagnonist). I do however prefer the scripted parts as to where the player has a choice to sneak/kill their way through vast numbers of guards. That said the game has a functional stealth system where you can repeatedly stab the enemy from behind or grab them as a human shield. However, I did get bored/fed up with the protagonist quite a lot during this game.\n\nTL;DR\nThe protagonist is a ♥♥♥♥ but everything looks nice. 5/10 Stalins","June 27, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

They both involve a resistance fighter in a desperate struggle to stay alive against Nazi oppression.  Unfortunately, the clunky controls, horrid visuals, awkward dialogue and strange design decisions reduces the amount of fun one could have while playing this game.\n\nTo it's credit, it gives you some lesser known weapons and gives the player an idea of what it was like being a resistance fighter stuck in Warsaw but that's about as far is it goes.  It tries to do stealth sections and action sequences, but it seems to fall short, like a jack of all trades but master of none.\n\nThere are a few examples I want to give, as a heads up to anyone tempted to buy this but fortunate enough to read the negative reviews.\n\nCan't switch weapons while in certain animations.  The Welrod will kill you often if you get caught or don't kill in the first shot.\nBugs/Issues where you aren't given or told where to get a mission critical weapon.  Try sniping with a pistol.\nHorrible, and I mean horrible, checkpoint system.  Normally, I wouldn't complain about this but the level design and tedium involved sometimes is too much.\nBreaching maneuver ala Call of Duty, hope you selected a good gun before entering the animation. (See Welrod above)\nAnimations, graphical quality and AI behaviour that is surprising close to Return to Castle Wolfenstein... just go play that.\n\nI really would've liked this to have been a better game, but I can't support paying full price for this game.

Not the best WWII game I ever played but it was nice with a game that came out with newer graphics.\n\nThings I liked:\n\n-The things that I liked was the gun sounds, they were actually amazing on almost every gun you would shoot (probably the best WWII gun sounds in any game to date)\n-You can grab hostages and use them as a shield and still use your pistol to shoot other enemies and then just kill the hostage\n-Counter knife was pretty cool and decent and had a couple different animations for it\n- The blood squirt when you shoot an enemy and if you shoot them in the neck they grab their neck for a little animation and then fall over and die\n- How you can stealth or just run and gun\n- Varies things you can shoot to make objects fall on enemies or release debris from trucks that makes them move and crush enemies or makes a distraction\n- You can run and slide by hitting the crouch button\n- Map detailing was pretty good and a lot of different buildings you could go into and routes for the most part\n-They didnt r.a.p.e you for the money ($30) and I have played $60 games that were a lot worst and shorter.\n\nThings I didnt like:\n- The movement of your character felt sluggish and slow but i eventually got used to it and didnt really notice it after a few hours of playing\n- Wish there was more guns, I understand your fighting with the russian resistance fighters and only have access to russian guns and german guns but the welrod and the 1911 was in the game but I was hoping to see the thompson, B.A.R springfield and the browning.  ( The thompson and Garant you can use in a dlc mission I believe i got from preorder, which you are a different character and different mission).Theres only been a few games that had all those american guns and got them right\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all the negatives werent that negative but as WWII FPS games are my fav type of game and was glad to see one come out with updated graphics and such.  The main mission took me about 10 hrs to complete with taking time stealthing some missions and running and gunning some.  The dlc map took about 30 minutes to run and gun.  A couple of aspects like the sniping when the camera follows the bullet to the enemy was like sniper ghost warrior but that didnt bother me, I actually enjoyed that. As for the MP part of the game I cant comment because Im not a MP type of player.  I play games for the SP stories. As for it being $30 the game is well worth it to me because I understand how long it takes to make a game and to get everything right since I used to make custom maps for COD WAW and the SP mission was longer than I expected.  Hope to see more DLC missions with some more american guns and I would rate this game 1 point higher.\n\nI would rate this game a 7.5 to a 8 out of 10 and would recommend it if you like WWII FPS games\n\nBy the way dont ever listen to popular gaming sites or critic reviewers because they are rarely right about games and most are usually paid by other gaming companies to say bad things about a game. Best bet is to listen to reviewers on here or from some forums.  Good luck and hope this helps.","June 29, 2014","true","17.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

They did a lot lot of cheap realises. MP is dead, so dont buy this game if you are not SP-player.\n\nEnemy Fornt is a better version of Mortyr. This series is about commando who takes part in special/partizan operation during WW2. Probably nobody know this game, exept Poles. Motyr has only SP campain, no MP.\n\nAnd now CI games realised abroad a better version of Mortyr - Enemy Front, calling it "great game wow, next Crisis". They always describe like that. Cheap games witch you can buy in newsagence for 4$ too. But non-Poles didnt know about it, they expected good MP and CoD's style SP. But Enemy Front is like Mortyr - you are one men army killing hordes of Germans. So that game is big disappointment for people who trust CI that they will made game of the year.\n\nThe main disadvantage of EF is bug and crash fest. You've got to preapare that 50% of map loading get stuck. Another bad aspect of game is that soldier's equpment is unhistorrical. You can find Stg-44, Sten Mk2 ,Panzerfaust or Germans wearing camo pants in 1940. Wz-35 AT Rifle has 5 round mag but in real life it has 4 bullets. Also German SMG-gunner skin is a diseaster - hakenkreutz on arm suggest Hitler's guard. But on helmet you can see Wehrmacht signs. Any way on the uniform you can see sign of artillery but also tankcrew one...\n\nSome people complain about graphics. It just OK, not the best, not the worst.\nAlso players complain about stupid AI. AI is copy-paste from one used in Mortyr: Operation Thunderstorm, Terrorist Takedown 2, Code of Honor 2 and games like that. So prepeare that German soldiers act like Afgani partisans in MOH: Tier 1.\n\n\nBut this game has also good sides. Firs one is really beautiful presentation of buildings in Warsaw like Pasta or Saint Cross Church. Next possitive aspect of game is that you can find weapons like Weltrod, DeLise, Browning Wz-28 or Lightning SMG. They are not present in common FPS serieses.\n\nAnd why to but this game? Campain. It isnt difficult but long enough. I really enjoyed my time playing it. You can take part in historical battles in Poland, year 1944 and fictional ones in France , Norway and V2 complex.

After enjoying some elements to this game I became increasingly frustrated with it. After comparing to Medal of Honor Allied Assault the failings become obvious. Just look at the use of Cryengine. Many of the levels are an abomination of badly selected texture colours. Models dumped in the level as if the designer was having a bad day. No graphic design or art direction. Some levels like the smaller alternative single player campaign are passable (a different level designer?) but this game just does not stand up against classic and modern exercises in video game design. It is a shame as there are a few good ideas in there. I found the story writing compelling. The "slo mo" sniper bullet works well. But the whole thing is not carried through properly, and that conflicts with the developers claims to be "bringing back the classic FPS" (I paraphrase); I wonder if they even played Medal of Honor or other classic FPS's to use as a reference ?

I payed 18 quid for chivalry medieval warefare, a game that I have 201 hours on, and am still playing, it has no major issues and is very polished, though on my new gpu (gtx 770 oc) I did have an issue with it that was resolved.\n\nThis game costed me more than buying "star wars: knights of the old republic" and "star wars: knights of the old republic 2: the sith lords" both on steam and on physical copy, I got them on disk before the holy light of Gabe shone from the heavens at me, hence them being on disk, but rebought them as steam is more convenient, as I dont want a disk drive on my pc, they are ugly.\n\nThe first of the aformentioned games I regarde as being the best game ever made if you could say there was one. Everything is right, graphics, sounds, models, music, characters, story, atmosphere etc, nothing could be better, and it has in my opinion no flaws. The second game is flawed, though still fantastic, and with the restored content mod, it is even better.\n\nMy point being that I bought those great games twice, for less than I payed for this turd.\n\nNOW ON TO STUFF ABOUT THIS GAME:\n\nI bought this ♥♥♥♥ because I thought it would be nice to play a WW2 fps game, and it reminded me of medal of honor: Airborn, but with the glorious graphics of cryengine.\n\nOpen launching the game, it crashed, I tried and tried and it finally launched after about 8 tries. I got into the menu, and was like "damn, thats pretty" it had a very nice menu, aesthetically. I opened the options menu and was kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off with the janky menu controls, it felt like a console port, many of my pc gaming brothers will know what I mean in terms of the menu controls and layout. I maxed the game out, and was looking forward to the nice graphics.\n\nI went back to the main menu, and guess what, it crashed when I decided to click the multyplayer option, ( I wanted to check the graphics etc without watching the inevitable cutscenes etc that fps are so plauged by in the single player)\n\nIt crashed, I opened the game again, it crashed like when I first started it up, and about 5 minuites of trying later it opened. I tried to get on multyplayer and it kept crashing and it worked eventually and I was greeted to the server menu, I tried to join a game.NOPE......... it didnt let me, i kept being timed out etc, and getting messages in the vain of "unable to establish conection", " host timed out" unable to connect to server" etc.\n\nI created my own game, and it worked, but even 10 minuites later nobody joined, the graphics were a let down, they were nice, but not very good, a few years ago, circa crysis 1, they would be acceptable, but now, no. The lighting etc was good, because of cryengine, but the textures were of fairly low quality, and the game didn't run very well, I was only getting about 60-70 fps, on a small multyplayer map, I know thats not due to the 770's performance, it maxes everything, and doesnt tank on demanding games, I should also mention I have an amd fx 8350, it is not the best, its no top of the line i7, but it is very good, and from what I have observed, I am getting higher fps on most games than people with i7 3770k's and upwards, so its no slouch. The cpu is overclocked, not by much as I am keeping the stock cooler untill I can afford my water cooling setup, but the cpu is very stable and fairly cool, especially considering it is an 8350, known for being hot. So there is no excuse for this low fps I experienced, I can run much better looking games with higher fps etc than I can in this, and from watching a lot of gtx 770 and 770 oc performance videos, many of them for the gigabyte windforce 2 like I have, I know that  It can run metro last light and other demanding games often better than it can this. THIS GAME IS NOT VERY EFFICIANT AT DOIN ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI left the game, and then quit, upon quiting I got an error message saying "enemy front.exe has stopped working" so I presume closing it crashes it or something.\n\nI did not touch the game for about 2 hours. I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I waisted 30 quid on this ♥♥♥♥, I could have bought some fans for my case, or some nice bitfenix alchamy pc leds or something, but I got this turd of a game.\n\nI was met with the same crashes etc I have previously described, though less of them, and finnaly got into the singleplayer "campaign" (more like a ♥♥♥♥in romp in the countryside of france but o well.........) .upon clicking the singleplayer button, it launches this kind of 3d scene that is paned around with a floating pov camera, It is quite nice, I presume its supposed to distract you from the long ♥♥♥ (really long, some like 3 minuites long) load times, though it doesn't. After the game finished loading and I was prompted to press any key or something to start the game, it crashed as soon as I tried to do that.\n\nI launched the game etc. went into singleplayer, watched the pan around thing and perhaps watched a cutscene (I dont remember) and got into the game. The textures were not all as bad as the ones from the multyplayer matches, and sometimes the game looked quite nice, though its no crysis 1-3 or anything. The performance was still argueable, but okay.\n\nThe game fairly fun once it picked up (after the first mission or two, that were like noob friendly tutorials.\n\nSome of the larger fights and things like explosions were impressive, mostly due to cryengine. but the enemy ai, ai in general was not great, it was fairly easy to just run up to enemies and shoot them in the face with a pistol. The stealth aspects of gameplay work fairly well, with takedowns and using enemies as human shields by grabbing them from behind, and I that the welrod (cant rember how to spell it) was in the game as a stealthy pistol rather than just making some wierd silenced luger or something silly. The combat, can be hard, so its rewarding when you dont die, and killing nazi's is fairly fun, its satisfying and headshots are fun, but the difficulty is not what makes surviving an encounter good, its that there are check points (why not quick saves.......cmon, games are getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I want to press f5 and have no worries, or if i ♥♥♥♥ it up, press f6 and reload the save) but the check points are very sprea out etc, and it just feels annoying, if a games combat outcomes rely on planning and tactics etc, quick save is needed, or at least an option when you press escape, but no, its just checkpoints, so if you decide to take on a group of enemies in a stealthy manner, an you spend like 3 minuites sneaking around, silently dispatching nazis, and then one sees you and alerts his friends and you die, you reload a checkpoint, spawning you miles from where you were, without whatever you picked up on the way, and all people you killed are back, so you try again, and if you ♥♥♥♥ it up, you load the checkpoint again............ its just not fun\n\nThe cutscenes:\n\nThe video quality sucks, instead of having it play out real time in the engine, the rendered it or something and recorded it, it is like something from an early 2000's ps2 game, or a bad 7th gen console game cutscene............... its not nice. But the content in the cutscenes is fairly good, the characters have some kind of personality and there is some humour to them,but they aren't super fleshed out but meh, I did not expect them to be. The sounds generally respond to what is going on etc in the cutscene, so if the characters are in a large room, it will echo etc.\n\nThe music:\nI dont reallt remember any, so it wasnt great obviosly, but I think it was an orchestral score, which is always welcome, but its not john willaims calibre or anything, but its not bad.\n\ncontrols:\n\nI remember them working, and I think that they were rebindable, not sure, too lazy to check lol.\n\nWell, im bored and kind remember what else i was going to wright.\n\n\n\nIN SUMMARY:\n\nIts not special, I wouldnt say its ♥♥♥♥♥, but its not great, 5/10.","August 13, 2014","false","10.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

The story will transport you before the uprising, to show how Hawkins end up at Warsaw. The Uprising of Warsaw is the Forgotten chapter of WWII IRL and in video game. This is the freshest thing in this game. The Gameplay is rather simple, with mechanic of Sniper Elite, Medal Of Honor and Call Of Duty (Before Modern Warfare Era).

I really enjoy WWII shooters since Medal of Honor and Call of Duty eras. Played them a lot. love them a lot and even was kind of dawned with Modern Warfare kicking in. When I saw this game - decided to give it a try. Even Totalbiscuit gave it a nice review, so, why not?\n\nIt was interesting at first. New game, new ideas. But something did not feel right.\n\n- There is stealth in game but no matter how hard you try - you won't get it.\n- Collectibles are not important at all except for achievement and are really hard to find.\n- Never liked multiplayer but just gave it a try. It is dead.\n- Heroes are not interesting at all. I did not give a crap if one would die or not.\n- Level design is ok in the terms of graphics but very lenient.\n- And Oh My God! Parts of the level are scripted in such a way that the may hero CLOSES THE DOOR in order not to let you come back to the previous part of the level. WTF? Are you serious? That looks so ridiculous. Made me furious.\n\nAnd the last mission is so-so. More or less realistic in the terms of war but not dramatic at all. The last 3 nazis died very stupid.\n\nDo I recommend it? Well, no. With all do respect to Polish Resistance, it does not cover even a part of the amazing history and brave man. I liked the idea and there are some good elements but in general, game does not catches your attention. I so wish it would be different.","December 9, 2015","false","36.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Is it bad?\n\nIt's made by Polish developer CI games. That is not so bad.\nThe game's story may not be as clever or as logical, but there is a big detail that I like about this game.\n\nYou are set in less known battles. Instead of common DDay and Stalingrad, you get to be in the Warsaw uprising, the French resistance, and even in the Swedish resistance (Cpt. Price knockoff included).\n\nGameplay wise, it ain't that bad. You can sneak around, throw rocks, assassinate nazis. Or, just run out firing all your guns. Sometimes it may not be as flowing, but the game can and will be fun to play for the most.\n\nSound, oh boy. They are using explosion sounds from their old Low-budget game Code of Honor (Yes, I played that, I have it). The explosions don't sount quite right, since their main part is from a 2006 game. Other sounds are fairly good. Imagine Call of Duty.\n\nIs it worth it? Yes and no.

Tons of big bad Germans with swastikas, against a few ill equipped, undermanned, but insanely smart and brave, crack shot and hard to die resistant fighters (partisans). Who kill nazis in 1000s with ease and for fun. Those movies lacked realism, historical accuracy, used whatever equipment they could find for Nazis (like US/USSR tanks and planes with swastikas) .. but were still somehow fun to watch.\nThis game is the same. It looks quite good, has brain dead AI, strange level design, is unoptimized and is made from developers who are well know for budget games here in Europe. Usually all their low cost games had a big City Interactive logo on it, but this one just had CI Games written under developers. Like they were trying to hide something.\nIf you are looking for a no brainer WW2 shooter after a bad day this game is great. But for all others I just can't recommend it for a full price in such state as it is now. Game already had a hefty discount ON THE RELEASE DAY (!!??) and the developers had made exactly ZERO post on Enemy Front Steam forum which is also not exactly a good sign!\nPreorder bonuses for this game were also a joke. Some stuff for (already dead) multiplyers part of the game and a really boring and kinda silly bonus mission.\n\nI will stick to Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm (WW2) and Verdun (WW1) multiplayer and Call of Duty: World at War for singleplayer.","July 14, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","2"

For once, he let me down.\n\nI also played City Interactive's previous game, Alien Rage, and while I gave it a negative review I thought it had potential. It had very linear levels and major performance issues, but great gunplay and relatively smart AI. So when TB said that this one ran smoothly and had a bit more freedom to its levels, I decided to give it a try.\n\nAs claimed, Enemy Front does seem to run well, and it does indeed have big open Crysis-like levels. Unfortunately, everything that CI did well in Alien Rage, they've managed to muck up here. It starts with the shooting - none of the guns have any recoil or weight to them. Also, the guns in Alien Rage had cool alt-fire modes that allowed for a variety of combat options - Enemy Front's weapons lack these. There's also a complete lack of variety to the weapons - two pistols that are exactly the same. Rifle. Rifle with scope. Two MGs that are exactly the same. They're boring to shoot.\n\nYou also only have two enemy types - Nazi with machine gun and Nazi with scoped gun. There's no strategy to shooting them as headshots and body shots seem to do the same amount of damage. You occasionally have to deal with tanks, but these sequences are rendered uninteresting because you're always given a rocket launcher immediately before the tank arrives and you just have to shoot it. Again, no thinking required.\n\nBut the game's biggest problem is that the gameplay doesn't take advantage of the huge levels. There's no reason to scour the levels for ammo or health packs, because the game has health regen and has a universal ammo system where you just walk up to any ammo crate and magically refill all your ammo. There are secrets to find but you gain nothing by finding them. You can, of course, approach enemy positions from different angles, like in Crysis, but regardless of where you come from you'll be doing the same sort of shoot-hide behind cover while regenerating-shoot again thing in order to defeat them. Because there's no weapon variety, there's no motivation to try different approaches to targets. The game also doesn't have quicksave, and the checkpoints are painfully far apart, so forget about quicksaving in order to try and see if a wacky idea will work. Additionally, enemies tend to stand in groups out in the open, so stealth isn't really an option. You shoot them from further away or closer - that's your only choice. Also, as soon as you open fire, the dumb AI enemies immediately all rush at you, sometimes even in a nice column so you can pick them off one by one. The AI is much worse than in Alien Rage.\n\nIn a nutshell, the huge levels look really nice, but the lack of variety in other facets of the gameplay means that the game doesn't actually create the sort of sandbox shooter experience you get from Far Cry/Crysis. Instead you get "click on head to kill," which is fun for about 1 hour and boring for the remaining 6 or 7.","December 14, 2015","false","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However in the end it just becomes "another shooter" where the "story" merely becomes a string of more or less connected "assault scenarios" and you end up not really caring.\n\nWhat sounded really interesting about the game was the promise of a slightly open world, allowing you more freedom in how to proceed through the various levels, but it never really seems to work out and it's pretty clear in the few cases where you "stray from the path", some scripted events either fails to trigger or triggers with you being in the wrong spot (e.g. helping the resistance being assaulted by German forces; you kill the enemy and a conversation starts, where only your half is audible because the person talking to you is 50 meters away inside a building).\nOn top of that, the difficulty is ... well ... too easy and unless you play on the hardest level, you will never have any need for cover as even 5 enemies firing at you at the same will give you plenty of time to take them down one by one before you run out of health. Of course you do have the occasional "instant death" where you have no idea what hit your and why you're suddenly dead.\n\nHowever what really truly ruins it for me is the controls; it's been mentioned in plenty of reviews already, but moving around feels like you're gliding in thick syrup and it just feels so unnatural that any sensation of immersion is completely ruined. Even archaic games like Quake had - and still has - a better feel to it.\nLevel design is ok - although some of the levels are quite short and again, not nearly as open as we'd like.\nOf course this is not an AAA title which is also reflected in the price, but even having picked up the title at £11 on a sale, I feel that I overpaid.\n\nIn the game's defense I did only spend 1 hour with it so far, but as it didn't manage to capture my attention at all in that time span or even could be classified as a little bit exciting in that period, I definitely do not feel compelled to carry on in the hope that it will eventually live up to its potential .... of course your mileage may vary.\n\nUpdate:\nHaving now logged 4 hours with this game I have to say that the initial impression stands but has gotten worsened quite a bit by ...\n* Consistent load bugs: Roughly 1 out of 3 level loads causes the game to become unresponsive and requires a restart from the task manager on an otherwise very stable PC.\n* Script events required to continue the mission failing to trigger, forcing reloads of previous checkpoints (e.g. an enemy assault never happening, hence making it impossible to complete the "clear the area of enemies" objective which is required before the "place explosives to blow open door" objective becomes active...or a complete objective not being detected as completed, e.g. "Kill the commander" who is already dead).\n* Secondary objectives being failed without the objective ever being given in the first place. It is kind of infuriating being told "objective failed" when you've never been notified that this was actually an objective at all.\n* Level progress being saved two seconds before instant death, then reloading for you to..you guessed it...die instantly, eventually forcing you to restart the level.\n\nIn effect, my experience of this game has NOT improved since now that I've spend more time with it - and at £11 I definitely feel that I wasted my money.","June 22, 2014","false","7.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Warning Contains Plot Spoilers and is lenghty\nWith contemporary and future based first person shooters being the current norm I looked forward to a World War 2 based shooter. Some of my best experiences in the first person shooter genre has been games based on the second world war. I saw the game on a steam sale with twenty or so percent off the base price and thought heck I am bored and a WW2 shooter could be fun. The purchase was not a targeted researched acquisition but a spur of the moment shot from the hip hope this is good moment. I took note that the game was based on the Cryengine so with that as a starting point I had plenty of hope for the quality of gameplay and with the attached Cryengine brand demands for decent graphics.\n\nThis review is not a concise affair, but rather a rambling of thoughts, ideas and reflections in a semi-structured somewhat coherent text jumbled hastily down. The review solely looks at the single player campaign. I played it at casual and it took me somewhere around 7 hours to pass the campaign. Though keep in mind that I watched a few games of Bullet chess and ate at least one dinner while the game ran paused. So all in all the campaign on casual with an experienced gamer probably lasts five to six hours if played at a leisurely pace.\n\nI ran the game on an older Intel 2500K at 4.3ghz with 16gb ram and a slightly overclocked Nvidia GTX670. Resolution was 2560x1600 with a basic setting on High with DX11. Checking the advanced features it shows all on High. Drivers were the latest as of 17/6/2014. The game version was V1.\n\nI usually have less stringent demands of single player modes when it comes to frame drops etc. than compared to Multiplayer games. I encountered some frame drops, but not to the extent that it bothered me much. Overall the game ran decent on my rig with my perceptions and expectations.\nThough I am no graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ I prefer games to look nice. Enemy Front looks decent, maybe not Crysis good but not bad. I met and to an extent passed my expectations on this account.\n\nMoving on to game mechanics I want to say a few words about the buildings in the game. First of I am a big fan of being able to spot a house and go into it. Enemy Front has a classic linear layout with little options and choices for approaching an objective. As a story telling technique I do not mind it, it is widely used and with success. Though sometimes I do feel that I am pushed face first through an area or sequence I much rather would approach in a different manner. When this happens one time too many it feels forced. Enemy Front is in this category. As I went of on a tangent I better return to the buildings. On more than one occasion I have been in situ ready move on closer to the objective and while for instance clearing a tiny hamlet I notice that two out of three buildings are accessible but the third is all locked doors. This is a big thumbs down for me. It makes me think the developers did not bother about their product. In large urban areas it is understandable, to a degree. But not in a three building farm/hamlet.\n\nThe game feel fluid, but combat is somewhat odd. Since I played at casual I usually did not take specific care to staying alive. As long as did not have a k98 and run into mp40 equipped AI at point blank range where I missed the first two rounds from my rifle dying is a challenge. You have plenty of time to take on the enemies and if the heat gets too high cover is not far away. The odd part is not how godlike my health is at casual setting but rather the behavior of the AI.\nFirst of the AI is predictable. They will seek cover, peek over, across or to the side of said cover while I am under suppressive fire from multiple enemies. Being cautious has its role but when heavily outgunned and outnumbered the enemy AIs let me take them on one on one with a bolt rifle at game wise short to medium ranges is off. Further if it gets too hot I can fall back ten or so meters and get some cover, possibly around a corner, then they will assault me. Ok not bad, but one at a time? I can sit there and pick them off one by one until the numbers are either depleted enough to go back on the offensive or vanish the enemies entirely. Also the AI is predictable in the sense that it often, maybe too often attempts to flank my position, and not only one of them, but multiple attempts in succession. Two or three pronged assaults have not taken placed unless I have an open vista/space in front of my position. Then they are still more or less coming straight at me.\nSecond, the AI is deaf or its alternate and has super hearing.  At times I have shot multiple enemies at a distance of 50 to a 100 meters with the next group of AI a similar distance away from me or for that matter a whopping 100-200 meters distance from my rifle blast. Though the group of AI I hunted and killed did not manage to sound an alarm, multiple rifle shots ought to cause some curiosity? On more than one occasion I have had a running SMG / Rifle battle lasting up to a minute, expending considerable ammunition and still the enemy AI groups slightly further out stand about. The alternate are the situations when you are supposed to camoflague your shots with the ambient noise. Here I failed miserably every time... I think it is me but still.\nThird. Though probably not an AI specific item the AI often is lackluster at pushing against barricades/static positions where you have to defend. At one of these in the Warsaw part of the campaign, I walked back to the ammo dump slowly reloaded all three weapons (rifle, smg and pistol) before going aim-down-sights expecting the enemy to come across the barriers... nothing happened. I walk up to the barrier and on the other side behind some barriers are the same AI I left behind plus some friends.\nFourth, and the last I can recall. The enemy AI is often funneled against you. If you find a static MG42 in your vicinity its a clear indication that in about ten seconds you will have to man it and go at large groups of enemy AI that runs more or less straight at you. To mow down one group is sort of fun, three or more not so much. At one stage there is an elevated causeway on the V2 mission where we come out of a complex and there is an MG42. I mount it and a sizable group of enemy AI runs at me 50-100 meters away. I take them out then another one comes, then I spot a third coming up the elevator. Traversing the MG over to the open elevator shaft aligning the sights is blast of a burst of 10 or so rounds. Nothing happens? Ok, return to spray and pray blasting the packed elevator for five or so second yields nada. Hmm, what now? Then they turn onto the causeway and brrrmmmm the all go down... Kinda annoying.\n\nThe game gives two features in the gameplay. There is a rudimentary system for choice do you want to do A or B or get weapon C or D. An okay twist but nothing more. It is sparsely used at that. Then there is the cinegraphic bullets that you get when using sniper rifles, maybe even rifles, that look nice the first time or so but is not predictable at all, to my understanding, and if I repeat three more or less identical head shots in succession maybe one will give the effect. Then moments later I give a hasty scoped pot shot and viola I get the sequence.\n\nThe Oscarsborg mission seems to be a fail. Not because a SOE type and a journalist can take on an entire fortification on their own. Somehow when you get down below and stand there with the persicope thinking you have four torpedoes to make it all good. You observe your target to your left and lead it appropriately. Splash, and on target but somehow there is no explosion? This particular part of the game caused me the biggest problem. How is it the torpedoes goes under the keel of the destroyer on the left side of the outcropping but hits neatly on the other? Makes little sense to me. Its the little things like this that pisses me of.","June 24, 2014","false","7.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","9"

Years later, end of 2015, I bought it for ~€3 and I'm glad that I waited. Not saying that it's a bad game, but it has its flaws.\n\nStoryIn both movies and games, you've seen and heard most of the stories from World War 2, right? Normandy, St. Petersburg, London, Paris, Berlin, Japan, Africa... you name it. But in this game, the developers chose a quite different route when it comes to the story.\n\nYou're playing as the american journalist Robert Hawkins, he's telling the story of his journey to Warsaw and how he came to help the people of the city in the uprising against the nazis. You get to help out the resistance fighters in the snowy mountains in Norway, you help a german SOE (Special Operations Executive) agent to free prisoners from a POW camp and you help a french man and his polish allies to escape death.\n\nIt is actually quite nice to be in other, mainly untouched, parts of the world in a WW2 game. Kudos!\n\nGraphicsIt's nice to look at, after all, it is powered by the Cry Engine. But it is not very well optimised. I had to lower the settings to medium overall to even be near 60FPS at places, otherwise it would be somewhere between 20-40FPS - especially when a lot of things are exploding. Not really optimal.\n\nOther than that, I didn't find that many things to complain about. One or two guns stuck through a wall, but that happens in almost every game, so I can't really complain about that. If anything I could complain about how grainy the cutscenes before and after missions were. They were really bad. It would be better if they would just create the cutscenes within the engine itself - like they do in the first "cutscene" in the extra mission - "Saint-Nazaire".\n\nSoundNothing to really say about this. This is probably the worst part of the game, besides the multiplayer. The explosions doesn't sound good, the weapons sound decent, the voice acting is on par at best. But I did like the background music at places, so I guess it has that going for it.\n\nGameplaySo, the main meat of the game. What is a game without gameplay? Dear Esther? I don't know. But this game is pretty fast paced, but you can choose to be stealthy if you'd like to. I tried it once or twice but it seems like the enemies will always find a way to see you.\n\nSometimes I would die for no explainable reason but I guess I was too aggressive or something like that. Shooting nazis are always just as fun, especially when the environments are so varied and the missions are rather short (there are 16 in total and I completed them all on medium in just above five hours - including the extra mission).\n\nConclusionThis game has gotten A LOT of bad reviews here on Steam, but I don't think it deserves it... not all the way at least. I mean, for the price I paid (~€3), it's not a terrible game. Sure, it's kind of short and the extra mission I got when buying the game didn't really deserve a special place in the main menu (mostly considering it was only ONE mission which took about 10 minutes to complete and didn't really bring anything new to the story of the main campaign). But at least it's FUN and that is the most important thing about a game - the ability to entertain the player. So I do recommend it, IF you're able to find it cheap.","January 12","true","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While the game does an OK job on the SP, it also shows its issues like sound glitches, random game crashes and it really demonstrates of being a not-so bad console port per say, but it is a shame of such wasted potential on this title while using Crytek's awesome CryEngine3 tech.\n\nHopefully the devs of this title don't kill their game so soon like ending its support by patching the game with performance improvements and more gameplay improvements because I seen other Indie game devs having a smaller team doing a better job on releasing their content with fluid performance on PCs and great gameplay overall.

I haven't even played it that much. But I'll give credit where credit is due: the graphics are pretty impressive. I don't think that the graphics are what make a game good, though. The story is weird. Why exactly am I a writer instead of a soldier or something? Also, the game is so buggy. My mouse cursor always shows up in game, my gun isn't shooting in slow motion during the slow motion scenes, and all of that just bugs the crap out of me. The controls are weird, and the graphics are the only thing keeping the game from feeling like it's about 10 years old.

As an fps goes, this game borrows many typical and expected mechanics and does so in a satisfactory manner. While it doesn't offer anything particularily unique, it does deliver a satisfactory experience. You can expect things like bullet time (much like if not borrowed from Sniper Elite 2), optional stealth/rambo approaches to objectives, suprisingly aesthetically pleasing environments, etc. Worth the $30 bucks I paid for the n hours of entertainment - perhaps wait for a Steam sale.\n\nThings I'd like to have seen:\n\nA bit broader of a weapon selection - I usually use sniper rifles when their available and having two was acceptable, although a couple more rifles as well as pistols would have been nice. I don't think I ever really used a pistol in the game except the silenced one. I was sad that the Garand never made an appearance but then again I don't think I ran into any Americans in the game. The silenced pistol was quite unique, I'm not sure if I liked the slow fire rate although I can see how it slows yours stealth ability early game perhaps on purpose. Oddly, and I'm not sure if was intentional but it felt like my accuracy (available, not player skill) was increased throughout the game. As well, I didn't like how it reset my carried weapons often when loading the next portion of the same mission. Perhaps adding a couple more "special" weapons beyond the anti-tank rpg, along with additional unique, scenario-based uses beyond kill the tank and hold off the invading infantry.\n\nMore complex story/character development - While I'm all for shooting bad guys, I do enjoy a good story. This game in particular felt like it really could have benefited from a more complex, character/relationship driven background. I think that's what was attempted but I never really felt connected with any of the characters, many of which we said our farewells to moments after meeting. I think adding an interesting twist to the end of the game, perhaps some unique take on what was really (or go ahead and make something up here like they did in Return to Castle Wolfenstien) going on behind the Nazi lines not only would have added a bit more gameplay/hours (felt a little short to me by an hour or two), but spiced up what otherwise felt like an excerpt from a History Channel special.\n\nVehicles - While you do get to mount a machine gun, I as dissapointed that I never got to drive a tank through the remains of a building, blasting holes in walls and mowing down infantry.\n\n\n\n","June 20, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And you got the poland uprising levels which is mostly lineair shooting.\nThis game doesn't have something to stand out but what it does, it does very well!!\n\nPros :\n- The stealth works good\n- The amount of details is suprisingly good\n- The graphics looks good, but that is just something personal.\n- Some big open levels in which you can choose your way on how to approach it, stealth or  guns blazing? Go throught the upper town or the main street, or just maybe sneak from house to house.

A big plus for not using quick-time events at all!\n\nSome replay value as you can either be stealthy or storm around shooting up everything, and you can manipulate certain objects to create traps (for example - in one level, you kill a group of enemies by dropping a bunch of treetrunks on their heads, and in another mission by rolling a truck into an enemy camp, and kiling them when the truck hits another truck and explodes).  You can also use an enemy soldier as a "meat shield", by holding him hostage at gunpoint while shooting his friends.\n\nAlso included are some entertaining features usually seen in "Sniper Elite", such as bulletcam under certain circumstances (when sniping, for instance) and the whole "shooting by cover of a loud noise so as not  to be discovered"-thing.\n\nThe story and voice are also pretty decent, and the game certainly delivers in the "nice graphics" and "ooh, shiny"-department. The controls feel a bit like "Medal of Honor: Airborne" to me. Not perfect, but close enough.\n\nSome people have reported performance issues, but I haven't encountered any (I run with all settings on highest on a mid-range gaming rig). The game has crashed once during the first four hours of gaming.\n\nLook, if you like WW2 FPS, you just might enjoy Enemy Front.

For the price, you honestly get a hell of a fun, and really pretty game. It's also surprisingly free roam, so you can approach almost every level in any way you want. And a nice little addition is that the sniping is similar to the Sniper Elite series as it slows the action down to offer a dramatic viewpoint of your kill.\n\nThe game uses the Cryengine, which really shows its chops even on a lower end PC. CI Games ditched the typical brown look of most FPS games in the last generation, and ops for a more natural aesthetic to the towns and countrysides of Europe... Well, as natural as you can get when everything's been bombed to ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnyhow, one last thing I wanna mention (that I'm not sure anyone else will care about) is the physics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacemanjupiter/recommended/256190/","spacemanjupiter","SpacemanJupiter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacemanjupiter/","104 products in account","First off I'd like to come out and say that I feel like I got what I paid for. This game is not a AAA game, but it doesn't need to be. It's 30 dollars, and I certainly feel it was worth that. There are good things, and there are some things that need a little work. I'll start with the things that need work. One aspect of sound design needs fixed. When the main character starts a level and is speaking to allies, his voice is completely disconnected from the scene with different audio effects, so you can tell it's out of place. Minor issue. The AI is not very smart, and needs a bit of work. The difficulty level is too easy on the hardest difficulty level. Bump that up. The game needs a form of AA in the options. I could only get FXAA to work, forced through Nvidia. Don't reset my weapons at each major checkpoint. That frustrates me as a player. I ran into one minor glitch where my sniper bullet would not interact with AI that was too far away. It would go right through him. Only happened once that I remember. Fix the mouse sensitivity in the game. Even at the lowest setting my mouse was too sensitive for my tastes, even while it was at halfway in Windows. I had to lower it in control panel. MP needs some anti-cheat. That's important. It also needs ping times to show and a few other options. More people need to jump into MP. When I first bought this game, the times that I played MP were a lot of fun. I had no issues getting it, but it needs tweaked.\n\nMany of the above issues are somewhat minor and not game breaking. The visuals are nice, but don't expect Crysis 3 just because it is using the same engine. Turn post processing down to minimal and you'll get a noticable frame rate boost and much sharper image. I liked the colors used in this game and the out door levels where colors popped and weren't as drab looking as other games of this type. War isn't grey and brown everywhere in real life so it shouldn't be in a game either. The gameplay itself felt really nice and tight. The mouse movement is smooth, responsive, and reminded me of old games that do that right like MOH. Character movement doesn't stop on a dime when letting go of the stick or keys, but is a very slight effect. I was perfectly fine with it and don't even remember experiencing it while playing earlier today. EIther they adjusted it in a patch or I simply overlooked it very early on. The levels are pretty interesting and open, with multiple paths and extra objectives on the side that you can complete. I liked that. My frame rate was always 60fps, partly due to lowering post processing, which also made the game look better. I never had performance issues. When I first got this game I played some MP, but concentrated on SP more so. That's what I usually do with any game. SP first so I can experience the campaign and prime myself for MP. I never had problems getting into MP and the times I did play, I had a lot of fun. Unfortunately people aren't filling up the servers. I liked the MP maps and hope that it picks up at some point. The gameplay felt pretty classic and simple, which is what I like.\n\nI enjoyed both the SP and MP (while I could). This game has a good foundation and could be an above average game with tweaks and patches for some issues. After completing SP I feel the game is worth buying, especially if the devs continue to work and address some things. It isn't perfect, but I didn't expect it to be, and that is no different than a lot of other decent games on here that need some work. I will definitely recommend the game.","July 21, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a WW2 FPS similar to Sniper Elite V2 but doesn't require stealth to complete. Sure it has some bugs but most of the time (at least for me) was bug-free gameplay with good graphics. This game is very optimised and at the same time quite good looking, but at momets there were not so good textures. The gameplay is quite short, (took me 6 hours to complete evn with the additional mission, but i'm not so good so it'll take about 4 ) and at moments not so good, but it doesn't differ mush from Sniper Elite V2 (the killcam though is not so good). Most of the time you'll be either lining up shots on at least 7 or so emeies or you'll be fooling yourself that you can "pass it on stealth". The multiplayer is almost like the campaign, but without objectives (except in radio transmission) and that there are real people you're playing with. The problem is, that there are almost noone to play with.\nNomatter what i still like this game and i recommend it if you can get it under 15 euros, because altrough i like it, it's short.","August 25, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/recommended/256190/","dmstewart","DMStewart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/","267 products in account","This game is a lot of fun! There are a few pros and a few cons on this game, as is the way with all games. So I will just point them out quickly.\n\nPros:\n\n1) Intuitive and easy gameplay: You start off in the thick of action and you can immediately start performing as if youre a veteran in the game\n\n2) Character mechanics: Your character is very easy to operate. If you hit "crouch" while running you do a slide. I didnt need to be told that. I did it on my own within the first few seconds of the game. But you will notice that you need very little instruction and your cdharacter is so easy to navigate through the worlds\n\n3) Cryengine: The graphics are not as good as I expected (more on that later) but Cryengine has great psyhics. And Enemy Front does well in making the most of the engine in this category\n\n4) Choice: Each section of each level has multiple ways to approach it. For example, you need to hold point at the Church. There are two different missions and tactics that you can choose from to achieve this. No matter which you choose you will find side objectives and you can complete the mission stealth or guns blazing or a little of both. I try to sneak through the hard parts and go bezerk on areas where there are only a few enemies.\n\n5) Hit detection system: This is a simple tweak thast makes so much sense. When you shoot an enemy a white "X" means youre hitting them and when you get a red "X" that means the enemy is dead. It makes the FPS environment so much easier and also helps you realize who needs extra bullets and who doesnt. Very cool.\n\n6) Price: I got this on sale for $23. Normal price is $30. Its worth it. I actually thought this would be ideal at a regualr price of $25 and you will see why in the cons\n\n7) Gun Mechanics: The guns are fairly easy to operate. There is recoil but much like a lot of FPS's its sort of put in there just to give the feel of authenticity. But because this game has so many scenes with a lot of action I am glad they didnt spend a lot of time getting the guns to operate true to their real life specs. It wouldve made the game way too hard for most.\n\nThere are other pros but those are the first that come to mind.\n\nNow the cons. There arent many and they shouldnt stop you from playing the game. But there are sort of weird, quirky, and unexplainable. They dont bother me but they may drive someone nuts. (Usually CoD fans are very particular about other games but havent realized yet that CoD sucks)\n\nCons:\n\n1) Stupid, poor quality cut scenes: I've noticed with Crysis series too that cut scenes are not high quality. Which is annoying because youre playing in this super detailed environment and then in between levels you get a back-story that looks like it was made on BetaMax. Not sure why Cryengine games are structured this way. Here we have the bad cut scenes and they have used a 3d still image that the camera pans around while loading a level. Since that image is just as fuzzy as the cut scenes, it is an eye sore and pretty annoying. I wouldve rather had a black screen with a "Loading" progress bar. Btw, cut scenes are so low quality that my framerate goes up to 4,000 frames per second and stays there.\n\n2) Graphics Quality: I always start games with everything maxed out. And then if it is too heavy on resources I start to back certain settings off. Here, I am still maxed and the graphics are not as good as I expected. Some of the textures look unfinished, especially at shallow angles. Certain foliage (and frequently so) have this sort of 1 dimensional Super Mario Bros 3 look and feel. Since the levels are very linear you would think that the player's path would be the cleanest. Ironically its not. Its actually all of the objects taht are out of where you can travel that seem to be flawless (and finished)\n\n3) Graphics Settings (or lack there of): One thing I usually kill shorlty after testing a game is post-processing effects. Here, post-processing can not be turned off but only turned down to "Low". Gamma never feels right no matter how its set.\n\n3.5) For some reason, any adjustments I make in-game remove the color profile I have set up in windows for my monitor. Anyone with an ASUS monitor knows that having a modified color profile is necessary for proper look and feel. After any adjustments this triggers the profile to be deactivated.\n\n4) Rock Throwing/Aiming: This game plays a lot like Sniper Elite V2. You can even throw a rock to distract an enemy. However, where you throw it is much higher than your cross hairs. So its very hard to aim where you are throwing it. Too many times I tried to throw it away from me to get a guy to walk away. But rather I would hit the ceiling or something right in front of me and the enemy would see me. So, for some reason, you have aim almost at the ground when throwing a rock (and grenades) in order to get a good proper throw away from you.\n\n5) GPU Usage: For some reason this will really put my 290 right up to 100% and stay there. Thats just very odd because there are so many games that have much better graphics that do not do this. And when I say it goes to 100% I mean for everything...core clock, memory clock, et al.\n\nAnd thats about it. Im sure there is more but I am just writing this off the top of my head. I have not tried Multiplayer yet and I may never try it. I save Multi for games like Insurgency and dont care too much for games that are supposed to be single-player and have a multi option. They are hardly ever done right or worth my time to play. But If you like FPS and WW2 you should be buying this game","June 14, 2014","true","9.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I first saw this game on sale through steam, which i wish i would of bought it then because this game does not even live up to 3Quarters of the price tag it has.\n\nThe Pros of the game are:\nGood Graphics\nGood Level Design\nGood Voice Acting\n\nThe Cons and Bugs\nBad Sneaking System\nLinner Game Play\nAnnoying loading screens\nEasy headshots to enemies depending on if you want casual or what ever\nAnnoying Music\nWeapon Boxes that are placed everywhere giving nearly unlimited ammo\n\n\nNow these are the major things that I've noticed that pretty much break the game for me.  Its more of a generic feel then any fluid shooter. Its more of a arcade game with out any fun rewards. Its simple, and boring as there is no real challange. Now the call of duty, and other series games ruined this line of game because they turned it into a mainstream way to run download content and other stupid ways to monotize there games. I do gotta give this game credit though they haven't done that "Yet" and i don't think they will, but if they do, I just will not buy another game from this publisher.\n\nThat all being said, I hate writing bad reviews on videogames but this one just kinda frusterated me with the price tag and the  lack of stuff to do in the game. I hate point a to point b games and this game said that it provided more then linner game play which it failed to do. If there were refunds for this game, I would like one. So i will rate this game a 4 of 10.","July 3, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The visual style is colourful, something you don't often see in WW2 games, and is a very welcome change.\n\nThe music is nice, and at some points beautiful. Weapon sounds are crisp and punchy, and the dialogue from the German enemies is great - and sometimes frightening (there's a certain line that Officers say that is downright scary when you hear it coming from around the corner). Voice acting from the main characters is a little off though, and lacks some charisma.\n\nThe story is okay, but lacks real punch, and you find yourself not really caring about the characters much - even though you may sympathise with the WW2 victims.\n\nWeapons and gameplay is a mixed bag. This game is certainly not OPEN WORLD like they claim.  I have yet to find any evidence of open world gameplay. There are a couple of instances where you can make a MULTIPLE CHOICE in the path you wish to take through the level, but that's it. Sometimes you will choose the stealth option, only to have the game force you to breach a door and start a massive firefight. Sniping is FUN, especially when you get a great shot and it goes into bullet-cam. Overall, the gameplay can be described as a generic FPS with ocassional basic stealth.\n\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nFirst of all, there are only 4 maps. Secondly, only a handful of servers. Third, I could not connect to ANY of these servers except one (I couldn't join, and the ones I could join disconnected me before the match even begun - yes, even the dedicated servers). When I finally got into ONE server, I (and many others it would seem from the player list) had extreme lag and ping levels in the red.\n\nMultiplayer NEEDS more content and more polish! Add at least another 4 maps, add BOTS if you aren't going to support international players, add some kind of progression or ranking system with unlocks to keep players coming back for more!\n\nFix fix fix multiplayer, and you could have a great game and capture a loyal WW2 crowd.\n\nMany people have purchased this with hope, so take the time and address the concerns of players now. They would love to have a good game to keep coming back to over and over, both in single player and especially multi player.","June 11, 2014","true","6.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

I've gotten about 4-5 hours in\n\nEnemy Front is a well-polished game for 30$. It has its faults, clearly, as almost all new relases do, but that shouldn't hold you back. I'll detail out the pros and cons, plus what I've read on the forums. As well, yes, another game where you don't fight as the Germans. But interestingly enough; It's for the Polish Resistance. Now, moving on:\n\nSingle player pros:\nSolid story from what I've read.\nFighting for the resistance.\nFun gameplay.\nA variety of weapons to use.\n\nSingle player cons: (Note, this is where I encountered bugs.)\nInvisble enemies (At times.)\nSomewhat poor AI. I was able to continually mow down enemies with a machine gun because they kept running into my sets begging to be shot.\nHitboxes seemed 'off'. I say this because there were several times I shot a German in the head and he just kept coming.\nAudio. Not sure if this applies to anyone else but there were times the audio wouldn't finish. A line would start, then cut off.\n\nMultiplayer pros:\nFun maps, which provide several ways to kill your enemies. I had fun leaping through doors with a bazooka and blasting anyone inside.\nPlayer model choice. (Note: I only played deathmatch.)\nGreat ambience, no cut-off issues like in single player. (Possibly due to the fact no one said anything.)\nWeapons are decent, even if a few aren't quite up-to-par.\n\nMultiplayer cons:\nIn the very first game I played, someone was glitching and had gotten out of the map. No idea how he did it. (Happened on Tram Station or whatever the map is called.)\nHitboxes were off, again.\nThe Trench Gun isn't as powerful as it should be. (I shot a guy point-blank with it several times, and he didn't die. This may have been hitboxes, but still.)\n\nAll in all, I give the game a solid 7/10. Multiplayer is fun but buggy, single player is okay but has potential. What do you expect? It's a great game anyway for 30$.\n\nNow, for the section of what I've read on the forums. I've been reading that people crash to desktop instantly, others can't get into single player after a cutscene, other people have no sound, and that there's framerate issues and poor optimization. For these people, I pity you. However, for anyone reading this review, I recommend you go to the forums and look through before making a solid conclusion about if you'd like this game or not. Hopefully there will be future patches that address the issues people have on the forums, because they're missing a good game.\n\nThanks for reading.","June 12, 2014","true","1.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Now, for me personally the pros outweigh the cons. I have seen in other reviews that there are reports of a lot of bugs and glitches, but I can't say I have experienced the same. Only one very minor bug, that was more amusing than anything. I have not played the multiplayer yet, however that is not why I bought this game. My suggestion is if you're looking for an online WWII shooter experience, you're probably not going to find it here, at least for the time being. That being said, the singleplayer is quite fun. Granted, the game is not as open as promised, but I think that has been stated enough by others.\n\nVisually the game is eye candy, and the models for most characters are well done. The audio is much the same, plus the sounds of the weapons are very nice, and so are the voices of the Germans. However, the voice acting of one of the main characters, who is a resistance fighter, is a little "off". I find myself wondering just what accent he is supposed to have, which wouldn't be too much of an issue normally, but I find myself distracted from his dialogue.\n\nMy bottom line is that, if you're looking for "the next revolutionary fps" you're not going to find it here. However, if you're looking for a fun WWII singleplayer experience it is well worth the buy. I have had a blast playing the single player so far, and I will certainly come back to it. I have a passon for WWII games, and if you do too it's definitely worth a playthrough.\n\n(Also kind of random, but it also has my favorite game mechanic from Far Cry 3, "the rock throw". I'm not going to lie, I do try to hit the enemy soldiers with it. :P)","June 12, 2014","true","26.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It's not too expensive, the graphics are great, and it has some very good ideas. The same cannot be said for the lackluster multiplayer, while not terrible, it's not too great either. However if you've been looking for a good single-player WWII game then this might just be what you were looking for.\n\nThat being said, there is one thing that annoys me to no end and prevents me from playing this game. I CANNOT USE STEAM VOICE CHAT WHILE PLAYING. This is the most frustrating thing in the world to me. I consistenly talk to my friends while playing games, meaning I am almost never able to play this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/armaster11/recommended/256190/","armaster11","ARMaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/armaster11/","397 products in account","I ♥♥♥♥ing love WWII FPS games, but what I don't like about them is being broken as ♥♥♥♥. Enemy Front is one of those games where it wants to be better than CoD (which I totally understand), but the game performs negatively on what it's trying to have you do. I have not bothered finishing the game since it has so many damn issues I can't handle it anymore so I'm just gonna go ahead and get on with the review.\n\nSince this game is running on the CryEngine 3 I'm going to say that the game is not optimized at all. When I looked at it's minimum requirements I was thinking oh this game should run perfectly fine on my system I mean ♥♥♥♥ it looks good...nope. I barely get 45 - 60 in the game on med - high settings and I know which part of the settings are gonna be the FPS hogs in the game. When lots of explosions and effects happen it drops down to about 20 - 30...good lord. Now I know I can play Crysis n all just fine with the engine, but when this doesn't thats poop optimization. Another thing is the graphics don't even look that good either, but I can care less about that tho. Oh and they really ♥♥♥♥ed up on DX9 mode. DX11 may be sorta poopy, but switching to DX9 for me made it even worse. My game was corrupted as crap until I switched back to DX11 so I'm forced to play the game properly on DX11. Terrible!\n\nThe AI are slow as crap. I can just pass right by and the meter wouldn't go that fast. Another thing is I played this on the hardest difficulty and they sometimes shoot like Stormtroopers and the amount of damage I take feels like I was playing on Easy this whole time. I kinda feel like I'm playing Far Cry 3 when I'm tryin to screw with the enemy AI, but in a broken way. It's safe to say that the AI in the game are semi-braindead, though not as braindead as the Wolfenstein TNO AI.\n\nWith a lot of flaws that were overlooked in this game there are some things I liked about it. I actually like that they give you open-ended levels where you can either go loud or stealth through (I'll get to the stealthing topic in a few.) The game doesn't have you wait for a certain interactive cutscene to slow you down like CoD and having mapping that is completely linear and will not give a choice on how you want to go through. I hate when modern FPS becomes so linear you have to wait for something to happen, have your team AI move on first and you last, and force you to go loud or stealth w/o giving you a choice. This game let's you perform how you want to progress through and that's something I like. I also like the weapons in the game too. I love the way they work and sound like MP40. The MP40 in the game is like a real MP40. Only problem with the weapons is that they are like pea shooters. I try to get a head shot and sadly it takes 2 hits in the head to count as a headshot...wtf game...wtf. Another thing is using a molotov is very...damn...slow.\n\nSpeaking of weapons and choices let's talk about the stealthing. I dislike the stealth mechanic. I think the stealthing is completely pointless. Some of you think it's fine, but to me it's just a joke. When it comes to stealthing it sometimes may work or sometimes it doesn't. Another thing that really pisses me off is that silent weapons are like rare to find in the game making it a bit difficult to stealth. When you sneak behind an enemy and perform an silent attack the kill is super damn slow. What I like to do instead is just take one of them as a hostage, move them somewhere where I can;t be spotted, and kill the nazi. Rock throwing is pretty useless the nazis are freaking deaf.\n\nThe story is bland the the objectives are weak. The game is just throwing random ♥♥♥♥ at ya sometimes and due to it's flaws n all it can sometimes make the game tough to get through. The story is boring and the characters are not interesting at all. Voice acting is pretty crap and whole bunch of bull honky. I haven't completed the game because of it's crappyness so I'm just gonna move on.\n\nOverall the game looks good n all, but it has lots and lots and lots and lots and LOTS of problems and I cannot play through this game anymore. I realized it really was a waste of money and my time and I still feel guilty for refunding my Sniper Elite III pre-order just for the TF2 Love & War Update.\n\n3/10! I like what it is trying to be, but it has failed to perform correctly as this game is unoptimized, buggy, and boring with it's story and objectives. I also heard that the multiplayer is awful and dead. If you guys want to try this because you really love WWII FPS then wait for it to go on sale or maybe get Sniper Elite III, Red Orchestra II/Rising Storm, Wolfenstein, or the classic Call of Duty 2. Maybe don't bother with this one at all.","June 30, 2014","false","3.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I'm going to go over a few problems a lot of whiney games have with this game.\n\nSingleplayer: The AI is dumb. yes this is true even on expert so as for a singleplayer game, enjoy it while it lasts and get what you can out of it, but I bought this for multiplayer so this isn't an issue for me.\n\nEveryone says they get low FPS. Thats because they try to run ultra settings on DIRECT X 11 with a 280gtx. Not going to work. Either upgrade your computers or turn off DIRECT X 11 and switch to DIRECT X 9. I honestly saw very little difference in terms of graphic quality with the two, except I got a huge FPS gain by switching to 9. So for all you morons out there, turn your damn shader quality down.\n\nMutliplayer: There are dedicated servers, this isnt a cod style matchmaking system. The only thing I don't like is the server size is a little small. If they increase it to like a 10v10 or more that would be amazing! Along with some bigger maps. I've had no issue with FPS or lag or HITBOXES like all these other people are talking about, maybe they should stop playing from cambodia and upgrade their internet. Hitboxes in this game register VERY well. I was online just blasting kids all day long especially with their loud romper stomper feet. I don't think people understand this is slightly more of a stealthy shooter, not COD run and gun.\n\nThe game is fun, its got a lot of multiplayer value and future potential. I'm excited to see what else they add in the future. Great WW2 stealth shooter. Don't buy it if you want a super refined polished game with thousands of features.

I'm going to go over a few problems a lot of whiney games have with this game.\n\nSingleplayer: The AI is dumb. yes this is true even on expert so as for a singleplayer game, enjoy it while it lasts and get what you can out of it, but I bought this for multiplayer so this isn't an issue for me.\n\nEveryone says they get low FPS. Thats because they try to run ultra settings on DIRECT X 11 with a 280gtx. Not going to work. Either upgrade your computers or turn off DIRECT X 11 and switch to DIRECT X 9. I honestly saw very little difference in terms of graphic quality with the two, except I got a huge FPS gain by switching to 9. So for all you morons out there, turn your damn shader quality down.\n\nMutliplayer: There are dedicated servers, this isnt a cod style matchmaking system. The only thing I don't like is the server size is a little small. If they increase it to like a 10v10 or more that would be amazing! Along with some bigger maps. I've had no issue with FPS or lag or HITBOXES like all these other people are talking about, maybe they should stop playing from cambodia and upgrade their internet. Hitboxes in this game register VERY well. I was online just blasting kids all day long especially with their loud romper stomper feet. I don't think people understand this is slightly more of a stealthy shooter, not COD run and gun.\n\nThe game is fun, its got a lot of multiplayer value and future potential. I'm excited to see what else they add in the future. Great WW2 stealth shooter. Don't buy it if you want a super refined polished game with thousands of features. The games small and so is the price, no complaints.","June 13, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Its what caught my eye. Out of the gate I decided to multiplayer first. The bad news for MP at this moment, not that many servers (could be not that many playing the game Death match worked. But Team Death Match I could not get to work.), second bad thing for MP is not being able to join them. Bad connection probs or something. But once you get in, a whole new can of WHUP ♥♥♥ is greeted. Small in size the maps seem, but lots of places to quickly set fast hit and run ambushes. First time, I had to get used to the style, and then second round, I ruled the leader board.\nSecondly, I decided to give the Campaign/Story Mode a run at. I loved the visual opening, And then the nice little lead in, to the point where you actually take control. The graphics are nicely done. Controls feel great. Loved using the plane fly by sounds to mask my shots. Even stealth killing was good (have yet to try the hostage taking bit, but I am sure I will). Was not aware of secondary objective(s), as my first mission told me I missed the secondary (would have been nice to know of them at the start). I love the distraction part of the game. Helped me out in a few tight spots. The only downer part for me so far, is that the game locked up on me as I was moving into a break in a wall of a building that lead what looked like a tunnel.\nBeyond that. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes a slow but not to slow paced of a FPS. There are times where the action does get hot and heavy from what I have seen so far (have yet to complete the game). But if your into some old school weapons and the feel of WW2. Then this may tempt your taste buds.\nOn a scale of 1-10.\nI rate this about 8.5 over all. A good experiance... But could use a bit more tinkering. And I am sure it woudl be that much better.","June 15, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Graphics on Cryengine 3 is great on this game, but they're not system-breaking like Crytek's shooters but that's fine by me since it's still an extremely appealing game to look at.

Truth is, while Enemy Front does not fully explore its untapped potential, it still provides a most enjoyable ride.\n\nTo begin with: graphics are good, really good. It truly creates a captivating atmosphere. Be warned, however: the game is poorly optimised, and thus framerate drops may be recurrent.\n\nRegarding sound, Music is absolutely fantastic. It has got a remarkable OST that will remain with you long after ending a mission. Voice acting, however, is somewhat lacklustre, and weapon sounds just feel bland.\n\nNow, on to gameplay:\n\nShooting works just fine, but I do have a minor complaint to make: weapons lack a certain "oomph" to it when fired. Maybe removing that ugly cross that pops up whenever you hit a target just to let you know you landed a shot would allow you to savour the moment all the more.\n\nMelee is, truth be told, absolutely disgusting. You get to an enemy up front, give him hell with the stock of your rifle and he will just fall sluggishly on his back, as if slowly falling asleep or something. That, and the lack of some powerful sound when meleeing them makes for some appaling close quarters. This might just be the worst thing about the game. Truly, I end up shooting everyone I am about to melee, just to spare myself of the despicable sight of enemies falling to their dreams - yup, you read that right.\n\nStealth, however, works like charm, and that's something I didn't expect from this game. It's not like it's a major feature or anything, but the game's designed in such a way that you can play each and every level either up front or sneaking your way behind the enemy lines - or a mixture, for that matter. This makes for multiple ways to tackle an enemy stronghold, a mission or the entire game itself for that matter. You can stealth kill enemies from behind or even take them hostages to use either as meat shield or to silently get rid of them somewhere else. And you know what? You can even pick up bodies and throw them wherever you choose, so as to avoid detection by your enemies. A GREAT feature that should exist in all games.\n\nEnemy Front delivers an enjoyable and unique experience in the genre. It has some rough edges, but you shouldn't let that mar your experience.\n\nFor 29.99, I deem this a 4/5. Excellent game.","June 23, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The atmosphere and the way the story are set up is very nice, the level design is well done, and the game is absolutely gorgeous. The weapons are pretty cool, the way they handle are nice, and they are very detailed. That's about where the good ends.\n\nFor not having a WWII shooter in the modern era, this is a sad disappointment to come about. It looks really cool, but the AI is just immensely stupid and the game tries to sell "open ended" but it just is not open ended. You cannot accomplish goals in any manner that you wish. It is very much a linear game, with having minor differences in how you approach maybe a single building or courtyard or something like that. There is a level with a town, that was pretty dope, but that was the only one. There's even a suppressed pistol in the game, but don't think about attempting stealth because it won't work.\n\nThe MP is a mess, I played a few games and every one was just lagging around. It was an awful experience and I don't really recommend anyone trying out the MP if they do pick up this game, it's just not worth the time.\n\nThe support for the game is basically non-existent, I don't even think there's a forum board to go talk to people except maybe on Steam. I could not find an official one.\n\nI would say that if you are looking for a solid 5 hours of fun, you could probably get that from the single player, but I would not spend $30 like I did on this game. If you see it for $5, go for it, you might enjoy it, but I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I tried really hard to like this game a lot and justify the purchase, but I've learned my lesson, yet again, to not purchase games on release.

The multiplayer community is non-exsistent much like MOH: Airborne's was... but the singleplayer is the main part of the game anyways, and it does well in that regard. Graphics on Cryengine 3 is great on this game, but they're not system-breaking like Crytek's shooters but that's fine by me since it's still an extremely appealing game to look at.

So far it plays just like sniper elite II (which was linear but a lot of fun). On some mission startups you can choose 1 of 2 options but once you choose..... its linear. Like sniper elite II you walk into an area that looks like a painball arena with obvious blocks of cover. Once you see something like that its pretty obvious there's going to be a shootout once you walk over some sort of trigger. Still you're walking through a level 'tunnel' , this is not a sandbox game by any means. To the reviewers out there from ign or other game sites, review your terms. "non linear" implies games like GTAV or in the war genre games like the first 3 rainbow six's or the red orchestra series games.\n\nIs it fun though? Yeah, its still pretty good. Its a console game so the enemies aren't very accurate but the bullet effects are pretty good. Your team AI seems about as useful as the team AI in COD4 (useless). Graphically the game looks great, that cryengine does wonders as usual. The story line isn't bad and the nazi's are the usal cardboard cutout evil badguys that don't know how to shoot. Maybe thats not right, they can shoot but your american hardskull deflects bullets and regenerates health like a starfish. I'm pretty sure your character could have single handedly won ww2.

I love playing cod - cod uo - cod 2 - cod waw etc. so this was the best thing that could happen.\n\nI guess i wanted it to be better then what it realy was. i could say i was disapointed but i cant say that i truly are disapointed.. it kinda goes both ways.\n\nFirst of all I hate to look at all the clips in the begining before the game startes.. you know the makers and engines and stuff.. ill press esc as a mad man to make them go away :P\n\nSo there i was in the begining menu of the game.. and damn that menu was so freaking promising and good. and the short video load screens are awesome.\n\nso when i started the singel player mission i was xcited. and beeing from norway and kneew that norwegian maps would be added i couldent wait for that story line to happen.\n\nwhen playing it was mixed feeling. a feeling between playing COD UO and call of juarez .- im not dissapointed about the "enemy" but there where some bugs here and there that realy shooked me sinse i had so great hopes for this game.. ive posted 2 screenshots from this on my profil.. flying in the air books and a enemy ghost inside a wall ..\n\nall that beside i still loved moving around and shooting stuff. but when i got to the point where i had found a silencer weapon  and i could realy stealth it.. i was so frustrated when i came to a  checkpoint and lost thoose weapons .. wtf.. let me keep them :(\n\nafther that point all the negativities started to infeltrate my head.\nlike missions could go on and on and on and on if you dident do what was xpected to do even though it was all over.\ni got like strange missions and couldent quite make them work as i think the plans for it was.\n\nsometimes you had to rush like hell for not been randomly killed at that point and sometimes if you rushed the ai player got stucked or bugged.\n\ni remember one of the landscapes.. city like.. i feelt like my character was a dwarf at some point.. not that its something wrong with that. but i think they mad some bad judgement in some of the layout.\n\nso ive finnishd the singelplayer mission.. done some multyplayer action..\n\nand i came to the conqlution that yes you could buy the game if you whant it and are a fan of ww2 games etc.\nbut dont xpect to much of it. its not a 100/100 game\nif i could rate it.. it would be a 55/100\n\nI had fun playing it. hoped it would be better but maybe next time :)","June 15, 2014","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Just feels like they kind of ran out of ideas as it is a very short game. Quite fun while it lasted but just leaves you feeling like it should have been released at half the price. Its certainly got potential and hopefully if they get enough sales they will work on a more polished sequel.\nGraphically its very nice, but certain features just don't work. The stealth aspect seems a bit pointless, you can stand in front of a guard that is shining a light in your face, but if you step behind a tree he doesn't realise you are there. Quite funny but not really in a good way.\nThis game is best played as a run and gun style and to this end it does everything very nicely, although slightly by the book.\nI'd give this a 6 out of 10, not bad by any means but it won't be scaring any of the big name developers.","June 16, 2014","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean, it's not great either, but the game is long enough to warrant the price. The levels also have a bit of replay value to them because you can do stealth kills in a lot of places if you want to. It has some bugs, but only a couple forced me to restart a checkpoint. Doing a stealth takedown apparently picks a random kill animation which can put you inside a wall, which is more amusing than frustrating. Anyways, I would say buy this game, especially if it goes on sale.

I disagree, because those people probably play on easy. The graphics of the game are amazing, and the storyline of the single player mode Is just drop dead awesome! And lets talk about the weapons. Being stealth In this game Is very very helpful. Now the accuracy of weapons get annoying, because It seems that there's bullet drop, and that's where people start saying "ohhhh I can't aim a gun so It's a bad game". No It's not at all, It might be difficult, but that makes It fun!!

So far it plays just like sniper elite II (which was linear but a lot of fun). On some mission startups you can choose 1 of 2 options but once you choose..... its linear. Like sniper elite II you walk into an area that looks like a painball arena with obvious blocks of cover. Once you see something like that its pretty obvious there's going to be a shootout once you walk over some sort of trigger. Still you're walking through a level 'tunnel' , this is not a sandbox game by any means. To the reviewers out there from ign or other game sites, review your terms. "non linear" implies games like GTAV or in the war genre games like the first 3 rainbow six's or the red orchestra series games.\n\nIs it fun though? Yeah, its still pretty good. Its a console game so the enemies aren't very accurate but the bullet effects are pretty good. Your team AI seems about as useful as the team AI in COD4 (useless). Graphically the game looks great, that cryengine does wonders as usual. The story line isn't bad and the nazi's are the usal cardboard cutout evil badguys that don't know how to shoot. Maybe thats not right, they can shoot but your american hardskull deflects bullets and regenerates health like a starfish. I'm pretty sure your character could have single handedly won ww2.

Where can you go ?\n\nYou don't know, but you don't care, since once again, it's a corridor game, the oly place where you need to go is ahead, following the flag.\n\nNow, the controls. They are very, very, very heavy. I've set my mouse sensibilt in maximum, and I have still the impression I'm trying to pull an elephant. But that's not all, it's the first time in a fps I see a character who takes 1sec to stop moving. Seriously, why is there so much inertia ? It's not a parcour game, it's a shooting game.\n\nYou want to play discretion ? I suppose it is possible. I really like fps where you can play discretion, like crysis and metro. But here I don't even bother doing so. The takedowns are long. Veeeeeeeery longs. You want to stealth kill that enemy ? Good I have a better way, fire your weapon in the air to tell everyone that you're here, because anyway that's what will happen after a stealth kill.\n\nBut maybe I'm just bad. So, I killed that man, quick, I need to drag it's body so nobody will find him. Wait ! Mother nature already took care of that. Move ten meters away, come back, the corpse will have disappeared. Thank you biodegradable bodies !\n\nAnd for the grand finale, the graphics !\nSeriously ? This is cryengien 3 ? The one used for crysis 3 and sniper ghost warrior ? It's awfull. The textures are bad quality (I run all in ultra), the light is overbright and the omnipresent sun shafts give an impression of mist. It's not a good mixture.\n\nAt first I thought most of the objects had some kind of importance, since they had the same luminosity as the ammo box, but no. They are just ugly and overlighted.\n\nThe cutscenes are in low (even very low) definition. Remember old games where you could see a lot of piexels ? I don't, because even old games had a better rendered than these cutscenes. Loading screens presents a 3d scene, in the same crappy definition. During my first loading, I prayed all the gods that the game wouldn't look lie that. Fortunately, I was exoced, unfortunately, I wonder if it is really better.\n\nOh! and before I forget, the difficulty. I play in expert. So yes, I die, but only because I lack attention, even in this difficulty, going berserck is more than easy. KAR and sniper kill in one shot. In fact, most weapons do, unless you don't know how to aim. At a point I wondered if I had mastered the headshot only.......\n\nSo, this game is ugly, uncoherent, unchallenging, ininteresting, and put a pejorative adjective here.\n\nI'll continue playing it until the end, bt only because I don't want to have wasted my money.\n\nI certainly not recommand it, it hurt me to say so, but call of duty is much better, no matter which one.","July 3, 2014","false","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't understand why it got so many bad reviews, because this is definetly a game that reminds of a true WWII FPS, just like a FPS should be like. So if you are reading this review, and you would like to play a real FPS then buy this game. If you are a WWII fan you can't miss this game.\n\nOverall I'm impressed about this game, CI Games did a great job with this game. Nice storyline that I will remember and definetly I'll come back to play again campaign. I hope we'll see another great titles from CI Games, maybe an Enemy Front 2 :D.\n\nI've bought it retail, not digital (I like PC case with a nice cover :D) and I've read somewhere that the price is too high, I don't agree with this. Consider that this game was done with a budget much more light than the blockbuster FPS like COD or MOH or Battlefield. So there are much more likely to come out financial issues.\n\nI'm going to point out some good points that come into my mind:\n\n+ Excelent graphics. I mean not necesarlly by texture resolutions, or high poly models or advanced shaders, I'm talking about how environment looks like. Even if some textures are splashed, the overall effect it's really nice, makes you fell like you were in WWII. Another good thing is the colors, you can see a wide color range, from nice green vegetation to snow, from dark underground tunels to shinny skies, etc.\n\n+ Weapons. Yes, firing mechanism. It's addictive, I like recoil and how weapons sound. Plus you have a wide range of weapons, each performing different.\n\n+ Sound. Beside weapons sound, the soundtrack is beautifull and even the environment sounds are nice. You'll find yourself in a corn field, hearing birds singing in the tree, and belive me that's a gorgeous moment.\n\n+ Level design. Every level is different. You'll see WWII Warsow, underground labs, sunny France villages, even a level with snowfall. So yes, speaking about location, they'll be different and moreover the way levels are design makes you think how you wanna hide from your enemies. Crates, barrels and so on, are nice placed.\n\n+ Gameplay. Camera performs well, simple FPS gameplay, WASD, jump, fire, zoom, grenade and silent takedown. Simple but efficient, and nicely done.\n\nNow I'm gona point some negative points:\n\n- Bugs. I gotta admit, there are a lot of bugs. Some of them are so annoing that you can't go over, and you have to reload last checkpoint.\n\n- Difficulty. Even on hard it's too easy. Maybe some more chalangeing enemies would be better.","April 7, 2015","true","20.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

From the Sniper series to Alien Rage, the studio has a habit of releasing critically slated shooters it taglines as "hardcore" and "revolutionary". To further this effort, CI Games recently recruited the talent of Stuart Black to its new London offices. So, does this newly added talent help CI to create a great game? No, but they might be learning how.\n\nEnemy Front makes good on carrying on the tradition of grandiose CI game descriptions, billing itself as the "first truly modern WW2 FPS". I'm not really 100% sure on what constitutes a "truely modern" video game anymore, but I can see this coming from a number of different perspectives. Most likely I believe is probably the graphical capabilities of the game, which are quite nice seeing as Enemy Front runs on CryEngine 3 technology. The game looks fantastic in most levels, complete with signature CryEngine light shafts and snow effects. Aside from a few issues with scale, most of the environments and models are decently accurate to their real world counterparts, and weapons look and sound more accurate then I expected from a budget action title. Ambient noise seems to be all but non-existent however, making the environments feel much more sparse then they look. Some of the levels do contain musical cues to make up for this, and when they do the music thankfully is very well done, and extremely cinematic. Enemy Front runs smoothly for most of the game, but there were a few places where the frame rate dropped dramatically and consistently for no apparent reason. In addition to random FPS drops, I also constantly encountered a strange bug which caused Enemy Front to set its volume level in the Windows 7 mixer to 25%, causing the game to either constantly be soft, or forcing me to tab out of the game to open my volume mixer every 30 minutes to an hour. Aside from these complaints, the game looked and ran pretty decently.\n\nSo Enemy Front has pretty decent graphics and sound, but that's mostly expected with a game that has a big name licensed engine behind it. So what about the game play? Well, this is were things start to fall apart, and rather quickly. You play as Robert Hawkins, an American journalist trapped in the middle of the Warsaw uprising. The game starts with Hawkins making an impassioned radio plea for assistance from inside the embattled Warsaw, mirroring the real life John Ward's broadcasts down to the "This is Warsaw calling" opening. Unfortunately, this is about the extent of the historical accuracy Enemy Front concerns itself with. After the well done and touching opening cinematic, the game dumps you off in the middle of a firefight behind a blockade which you quickly abandon for the safety of the sewers, which you use for most of the first half of the game to move between levels. Enemy Front then gives you an option of which level to proceed to, and although the ability to direct the flow of fighting through levels is another selling point of the game, this is one of only a handful of times this actually happens; although the levels rarely feel like a corridor shooter, there is always a clear linear pathway through the levels.\n\nOnce you get into a level proper Enemy Front gives you a quick run down on its stealth element, which is what you may expect from an FPS game with stealth elements. Stay crouched, sneak up behind people, and stab them. There is also audio cover in some levels, a la Sniper Elite, which will allow you to fire shots without being heard. Unfortunately the stealth system is laughably broken, with soldiers commonly spotting you from the across the map, even when you are in cover. Except in a few cases were stealth is forced, it is almost always better to go in guns blazing. Combat is fast and furious, and getting kills feels weighty and good with each shot feeling like it has some force behind it. Unfortunately, although yet another tagline is "advanced tactical AI", enemy AI is almost entirely broken. Most troops will simply stand there and try to put as many rounds as they can toward you, while some do try to find cover but can't seem to shoot around it. In one level I had picked a trench gun as my main weapon, and found that many enemies would simply stand there and look at me if I rushed up on them. Although in some cases the AI worked well and attempted to flush me out of cover using grenades, in many cases the only challenge poised by my foes was the massive amount of damage I took if I did manage to get hit.\n\nProbably the biggest I have with the main single player of Enemy Front is the story. The story starts in the middle of the Warsaw uprising, a time of great drama and plenty of heroic and incredible stories which have rarely been told in creative media. However, although Enemy Front does get some historical events correct, there are an equal number of inaccuracies, and most of the story that takes place in Warsaw revolves around defending a church which has seemingly little strategic value. About a third of the way through the main story, however, the story then inexplicably takes a strange turn in the form of flashbacks to various other fronts Mr. Hawkins has fought in, including France, Norway, and at one point even with a secret agent into Germany itself. Ignoring the fact that the idea a freelance journalist would somehow get the okay to tag along into these secret mission completely destroys your suspension of disbelief, these jump cuts also kill any sense of connection you had to the characters in any of these stages of the story. In addition, although the store page boasts of a 10 hour campaign, it took me barely over 5 hours to finish the campaign and the extra pack in mission on the hardest difficulty setting.\n\nAlthough multiplayer plays decently for what it is, it is extremely sparse with support for only 12 players and handful of weapons and maps unless you pay the extra $5 for the DLC map pack. Although the weapons handle well, and the high damage output may attract some of the more hardcore oriented shooter fans or those looking for a faster paced shooting experience, the small, bland levels and restrictive player count made multiplayer easily the weakest part of the game for me.\n\nAll in all, although Enemy Front is a marked improvement from CI's previous efforts, they still have a long way to go. Slowly but surely, they may get there, but for now other current WW2 offerings such as Red Orchestra 2 or Sniper Elite 3 easily win out.","July 29, 2014","false","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But Im mad.... mad at my own self.... I should have researched this game better before buying it but I had just gotten a fresh paycheck and was ready to blow it on games. Well I looked at the steam reviews and they said this game was a great buy, "cheap" yes only $23 on discount. But its not even worth that much. I fell for the reviews which called the game a fun revist of old ww2 games, paying homage to the original call of duties and such. I don't know about you but I f**kin loved the original cod back in its day. This game was nothing more than a disappointment, no it was worse than that... it was humiliating, the way you feel when you get played by a con artist. It was advertised well I will say, even had a song I love in the trailer. I fell for it, I should have seen all the red flags. Its made but the creators of the sniper ghost warrior games which were horrid.. red flag! There was at the time of my purchase a lack of reviews... red flag! I have never heard of this game before release... sometimes a red flag. But heres the strangest thing of all: I found a gamestop preview of this game after purchasing it which was dated to back in 2011... They previewed this game 3 years ago!!! And even more strange, they previewed it as "a completely linear story driven single player experience about elite soldiers behind enemy lines on a missing to sabotage nazis." Yeah... f**kin weird right? considering this game is currently advertised as a game which is non linear and about a reporter trapped in nazi territory. Oh and I should tell you, this game is a completely linear game but tries to trick you into thinking otherwise by having you choose to complete the linear missions in slightly different order. The missions are linear, theres no arguing that, the only way to change the path the game forces you down is to jump out of the window rather than exitting through the door.\n\nTo make this game worse it is riddled with bugs and horrible optimized. I play litterally every game on high or ultra settings... hell I play bf4 on ultra settings no problem. But this game has huge fps drops when anything above medium settings. And even on medium theres a rediculus amount of screen tearing and after some time of playing it begins to hurt my eyes. Its litterally like swimming underwater without goggles. The graphics aren't even good! poorly done models... holy sh*t look at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ model for the ammo crates!! jesus christ who designed those? whoever designed the ammo crates had to of been artistically challenged. Anyways more gripes with the game: the AI is overall ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by even low budget game standards... I gave up on the sneak parts and just walked in and shot the nazis in their faces because sneaking was useless. The AI runs to predetermined points, which isn't that big of a deal... except for the fact that they run to predetermined points even when those points are behind you and your friendly AI... Yeah they litterally walk right passed you and your friendly AI to take cover on the same side of some object as you and your allies.\n\nTL;DR:\nNOT AS ADVERTISED, POORLY OPTIMIZED, TERRIBLE GRAPHICS, HORRENDOUS AI, BUGS, NON STOP SCREEN TEARING EVEN ON LOW SETTINGS, VERY LINEAR EVEN THOUGH ADVERTISED AS NON-LINEAR, BROKEN SNEAK MECHANICS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONT BELIEVE ANY OF THE GOOD REVIEWS OF THIS GAME","June 21, 2014","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can go guns blazing or stealth, but the former is always faster due to how long it takes enemies to do anything. Their reaction times are dreadful and their tactics don't go beyond standing still and shooting at you. If you run and gun you can simply sprint around shooting everyone since they are so slow that they pose no threat, if you choose stealth and get spotted then you get to enjoy all of them running at you in a straight line while you gun them all down. The game is built around combat/stealth, so when the AI is this bad the entire thing falls apart no matter how much freedom you have to approach the gameplay scenarios.\n\nThere's some other flaws too but they're subjective - the FOV is pretty zoomed in (around 55-60) which makes the game disorienting to play, and the movement is weird and slow and it feels like I'm hovering on the ground as if it were a Source engine game (it uses CryEngine 3).\n\nLike I said, it could've been a good game, but the enemies are so dumb that it's boring.","June 29, 2014","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is no AAA polished game but it is definitely worth its money and quite enjoyable. Here's what I liked about the game -\n\n+ good visuals albeit had issues initially (see con)\n+ good enough gameplay that it is fun\n+ enemies sometimes react well and I like that they're constantly searching for you and don't give up their alertness like in reality\n+ fun enough to keep me engaged\n+ bullet cam! Never gets old. They did a great job with the Sniper games - loved both of them. Glad to see bullet cam here\n+ surprised the rooms have variety as do some locales to an extent given its budget\n+ nice achievements\n+ sometimes you get innovative ways to kill enemies\n+ good selection of weapons\n+ weapons make nice sounds\n\n- no maual save\n- I hate the checkpoint save system. So many times I had to repeat areas because of last enemy\n- graphics issues - game wouldn't start on high res and high texture. Lowering res and settings made it work. Still looks very good. Its not like most people can tell diff anyways between many minor graphics settings\n- crashes\n- some enemy AI bugs - a couple of times the enemy just didn't realize I was right in front of him\n- sometimes enemies instantly realize where you are\n\nOverall, this is a good game but not a great game. I'd rate it a 7/10\n\nDefinitely worth its purchase price. I'd recommend people buy this game. There's about 7-8 hours enjoyment in here for $30 or less which is more than what I can say about $60 Call of Duty games with its 3 hr SP.","December 13, 2014","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean its asssssss.\nThis game is one of those its so bad its good kind of games. I bought it for about 3-4e, which is around the price you should try to find it for. The graphics are...fair on the PC, but ocasionally some things just look abysmal. Cutscenes are like visual diarrhea, the voice acting is..well it is what it is, its not good.\nThe animations are clunky and buggy as hell at times which can result in some really fun stuff ocasionally. Like most things in the game.\n\nThe sound design is damn weird. Sometimes things might sound alright, but theres a weird reverb effect going on even when its not needed. Gun sounds are buggy as balls at times, you might get into one of those epic breaching scenes, the gun fires in slow motion, but the gun sounds are at normal speed. Mostly the sounds are just ♥♥♥. Even the nazi soldiers sound like asses in uniforms\nOh god, almost forgot the soundtrack, it is some terrible stuff. Makes me want to fill my ears with gasoline and light it up, its f*cking bad! it never even fits the stuff thats going on!\n\nThe game also feels like its one of those weird things where they picked random things from random games. You get the breaching stuff from CoD, you get the stone throwing from far cry (which is f*cking useless by the way, but it can glitch out the AI atleast) and so on.\nThe story is some cheesy sheit too, our hero, hawkings is some reporter guy who kills the whole nazi reich on his own while on a quest for some epik scoop. He takes out the camera 3 times during his quest. No wait, probably 4. I mean he takes the came our during the final cutscene that lasts like 10 seconds. The game ends so stupidly and quickly that I honestly dont think the devs believed that anyone would actually finish the game, well f*ck you! I I finished it!\n\nThere is a multiplayer component, but to no ones suprise, no one is playing it so who gives a flying f*ck.\n\nEnemy front is a stinking pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ motherf*cking sh*t, its a bug filled, glitchy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess thats painful to the eyes aswell as the ears, but my god I kind of liked it and I might re-play it at some point. Its a fantastic mess and worth picking up if you want to torture yourself with some doodoo game thats actually kind of fun.\n\n"Impressive machine"\n-hawkings who probably misread his line","January 4, 2015","true","7.4"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","8","18","3","0"

This WWII shooter is refreshing to play and very pretty to look at. As a student of WWII, I also like the fact that the game is set with the Polish resistance, something rarely, if ever touched on in previous shooters. The graphics are as demanding on your video card as you'd like to make it, but also offers a legitimate range of performance based settings. Here are some other great aspects to the game:\n\n1. Easy GUI for gameplay and settings.\n2. Escapable cutscenes.\n3. AI is moderately intelligent.\n4. Environment is destructible.\n5. Weapons are neatly made, (particularly the Welrod) with awesome sound effects.\n6. Sniper usage comes with killcam, but not overwhelmingly so. (Very similar to Sniper Warrior 1,2.)\n7. Somewhat linear based progression; however, nice secondary missions popup on the side.\n8. Plausible, and somewhat interesting storyline.\n\nI will also say that the game is far more stable than the initial release of any Call of Duty game, and I have played all PC versions of that since the original franchise release over 10 years ago. (Just sayin...)\n\nFor World War II fans, this game is a great buy. If you want to experience some advanced, arcade shooter gaming in the WWII shooter genre, why not Enemy Front?\n\nI'm looking forward to watching this game grow. It's a lot of fun!

A shame really, you can see the devs were trying really hard to make a cool WW2 FPS here and freshen the genre but it's just generic, im not sure if it was due to a small budget or they just didnt have the skill to pull it off but at the end of the day it feels like any other shooter, it looks like any other shooter, it sounds like any other shooter, it plays like any other shooter.\n\nIt's clunky, quiet glitchy, the stealth is broken and insanely hard to pull off, the animations are pretty robotic, it definatly dosent look like its making full use of the Cryengine 3 but it looks good, the lip sync animations are pretty bad so try not to look at those and the gameplay is well, the same as every other FPS ever made. I didn't expect anything ground breaking for 30 bucks no but it dosent seem to try and vamp the satisfaction of kills or anything in any way, there is nothing else to do but go forward and click and if thats what your looking for in a game then this is for you but if your looking for 30 dollars worth of game it's not really here sadly.\n\nI guess its an fun little romp if your a big fan of WW2 history and guns as much as me but other then that wait for it to go for sale cas this is just an aim gun at enemy and click, not much more can be said about it sadly.\n\nQuick score 5/10, it's fine, not great but fine.","June 15, 2014","false","16.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Every now and again you'll run into a single enemy or two who act in a reasonable manner, but most of the time every enemy will just be a random psychic who senses you sneaking through brick walls and the shoots you through them, while you get stuck in furniture that spawns 5 seconds after you enter a room.\n\nThe story is bland and pointless, the main character a white-washed American who for no reason what so ever shows up in Poland and France during the second world war with not explanation as to how he got there, or why. The game itself states he's a journalist, but this fact never comes into play in the actual game from what I could tell.\n\nThe AI is non-existant with enemies who will simply run towards you in the straightest line possible while you mow them down with whatever weapon you've got in your hands at the time. Most weapons a surrealistically precise, meaning that it makes absolutely no different whether you equip a machine gun or a sniper - Iron sights will turn you into the harbinger of Nazi death no matter what. When said Nazi's do decide to fight back, their favorite tactic is to shoot you through walls.\n\n1,5/7.","August 7, 2014","false","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

We haven't had one of those in a while. There is Wolfenstein: The New Order but that one's alternate history. Enemy Front uses the CryEngine but some of the textures are low resolution. The game is nice in that it gives you the ability to do either a stealth run or a gun and run. The AI is a little dumb though, since they take a while to notice you. I played on medium difficulty however so I'm not sure if they notice you faster on expert. It is more forgiving however than Sniper Elite in the sense that the enemy doesn't have Eagle Eye and so they won't know exactly where you are and if you manage to lie low for a while and let your detection meter drop, they will stop searching for you but will still remain on guard. The dumb part comes in due to the fact that they lose you simply because you hid behind a box, even though they know you were there a minute ago. The weapons are nice. Ammo is plentiful with open ammo boxes scattered all over the maps. The graphics overall are nothing crazy and could be considered lacking a bit in today's modern age and AAA titles but look better than all the old WWII shooters that we've had so far. I will say that the textures tend to bug out sometimes and take a while to load but they are only few. I've experienced more crashes than texture bugs, usually at the later levels of the campaign. With all that said, it's an otherwise pretty good game and I recommend getting it while it's still on sale right now.","June 11, 2014","true","18.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

When I got it I was hoping for a game like the old wolfenstein multiplayer, but instead found that I could not connect to most servers as they often simply timed out due to no dedicated servers available. Those times I did connect to a server the screen either remained black or I had no mouse to select my loadout with. Gameplay itself is extremely mediocre, with the characters moving slowly and feeling rather sluggish while the gunplay itself isn't anything noteworthy. The singleplayer campaign is prone to crashing and being stuck on black screens when loading to a new area, and the AI are pitifully stupid. Overall the game is nothing but a frustration and waste of money, I do not recommend getting it.","June 11, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

In fact this is my second review I have ever written since I played tennis on the Atari. I am very interested games of this genre and have spent many contented hours working my way through a ww2 based game. I was wooed by the the idea of enemy front as it explores theatres of ww2 that have previously been untold. The moral to myself is this. Do not drink and change your mind about an intro. It looks clunky and the physics is awful. I prefered wolfensteins latest flashback bits old skool gameplay  that provided some adrenaline. I wanted this to be good and I feel I have flushed 20 odd quid or $50 or whatever the exchange rate is. Oh and it crashed. alot. If the game had been anything like COD - the-most -recent-WW2-one (but that was ages ago, I'm so **** old and this game is makng me question gaming)  it might have been satisfying. Ho, hum.

The hit/damage system and the effects are also really nice.\n\nThe story starts good, but the enemies' AI is buggy or something like that. That's a big problem, they should work on the enemies' AI and behaviors, because that's what the singleplayer is based on.\nI will write more about the story later becaused I haven't played much yet, I've played played half an hour.\n\nThe multiplayer is missing a lot of things. I think they should devolope that thing further.\nThe server browser doesn't show the server's ping, and thats a problem.\nYou can't join a server by (double)clicking on the servers name.

I personally got this game in the bundle and the way I calculated it out, it came out to be around a dollar for this game, and to me, this game is easily worth that dollar. It is not a AAA game, but it is not an indie game either. It reminds me a lot of Sniper Elite V2, except that you can play as a sniper, or you can use smgs and other assault weapons. However, sometimes when you snipe an enemy, you get a little mini cut-scene that almost looks like the same cut scene from Sniper Elite V2, except it does not show what the bullet actually does to the enemy, it just shows them falling back dead. This is not Splinter cell, but there is a decent stealth option. The bushes sometimes provide cover and sometimes you can be seen through it. I did manage to do an entire mission stealth with no one ever getting alerted. You can tag people, but it sometimes works, and sometimes does not tag them, even if you over over them for a good amount of time.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, I paid around a dollar for this, and I feel I got my money's worth, though I would never buy it full price, or even on sale.","March 26, 2015","true","14.2"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

DX11 runs like crap, DX9 has flickering everywhere for one, but that's not all. The sound assets are a joke really, and in my (PAINFUL) limited time playing, you have no real freedom in the levels like there's "supposed" to be, it's only go out the back instead of front door. Yeah, freedom.\nThe sounds are a joke but that's not all, there are looping sounds too, if you fire the mp40 by trigger tapping, one shot at a time but rapidly still, the sound cuts off and is really quiet too, almost like it's suppressed. It only sounds right when you hold the trigger down. The guns themselves are a joke as well, they handle like crap and aren't fun to use. The animations for them are ok at best, I really like the tactical reload for the Luger too, but noticed the new mag you put in is EMPTY. You don't get an A for effort there, you get an F.\nThe movement is really floaty and not fun at all, jumping is pretty much useless. The AI is atrocious. I was in a building testing the animations for the Kar98, when a soldier walks into the hallway right after I fire, and he turns and walks down the hallway AWAY from me, wondering where I went. I proceeded to follow him while spinning in circles and he still didn't notice me, up until I melee'd him in the back and killed him. Which either didn't have a sound or it was a very weak sound.\n\nWaste of ~30 USD, if Valves refund policies weren't so crappy I might try and get my money back. But read this, and don't waste yours.\n\nEdit 9/18/2014\nI'm going to play this again because I'm a masochist.","June 11, 2014","false","1.5"," 20 of 47 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","20","47","0","5"

CI games has gone for a game based on Sniper Ghost Warrior. The have even reused the bullet cam. They have improved the stealth part since you are all alone in this game. But i got to say that i was struggling during stealth in this game. somethimes the sound isolation does not work and the enemies dont even care about the rocks you throw to lure them away. And it really bothered me that somethimes you couldn't tagg enemies with your binoculars. If they would have made those parts better they would have nailed it. but it was not impossible to complete the mission full stealth. The combat system is good and the enemies are accurate. the story is interesting as you are a reporter covering the forgotten heroes of WW2. The levels is also different as you are i france. Norway, Poland and Germany. A big minus for the story is the ending. Its like they didn't care about the game anymore, they just wanted to finish it. No dialouges, it was like an awkward silence.

The Welrod was a very welcome find, and the mounted heavy mg's were partiularly satisfying to use.\n\nThe enemy AI I found particularly good - crouching behind obstacles looks very effective but you do tend to spot patterns quickly enough. For instance, enemy will reinforce to the same spot which wasn't so great and made picking them off in what would be otherwise heavily out-numbered situations - well, simple.\n\nRambo approaches are not recommended, whilst they have their faults, the enemy AI can be devastating once they knoiw where you are and are in numbers\n\nCrouching in a run produces a really neat skid effect - loads of fun : -)\n\nMaps and general ambience - brilliant.\n\nEvery now and again you will hear enemy soldiers exclaiming 'sheister, sheister, sheister!' - which is excellent. Quite rare, as far as I am aware for a game producer to introduce an element of fear into the AI you need to killl, great for ambience.\n\nAlso, using some form of area trigger , a character (who may not actually be anywhere in the map) exclaims '♥♥♥♥!', which I found also, great for ambience.\n\nI played it through then went back to methodically collect the secrets.\n\nExpensive, maybe, but certainly fun.\n\nSome missions I enjoyed more than others, but there are some real gems, and if WWII is your thing, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\n\nAll-in-All ~ 10/10 for great fun. And despite reviews to the contrary, the only real obstacle to playing it over-and-over again is the lack of enemies you'll need to kill to advance through the levels.","December 27, 2014","true","85.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a great game but has it's flaws which is expected from City Interactive but this time around they made a game that is actually fun to play. I enjoyed it from start to finish(including the extra mission).\nThe gameplay is what you expect from shooter these days which is just fine, works well but when it comes to animations they bothered to add a second reload animation to almost all weapons depending if their empty or not which is a really nice addition to detail. Should also add that the graphics looks really nice with very colorful areas, well made levels with a bit of variation on how to progress through them and very good looking skyboxes.\nThink they did well when it came to music which i did like and fitted in well with the WW2 theme. Voice acting however was a bit mixed, at times it was really really good but with others(germans mainly) it did not sound too good but did not get bothered with it.\nThis is a game worth looking into and is worth the 29,99€ pricetag.","July 19, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It definitely has more depth than some other modern shooters I've played.\n\nIt IS good - but it's not great.\n\nThere are plenty of little, essentially nitpicky things I could say, but what really stands out to me is that the game subverts its own stealth mechanics.\n\nWhat I mean is that the stealth elements are there, and they do basically work, but the metagame doesn't reward them very well. Stealth combat is all about patience, planning, and deliberate action. The problem with "Enemy Front" is that the widely spaced checkpoints tend to dis-incentivize taking the time necessary for stealth to really work. If you make a mistake and suffer a death, you can get handed a really large setback. On the whole, you're much better off taking a middle approach of being overt about combat, but keeping your distance and using cover. You're much less likely to get cornered and killed, and you'll be moving along at a good clip instead of crawling along...only to get killed and then have to make the same, slow, grinding crawl all over again.\n\nThis major issue, combined with some rough edges, drops "Enemy Front" down rather close to my threshold of "Recommended." It's a "Maybe." I appreciate what I can imagine what went into the development, but I can't say that this game is a must-play for anyone and everyone.","November 5, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enemy Front has the sniper ballistics from Sniper Elite, the gunplay from Call of Duty,  and the lense flare from Battlefield 3. Sounds like it could be a reciper for a lot of fun (except for the fricking BF3 lighting glare/lens flare), but it's not. The game is so glitchy and unpolished, it feels like a beta version of most other FPS'.\n\nIs it worth the time?

I could not recommend this at full price.  If you get it on sale and don’t mind linear missions like the original call of duty, then I think it is worth a play through (don’t even consider multiplayer, it’s dead). The graphics are pretty good, I like the slow-motion looking loading screen, which is good, because the game takes a long time to load.  Check points are poorly done, and some missions, you have to figure out what they want you to do or you will lose a few times.\n\nExample, one mission, you are tasked with defending a point.  Germans will send waves of infantry, halftracks, and a couple of tanks.  You have limited ammo.  The first time I played, I used my rocket launcher and grenades freely and found that, even though I had killed all the Germans, and defeated all the waves, I could not win because I could not destroy the remaining half-track (even though I could walk around it freely) because I had run out of explosive ammo.\n\nI did like the story line.  Being a part of the Polish resistance in Warsaw was quite effective at bringing the “War is Hell” feeling to the game.  When the Germans shoot civilians, you find you want to take them out with more emotions than most games of this genre.  The radio broadcasts “This is Warsaw calling all free nations” becomes almost haunting by games end.\n\nGet it cheap, play on the hardest level (the rest are too easy), and a few entertaining hours are to be had.\n","January 20","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Took me 9 hours to finish.\n- Lots of rambo style missions where you sneak into an entire German military camp or facility and need to complete the mission just by yourself  such as the missions "with" Dietrich. I personally like missions where you fight within a small squad a lot better such as the Russian campaign of Call of Duty rather than one-man-army style ones.\n\nOverall, the game did give me the WWII FPS experience I was looking for at a reasonable price but is definitely not a COD.\n\n\n","February 9","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it on sale, but only if you have the patience to deal with the buggy, incomplete gameplay.\n\nMan, what a slog to manage to finish the SP campaign on this.  Light sources started glitching out after a crash in one of the last couple of levels, that only went away by changing some of the advanced graphics settings.\nAn infuriating bug is one where you would set an explosive charge and then would be stuck there, unable to move until it exploded.  Not bad if some or most of them weren't FREAKING MANDATORY.  There were also places where you hold F to climb up, and once in awhile, the prompt would not register unless you restarted at the last checkpoint.  On a single playthrough, I got stuck in holes in the terrain, no less than 5 times.  (Stay off the ice inside the water plant...i'm jus' sayin')\nThe stealth aspects are terribly implemented.  There is a gauge that shows your discovery, but it has no directional marker that I can see, so you have no idea who can see you, and they can be really far away.  The binoculars are supposed to mark where the bad guys are, but half the time, they can be in plain view and the mark won't work.  Also, sometimes you can walk right up in front of the guy and he won't see you, and yet there is a guy half way across the map that sees you instantly, even though you are crouched behind something.  Not that staying stealthy matters, you can just go loud and wait for the dummies to come around the corner, one by one, just like lambs to the slaughter.\nThe story is a disjointed mess that has you jumping all over the place, in and out of the Polish front, to occupied France, and even deep into Germany.  The last mission, especially, feels like corners were cut at the last minute and shoved out the door with huge gaps in the story.\nSo, I am loathe to recommend this game, and yet I almost feel compelled to on account of it being one of the only WWII shooters to come out recently.   Seeing as how the next COD is likely going to be a ridiuclous, futuristic, bunch of space nonsense, this at least scratches that WWII shooter itch until they come to their senses.","April 6","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's hard to keep up with the story and you will hardly pay attention to it\nGameplay is fine, it's just another typical WWII FPS, but with some choices of combat (sniping, sabotage, stealth or brute force). I appreciate this cool choice between these choices, but sometimes you get only one choice of combat. And I also encountered some of the dumbest AI solders ever imaginable. Sometimes they would just charge at me like idiots, other times they have problems using cover and in some cases, they can spot you instantly.\nSound effects are good. The weapon sound effects are realistic and so are the explosions. The voice acting is acceptable, and sometimes it made me laugh because of the chessy voice acting for the german solders.\nMultiplayer is a bit disappointing as there are only 3 game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Radio Transmission.

Its worth buying, yes, but only in a steam sale. You got a solid 6 hour campaign, that's too small in my book but that's what we've kind of grown used to in the FPS market. These companies hope that their multiple player will carry their game and focus time on that when in reality adding a coop mode would have been better and adding 3ish more hours. I'm sure they have plenty of really great looking multiple player maps but we'll never see them because these games never garner any kind of multiple player community.\n\nThe levels are all beautifully rendered and the voice acting was really good. The storyline was choppy with jumping around. You start in Poland then flash to France where you meet this potential love interest then you never return to her and then all of a sudden you're back in Poland then Norway and then Poland then in Germany to end in Poland. If that sentence confused you, now imagine the storyline. You wouldn't read a book that every chapter was out of order and you wouldn't watch a (non-indie) movie where the plot jumped around so why did the developers think you'd want to play a game like that? They should have focused in maybe two of the locations Warsaw and France. I'm all for starting in the middle in a story- en medias reas - but it works in the classic literature because they only do it once. This jumping around wasn't needed.\n\nAs far as gameplay all the weapons are too accurate- besides the sniper rifle. That goes for the weapons you shoot as the player and the enemy. Often I would get Germans shooting through concealment to hit me when I couldn't see them and they shouldn't have been able to see me. I remember getting hit by a guy who only had about an inch gap to shoot through. Also, your character is horrible at throwing things. I burned myself to death a few times throwing a molotov out of a doorway only to have it splatter on the doorframe.\n\nLike I said above though, the levels are solid, the game play is fast pace and not dull and I have to say again, the voice acting was very good. it just fell flat because the storyline looked like someone mixed the level orders up.","November 29, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game borrows heavily from classics such as Call of Duty and Medal of Honor, but in-so-doing it fails to grasp what made those games great in the first place. The game does some things right, and then immediately fumbles and drops the ball. The first thing you'll notice is how great the game looks but how absolutely blinding the lighting is. Why is there so much bloom? What's with all the dirt on the screen? Was the game so easy that they had to obscure the enemies in order to make it more challenging? Maybe.\n\nEnemy Front starts out fairly awful, but gets markedly better towards the end. Assaulting a Norwegian fortress in the middle of a snowstorm is a lot of fun. Not to mention fighting off the Nazis from a Warsaw barricade in the middle of the night. These are the high-points of the game, but the lows are very low. If you enjoy poorly spaced checkpoints, getting stuck in terrain, and dying to no fault of your own, then Enemy Front is most definitely for you.\n\nThe gun models are nice and so are the animations; the shooting is loud and satisfying. But the AI? Not so much. You can literally jump up and down, waving your arms about from across the battlefield, and the soldiers won't even notice. Sometimes, a shot will go whistling past their ear and they'll just keep on twiddling their thumbs. Clearly, I had war all wrong. It's such a pleasant ol' time.\n\nWhat about the story? It's alright, but here too you're left scratching your head. What's a journalist doing picking up the gun and fighting for the Resistance? Reporters are supposed to, well... report, not join in on the fighting. Even the game is conscious of this, as an npc outright asks you: “So, where did you learn to fight, newsman?” In Spain, is the answer. Literally. No further explanation given.\n\nThe Warsaw Uprising is the very reason I picked this up. I liked that part of the game, at least. But not the voice acting. It comes off pretty decent for some of the characters, but the rest are cringe-worthy, at best – especially the protagonist. He sounds half asleep most of the time, with no effort or emotion put into any of his lines. That leaves the music, which is pretty good. Occasionally, I felt like I was back playing the original Call of Duty for the first time, but not for long.\n\nI wouldn't recommend Enemy Front to anyone unless they're absolutely starved for a WWII shooter. The V-sync doesn't work, there's no FOV slider, and the AI is nowhere to be found.\n\nTL;DR: Maybe when it's on sale, but not for 30£/$/€. Save yourself the disappointment and buy Wolfenstein: The New Order, instead.","April 25, 2015","false","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've only got 1.2 hours on my play time, i've actually played more as I played a copy on a different account for some time, but not much more. With that said, it's still true I haven't played the game much. I only really play it when i'm in a very specific mood for a WW2 FPS, and that isn't too often. Enemy Front has a cool idea for a setting, the Warsaw uprising and rebellion during Nazi occupation, but it frankly doesn't do much to flesh out this potentially excellent setting. That's about the biggest problem with Enemy Front, nearly all of it's good ideas aren't well excecuted or are just barely good enough to be passable. Missions typically play out with a fairly decent stealth system that is plagued by bad AI and bugs. It also has a good selection of pain-stakingly detailed WW2 weapons, one of the things Enemy Front does really well. You'll sneak around, steathily dispatching Nazis, until things go south. At that point the gunplay comes to the forefront and it's a very mixed bag. So, with that said, here are the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nEnemy front isn't entirely awful. In some regards its terrible, but in some aspects it's quite well done. The stealth focused missions give a nice feeling of freedom, and the guns do feel very good to use when things go south. However, the gunplay is hindered by the poor AI and killing enemies in this game with guns just doesn't feel very satisfying. Enemies just kind of slump over in a rather unexciting way, often bugging out or glitch through scenery. It just doesn't feel right. But this is the pros, not the cons. There's a very good selection of guns and they are very detailed and have good sound effects. Actually, the sound design in general is fairly solid. Besides the voice acting, this game has quality sound. The graphics are by no means spectacular, but they are generally solid. The WW2 setting is recreated well and feels authentic. The level's are fairly well designed from what i've played and are fairly open for exploration and for stealth gameplay. The stealth system works mostly as expected and is rather satisfying at times. If not for the bad AI, this stealth system could possible carry the game, but with all the previously mentioned problems it holds the system back.\n\n- Good stealth system\n- Authentic WW2 weapons and a good selection of them\n- Decent graphical fidelity and decent performance\n- Solid sound design in all regards but the voice acting\n- Solid level design with lots of stealth and exploration\n- Interesting setting\n- Authentic WW2 levels\n\nCons\n\nThe cons list is roughly even with the pros, which is essentially what makes up Enemy Front as a whole. It's a 50/50 experience with about half good and half bad on the whole. The voice acting is pretty bad, not attrocious, but not good enough to carry the weight of this story and setting. The Warsaw uprising makes for a great story, but this game relatively squanders it and doesn't make much use of it. As a result, this game doesn't feel much different than a typical WW2 FPS. The only thing setting it apart is its stealth system, but sadly the terrible AI detracts from the system in a major way. The AI often stands in the open or doesn't properly use cover in most cases. In addition to that, there are numerous glitches, far too many for even a small time release such as this. The combat feels rather unsatisfying as a result of the bad AI, glitches, and just general lack of a visceral feeling to the gunplay. Stealth runs can often be blown by seemingly nothing and other times the AI can be so stupid that it'll ignore you shooting a friend in the head, acting as if nothing has happened. When the stealth system works properly it can be satisfying, but this is pretty uncommon for it to fire on all cylinders.\n\n- Bad voice acting\n- Little mission variety\n- Terrible AI\n- Unsatisfying gunplay\n- Too many glitches and bugs\n- Lackluster, boring story\n\nThe Final Verdict\nEnemy Front is just one big mixed bag. It has serious ups and downs and squanders a lot of it's best aspects. Between the broken AI and glitchy nature of the game, its rare to see the game at it's best, with everything working like it should. When the game actually goes as it should, it can be a pretty solid WW2 shooter. But sadly, that's really the best the game can be is merely solid. Even at it's high points, its nothing more than a decent, mostly generic WW2 FPS. Is it worth buying? At full price, I'd say no, definitely not. At a discounted price? I'd say yeah, but at least half off or more. I think I payed $15 for this game or $10 and frankly I expected better, but I'd say I got what I payed for. If you love WW2 like me, and you've been Jonesing for a return of WW2 shooters, then you just may find something to like in this game. Otherwise, if you're just a lover of shooters or just looking for a fun game, i'd say look elsewhere as this game is only going to really appeal to a specific group of people.\n\nEnemy Front is a good idea for a WW2 shooter, but it's sadly a squandered idea and most of its best mechanics are ruined by other bad or broken mechanics that interfere with the few good systems in this game.\n\n5/10","December 19, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can see that this dev team had some good ideas but things get bogged down by an inconsistent tone, slow movement, odd level design, bugs and plain blandness. It's strange because there is some genuine fun to be had here but the game is just too inconsistent. Sometimes the game is gorgeous, other times it is downright ugly. Other times the gun play seems fun, then it becomes a frustrating bullet hose fest. I got about 3/4's way into the game when all of a sudden i started getting a slow mo bullet cam effect when using the sniper rifle that I had never seen before. While cool it certainly came out of nowhere, things like this seem to crop up all the time. The plot, characters and story can never seem to make up their mind whether they want to be serious (saving private ryan) or serious camp (original COD, those 60's WW2 movies).\n\nLong story short should you buy this game? I would say if you can get it for $5 and have a free evening to play it (it's short) then it might be worth your time. The setting is interesting, if not wholly unique, and there is a speck of a good game in here somewhere. Treat it like a cheap rainy day B Movie and have some fun but otherwise stay away.\n\n5/10","May 14, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Besides some minor glitches and some crashes that people may get. The game is fantastic in my opinion, the artwork of the towns, weapons, and uniforms are spot on and they were not rushed like some other games. The uniforms on enemy soldiers, are highly detail showing every badge, patch, and detail on them. The towns are amazing, the mountains in the distance look so realistic. The gameplay is fine in my opinion, it all works well and is also realistic. The storyline, which is a big factor in this game, is very easy to follow. It is a believing storyline, which also gives you a taste of the resistance fighters of WWII. I have yet to see any other game that covered a storyline of people of the resistice factor of the war. So all in all, I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a realistic, correctly detailed features, and a great WWII FPS.

I personally like missions where you fight within a small squad a lot better such as the Russian campaign of Call of Duty rather than one-man-army style ones.\n\nOverall, the game did give me the WWII FPS experience I was looking for at a reasonable price but is definitely not a COD.\n\n\n","February 9","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it on sale, but only if you have the patience to deal with the buggy, incomplete gameplay.\n\nMan, what a slog to manage to finish the SP campaign on this.  Light sources started glitching out after a crash in one of the last couple of levels, that only went away by changing some of the advanced graphics settings.\nAn infuriating bug is one where you would set an explosive charge and then would be stuck there, unable to move until it exploded.  Not bad if some or most of them weren't FREAKING MANDATORY.  There were also places where you hold F to climb up, and once in awhile, the prompt would not register unless you restarted at the last checkpoint.  On a single playthrough, I got stuck in holes in the terrain, no less than 5 times.  (Stay off the ice inside the water plant...i'm jus' sayin')\nThe stealth aspects are terribly implemented.  There is a gauge that shows your discovery, but it has no directional marker that I can see, so you have no idea who can see you, and they can be really far away.  The binoculars are supposed to mark where the bad guys are, but half the time, they can be in plain view and the mark won't work.  Also, sometimes you can walk right up in front of the guy and he won't see you, and yet there is a guy half way across the map that sees you instantly, even though you are crouched behind something.  Not that staying stealthy matters, you can just go loud and wait for the dummies to come around the corner, one by one, just like lambs to the slaughter.\nThe story is a disjointed mess that has you jumping all over the place, in and out of the Polish front, to occupied France, and even deep into Germany.  The last mission, especially, feels like corners were cut at the last minute and shoved out the door with huge gaps in the story.\nSo, I am loathe to recommend this game, and yet I almost feel compelled to on account of it being one of the only WWII shooters to come out recently.   Seeing as how the next COD is likely going to be a ridiuclous, futuristic, bunch of space nonsense, this at least scratches that WWII shooter itch until they come to their senses.","April 6","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably both ;)","February 29","false","2.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is easy and the story is slightly cheesy, but I  enjoy the immersion in this significant historical time. I am compelled to write my first ever Steam review for this game (and I am playing some awesome games these days!), because it is a shame that it has mixed reviews. I waited 6 months for it to go on sale, before I finally puchased it. I think if you take Enemy Front for what it says it is, and for what most of the positive reviews say it is, you will not be disappointed. The ONLY reason it might be slightly overpriced is because of the short length of the story.\n7.5/10","March 9","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are plenty of WWII tunnel shooters around, but this one revives memories of the first instalments of CoD or MoH series. Playing as a partisan is definitely something new and exciting - sniping and stealth sections add some variety to the genre. Background story isn't very inventive and serves mainly as an excuse to throw protagonist into different locations - which are, by the way, well-designed and challenging. I liked Norway and Poland the most. Graphic is excellent. Occasional glitches don't spoil the fun. I recommend.","December 11, 2015","true","36.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could not recommend this at full price.  If you get it on sale and don’t mind linear missions like the original call of duty, then I think it is worth a play through (don’t even consider multiplayer, it’s dead). The graphics are pretty good, I like the slow-motion looking loading screen, which is good, because the game takes a long time to load.  Check points are poorly done, and some missions, you have to figure out what they want you to do or you will lose a few times.\n\nExample, one mission, you are tasked with defending a point.  Germans will send waves of infantry, halftracks, and a couple of tanks.  You have limited ammo.  The first time I played, I used my rocket launcher and grenades freely and found that, even though I had killed all the Germans, and defeated all the waves, I could not win because I could not destroy the remaining half-track (even though I could walk around it freely) because I had run out of explosive ammo.\n\nI did like the story line.  Being a part of the Polish resistance in Warsaw was quite effective at bringing the “War is Hell” feeling to the game.  When the Germans shoot civilians, you find you want to take them out with more emotions than most games of this genre.  The radio broadcasts “This is Warsaw calling all free nations” becomes almost haunting by games end.\n\nGet it cheap, play on the hardest level (the rest are too easy), and a few entertaining hours are to be had.\n","January 20","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was OK, I guess.\nGraphics were accceptable, although I noticed some glitches while I was playing, like the lights of a truck were turned on and off and there was no one at the steering wheel\nStory is kinda confusing with the action taking place in Poland, then in France, then back to Poland, then in Norway, again in Poland, then somewhere in Germany and finally back to Poland. It's hard to keep up with the story and you will hardly pay attention to it\nGameplay is fine, it's just another typical WWII FPS, but with some choices of combat (sniping, sabotage, stealth or brute force). I appreciate this cool choice between these choices, but sometimes you get only one choice of combat. And I also encountered some of the dumbest AI solders ever imaginable. Sometimes they would just charge at me like idiots, other times they have problems using cover and in some cases, they can spot you instantly.\nSound effects are good. The weapon sound effects are realistic and so are the explosions. The voice acting is acceptable, and sometimes it made me laugh because of the chessy voice acting for the german solders.\nMultiplayer is a bit disappointing as there are only 3 game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Radio Transmission. But you'll mostly spend your time playing with friends in all these modes and it's worth your time.\nConclusion:\nIs it a unique WWII FPS? No\nIs it a bad FPS? Of course not\nShould you buy it?

On the plus side, the graphics are pretty good and sometimes the physics were really impressive, such as the blood spatter.\nThere are collectables, but they do absolutely nothing, there's nothing to unlock. Often times, you finish a level with a good loadout of weapons, only to have them taken away from you in the next level, which happens right after.\nThis game is a total throwback for the MoH games, which I loved so it's hard to say this but I can't recommend this game to anyone except the hardcore WW2 fan.","November 19, 2015","false","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
