Enough said. Buy it now!\n\nIt even has a multiplayer arena with rankings/leaderboards!\n\nThis game has taken me by surprise! I had no idea it was coming out or what it was. 2 minutes after it launched EA, I read the description, bought it on a whim, and I must say, this is insane! Only 8.99? Deal of the century!","June 2","true","41.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melwing/recommended/464470/","melwing","Melwing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melwing/","311 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSurprisingly intense - kind of Puzzle Quest TURBO. Rather than match 3,  you match as many as possible. The top half of the screen is a fully animated action battle that shows the results of your matches and ability uses. Full armor/weapon drops, spell upgrades- this game is really great, actually.\n\nPvP seems sparsely populated, but this is day 1 of early access so that's not a genuine knock at this point. Still, even ranked pvp gives the option (when it doesn't find a human opponent) to fight the 'shadow' of the real player (basically AI that imitates that player's behaviour).\n\nBig thumbs up from me, but I am admittedly a sucker for the genre.","June 2","true","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has enough of it's own original ideas to make it feel fresh and fun to play.","June 2","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Its like puzzle quest in the real time.  The only issue for me is the game need steam always connected to the internet which I can't do all the time. Hope single player campaign can be played offline.","June 4","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For those wanting to see some first impressions, I did a quick gameplay video going in completely blind with a first play and playing a couple of levels.  Video is in full 1440p.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTzcsDA1mvA&","June 3","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It feels in the slow progression and tiny rewards. The gameplay is repetitive and quickly became boring.\n\nRather than grinding through hundreds of identical enemies in BloodGate, I recommend to check out the classic Puzzle Quest.\n","June 2","false","2.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","3"
