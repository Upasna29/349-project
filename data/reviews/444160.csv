"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/444160/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1843 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJX5qNbHU3s\n\n'Bonsai' is a good idea in theory, but it's developer (and publisher) Rooted Concepts has put very little effort into it, not to mention doesn't quite know what the concept of a "bonsai plant" is or what one looks like. This title immediately comes off like the most basic of Unity clicker assets, the kind you see accompanying 'Clicker Heroes' knock-offs on various mobile stores, crossed with 'Viridi' except with a price tag and none of that free title's charm. What's worse is the Steam community voted for this dreck to be on the Steam marketplace.\n\nYes, ninety-nine cents US doesn't seem like much until you start playing what you just bought, or what someone gave you as a gag gift because "You like ♥♥♥♥, make a let's play out of this!" and you'll feel bad if you don't. A small patch of land with a sometimes ribbed-for-her-pleasure ♥♥♥♥♥-looking tree that only grows, leans and throbs when the game is running is all you get. The options are sparse as well, and all you can do to the tree is prune it. After two hours I found my mighty Oak finally bloomed, and upon pruning nipped the tip and had to start from scratch. When I did this, however, I was eventually greeted with magical floating leaves with no branches to prune, as shown in the above video.\n\nThis title's also a surprising resource hog that needs a sturdy computer to run. An i7 is required, but for what exactly? The branches! Yes, whenever they show, there's so many you can choose from to trim and rid yourself of the obvious clip art leaves that seem to grow in at all the wrong angles need strength to go from one highlighted spot to the net. Of course they have an obvious base background color around them, leading me to suspect yet more google images copy and paste tactics like 'The Slaughtering Grounds' was guilty of. The music is also severely out of place and sounds like a cheap knock-off of Train's "Hey, Soul Sister" at time, but done with a ukulele and xylophone instead. It made me want to smoke up and chill at a beach barbecue more than relax and trim my "bonsai" tree. A simple Youtube audio library search and I found a royalty free classical piece that better suits the whole purpose of the game, and didn't cleash with the obvious 'Vivardi' knock-off visuals and core concept, so you can't say finding a similar piece out there on the internet was impossible given the power of Google these days.\n\nFurther more, there's three save spots, and (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) no way to choose which tree to grow. It just happens. Again, nothing grows when the game is running, so you either need a good rig like I do to play something else while it grows (I put another hour into 'Victor Vran', personally), or just walk away for a bit and hope the appendages of the tree don't cause your computer to crash or go up in smoke. Seriously, 'My Name is Mayo' probably could run on an old 486, but this sit-back-and-do-nothing-but-watch-a-digital-tree-grow simulation game, the Steam equivilent of the USB Pet Rock, needs a core-i7 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 card minimum? It all just seems like bad programing to me, really. Perhaps the looped audio made the developer snap before loading it to Steam in the firstplace.\n\n'Bonsai' honestly just looks and feels like bad/lazy programming on every level. There's room to make this a fairly zen experience, or offer elements to make it seem like you're actually nurturing your tree such as weather augmentation controls, laying down mulch or dirt, pulling weeds to make your tiny patch of floating-in-eternal-purgatory land look nice. Hell, even simple customizations like adding a bird house after a certain point would help make it more of an experience, all of which Rooted Concepts completely ignored for what looks like nothing but a quick buck at the expense of the fools who green lit this title, and those looking for a gag gift. Unless you absolutely hate someone or yourself, 'Bonsai' is well worth passing on, especially if you're eyeing this up solely for achievements (they're not worth it, trust me on this).","February 19","false","4.2"," 107 of 124 people (86%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","86","107","124","19","2"

It’s called to root. Therefore to have been f***ed is to have been rooted. After playing Rooted Concepts’ Bonsai for  a short period of time (an entire 82 minutes) that’s exactly how I and my poor computer (which was an upper echelon computer when purchased new back in July) feel. The game is a complete resource hog for absolutely no excusable reason and what is present isn’t much of a game whatsoever. This, my dear readers, makes Bonsai the plant version of the infamous Bad Rats and a game that will be given as a prank gift for years to come.\n\nIt’s as much a game as watching grass growing is a spectator sport. Seriously. In order for your plant to grow you wait extended periods of time – you’re best alt-tabbing out during that time and doing something else – and then when it’s grown enough you can then snip the parts that you don’t want. But it’s the waiting that is annoying and the fact that every time it grows it takes up yet more resources. If your tree grows enough the amount of resources that are consumed becomes ridiculous and will slow your game down to a grinding halt. It’s a very bizarre combination of poor design and programming choices.\n\nIf I were to find two things that are redeeming and positive about the game then the first are the cheap achievements. Start a new game and if you get a type of plant that you haven’t grown before you receive an achievement. The other is that the game does have the potential to be a soothing experience. That is if you have China’s supercomputer to run the program on due to the game being a resource hog.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot recommend Bonsai to anyone due to the problems with the programming. It’s just a poorly programmed and designed game that shouldn’t have been released in its current state. Had the title been released in the Early Access programs the issues may have been overlooked because it is clear that they need a lot of work and that’s what that program in part signifies. However, it’s not and I can’t see the problems with the coding or the design choices changing nearly as much as is necessary for the game to reach recommended status.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group and Curation please join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 28","false","19.5"," 58 of 71 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","58","71","16","5"

Like Viridi it's also a longtime investing idle game with not many options. But what does it have to do with bonsai? AFAIK no Bonsai master has ever used a chainsaw to prune armthick branches. This unrealistic game works like growing your tree to the max with intense watering and then prune endlessy regrowing branches. After 100 GCs the stem and branches got thicker than you can cut off with any scissors. So to speak a logical disappointment. Though the fractal branch generation and the typical tree characteristics look quite neat you wonder why this game is not educating you more about the Japanese philosophy. What about perfection through reduction? Cutting down growlings and leaves to force a tree into a bonsai shape. It could be more fascinating to generate miniature trees than normal trees. And to cutoff 6k branches as a master goal wouldn't be neccessary anymore. Pity what a missed chance ...","May 10","false","9.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ariandel/recommended/444160/","ariandel","Ariandel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ariandel/","683 products in account","Apparently I'm in the minority by saying that I honestly enjoyed this game. Bonsai, contrary to what many people think, is the Japanese art form of cultivating and pruning miniature trees grown within small containers; it is NOT a specific type of tree. And this game is exactly that.\n\nYou start out with a tiny sapling on a square of grass, and either a day or night sky background depending on the time you play. You can water your sapling to speed up its growth and it will steadily grow into one of five types of tree: each with its own species appropriate bark, leaf shapes, and leaf colour. As it grows branches and twigs, you use the scissors to trim it into whatever shapes you wish. Trimming and shaping the tree's growth is supposed to be calming and contemplative. I found it to be rather relaxing.\n\nHaving said all of this, there are certain things this game could improve upon:\nThe soundtrackIs unfortunately out of place. With a game focused on relaxation, I was expecting its music to be more reiki. It instead seemed to fit more for a childish platformer. Turn it off to enjoy.\nThe leaves\nCurrently you can only trim branches, and the leaves that generate around the branches and twigs have white outlines on some of them. Hopefully in time you'll be able to shape the leaves to your liking, and they'll improve their graphics.\nThe base\nAs it is, the base of the tree is merely a square of grass. An assortment of containers and pots to choose from to fit your tree would be far better.\nThe trees themselves\nMore species, especially those that are more commonly found in the art of Bonsai would definitely improve this game.\n\nIf you just want a simple, relaxing game to play while you think about things, pick this up, turn off the sound, and play some gentle music to trim your tree to. Otherwise, avoid Bonsai: it's not something for those who want a "real game".","April 21","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's boring and tedious.","March 12","false","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Trees don't grow like this. I played for about 15 minutes, my tree grew to have a couple of branches, but it never had any leaves. It just looked like firewood sticking up from the ground. Trees don't grow without foliage!\n\nThe definition of a bonsai is "tree in a pot". This game doesn't have pots. The tree just grows in a rectangular slab with some green on top.\n\nThe game allows for some realistic bonsai development in the sense that you can let the tree grow taller and then chop it down to get low branching. But the branches that appear from the chop point are immediately far too thick, almost the thickness of the stem below the cut point! That's not how it works! You can't build taper into your tree this way. Even the sample trees on the Steam images and videos look very young and slender. Bonsai trees are supposed to look old, massive and weathered.","May 22","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
