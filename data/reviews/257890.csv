(What year is this?)\n\nI can't use hotkeys for spells of the hero when he is in a group with normal units, I have to put the hero in his own group which doesn't really work because the group system is bugged, sometimes I can select groups, sometimes not.\n\nIt's pretty hard to disgintish units in battle because it gets cluttered up and they just randomly swing around.\n\nThe missions I played were so godawfully boring, having to defend from enemy troops which are no threat at all for 15 minutes, couldve gone afk at that point and it wouldn't have made a difference.\n\nAll in all this game feels like it should've come out 2001.","January 5, 2014","false","1.9"," 182 of 203 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","182","203","2","5"

I got my buddy to get a free version of the game also. We thought we are going to have a good time. Oh were we wrong. The journey was a very painfull one and full of sorrows. It started with us having no freaking clue wtf was going on during the tutorial. The so called campaign coop tutorial consisted of putting us on the opposite parts of the map and making us beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of each other.\nThat was fine whatever, eventhough we desynced multiple times. During the second level the desync issue became even worse. We were able to get a couple source nodes before the enemies attacked. Oh the AI pathing was horrendous, I barely managed to get back to my base because AI kept getting stuck inside trees and taking the stupidest routes possible. Well I got home and defended the first wave of the enemies. Then my game crashed to desktop.\nMy friend kept going forward while my hero stood there without any control at all. I was unable to rejoin the game because it said the current lobby had 5/4 people. After another failed attempt to join it said the lobby was at 6/4. I kept saying wtf is going on. When I was finally able to join the lobby my friend has failed the mission because he was unable to control my hero. Yea this was the best and the worst experience I have had with an indie game. We have played a game called Love by Eskil Steenberg and that says a lot. So overall this was a giant waste of time, bandwidth and harddrive space. Save yourself and fly you fools.\n\nMy friend also has this to say. "Your game sucks. (period) All of the default hotkeys are completely wrong. There's a game called dota 2. You should play that for a little bit to see how to make control interfaces and hotkeys.."","August 7, 2014","false","1.0"," 92 of 106 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","92","106","4","0"

Tried a campaign mission, the one where the ice beasts attack. Start fighting them, then boom. Crash to desktop. No 'this program has encountered an error' dialog, no nothing. Alright, so I tried it again. Loaded back into it, played for a bit, and my avatar got taken out. Reload. Playing along, then it crashed to desktop again. And again, no dialog, just no more game. I'll try again if this game receives more updates, but I still can't recommend this. Which is unfortunate, because I want to like the game.\n\nOriginal review follows:\n\nCannot really recommend this game. Graphics are servicable, but sound and music fall flat. Gameplay is slow and boring. Plays like the Warhammer games, in that you get resource nodes, instead of chopping down trees, mining, etc. It worked well in those games, but not here. Just a very slow trudge through the map, trying to get to the victory screen. Unless things change a lot over the course of this game, just stay away.","January 17, 2014","false","1.1"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","34","45","0","3"

Base building is present with modular assets added to the main building forcing one to choose wisely according to situation and playstyle. Selection of character types for main hero but they all have the same generic army so its only the skill package that varies limiting replayability on the campaign.\n\nSkirmish maps allow team/ffa setups and introduce another playable faction. (Always crashed... longest match lasted 30-40minutes before crashing)\n\nIf they can fix the stability issues then this game may be worth investigating properly but It's difficult to gain any real game time when most skirmish / campaign games crash before completion and have to be started from scratch.\n\nedit: 1 year after 1st trying - fresh install of operatring system,new bios,new main drivers, new secondary drivers same old instability. - Game ships with old physx dependencies, 2008 vcredist and directx june2010.","January 12, 2015","false","1.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

Think twice before rating or giving out a comment...\nThis game is not finished! There I said it, this game is not finished and it is classed as a finished game, really!?! Where are the sound effects you forgot to place in, where is the rest of the music you forgot to put in, where is the story campaign you forgot to place in, this game is not finished!\n\nLet's start with the sound effects, the BASIC necessity for a game, and this game only offers a few sound effects, no sound effects from when you cast a spell or attack a creature etc... No sound effects when you complete a checkpoint, nothing, no ambient sound effects, no walking sound effects, nothing, pure silence, very boring\n\nMusic, the music just repeats itself over and over and over, non-stop, the developers probably didn't even have a clue on which type of music they should feature in the game\n\nVoiceovers, the only voice I hear in this game is your main character, who keeps on saying, "I am coming", "For blood and glory", etc... over and over and over again, hardly any of the other characters (in the tutorial) have voiceovers, now I can understand for an RPG game that some voiceovers would not be possible, but for a game that only offers a tutorial where the rest is Co-Op and Multiplayer!?!\n\nStory campaign, no cutscenes, no storyline, no character development, NOTHING, this game has nothing, just a tutorial then after you finish that (which is about 15 minutes), then it throws you back to the Main Menu and your stuck on what you have to do next, there is no story campaign, although in the Main Menu it does say Campaign, which is just you playing the Multiplayer/Co-Op features with just AI, boring\n\nMultiplayer/Co-Op, no one plays this game so I cannot play Multiplayer/Co-Op and I am not bothered to play with AI\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED :(  If you want a good RPG either play Avencast or Enclave (although they are not recommended in my reviews, I still would recommend playing those than this unfinished game)","August 14, 2014","false","0.3"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"

There is no checkpoint system, mind you, so if crash happens you have to do whole mission again. But not only crashes are bringing frustration. Game has clunky interface, gameplay is poorly executed. There is no sound for many actions, engine is really badly optimized so even on machine that can run it on high settings, you will see the things like slowdowns due to grass drawing and what not.\n\nThere is so much bad about it. I did give it fair chance but crashes just demotivated me to keep doing same missions over and over again. And no, crashes are not my fault - game fails to import some assets during gameplay.  To be honest, even if crashes didn't happen, I doubt that I would be happy with overal experience.\n\n","August 22, 2014","false","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

These guys need to either update & fix , do some work on this game or refund everybody for clearing trolling them and ripping them off! I read a developrs comment"we are finished developing this for the year" are you kidding? this game lacks really basic fucntions such as noway to change the graphics settings out of its native setting (wich is terrible btw),rpg elemnets are really boring and very few(minimal lvl/skill tree/gear/upgrades),this game is almost nothing like dow save for exception of point cap,( and even that's terribly done) as prievious posters have stated everytime you click on mini map to move the game will load textures!! What? The? FXXk?? there is no muylti player and even when you do have a willing firend who was unlucky enough to buy this "game" the co-op or multi will not work,both our rigs are fine our connections are fine evey other high end game works nps,but this is just a clunky horrible mess,the artwrok ,design is not soo bad the tehem is really cool the scale of uits verus buildings looks really bad!!!,the fact everythig you build is all stuck in one building and one building only sucks! it is like making a big pizza building and adding spices to the individual slices aka( resource/upgrade buildings) wich are all attched at the centrla hub building i liked it for an hour or so ,and belive i supoort heaps of green lit games and indy stuff and yeha i know how hard it is blah blah,but sorry no excuse it is obvious the ddes who made this clearly love the genre and know what they are into. wich makes me even more mad they scammed so many die hard fans with a ♥♥♥♥ poor game ,terribly shoddy mechanics,a delibertly convulted ,confusing,broken multi player set up why??? its on steam ffs! should be .. click play search friends or forum (of your game rules and is pop) bam play game noneof tis muck about here wait 20 mins ,do this try that .. itsnot bloody hamachi! i mean sure i only paid  20 bucks or whatever.. it is beside the point if i walk in to a store and steal a 20 doallr cd thats still theft and i cna be charged and probaly fined or worse go to jail i will never ever argue or give a person grief for dling torrented games ever again this is the final straw as much as i like to buy my games legit(preferably on sale) i can totally understand why people refuse to bother with a lot of new games legit as developers have this attitude of grab cash run.. if this game updates and is miraculously fixed in the next 2-3 months and i can actually play to give a better review belive i will do so .. until thne avoid this game like the plauge! it is the worst","May 28, 2014","true","0.9"," 44 of 92 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","44","92","0","8"

In fact, I would recommend a boycott of said games based on principle.
