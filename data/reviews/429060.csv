Evidently, this game is a complete clone of his game launched on Steam in July of 2015 called "Island Defense" just different mobs, same maps, tower options, special abilities and all!  What a pathetic way to try and scam a few extra dollars off the same exact game, SMH.  Here's the link to Island Defense:\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/375850/\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nHuge resource hog of your computers CPU and RAM for such a simple game..  Ugh.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7imPl3inNA\n\nNothing special about this game.  This game seems to try and set the absolute minimum expectations for even the most basic of tower defense games, and seems to try and suck any success it might get from the "Plants Vs Zombies" cutey-pie looking zombie graphics.\n\nI know that the price point is low, but as I state in my video review, why buy "Hamburger Flavored chips" or "Hamburger-Flavored Ramen noodles" when what you really want is a real and nice, hot juicy hamburger?\n\nThis game is the "Ramen Noodles" of all the much better, much better looking, and much deeper tower defense games.  My opinion is to save your money and put it towards any of the million and three much better tower defense games already out there.\n\nMy Score is a 46%   (Value: 15 out of 40;  Fun: 8 out of 30;  Controls & Bugs: 18 our of 20;  Graphics and Sound: 5 out of 10)","January 14","false","0.6"," 208 of 229 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","208","229","14","38"

The game is buggy as hell.  It shows things you can't buy as buyable, it let's you bug out and buy several things anyhow, even when you cannot afford them, there is no information on what monsters are in the next wave, some upgrades actually downgrade the towers....I could go on and on.\n\nThis is a very bad game that requires a pretty major patch to make it a good value, even at $2.24.","January 15","false","23.5"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","24","25","2","0"

Sadly my hopes crumbled as it quickly become frustrating, Everything was going -fine- up until you get to the mummies. They completely ruin the game. Please fix them, they are way too strong & too hard to kill. To the point where the game becomes a chore. I've hardly wanted to pick it up to just TRY again. As the game is now, I would say stay away until the mummies are toned down. For a tower defense game, this one is super dull and annoying.","February 15","false","10.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Specifically the mummies.\n\nYou can upgrade towers but to use the upgrades - you have to spend lots of coin that due to the high cost of upgrades and low money from killing zombies  is very difficult.\n\nThis game almost seems like it was a freemium type on a phone where you get hooked and then get to a point where the only way to get further is to spend money on upgrades just go get further.\n\nIt also should be tested a bit more.  Moving the main character sometimes takes several attempts to move him.\n\nNo video options to configure viewable area - so when you go to use a special ability - the entire screen moves down - (can't see the top) - and if you were going to activate an ability at a target at the top - yuou have to reposition the screen.\n\nThe positive reviews on this game are either from the developers or friends of the developers or those who haven't played this game a bit.","January 17","false","17.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I spent like 15 hours playing this game and I would do it again, and probably will. The game has a simple concept. Don't let the zombies hit your base and kill you. As the game progresses the zombies get progressively harder. Some of them are suceptible to different type of attacks while also being resistant to various other attacks. Very cool concept and very replayable. The ONLY thing I dislike with this game and it's not only with this game, it's with most indie games released these days, is that it has a 3-Star scoring system after every level. Other than that it's a perfect gem. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone willing to spend a couple bucks for a great time!","January 14","true","13.6"," 11 of 71 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","11","71","0","13"

After several months, I was just going through my Steam account just to play a game that I have never tried and at best, a 'meh experience, when I saw this game.  I really wasn't expecting much but just a short timewaster.\n\nWhile it is true that this game was quickly thrown out and hasn't had so much as a new idea, it isn't bad though.  I think the game could have used a playtester or two and a few little things will get on you like how you are defending an iceburg and how you are fighting to get to the army base and not to exit one but the game isn't half bad.\n\nI did beat the game to a 100% achievement base and even knowing how all the levels get pretty monotonous, I would suggest playing this game when you get it in a bundle that you bought for something else though.  I did enjoy the game for an hour or two so I guess I could recommend it.\n\n...it just could have been soooooo much better with a little more love and work put into making it with little things being added or tried like more than just one flyer or a bigger selection of zombies to attack with a more diverse set of towers to use.\n\nBut as I am asked at the bottom...do I recommend this game and with that, I say "Yes, but only if it is in a bundle or on sale".","March 4","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes it doesn't matter if your clicking all over him, the trick is to click slightly below his boots (unless a mine is there).","June 3","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
