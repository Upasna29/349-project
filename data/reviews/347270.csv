"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bstingnl/recommended/347270/","bstingnl","B-sting","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bstingnl/","19 products in account","Knights of the Sky is the original DOS version of the World war I flying simulation game from 1990. While as a retro-gamer you might be thrilled to see this again, be warned that it's EXACTLY the original game stuck in a DOSbox shell. So no changes or extra's. That means you STILL get the configuration screen each time you start the game AND the squadron selection screen that requires you to look up the correct answer in the original manual, which obviously is not provided with this Steam release. Luckily it can be found online (here for instance: http://www.scribd.com/doc/39494458/Knights-of-the-Sky#scribd). If you didn't know that you'd be stuck with just playing the demo version, even though you paid full price for it. You will also need the manual to look up the controls and be reminded of the fact that you CAN actually skip a lot of tedious flying time by pressing alt-A.\n\nWhile the game was brilliant in its time and still fun to play if you look past the outdated graphics, you might want to wait for a steam sale to buy this at a more reasonable price or maybe dig up your old floppies and manual of this game from the attic instead.","February 24","false","0.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","2"

You get a replay of your plane crashing. That's pritty modern for a game this old. After a bit of messing around i found out how the controlls work.\n\nIf you are a flight sim fan you might pick this up during a sale, only 0,97 cent *euro*","October 6, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"
