While he has requested that I not change this review until said fixes go through, I felt it necessary to at least mention that they will be worked on. Stay tuned!\n\nWhen this game released on Early Access, I was intrigued. I've spent many hours playing bit Dungeon on mobile, and I enjoy bit Dungeon II. bit Dungeon+, however, has fallen so miserably short that I am sincerely tempted to request a refund.\n\nFirst and foremost, navigating the menu is a game in and of itself, considering there are no prompts to let you know what does what. Multiple keys appear to function as back and forward, yet there are no guides (only "humorous" comments like "are you a master or a chicken"), so it is not uncommon to find yourself on the wrong difficulty in the wrong mode because you hammer random keys to try to get somewhere. And no, you cannot check key bindings; accessing the control menu immediately forces you to begin rebinding all keys, and will then kick you out of the menu once you have rebound. Speaking of changing settings, there are NO audio or resolution options; by default, the game is set to an unlocked window that may or may not be largely off screen, and volume is so loud it is recommended you start the game on MUTE and adjust your operating system or speaker volume once in.\n\nOnce in game, there are, again, no prompts to let you know what does what. You have to remember what you have bound, or hammer keys until you figure it out. The "tutorial" is laughable, stepping you through rooms telling you to "push the attack button" without enlightening you as to what the attack button might be. Out of the tutorial, things pickk up, but only slightly. Accessing the map/menu, and no, there is no persistent minimap, lets you see your stats and equipment, though even this is rough as stat numbers bleed over text and become jumbled, and checking equipment is on a spring and bound to your movement keys; be careful, as holding right to check your sword may lead you into the next room unprepared since the movement controls are still active.\n\nSave your money on this one. Spend it on a polished dungeon crawler like Sword of the Stars: The Pit or The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. If you still really want this game, wait to see if they continue to patch it (or at least fix the horrible grammar and spelling in the stupid menu messages).\n\nTo those coming back to this review, yes, I deleted my old review as I expected it to change since early access. It has: it's gotten worse. And considering these are now my impressions from the "released" game, the "pre-release" flag no longer applies. This should not have left early access in this state.","March 22","false","0.6"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","40","46","2","0"

Fighting bosses and getting the best loot is your top priority. Oh, and also not dying, that's the most important part.\n\nGameplay: You control your noble knight that tries to save his girlfriend or something like that. Excuses, excuses. You and I know that he just wants to kill all the innocent creatures that live peacefully in the dungeon, then pull all the gold coins and emerald rings out of their bodies, because profit. The whole dungeon idea is kinda inspired by The Binding of Isaac and the likes: You have a bunch of rooms that are connected to each other. By using the doorways you can go into another room. Enemies spawn, you get locked up, you kill them all, you go to the next room.\nThere is also a shop where you can buy various potions and chests with random loot. When you are done with your dungeon floor, you go to a conviently marked boss room, you fight a boss, you die, you get angry, you try again, you succeed, and you do it over and over again. The whole idea is good, but it's not really polished. When I was playing the game, I was working on an autopilot: Kill those guys, get this loot, die at the boss, repeat.\n\nControls: In one word: Unresponsive. Well, at least while playing with a DS3 controller. I had much trouble hitting my enemies, because my character would often face the wrong direction. When you attack, you also stick to the direction you are attacking at for a moment, so you have to get your finger off the trigger, and try to flip your character to face the enemy.\nYou have a shield that you can use to block, but it's so tedious to use that most of the times I let my enemies hit me, rather than playing peek-a-boo for 20 seconds with them. You can also stomp at the ground, it's supposed to stun the enemies for a brief moment, but sometimes they will still move and shoot at you, I don't know if it's a random element, a bug, or maybe something else.\n\nGraphics:They are alright. Enemies are not really creative (skeletons, wizards, Your Friendly Dungeon Inhabitants) but their pixel sprites are nicely done. I also really liked how different parts of equipment change your appearance, so you can transform yourself from a boring knight in shining armor, to a lava demon, or a Grim Reaper (complete with a scythe!)\n\nSound Sound effects are nice, although they get pretty boring after a while. You probably gonna ignore them after some time, because they are not really that interesting. But I liked the music! Enjoyable chiptune, fitting to a dungeon. What I didn't like is that you can't mute it, because no matter how great it is, it would still be nice to listen to some sweet silence without muting my volume in the Windows control panel.\n\nConclusion I'm very sorry, but I can't recommend the game. It has some fun little gimmicks, like stomping on pools of blood lets you leave bloody footprints for a while, and coming back to a cleared room spawns enemies that feast on the poor creatures you have killed just a few moments ago.But it's all just not enough to let me recommend this game.\nIt's fun for a short while, and when you ignore all the control issues and repetition, you could play it for a while longer, but still not longer than a few hours. The game isn't packed with content for the time being, but I can understand that it's in early access, so I guess we'll see if the game evolves into a fun little roguelike, or will it still be like today: An unremarkable game with unresponsive controls and not enough content to keep you amused.","March 3","false","0.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Finally got it to work after another 15 min of trying and 10 min later we were glitched out side a room with only half of the room next to it showing.","March 22","false","0.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/440020/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3726 products in account","bit Dungeon+ is an upgraded version of a Flash game (which is also available on mobile devices) from a few years ago. You may have heard of it or perhaps its sequel, bit Dungeon II, which has been on Steam for a while now. So, how does the first game in the series, armed with a fresh new coat of paint fare?\n\nThe BreakdownClearly, this game is inspired by quite a few popular titles, many of which are also on Steam. Games like The Legend of Zelda, Diablo, The Binding of Isaac, and even perhaps Dark Souls have inspired bit Dungeon. The game plays most closely to Zelda, but elements from the other games I mentioned are definitely present: randomized loot, randomized dungeon layouts, and (somewhat) slow-paced combat along with some giant bosses. bit Dungeon is played from an overhead perspective like most roguelikes out there, but it definitely differs in one major aspect: it feels more like an arcade game than something lengthier that might pop up in Steam's  "Rogue-like" tag section.\n\nA standard playthrough consists of the player progressing through a randomized dungeon, killing enemies, using melee weapons or magic (both are viable), and eventually fighting a boss. After defeating it, you'll progress to the next floor of the dungeon. There's also randomized loot to be found all over the place, along with coins that you can use on shops that are hidden behind certain walls.\n\nThe game is entirely beatable in less than an hour, yet it's challenging enough to keep you coming back for multiple tries before you can finally manage to beat it. Personally, it took me a decent amount of attempts to even manage to beat it on Easy, which I managed to do with ease once I had acquired some nice gear. Speaking of gear, there's a fair amount of variety in gear types, or at least gear stats and appearance. There's 8 different rarities of gear (based on the color of the item), though unfortunately in reality every weapon and piece of armor feels and plays the same as all the rest. They may cosmetically appear to be different, but none of the items really "feel" different from one another - they just look that way.\n\nThe enemies are a bit lacking in variety as well. Sure, they have different designs, but they all generally "feel" the same. They all shoot out a small wave-shaped attack (it's hard to describe) at you, though some of them have ranged attacks while others can only attack you up close. Even if the enemies may all look fairly varied, they all functionally only fit into a few categories: melee, invisible (or rather cloaked) melee and ranged. Sometimes the game randomly spawns giant enemies, which are stronger and thus more challenging, which does admittedly add to the fun. The bosses play similarly to these larger enemies, so they're at least pretty fun even if the generic enemies get a bit repetitive after a while.\n\nProbably my biggest complaint with the game is how unpolished it feels. There's a tutorial, but besides a few helpful tips, like how charging an attack will give you a bit of temporary invulnerability, the game doesn't help you out much. For example, in one situation I was stunned by an enemy while a "PUSH!" message repeatedly popped up above my character. I mashed buttons and moved the joysticks around, but I had no clue how to "PUSH!" so I simply had to restart the game. Another example - items have stats, but some of them are utterly confusing; what's the difference between "armor" and "defend", and what the hell is "proc" or "chop"? The game also doesn't bother to explain what its story is about unless you read the store page, which was a bit amusing to me when I reached the end of the game, only to find my supposed "loved one". It doesn't help that there's a few typos and a decent amount of grammatical errors present as well.\n\nIn terms of bugs or glitches, I really only encountered one, and that involved me moving through a door, only for it to glitch out and leave me in the entranceway. There was some rats in the room that then swarmed around me (without damaging me) and pushed me into a corner. I eventually killed them and moved on, but from there onwards the game only showed the bottom half of each room, which was pretty odd.\n\nDespite all these complaints, however, I still enjoyed my time with bit Dungeon+. Is it worth $5? Well, that depends on your personal taste in games and how fine you would be with all the negative aspects of the game that I mentioned earlier. Personally though, for $1-$3 I think that this game would be pretty decent; with some patches (which the developer has frequently been releasing anyway) I think this game has the potential to be really good. The pixel art is lovely, and the enemy designs are pretty creative. The bosses are quite fun to battle, and the game can get fairly difficult at times. I personally died a lot even on easy mode. And hey - the game has co-op support too!\n\nProsFun, challenging roguelike gameplay with an arcade feel to it (randomized loot, dungeons, and only 1 life to beat the game!)\nLocal co-op support (I didn't test it so I can't vouch for its quality)\nController support\nSuperb pixel art and enemy/boss designs\n3 difficulty settings: Easy, Normal, and Hell (along with an extra timed mode)\nCharacter customization to an extent (place items you've found on previous runs on your characters, though they are purely cosmetic)\nMultiple endings\nSteam achievements\nConsPretty short for a complete run - takes about an hour or less.\nWeapons function in the same way; no variety whatsoever there.\nEnemies are also pretty limited in terms of functional variety (they're either melee, cloaked melee, or use ranged attacks).\nThe game is extremely lacking in regards to informing the player about a lot of things, whether related to game mechanics or the story itself.\nSome typos, grammatical errors, and glitches are present.\nThe music is generally forgettable and gets pretty repetitive after a while.\nThe options menu lacks resolution options or volume sliders, though it does have support for rebindable keys and different languages.\nConclusionAll in all, bit Dungeon+ is somewhat of an unpolished gem. It's covered in dirt and soot, but underneath all that grime is a great game. Sure, it has problems, but the base game is still quite fun, and for that I believe it deserves a recommendation.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: 6/10","April 24","true","4.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

You can do normal stuff with almost no problems, however there are some flawed bugs inside the game.\n\n1) Stamina doesn't recover unless you drink a potion for that. Same goes for Health\n2) The colliders are all over the place, you can enter another dungeon through a wall.\n3) The loot drops are buggy, you can only open them if you "hit" them from the front side. and if you find a loot crate that's for example "Mythical grade" and you have a "Normal grade" in your inventory, you will equip the Mythical one but still the loot crate will show that it's a Mythical grade crate.\nand much more....\n\nAnyhow, This game has Multiplayer (Local couch Co-op to be exact). It's relatively fun to play it with a friend. However, you can revive your friend as many times as you want. The person who got the key to unlock the next dungeon is the only person that can open the gate and pass through it. Even after the gate's been opened and the user wishes to return through that specific gate, Only the person who has used the key can pass through.\n\nAll in all, The game's not recommended right now but maybe after an update or two, it will be a good and addictive game.\n\nEDIT #1: The shop system seems to have been fixed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WildSeraph/recommended/440020/","WildSeraph","Scaffolding-chan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WildSeraph/","350 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPARAGRAPH WARNING. Yes, I have a lot to say.\n\nI recommend ONLY if you want to see an unplayable game turn into something (potentially) cool.\nDecent idea, but right now awful execution.\nIf you purchase this game right now and expect fun, you're in for a bad time. Details below.\n\nI'll just say right now that, while the makers of the game aren't primarily English-speakers, it looks pretty bad to have so many spelling and grammatical errors. Get those fixed.\n\nIt's a very simple hack-and-slash thing, playing similarly to Binding of Isaac and the original Zelda.\nGo through randomized dungeons and hit monsters in each room until they die. Stat-giving equipment is all over the place.\n\n==BASIC GAMEPLAY & INTERFACE==\nYou're a knight with a basic melee weapon and a shield. That's currently the only starting class. You have avatar sets, but they are entirely cosmetic; that greatsword is gonna swing identically to that scythe.\n\nYou have an attack button, a magic button, and a block button (Default A S and D). That last one is important, because timing to block enemy attacks will keep you from otherwise requiring trades. A single hit can just chip at your health, but you are in rooms with three to like twenty enemies at once, and they're all attacking on their own patterns, so if you never touch that shield you're going to be dead in three rooms.\n\nKiting around and blocking effectively is key to getting hits in without taking damage. It's definitely trying to feel like a top-down Souls game -- a concept that is entirely responsible for keeping me around.\n\nUnnfortunately, having three buttons doesn't mean the game is immediately accessible. Thanks to an almost complete lack of interface or instructions, I didn't even understand that I had a block button. The launch options window says 'Fire 1' 'Fire 2' and 'Fire 3'. Ignore these completely, because there's an in-game options menu for that. It says 'Controllers' but it really means 'Controls'.\n\nThey don't even have a setting to rebind Up Down Left and Right, opting to have default-blank 'Vertical' and 'Horizontal' axes. Just ignore those input settings.\n\nOh, don't set anything to Z, either, because that's the debug mode key for spawning a random chest, it seems.\n\nYes, this executable is for DEBUGGING.\n\n==GAME FEEL & CONTROL BUGS==\nThe controls are meant to be a little bit clunky and require thought to timing, but the stiffness leads to exasperation more than anything. You will often find yourself stuck swinging in the wrong direction despite holding down another direction's key. If you're close enough to an enemy, you might not even be able to turn, because it seems as though turning is stopped any time movement is halted. This doesn't happen on walls because they are pushing you back instead of restricting movement entirely.\n\nThere is a completely unnecessarry delay to most actions. It's caused me to wonder if my keyboard was broken multiple times. There's a small delay before blocking, but no visual indicator that you need to take time to put up the shield. In many cases, it looks like damage went right through your shield.\n\n==SOUND==\nThe music and effects themselves are mostly passable. The same dungeon tracks over and over can get pretty annoying, but whatever. Unfortunately, you can't set just the music to 0 and play your own stuff while keeping the sound, because there are no audio options anywhere. The game starts blaring at max and you're forced to change it with the volume slider.\n\n\n\nThis debug version is nigh-unplayable, making you deal with gameplay bugs and expecting you to know what you're doing. Like I said, if this becomes even a half-playable top-down Soulsish game, I'll be happy I got it.","March 3","true","0.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

But if you do use the controller you will enjoy it. Its a great little fun game and its being worked on by an awesome dev. Its COOP and its pretty flipping cool. I'll recommend it because I assume the dev will work on it, if he doesn't DONT LISTEN!","March 3","true","1.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","3","7","3","1"

I honestly don't like it as much as the first gamethough. it doesn't let you roam around a large area, insted your left in a dungeon that takes forever to get through. They also need to up the boss difficult, I could beat the first level boss in three hits, and one time it was the first room next to me so i fought and one with base stats and items. The normal rooms are more of a threat. Its still a good game though, especially if they up the difficulty for bosses.","March 4","true","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

So far, even with what little play time i have had, i have had a blast hacking at enemies and running through the dungeon floors. Although this game is far from being great, i think that it will get there, considering these creators previous works, such as bit Dungeon II.","March 8","true","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It's quick and had a lot of fun killing enemies and exploring rooms.\n\nThis retro-feeling is very good, once I left the game on for the music while I was doing some other things.\nGraphics, as you can see, look very original and animations are ideal with the flow of the game.\n\nThere are a bunch of different enemies, each one with its own behavior and make the game more interesting and not boring.\n\nAlthough it's in Early Access, I didn't find any big drawback, but developers are very kind and receptive on feedback. So it's a very big plus :D","March 14","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hasta el dia de hoy, tenia novia, hijos, familia, y un perro. Lo he dejado todo, y nunca he estado antes tan orgulloso de una decision. Esto es el paradiso, el mejor juego de la historia, del planeta, del universo, el messi de los videojuegos. Si lo llego ha saber antes, hubiese ido a por un mando y una cuenta de Steam nada mas salir de las trompas de falopio de mi madre, para asi descargarme el juego y jugarlo hasta morir. Que graficos, que jugabilidad, que personajes, que trama tan esplendida. Jugar a este juego es como hacer el amor con shakira, pilar rubio y maria patiño juntas. Un ♥♥♥♥♥♥o de dimensiones incalculables. Ahora si me disculpais, voy a hacerle el amor a esta obra de arte hasta el  final de mis dias. Gracias mundo por ser tan maravilloso, gracias mundo por tener cosas tan bellas como esta. No hay palabras que describan esta increible bendicion de dios.
