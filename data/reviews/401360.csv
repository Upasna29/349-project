At some point in the past we sought a future amongst the stars and that, presumably, did not work out... so you've returned to an Earth reclaimed by the sea to discover, adventure, and generally faff about in your little submersible until you die from toxic fart buildup.\n\nIt won't be long into your faffing before you learn that, in the absence of hungry, hungry humans, some underwater creatures have grown to enormous, Captain's Platter™ proportions – with tempers to match. Fortunately, because this is a Metroidvania-y kind of title, you'll also find various upgrades with which to kill all the  giant oceanic critters that give you trouble. You'll pick most of these upgrades up, ironically enough, after killing one of the dozen-or-so bosses – though there are more passive upgrades (improved hull, speed, etc.) to find while exploring. Besides helping you better kill enemies, in true Metroidvania fashion some upgrades will help open the world up to explore.\n\nThe boss fights are great, generally. There were one or two I could have done without but they were for the most part fun. Every enemy has their own range of attacks and patterns and you'll seldom “nail it” on the first encounter. With each kill you'll fill out a bestiary for the respective boss to learn a little bit about it, and when you complete the main game there's a boss rush mode and a hardcore mode.\n\nWhile there are a few hazards here and there (and boss battles, of course), this is a very laid back, lonely, peaceful kind of title – very akin to Shadow of the Colossus... not because of the titanic boss battles per se, but because of the soft ambaince, the wandering, and the unavoidable feeling of being an incredible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for murdering unsuspecting giants. The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human has a world I got lost in for hours. The backgrounds are some of the most beautiful and haunting I've seen in this pixel art style – and the music definitely does its part.\n\nThat's not to say this one is perfect! There are hologram messages in every hub with bits of exposition and... at its BEST it was uninteresting, at its worst it was preachy. “The forest offered us plentiful bounty, and we wiped our asses with it.” Well what did you want me to do devs, use a bidet like some kind of European or something?  Also, the dinosaurs didn't live for 65 millions years, they died 65 million years ago... they actually lasted closer to 200 million years! Just a minor nitpick. Oh, and there's no map function, really. You have a mini map you can refer to while traveling but it's just for the immediate area you're in. There are save points in each section that have a world map you can refer to but I found myself backtracking and getting lost to the point of frustration near the very end.\n\nI still really enjoyed this one in spite of those minor quibbles. It's peaceful and pretty, like a walking sim but with boss fights sprinkled in to keep it interesting. Every environment is unique and lovingly crafted, every boss fight is singular and special (and the names for each one... excellent), the music accents the loneliness perfectly – it's a great little experience overall, and a wonderful way to start off your 2016 Gaming Year.\n\nPlus. it's just better down where it's wetter – take it from me.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ChjVcijZOM","January 19","true","6.1"," 87 of 109 people (80%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","80","87","109","37","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/401360/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","From the haunting melodies by Karl Flodin, to the wonderous seascapes of post-apocalyptic Earth, The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human is an audiovisual treat. I'm not much of an art-critic, but to me, this is a game that feels...significant. I'm overcome with this feeling of inspiration. At any moment, I could sit down at my desk, turn on the PC, and write something really powerful. Anyone who read it would also become inspired, and the cycle would continue until the entire world became just a little bit grander.\n\nWell, maybe I'll do that tomorrow. For now, let's focus on the game itself. Some of the first videogames I ever reviewed originated in the arcades, so I tend to pay more attention to basic qualities like controls and design. My approach to reviewing this game is to strip away all of the extraneous elements. The visuals are lovely, and the soundtrack is excellent, but right now I'm tuning all of that out. All I see are lines, dots, and rectangles. If I open my ears enough, I'm sure I'll hear some bleeps and bloops. With this scenario in mind, do I still consider The Aquatic* a good game? Yes!\n\nAside from light exploration elements, this is a game that revolves entirely around boss-fights. As a Darius fan, I've always been a sucker for oceanic-themed adversaries. While that series operates under the basic trappings of a 2D shooter, The Aquatic goes in another direction. Each of the 12 bosses are approached differently. Aside from each boss having a unique look, they also have their own patterns, weaknesses, attacks, and environment. Not only do you have to pay attention to the projectiles the boss might fire, but also your immediate area, and the following action the boss is liable to take.\n\nThis is not a game to approach lightly. You're going to die, possibly a large number of times. In my view, all of these deaths will be fair. The sub, even at its default speed, is fast enough to avoid every attack, it's just a matter of understanding movement. Yes, it will seem slow at first, but there will be cases where you can avoid attacks entirely with a little fore-thought. The first boss (a giant worm) has an attack where it spits several smaller worms at the player. The player can attempt to hang back and dodge every single worm, or they can work their way around the giant one. By doing this, the player avoids the entire attack, and gets a nice opportunity to do a lot of damage to the boss. Unless you're after a specific achievement, the sub can also take quite a bit of damage through the acquisition of hull and auto-repair upgrades.\n\nThe most important weapon you'll have for the boss-fights is your harpoon. In order to get the most out of this tool, you have to grasp the basics of risk vs reward. The harpoon can be charged to hit distant targets, or the button can be mashed repeatedly if an enemy is close. Naturally, the closer you get to the boss, the more dangerous they become, but they can be destroyed more quickly. As you develop strategies to defeat these bosses quickly, you'll discover the real depth found in this game. It's almost entirely boss-fights, but it does them justice.\n\nSince the game delivers in terms of the more important qualities, I feel more comfortable talking about its artistic side. Videogames that take place in or around large bodies of water have always intrigued me. When most other games have the obligatory water stage, I can't stand them. I think it's because nobody really appreciates the ocean, they just want to have some harebrained swimming mechanics, in order to pad things out. Videogames that embrace the ocean and the life that inhabits it, such as the Ecco the Dolphin series, are just incredible. The Aquatic really captures those immersive moments, where you're blown away by all that's happening around you. The world's surface (and humanity) is long dead, but the seas are as lively as ever. The minor visual details like the remnants of human architecture and various types of marine life bring everything together.\n\nThe soundtrack can not be praised enough. This is a short game, so it's welcome to have a unique track for every part of it. I've always said that good music can elevate any game, and this is as appropriate an example as any. The boss themes in particular are superb. You're the last human in existence, fighting off an abomination, for reasons you can't quite grasp. The music in these tense and disturbing situations really preys upon the game's sense of hopelessness.\n\nWhile The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human isn't lacking in quality art and sound, it also holds up well purely as a videogame. There is some entertainment in poking around a small yet visually dense world for upgrades and other secrets. However, most of the fun and challenge is in learning, defeating, and then mastering the myriad of bosses. Overall, this is a unique experience that's definitely worth checking out.\n\n*Sorry, but I can not write out that title every time.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 5","true","4.4"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","38","41","4","6"

Anytime someone asks me about this game, I liken it to Megaman, but underwater. The boss fights feel very similar, the upgrades feel similar, and some of the boss strategies feel exactly like something I'd expect playing a Megaman game. Now, that's not to sell the game short and say that it's a rehash of an old formula or anything like that, the game does a very good job of making its own space in the action/adventure genre, but the similarities scratch that nostalgia itch in just the right way.\n\nBe forewarned that some of the boss fights can be outright rage inducing, but they are challenging in a very fair way. There isn't a fight in the game that I'd consider overly influenced by luck or requires this upgrade or that upgrade, in fact there's an achievement for beating the game with no upgrades at all which adds yet another layer of challenge to a game that already has a fair bit of replayability.\n\nTL;DR: If you like challenging boss fights, environment-driven narrative and beautiful pixel art with a great and ominous soundtrack, you've come to the right place.\n\nIf you'd like to watch some gameplay, check out my Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human playlist.","February 1","true","2.2"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ruds/recommended/401360/","ruds","Ruds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ruds/","117 products in account","Several of the helpful positive reviews used the word Metroidvania to describe this game, and that set a certain expectation. I was very quickly disappointed, as the gameplay is basically "exploring" empty cooridors with the occassional environmental hazard or upgrade until you reach the next boss. What these reviewers meant by "Metroidvania" was true in only the barest sense: get new weaponry -> use to open path to next boss.\n\nWell, nevermind my expectations, this isn't the game I thought it was. However, it's quite a good game for what it is: a challenging Boss Rush Mode similar to the structure of Shadow of the Colossus. In that regard, it's a pretty great game.\n\nPros\n+ great pixel art\n+ great music and sound\n+ great boss design\n+ fun setting and style\n\nCons\n- boss fights devolve into bullet hell towards the end (I suppose they're very well done, if you like bullet hell)\n- "exploration" that feels more like "aimless wandering" due to a lack of threats, direction, and frame of reference\n- has some frustrating one-hit-kills that blend into the background or come from nowhere","February 4","true","6.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

A few times I ran into hazards only cause they blended into the background so much, the slight flash isn't enough to decern the BOMBS THAT ONE HIT KILL YOU sometimes.\n\nWhen you aren't lost or slowly moving to where you need to go, you're fighting a boss of some sort.\nI regret to tell you that none of these are really interesting and a few are just frustrating. You'll never do much more then move slowly and shoot slowly, a good deal of the bosses are easy to figure out but have a lot of health to knock out with a very slow rate of fire, but a few bosses have this mantra of just being hard rather then interesting.\n\nFew spoilers here, but the Chain Gang boss is literally a big shark with a million little sharks alongside it, which was frustrating because not only would they occassionally bump me into one another and kill me instantly, the sharks also blend in with the background too much to see them coming most of the time. The Heart of the City boss is annoyingly filled with projectiles, some of which are way too small to see learly to dodge properly.\n\nI'm really not feeling this game here, it's so frustratingly slow and frustratingly difficult. I assumed it would be a calming ride under the ocean, but when the game remembers it needs gameplay it pulls from a twinstick shooter with bosses that want you to bob and weave between their attacks which is impossible in the slow little sub you pilot.\n\nIt's pretty on the surface, but empty under all of that.\n\nTo sum it up:\nThe chainsaw in this game is useless.","February 9","false","4.7"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","32","46","0","0"

It's short, but sweet. My first run through took me a bit over 4 hours, with some getting lost but not finding every upgrade.\n\nThe Metroidvania style exploring is fun, although a better map would be nice. Toward the end of the game you get an upgrade which lets you see more details on your mini-map, but it would have been nice to have something like that from the start. Or at least let it apply once you've explored each area of the map.\n\nFor the most part, the boss battles hit a perfect level of challenge for me. A couple of them were pretty easy, but most of them required a number of tries, sometimes dying very quickly, but generally learning a bit more about their patterns each time. Some of them have definitely got some bullet hell going on, so hopefully you're into that kind of thing.\n\nI found the music generally pretty suitable. The pixel art on some of the non-hostile fish was a bit blurry, but everything else looked quite good. I think a good job was done on the sound design, too. Especially the squelching noises.\n\nIf you're easily frustrated this might not be for you, but if you're up to throwing yourself into a grinder to get a little bit better at a fight each time, there's fun to be had here. Just try not to curse too much when you get trapped between an enemy and a wall and torn apart in a second.","January 20","true","5.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The beautifully crafted pixel art environments are very impressive, and the atmosphere of a hopeless, long-ruined civilization behind a lively undersea environment is well realized. All in all, it's avery nice-looking piece of work.\n\nSo, what about the gameplay? AALH is probably best defined as having metroidvania-style game progression. You must pilot your submarine throughout the game world, exploring the map until you find bosses to fight and upgrades that allow you to explore further. The gameplay serves its purpose adequately, but it's not without several caveats.\n1: You move EXTREMELY slowly. It's ignorable at first, when you are admiring the scenery of a new area, but as nice as the environments look, once you've seen them, you've seen them. It quickly becomes very tedious to slowly drift through already-explored maps looking for missed upgrades or paths. Granted, there are a few fast-travel stations(although they're few and far between), and there's an engine upgrade that helps a little, but not enough.\n2: Once you realize how slow you're moving, you'll notice that the game map in its entirety is actually pretty small. The slow movement speed and the occasional one-way path make it seem like the game is much larger than it is, and it's a disappointing realization to come to.\n3: It's up to the individual to decide if this is a pro or a con, but aside from a couple areas with mines and several stationary projectile shooters, there really aren't any enemies except the bosses. This means that you don't have anything to do while you trek from area to area other than look at the scenery again or take pot shots at the occasional nonagressive fish.\n4: Your weapons and tools seem pretty weak for the entire game, and the optional upgrade crates you can find don't seem to help much. However, keeping in mind that basically the only things you fight are bosses, there really isn't a good metric for judging this.\n\nThere's not really any story present in the game, either. The opening cutscene shows your ship leaving earth in the near future and promptly landing in a wormhole, then being spit back out an indeterminate yet incredibly vast number of years in the future. Your ship crashes back to earth to find it covered by ice and water; all humans, and their civilization, appear to have long since died. This is all that is given to you in terms of your own story. As of this writing, I have not yet finished the game, but I can't see it ending positively.\nThere are 'holotapes' sprinkled around the world map. Ideally, they should give some sort of backstory about the end of humanity. However, they never have more than a single dialog box worth of text in them, and there's definitely not enough information to cobble together any sort of cohesive narrative. They're mostly filled with a bunch of vague political and environmental alarmism, which, while applicable in a game about post-humanity, seemed heavy-handed and unnecessary to me.\n\nThe quibbles I've listed above might sound a little harsh, but they didn't stop me from sinking(har) a couple hours into this game, and I suppose they might even contribute to the game's overall aesthetic. If you enjoy atmospheric experiences, I can definitely recommend this at its current price. If you're not so hot on atmosphere and just want to play a game, well... it's still pretty fun, so you could pick it up on sale and give it a shot.","February 7","true","4.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

There's been a few bugs, ie: when I had the first boss down to minimal health it just sat there and let me kill it, but nothing game-breaking. The biggest annoyance I've found is that the game slows down considerably when it pans in/out (which happens a lot) and when there's a lot of stuff moving on the screen (which again, happens a lot because: fish).  This has made the second boss I encountered a real pain as there is a mix of fast and slow moving attacks..which both seem slow until suddenly the game picks back up.  And the slow-down is really the only downside I've encountered thus far; I'd certainly reccommend giving it a shot.","February 10","true","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the new Indie Pixel-Art Adventure, The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human. The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human was released onto Steam by Developer/Publisher YCJY on January 19, 2016.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pnR0x02c3jk\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nPretty, Mellow & Fun. Good Boss Battles. 4/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nIf you like a game that's essentially explorable art, with some good boss battles thrown in, then this may be the perfect game for you! The majority of this game is simply spent exploring the story slowly through the art (and little messages spread about). There is enough to keep you engaged (toxic spillage to avoid, etc) but nothing too stressing. Just an enjoyable ride through some great pixel-art and mellow sounds. Occasionally, you'l stumble your way into some very interesting boss battles. These will get intense, quickly. At one point, I am pretty sure a seahorse was spewing forth his, um, seed as an attack. Two of them were, actually. So, it's definitely got the "Interesting Boss Battle" category covered. All in all, it's a pretty solid game at it's price point ($10). The art alone may be worth that, especially if you like Pixel-Art. This is Pixel-Art done right. If you seek more action from your metroidvania-types, then this may not be to your liking. The action sequences are essentially confined to the boss battles. However, if you're all for some exploration and relaxation between bouts of action, this is perfect for you. 4/5 and worth $10 for sure.\n\nHappy Gaming!\n","January 20","true","3.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Forever keeping you relaxed while you enjoy the ocean view, or making your heart race during a boss battle.\n\nThe controls are nicely intact and smooth, while a simple yet perfect UI makes the pixelated game feel more at home.\n\nCombat is merely perfected to the degree on how well you can aim, time your shots, and get to a specific position of safety. All of which, will be a struggle at every new boss you encounter. And It gets worse, but it rewards even better!\n\nThe story, though a mystery, keeps you searching for more clues about our previous existence. And though personally I have yet to finish the game, nor do I want to spoil what I already know, the story driven adventure will show you how real global events can be no different than what you discover throughout this game (realistically).\n\nThe price of the game, is perfect, and if you're looking for a challenging metroid game, I insist that you take advantage of this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/recommended/401360/","GameReviewsAU","GRAU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/","44 products in account","It’s been a long time since a game frustrated me to the point that I asked myself, “How bad would it really be if I broke my keyboard?”. Don’t get the wrong idea though. Frustration from a game isn’t necessarily a bad thing! When a game pushes you to the point that you consider breaking something, yet still find the desire to keep playing, the developers have obviously done something right! Our The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human review will go on to describe why it will annoy you and also why it will keep you coming back to it no matter what.\n\nThe Story\nThe Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human tells a story that is all too possible. The year is 2971 and a frozen Earth’s resources begin to run low. Humanity sends out a sub-aquatic spaceship to a nearby wormhole in search of habitable planets. However, things don’t go as planned and the Argo9 returns thousands of years later in time to an Earth where humans are long extinct.\n\nYour task is to find out if the ruination of our species is a travesty or something that just couldn’t be prevented.\n\nAs you dive throughout the seemingly endless labyrinth of underwater areas, you will find clues as to how humans happened to become extinct via recordings scattered throughout the ocean.\n\nControl\nThe Argo9 is controlled via the ‘WASD’ keys and as you progress to unlock weaponry and other such aids, you will use the mouse to aim and fire.\n\nWhat could possibly be left on the planet if it’s frozen over and humanity is extinct I hear you ask? Plenty… Aquatic life seems to have survived perfectly and you’ll come across all sorts of fish, crustaceans and other such life.\n\nThe Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human plays very much like Super Metroid whereby certain areas of the levels are unreachable until you find the required upgrade for the Argo9 to get through. For example, one of the first upgrades comes in the form of a saw that attaches to the front of your ship and is used to cut through vines in your way.\n\nScattered throughout each area are travel stations that also act as save points. These travel stations, when discovered, allow you to quickly traverse to a different section of the playable ocean. To begin with, I didn’t think it was necessary because I loved driving through each area and absorbing the thought-provoking music. However, when I arrived at points of the game that left me yelling at the computer screen, “Where??? What do you want me to do now???”, the travel stations became my friend.\n\nBe warned that this game will require a lot of to-ing and fro-ing. That might turn some people off, but in my opinion, it can oft become quite exciting when you finally realise where it was you were meant to go. Sometimes you’ll arrive at areas that warn you to have a lamp equipped on your ship, but really, everywhere is accessible and if you feel like doing it in the dark, then go nuts!\n\nBosses\nWelcome to the point where you’ll frequently die… or have the game crash on you. The first boss to come at you will have you thinking, “Am I really supposed to be able to beat this guy?”. Fortunately (but also unfortunately) every boss is killable when you reach them. Some prove to be much harder than others and some will present you with many different types of game crashes… ahem… the shark boss.\n\nJust going to go on a small rant here about the shark boss. It would have to be one of the more tricky bosses in the entire game, mainly due to it’s extreme difficulty, but also because of certain events in the boss fight triggering multiple types of game crashes. I think I would have spent about two to three hours attempting to beat Mr. Shark and then when I finally got to the point where the shark would die in one more hit, the game crashed.\n\nWhen you spend so much time on one boss only to have the game crash on you, it’s a bit of a kick to the genitalia. One boss in particular, a stingray with lasers also became quite troublesome because the game would crash as soon as the small cut-scene before the fight ended. Perseverance was the winner of that fight.\n\nAll that said, each boss fight is incredibly tough and sometimes they’ll make you wish there was a difficulty setting. However, working out the patterns of each boss and the tricks involved in killing them is all part of the fun. The bosses are all really well thought out and defeating some of them will bring the topic of the game to the front of your mind. Why do humans have to kill everything?\n\nThere’s one particular boss that will make you feel downright rotten as you watch it grow physically weaker before your eyes. Once it’s dead you’ll feel even worse as you find it’s babies scattered around the area it once protected. Bits like this are where The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human’s story really makes you think.\n\nHowever, when a boss fight is so incredibly difficult that you spend hours trying to win, you’re more than likely to end up forgetting the story altogether. That’s where you’d probably prefer a difficulty setting. Strangely enough there’s a hardcore mode… umm… okay. Not going to attempt that one any time soon!\n\nAesthetic Charm\nThe graphics in this game are simply beautiful. They’ll leave you absorbing your surroundings in awe and engaging your imagination in a way that makes your mind believe what you’re seeing is actually a full HD world.\n\nMusically, The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human envelops you in it’s atmosphere, pulling you deep into a world where humanity has become extinct and you’re the last survivor.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nA thought-provoking story mixed with simply beautiful graphics and engaging sound track will take you on an adventure that leaves you questioning why humans are such ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nBugs are still commonly found throughout the game and some might make you reconsider giving it any more thought. But if you persevere and try different tactics, you’ll be rewarded with a rich experience that seriously puts your gaming skills to the test.\n\nI highly recommend The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human, but because of the amount of bugs and rather high difficulty level, it still feels like there’s a lot of work left to be done by YCJY.\n\nRead the full review[gamereviewsau.com]","January 30","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They must send submarine like ships into a wormhole in the sky to see if they can find a new habitable place to live. That's where you come in. You are one of the brave pilots to go through the wormhole, but something strange happens. You return to Earth but a million years into the future. There appears to be no one left alive, and it is up to you to explore and discover what happened under the sea.\n\nThis is a challenging game, The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human, that will have you pulling your hair out one minute, and then getting lost in the music and the retro-graphics the next minute. The reason why I say you'll be pulling your hair out is because you are going to be set with a certain amount of limitations that you'll have to unlock, or solve in order to advance the game. The thing is that in order to truly advance you will have to take on the bosses, and none of them are push-overs. Hell the first boss might take you a couple of tries to beat, and it only gets tougher from there.\n\nAs I mentioned before this game has retro-graphics. You are not going to be blown away by any photo-realistic graphics, but you will feel like you are playing a polished game from the past. There are several different locations, all with their own look that will have you wondering what exactly happened. You will travel through ruined underwater cities, through a sea of pipes, a warehouse, and more. There is definitely plenty to see, not to mention the fact that all the bosses have their own look which might haunt you in your dreams if you can't defeat them in combat.\n\nTo be honest the difficulty in this game REALLY only centers around the bosses, outside of that its just a matter of dodging some projectiles, avoiding corrosive gas, and keeping very far away from snapping clams. That's not to say that you can't die while just exploring the underwater world, believe me I learned that if you go straight at a floating mine you will die on impact.\n\nThe game is broken up by the power ups you gain as you play. You'll get a harpoon gun, which shoots from the bottom of the craft, and doesn't aim further up than parallel to the bottom of the ship, you'll also get a saw that will power through shining vines, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. The one thing I recommend doing is finding out where the second boss on is and then exploring every nook and cranny to see if there are power ups for your hull recovery or the hull strength. You will need ever single one of those power ups if you are going to survive.\n\nAlright so here's the one issue with the game, and to be honest with you it's not a deal breaker, but its very annoying, and it has to do with the checkpoint system. You have to consciously interact with each checkpoint, while not fighting a boss, in order to respawn there. If you don't you will respawn somewhere far from where you last started and so you are left backtracking a ton, sometimes losing where and what you were previously doing.\n\nThere's also the area maps. I would have loved to uncover the map as I'm moving through the area so I know where I've searched on the screen, but instead as soon as you hit a new screen the entire map is displayed leaving you to wonder if you've been to that screen before, and if so have you searched EVERY inch of it. You never know what could be hiding in that section.\n\nThis game is not going to be for everyone. It is challenging enough that its going to scare away some of the people who don't like on the fly strategy and some luck when it comes to bosses, but that being said this is a game that you're going to keep coming back to because either you want the challenge, or maybe you just want to shoot the poor defenseless fish that can't actually hurt you, but you sure as hell can massacre each and everyone on the screen, over and over again. This game gets an 8.6 out of 10.","April 14","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get snippets of the story of how the world came to where it currently is from holo-tapes that you can find around the game. The environment is very athmospheric with clear differences between the different areas, and the very good music does a lot to improve that even more.\n\nThe game mainly consists of going between areas and trying to kill various big bosses. I haven't finished the game yet but so far all of them have proven to be quite challanging with several of them being so hard its almost a bit frustrating (im talkingf about you, Parasite). The tactics to defeat the bosses are not always clear at first glance and some are easier if you get additional upgrades and come back a bit later.\n\nThe save points placements can be a bit annoying at times, but it autosaves outside every boss room so you dont have to travel a long way if you die, which you will.","January 24","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Here are some things I like and dislike (And some suggestions)\nPositive:\n-The bosses were all amazing and fun to fight against\n-The design is neat\n-The backgrounds and creatures were all stunning and beautiful\n-The music was also very atmospheric\n-It's just fun to play\n-The monster encylopedia. I just love to read about the monsters I fought in video games!\n\nNegative:\n-The submachine is pretty slow, which makes following point even worse\n-Maybe I am just being stupid (and I was pretty stupid sometimes) but the game is really confusing sometimes. I fought many of the bosses in the wrong order (Or can you fight most of them like you want? I'm not sure)\n-I felt like I was watching Captain Planet when reading the Holotapes sometimes. Geez, I get it, Humans are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but you can adress that a bit more subtile\n-The ending\n\nSuggestions:\n-Give the player a map. It does not have to show the upgrades and holotapes, it would just prevent a lot of backtracking and maybe show where the bosses and the travel stations are\n-Make the sub a bit faster\n(SPOILERS)\n-Make more endings. I did not kill more than 5 sea creatures other than the bosses and the latter all attacked me! I even really tried to get past the octopus peacefully! And Osiris is supposed to make me feel bad about it? Well excuse me, next time I'll try to talk with the gigantic zombie fish that's about to eat me instead of fighting it. And there are surely more than one gigantic worm and a kraken in the whole world, so I still do not feel sorry for defending myself. The Experiment was obviously better off dead, the Parasite is really not something that should belong in a healthy world, same for the Forgotten One and the giant Lobster walked into the machine all by himself! Enough ranting, I wanted to suggest something (oops, forgot about that lol) there should be something like good, bad and neutral (or maybe more) endings based on how many creatures you killed (Excluding bosses, because duh) so maybe you can talk with Osiris and let him spare you / or spare him. ( I also really didn't like that the protagonist in shot at Osiris in the end. It felt forced and unnatural\n(SPOILERS END)\n\nAll in all, I really liked this game (Even if the wall of text seems to say otherwise at first glance). Even if it was short. But it was really and expierence for me, despite the flaws it has. It was really fun and very beautiful. But you're at the wrong place if you looked for some ultra action packed shoot em up game, because this game is more about the art, atmosphere and the message behind it.\nHats off to the developers for making such a amazing game!\n7.6/10","February 7","true","12.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Which I don't.  And based on my limited play time, it seems like a lot of boss fights per square inch.  More than the average Metroidvania, at any rate.\n\nInterestingly enough, based on the achievements as of this posting, 33% of the people who bought The Aquatic Adventures of the Last Human either gave up before reaching the first boss or haven't even started the game yet.  Considering the first boss shows up within mere minutes, I'm guessing most of those 33% haven't started the game yet.  But of those who have started, 85% have made it past the first boss.  I am in this group.  The other 15% got to the first boss and bailed before beating it.  Among those of us who made it past the first boss, it seems only 60% of us have made it past the second boss, which you should reach in no more than twenty minutes.  I am not in that group.\n\nSo assuming my math is right -- not always a safe assumption, by the way -- about half of the people who started The Last Adventures of the Aquatic Human bailed before beating the second boss.  Maybe they just took a break and they'll be back later.  Maybe they only play twenty minutes at a time.  Or maybe, like me, they were hoping to explore a little longer between bouts of figuring out patterns.  I've had enough Capcom games for one lifetime.","March 6","false","0.8"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","1"

It scratches a bit of the Metroid-Vania itch, but in a more streamlined fashion. It's mostly about the boss fights and damn if they aren't cool! Figuring out how your lackluster arsenal will function against certain bosses is a treat, albeit frustrating at times. Each time I see a room that looks like a boss room, I am overcome with dread for a moment, only to then steel myself and prepare for the fight to come. It's a fun challlenge that requires skill but also presence of mind.\n\nThe game is mechanically sound, and while there are some restrictions early on that don't seem to make sense at first, it soon becomes clear the developers had to leave room for progression.\n\nThe real achievement, in my opinion, is the visual and sound design. I absolutely love the look of it, even though the popular consensus about pixel art, seems to be that it's overdone. In the case of this game, it still feels new and fresh and manages to give depth to the environments as well as the boss fights. The wildlife and underwater flora simply look fantastic.\n\nLastly, the sound design of the game is very interesting. Some sounds are a bit odd, but the underwater atmosphere is oppressive but also comforting at times. The sometimes soothing, other times unnerving sounds of the deep really add depth to the environment. In addition, the musical soundtrack is just perfect for the game, each "district" having its own song.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game you should definitely play!","January 25","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eyebrowraisingoodtimes/recommended/401360/","eyebrowraisingoodtimes","DarkDork","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eyebrowraisingoodtimes/","363 products in account","I really wanted to love this game, becuase it's utterly beautiful. It's stunning Literally, the art is better than I have seen in a /long/ time. It's got some serious atmosphere and the msusic fits the landscapse like a glove. I mean, visually the thing is a masterpiece. The trouble comes in at the gameplay portion. Game is made up of a bucnh of big ol' bosses that you have to go and kill in a wonderful underwater setting, but swimming around this dystopian waterpark isn't as fun as you imagine it. The real meat of the game is just the bosses and the to and fro is... really kind of dull. Sure, i'ts visually stunning, but all of teh obstacles are repetative and few and far between, you rsub is pretty slow making navigation slow going, and theres really nothing to do or find other than a couple bland text explanations of the story through journals and some power-ups that buffs defense or attack a tad. Other than that the entire world is really just a crossroads for the bosses.\n\nNow this would be alright if the bosses were pulse pounding fun buns, but they're... In my humble opinion... By far the weakest link in the game. The best way to explain them is "So hard it's hard." The diffuculty doesn't stem from challenging maneuvering or puzzling ways of defeating them. It's lame design. The speed of your sub manages to make dodging things a real pain AND feel un-exciting. The bosses attacks are generally far faster than yours, and a lot of the dodging factor is either luck or painstakingly calculating each attack and dodging them just so you can get a hit or two in, which generally lands you at ten-minute unvaried battles, only lengthy becuase of how much time you have to spend swimming away and not fighting. Your primary weapon, the harpoon, was probobaly my least favorite part of combat. It requires a really long charge-up period to actually get some good distance, which even FURTHER adds to how lengthy and tedious the battles are. Even then the range is poor and you'll probobaly end up just barely falling short on most of your shots. My final problem witht he game stems from the bosses themselves. Most have them have balls to the wall massive health bars, and though they're all varied in terms of gameplay strategies, they're generally all a pain in the ♥♥♥. By far the top culprit for me was The Tranquil, which sucks. I love octopuses. The Tranquil kinda just sits there as it flails four massive tentacles at you, that slowly move back and forth across the screen. Even touching them wille eliminate roughly a third of your health and if you get caught against two or one smashes you against the wall? Game over. Back to the beginning of the fight. (By the way, this doesn't just apply to the tranquil. You die? Back to square one.) You have to slooowly take down the segments of the tentacles, chop them off, and only then can you shoot it's eyes and mouth to take down it's health. At about a third it will suddenly regrow all three tentacles and start it all over again, but with an extra flail attack that is practically unpredictable. It's tentacles extened waaay farther then their normal length and if you haven't already gotten out of the way, you're doomed. This really brings it all down to luck. Wrong place wrong time? Start over for you. You have to repeat the tentacle chop eye process a couple times and then its dead. Eeeeeeh....\n\nI'm sure there are some people out there who cleared it all on their first try and look at this thinking (Lol$ n00b.) But for me, I found it way more frusterating than challenging. The bosses wern't difficult becuase they made you put your skill to work, they were difficult becuase beating them meant a whole ton of long and tedious trial and error, and boring camping technuiqes that drew the fight out way longer than it should have.\n\nI really respect the game's art and I think they did an absolutley amazing job in the department, but the gameplay is just really under par.","February 20","false","1.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Another boss, I've managed to eke my why through only one time without the game seizing up. And yet another boss after that my computer just instantly slows to a chug, and the game crashes yet again. I can't finish the game in this state, and am unable to. For this, I shouldn't need to scour around forums searching for solutions to these problems.

Cool.\n\nThe game tries to be a bit of a metroidvania -sort of affair, with new paths of exploration opening up as you gain new abilities. However, the game is surprisingly limited in it's offerings.

The game also lies: it says it can be played with a gamepad. I did, but I would not recommend it. Especially towards the end you need to be able to aim fairly precisely and switch firing directions very quickly, so a gamepad simply could not provide the required level of accuracy, which led to even more frustration.\n\nSo the gameplay is a bit repetitive, the bosses are frustrating and long and the game has precious few new features to unlock, so what about the story?\n\nSadly, the story, too, is lackluster. There is very little story to go around, most of it is pointless in the end and the method of delivery is boring as well.

Due to climate change, the surface of the earth has frozen up and the human race has been forced to live underneath the water! A great expedition has been planned to send a sub-aquatic spaceship (of which you are in command) to the nearest wormhole. The idea is to look for a new habitable planet. However, after entering the wormhole, a small hiccup occurred . . . Nothing too drastic, you just find yourself back on earth a thousand years after the extinction of the human race . . . You are the last human! That’s a bugger, wouldn’t you say?\n\nThe aquatic adventure of the last human is an action/adventure game where you take control of the sub-aquatic spaceship, Argo 9. After piercing through the thick layer of ice, you will start your underwater adventure with not a defensive or offensive mechanism to your vessel. You will explore the very colourful underwater scenery. Despite all of this, you will encounter obstacles the likes of underwater mines, sewerage pipes and more. Within the map, you will find upgrades for your ship – a harpoon, a saw and more. You will upgrade the hull of you vessel by finding crates here and there.\n\nAs you explore the map, your will come across “Holo Tapes” which will give you some tips and information about the underwater world. As soon as you see a station, make sure you reach it; it is a checkpoint so if you die for some reasons, you will respawn from there.\n\nIn term of the enemies, within the map (as far as I have seen so far), the giant clams are pretty much the ones you will need to be careful of. In regards to the bosses, you will find them quite challenging to beat. As this game is more exploring than anything else, you will find bosses in different places without a specific order.\n\nThe pixel graphics are beautiful and the underwater surrounding atmosphere is well portrayed. The soundtrack is good too. For the controls, you will use the gamepad.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good pixel art graphics\n-	Well designed bosses\n-	Good soundtrack\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Very challenging bosses\n-	Few enemies beside the bosses\n\nThe Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human has beautiful pixel art and portrays a very good underwater atmosphere.\n\n7/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

The concept that humankind actually managed to not only preserve some documents for 100,000+ plus years after their death, but also a McDonalds building should make me feel something. A giant worm about to wreck my ♥♥♥♥, or seahorses, or some of the magically regenerating other bosses (No really, it's FM: F-ing Magic) should make me feel... Well, *anything*.\n\nBut I feel nothing. I don't feel any adrenaline during the boss fights, because often, it's a matter of dodging the boss while waiting for a few seconds to charge my harpoon, release at roughly the right moment, rinse, repeat (Until you're then asked to use saws, and torpedoes)... No rush, no disappointment when I die (Because usually, it's either because I failed the fight, didn't know how the boss works, or, occasionally, something wasn't quite as saw-able or torp-able as I thought it was at first), no "♥♥♥♥ you, game!"\n\nNothing.

Each encounter with the bosses are special ands hard to forget.  They are really, really hard, which help making each combat unforgetable.\nThis game has a kind of Dark Souls vibe in a positive, with the weapon which must be charged to hit more than 20cm from the submarine, and the limited dodge, you must time your attacks and dodge at the right time.\n\nIf you like metroidVania and not afraid by a challenge, give it a go !","February 14","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Non-linear gameplay. The story is told through in-game lore, not cutscenes, and it's up to you to decipher how the events actually happened. There's a logbook on the bosses that you fight. And lastly, the beautiful ambience music.\nShadow of the Colossus: Simple, besides exploring, the other half of this game is fighting humongous creatures. All the battles are amazing and also pretty hard. Makes both finding and defeating the creatures exciting.\n\nOh, and lastly, dinosaurs didn't last 65 million years!!! They went extinct 65 million years ago but lasted about 160 millions. That really, really bothered me. Other than that play this game!","May 19","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play a submarine exploring the remains of humanity underwater. The bosses fights are interesting, the environments are varied and atmospheric, there are plentiful nooks and crannies to explore. I guess my only complaint is that it's sometimes not clear how difficult a particular boss/area is. Thankfully, it auto saves as you enter a boss-area, so even if it cleans your clock, you can try, try again--or skedaddle and venture in a different direction until you find some more upgrades. 9/10 would kill all the ocean life again.","May 29","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
