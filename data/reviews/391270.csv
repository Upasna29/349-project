"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sayasays/recommended/391270/","sayasays","Not FUNKe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sayasays/","60 products in account","[SUMMARY]\n\nFor a game that is free to play, and has very little download time it is most certainly worth your time, if you got 30 minutes or so spare, download this game and play it. Do note if you are under the age of 13, that you need to think carefully before playing this game, because it might scare younger players, but to be honest do feel free to play it, and finish it. Totally recommend: 8/10.\n\n[IN DEPTH REVIEW]\n\nSo, you still have your doubts huh? Well, I’ll explain why it is so great.\n\nThe storyline is so brilliant for an indie horror game, to be honest I hate horror games, but this, was something I actually enjoyed, it has no jump scares (although I did rush the game for the review, I may update it later if there is one, that I may have missed during rushing), and is purely driven about the idea of psychological horror, and that’s what makes it such a compelling storyline, and, despite the multiple chills I felt going down my back, I continued, because I wanted to see what would happen, and how it would end.\n\nIn terms of playability, it is, like most indie games, a pick up and play, the only thing that will make you think, is the complexity of the situation, and not which controls you need to press, the themes of this game is mildly concerning, (not going to spoil anything) and at the end, really makes you think about yourself, and if what your doing is right. I really struggled to get started on this review, purely because it keep returning to my mind, but, that is what the game is meant to do to you.\n\nThe game itself is quite a lot more serious than the clone of games being released every 3 weeks (*cough* Five Nights at Freddy’s *cough*), and is a ton better than whatever they are releasing, so before spending some of your hard earned cash, (or not so hard earned cash, I don’t know how you get money), why not give this a whirl first? Truth to be told, it has more entertainment value than You-Know-What.\n\nMy only complaint about the game would be that the game really could and should have been a great deal longer, the story and plot line has so much room for expansion, don’t get me wrong this game is good as it is, but an update or something to have more of a capitalisation upon the story of the characters (trying not to spoil here), as it was not really explained enough to really give to effective of a cliff-hanger, but is suppose, it is about the psychological effects more than the plot after all.\n\nAddressing re-playability,  it looks the game that you might feel inclined to play and then play again immediately, or after a few weeks of intervals, because the story immerses you so well, (like I said room for expansion) that you really want to replay it, (after this review I’m probably going off to replay it, because it’s so good), but, to be honest, it doesn’t need to be replayed, however, if you got the time, replay it, because it’s like your looking through a completely different perspective, and maybe I would of get FNAF 2 if I had the ability to be the animatronics, but to be honest, it isn’t up my street anyway, (I hate jump scares, poorest way of adding tension, but I’m not a game developer, so what do I know?), but I’m getting off topic.\n\nNext on my list is the graphics, and when I say what you expected from a game that takes barely any time to download, your answer would probably be not much, however, this graphics, enhances the game, and makes it more immersive, it feels older, making you feel it is more unknown the games you normally play, and considering the engine used was Unity free version, you can count me impressed. I think the creator could not be more right with this “It features a unique artstyle that combines elements of pixel horror with realistic lighting effect, which is intended to enhance the surreal atmosphere”. That right there is exactly what it does, the graphic make it feel more real, it makes the atmosphere feel as if it is happening with just you in control of the body, and that the body you control, is you, and you want to know who is this character, and what is he/she doing here? What relevance does it have to the story? How does the title fit in with all this? And that is exactly why you play this game past the opening moments, because you want to know the answer, and you are going to play through this game multiple times just to find out what is going on here. And that is the true beauty of an indie game like this.\n\nLast, but most certainly not least, the music. This tune, fits too well for this game, the eerie sound of the tune fits in perfectly with the game itself, as if the music was made specifically for the game (maybe it was?) because it naturally makes sense for the sounds being played and the game itself, I can’t have any real complaints about this game, because, on all aspects, its indie developer’s dream, because it doesn’t appear to have any bugs, its well-made and fluid.\n\nI really want to say how impressed I am by this, and I give kudos to the creator for such a unique and enjoyable game, that has changed my opinion on all horror games, and the genre itself, maybe I might get those games with lots of zombies and jump scares in it… No. This game is beautifully original, and is hand crafted to a perfect game, and is an absolute gem.\n\nIf you’re still not willing to give this game a go, then… I don’t know, maybe you just don’t like psychological horror, or maybe you’re on your phone or something, and you can’t download it yet, who knows, maybe you’re holidaying in Belarus, and won’t be back for a while.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, good game, well played. Sorry for any mistakes, I’m not fluent English, if you have any questions, or want me to review a game, add me or drop a comment on this, or my profile.\nAnd on that bombshell…\n\nGoodnight!\n\nP.S: I do know this game has been out since March last year, but just wasn’t on Steam\nP.S.S: Totally didn’t find out just now when searching the game to make sure I hadn’t got the wrong game","August 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 244 of 270 people (90%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","90","244","270","32","47"

It's free!" So, yes, let's acknowledge first that the game is free.\n\nBut did I *enjoy* it? Not really. The game is entirely centered around its story, which is told in the form of scattered diary pages that you are obligated to find and read. The story, though, is minimal. It's not so much a story as much as it is a concept. Is it a scary concept? Not really. It's more of a sad and despicable concept than scary.\n\nThe gameplay can be 100% described as follows: 1) Look for a diary page, 2) Guess which word in the diary page is a password for the keyboard on the desk, 3) type it into the keyboard to unlock a door, 4) go through that door into a new room, 5) repeat steps 1 through 4.\n\nDo that about 3 times and the game is over.\n\nIt might have been interesting, but the "gameplay" amounts to a checklist and the story is more of a concept.\n\nBut it IS free.

Good, and evil, are names that signify our appetites, and aversions; which in different tempers, customs, and doctrines of men, are different." - Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan\n\nFingerbones is the first game that David Szymanski made in the horror genre, and he confesses in the game's brief description that he has learned much since completing this project. Still, Fingerbones is a narrative and atmospheric success for a game which wouldn't take any longer than 20 minutes to complete, plus it is free for you to experience.\n\nWe open our eyes to an old bunker, and start our exploration. We are quick to discover some scattered notes around left by a man, a father who supposedly lived here. We know one thing: whoever left these notes to us as bread crumbs all around the house, is one obsessed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over the concept of "societal norms". What happened to him? That is one major spoiler, so if you'd like to find out, you have to spare 20 minutes and discover yourself.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game, in my opinion, serves as a foreshadowing for David Szymanski's future games. The usage of beaming lights, flickering screen and creepy background noises are used conventionally to establish a successful setting. Graphics are very basic, yet they do not fail to deliver the kind of uneasiness that you expect from a proper horror game.\n\nGame mechanics consist of a basic exploration, and 3-4 very easy password puzzles. Is there anything extraordinary about the story? Well, aside being particularly disturbing, the story isn't incredibly interesting. The imaginative or enlightening factor is the concept David Syzmanski decided to build the game over: the true nature of mankind. When given total freedom, away from societal norms and binding rules, human isn't even slightly glorious or benevolent than an ape, a wild animal. This game is a symbolic ode to the theory of men being evil - or primal - at their core. I bet Thomas Hobbes would be proud.\n\nI personally prefer games with more elaborate social theories, but if you have 20 minutes to spare, capable of ignoring some disturbing implications and enjoy atmospheric horror genre, there is no logical reason for not checking this game out. It is free, and it is really good in that context.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 12, 2015","true","0.3"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","49","57","2","0"

Proves that you don't need heavily advanced graphics to make a nice horror story and give you that sense of immersion.\n\nThe game has a simple, blocky, retro-style visual, a look that could easily fall into mid-to-late 90's game, with some nicely added lighting and fog, which adds, at least for me, that "Silent Hill" effect of "I know I need to go further, but I'm scared".\n\nThe great part of the game, though, it's certainly in its narrative, how it's constructed and how it uses sounds to help generate the mood during gameplay. It's disturbing, but not in a gory and visual style, and there are no jumpscares at all, the story brings you the terror without even showing a monster, ghost or whatever.\n\nAlso, while some people might find that this walking "back-and-forth" mechanic is a bit tiring, it's also one of the things that help build the terror in the game, like "ok, I'm going out, but I know I'll have to return and I have no idea about what  I'm gonna find there".\n\nIt's short, but it's a well written story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/391270/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","Fingerbones is the first horror game by David Szymanski, the creative mind that brought us such gems as The Moon Sliver and The Music Machine. Originally published in 2013, the game wound up on Steam around a year later. This title is a short exploratory horror mixed with narration in the way of journal pages scattered about. It's up to you to unravel the dark story within, by solving a simple series of puzzles.\n\nI would be lying if I said that Fingerbones didn't keep me looking over my in-game shoulder, amidst the eerie crying of a child and dense fog. I was almost certain that I would see some demon-spawn in kid form awaiting me around the next corner, or behind a door. Needless to say, the thick and immersive atmosphere, however simplistic it may be, really sucks you in during the short timeframe of this narrative story. From the stand-alone mechanical howling of the generator in a well lit top level, to the forlorn cries of a child and creepy silence of the basement, every moment is suspenseful in some way.\n\nThe game uses Minecraft-like textures, in that everything is heavily and purposefully pixelated. Usually this distracts from any horror element that a game may have, turning them into child friendly PG-13 types. Thankfully, that is not the case here; however brief it may be, the chilling story is enough to send a shiver down the spine of any adult. The game only lasts 15-30 minutes at best, and there are only a handful of journal pages scattered about; it would've been nice if there was more story to this narrative-centric experience.\n\nFor a short and free horror title, Fingerbones is one of the best that you'll come across. Prepare to white-knuckle your mouse for the next half hour of entertainment, while anxiously waiting for what may be around the next bend. Take your time, don't rush, and read the pages carefully to fully understand what unimaginable horrors that this poor excuse of a father put his child through. Then, if you enjoyed yourself, go ahead and take a look at the other games from this fantastic developer.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","May 2","true","0.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Smaller, more alternative genres like psychological games, especially these small ones, can change the nature of the gaming industry completely.\n\nIt adds a flavour to gaming, allowing it to be enjoyed by all ages. In a way, it's very comparable to films. You have the blockbusters like Mission Impossible (film) and Call of Duty (game) which are respectable creations, but the truly introspective aspect of games can only be found in these little projects. It can put your ethics in question and  can truly alter your intellectual thoughts.\n\nI definitly approve this game, recommending it to all.\nAnd come on, it's literally half an hour of your time.","August 23, 2015","true","0.3"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","0"

It's simply a shock game that tries to make you disgusted by throwing as many touchy traits within the main character to make you cold to them as possible, then have him commit so horrible that the player is supposed to feel sickened.\n\nI didn't feel that sickening. I felt irritated, really. It's a very cheap trick to toss in too much shock at once rather than let a story happen naturally. Fingerbones doesn't do this. I implore any gamer to consider Serena, which introduces you to a plot that doesn't intend to smother you with shock but gently pull you into a plot and then slowly allows you to see the true horror to the story instead of smacking you repeatedly with it. Heavy handed and overly dramatic, skip Fingerbones. Please. Spooky's House of Jumpscares has more development than this should you complete the required actions. Both games mentioned are free.\n\nThe developer has done better than this. As others have also indicated, The Moon Sliver and The Music Machine are games that are worth being looked at. The Music Machine deals with similar topics you find in Fingerbones and is worthy of an artistic title due to not just how beautiful and creative it looks, but how it bends religious dogma to create a sort of universe that ties into The Moon Sliver but stands alone just as well.\n\nWhile this is, of course, a short game and one that is free, it's just not worth it. While there's nothing awful with the blocky and Minecraft-esque graphics, it's all about the tone set in the story. There was nothing here but a few sound effects and what I imagined would have been a "you're supposed to be scared here" sign. The mouse sensitivity has to be turned all the way down to the minimum on my end and I have to insist, I have a pretty new computer. This game will cause severe motion sickness.\n\nThe only thing I can say about this game that is good is you'll be over this game in about six minutes if you figure things out relatively quickly, but because many of the notes are fairly vague, I highly doubt that will happen.\n\nIt's a poorly made free horror game. It's not quite as bad as All Is Dust, but it's pretty bad.\n\nDon't believe the hype. Go for the dev's later games. At least he handles the topics a bit more tastefully in The Music Machine.","December 21, 2015","false","0.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Chances are, you've put more than half an hour into a lot of them.\nGo put another half hour or so onto them.

Sure, the notes are unsettling, but the story they tell is hardly original, and the supposed "trigger warning" needed is just a buzzword grab for attention. For such a short 'game' trying to be impactful, it pulls a lot of punches it didn't need to.\n\nFurthermore, retrieving passwords and backtracking to the keyboard is tedious, and takes up a fair portion of the ~20mins you'll spend playing this.

All you do is walk around and pick up notes and solve a couple of puzzles. It's really simple stuff, but if you do play the game it will be for the story.\n\nGraphics are simple pixel horror style, but use different lighting effects which gives the game a really awesome look.  Now some of the item models look a bit weird it's still a really good looking game.\n\nAudio is fantastic. The audio will make you feel like you're not alone and it's just really well done. The music is really good to, but there's not much of it.\n\nThe game has really simple level design so I doubt anyone would get stuck in this game. There's not much more to say about it.\n\nThe game is really short. It took me 15 minutes to finish the entire thing and I loved every second of it. Apart from the one playthrough you will do there's not much replay value.\n\nI didn't encounter any bugs what so ever. The game ran smoothly and I highly doubt that anyone would have problems playing it.\n\nOverall Fingerbones is a really good indie horror game. Now I wouldn't say it's better than Moon Sliver, but it's still really good. I highly suggest playing through it at least once. I give Fingerbones a 8/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 31, 2015","true","0.2"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","2"

It talks about taboo subjects that games often beat around and never truly even give note of, where as this game full dives into it head first and let's you in on all that's happening. The atmosphere is dark and the gameplay is quite profound, especially in the terms that of how as you progress, you can feel yourself get scared as if you were actually there and just grip the edge of your seat. I found myself at times simply pausing the game and walking outside for some fresh air because of how intense this game could become, whether it be the haunting and eerie score, the chilling wimpers of a young girl, or the context you pick up on as the ending of this game grows nearer and nearer. There even came a time in which I messaged the Dev simply because of both my brother and I being so afraid that a jump scare was surely imminent that we decided to stop until we knew for sure what the outcome would be. It is amazing and truly something when you have someone such as myself who has spent most of life looking into the paranormal and supernatural, along with my brother who is one play games such as Amnesia and FNAF in the chilling hours of morning with only the dark screeen as his light, to be so scared as to refuse progression until we knew what was possible to come next. I must digress. This game has it all and if you feel up to the challenge both mentally and psychologically, I say get this game and dive into it. Dive like you have never diven before and don't look back.\n\n-Eerie Score\n-Dark yet calm atmosphere\n-Taboo is present\n-Amazing Storyline\n-It's Free!!!","September 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I felt like it didn't quite drive the point home enough for me, or leave me with a sense of horror afterwards. So I played it again. And I feel I got more out of the experience this time, but still, I feel that it's missing something. It's all there in the notes, and the story is well layed out (and quite gruesome, don't get me wrong), but I feel like the game didn't quite go all the way for me. I left feeling like the creator didn't quite end on the highest note (no pun intended) and the dread just wasn't quite there for me, even though I feel it should've been given the story and tone of the game.\nHowever, I do recommend this game because it looks great stylistically, the story is well written, and while the horror (for whatever reason) didn't quite hit me as hard as I would have liked, it is a sufficiently atmospheric and creepy game that tells a pretty diabolical story. Perhaps this game will hit others where it didn't hit me.\n\n7/10","August 15, 2015","true","0.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I would call it "interactive shortstory" rather than a game, but I dont mean that in a negative way.\n\nTechnical stuff:\nThe graphic is similar to "Music Machine" (same dev), simple but atmospheric (for example due to the light and dust effects) - I uploaded a few screenshots if you like to have a look.\nThe game mechanic is very easy and pleasant, you move by WASD, look around with the mouse and interact with items by LMB. Thats it.\nA little annoying was that you cant really come near any objects like tables or the like, you stop a meter (~3 feet I guess) away from it as if you walked against an invisible wall. But that isnt a big deal, you get used to it and it doesnt happen very often anyway.\nWhat else? Oh the sound. Theres no voice acting. Your character stays silent and you have to read the notes you find yourself. But for me that wasnt a negative aspect - I liked the silence and found it matches this whole atmosphere perfectly. The backroundmusic could be better to be honest. I found it a little annoying after a while but the game is so short, that you are finished before it really starts to bother you hardly.\n\nContent:\nWell like a said, actually its kind of a short story. You find yourself in a bunker with no information who you are and what you are doing there and have to look around and find out what happend by reading short notes which you find here and there on the map (and that was it. In fact there isnt really anything more to do than reading notes. Thats what I mean by its a story, not a game). By finding new/more notes, the story reveals, till in the end you know who you are, why you are in this place and what happend there. The end.\n\nConclusion:\nI liked it and would recommend it. But ONLY for people who like to read and games in which the story is more important than the gameplay (or even in which there nearly isnt any gameplay except moving around and reading). Its in this regard (or actually in many regards) similar to "Serena" - if you liked this game you will probably also find something you like in "Fingerbones". But if you expect more than a very short story to reveal by reading notes, if you want a game where you actually have something to -do- that effects your enviroment and so on, this game isnt for you.\n\nBut since its free and only takes you 20 minutes... try it.\n\n[If you liked this game and want something similar but more complex, try "[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/359040/]The music machine[/url]". I can really recommend it.]","August 3, 2015","true","0.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's a short (20 minutes) narrative story.. Well how do I put it.. About mentallity of people it's straight up ♥♥♥♥ed up. You will be finding random notes untill you start heading deeper into the mentallity of the notes. It sorta describes how much people can be ♥♥♥♥ed up and how far will they go with that.. I won't spoil anything play it for yourself. It has a lot of backtracking which is sucky but worth if you like good psychological horror. But I do not, DO NOT recommend it to younger players since they won't even understand the severity of it and if they do they won't feel very nice. The game sends a message of some sort and that is what games these days can't do, it actually makes you think about what can the world turn in to and in what is it turning. It left me feeling uneasy and really is one of heavier themes. Could be I just handle it bad, but it really made me think and feel bad or I don't even know the feeling.

It isn't a horror game that uses cheap jumpscares to frighten you\nInstead, Fingerbones uses your mind through different notes scattered around an environment that you need to read to uncover the secrets of the place you're in. At the beggining, you don't know who you are, where you are or what your purpose is. After reading every single note, uncovering every secret of this AMAZING but at the same time HORRIFIC\nstory, you finally find out who you are and what your purpose was from the beggining.\n\n\nThe game's main enemy is found right at the end, and this enemy will surprise you the same way as it surprised me.\n\n\nThe horrific story of the game somehow resembles I Am Legend combined with a Friday the 13th movie, although it's very original and the core is just a very tiny bit alike these 2 masterpieces.\n\n\nFingerbones can be finished in about 20-30 minutes, and uses no savegames.\n\nOverall, all i can say is congratulations to the developer for creating this masterpiece. We need more games like these, games that make us think and eventually ♥♥♥♥ with our minds in both a good and a clever way.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, and it definitely made it into my Gaming Hall of Fame\n\nI rate it 10/10\n\n\nBEWARE: IF YOU ARE NOT USED TO HORROR GAMES DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, THE ATMOSPHERE, MUSIC AND GENERAL STORY ARE NOT FOR THE EASILY SCARED!

Just kidding anyhow Fingerbones is a "Psychological Horror" in the broadest sense of the term seeing as how all of your attachment to the characters stems from brief journal entries that were for whatever reason scattered in your end of the world bunker. You are a man coming back to his bunker after a time period where you did nothing or something I honestly don't know. You boot up the game and walk around reading notes and then you pick up a flashlight for seemingly no reason it's pretty useless overall until the very end of the game where it serves as a plot device. So after reading the notes and what not you turn on a generator walk around type stuff into a keyboard jutting from the wall that's connected to nothing. You waste some more time then head to the door you could'nt acess before and head in. You go further down and then realise you can't. Go back upstairs and walk around go back down after becoming frustrated. Get into the hatch and figure out you cut your daughters fingers off as keepsake. Then your light go out, THE END. I really felt nothing throughout this whole game. The notes were bleak and meaningless other than to prove you are playing as an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a man who is having marital problems. So when the light goes out in the basement and I guess your daughters ghost kills you. You can't help but not give a single ♥♥♥♥ about anything. 4/10 Walking simulator should be a tag.

I booted it up and could not for the life of me figure out what I was expected to do in the very first room. I thought maybe I was supposed to leave after activating the generator but the "Exit" door literally means quit-to-desktop exit.\nI'm glad I went right back in to give it one more shot. I've been following this dev's creations for a while now, and though they are disappoingly short I think the fact that I feel dissapointment at their premature conclusion really speaks to how engaging 20 minutes of gameplay can be. Fingerbones is free, so there is no reason under the sun you shouldn't pick it up and give it a go. My only gripe is that your character moves abysmally slow; if the walk speed was 10-15% faster there would be nothing I would find worthy to complain about.","September 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

David uses minimal graphics, a beautiful score, provocative writing, and well-timed sounds to create an atmosphere of dread that many expensively produced horror games cannot match. More than a horror game, Fingerbones provides its player with an experience that, while short, will resonate with them long afterwards.\n\n*I've played each of David's designs, and highly recommend them for those who are seeking an experience that is more than just a game, but an exploration of horror narrative, and how a game can be more than just an entertainment piece.

It sets out what it wanted to do and accomplished it. I wouldn't call it horror outright, but it has a semi-unsettling story you discover through the notes that I would not have expected told in a game. Do not read this unless you don't feel like you want to play it --->  You are a father who took refuge with his daughter in this shelter because of an unknown event that wiped out humanity. Through the notes you find that the initial excitement of survival wore off and the lack of society means that the immoral desires or thoughts you had did not need to be locked away and that you could make them become a reality. You find your way into the cellar and you come to realize that you had killed your daughter, but the guilt was so overcoming that you cut off your some of your fingers and put them in the safe upstairs, and by now they have become Fingerbones.\n\nA decent time killer that is definitely worth taking a look at, especially since it's free. It goes in a direction I would love to see more explored in games and even though this is a very small taste of that direction, it is a good one nonetheless.","November 7, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's good music. Less good are the other non-music sound effects, which were kind of cheesy. The rest of the game consists of 4 rooms, which you have to backtrack through several times in order to progress. Your character moves very slowly, adding to the game time. I think the visual transition between the first room and the cellar could have been done better--I found the cut to black to be much more jarring than the other doors, which you just walk through without seeing any kind of cut.\n\nRather than scary or creepy, I just found the notes, and the story they reveal, to be sad and a little hamfisted. Instead of being unsettled, I was merely grossed out. That's fine for some horror games, but that's really not what this billed itself as. I'm a complete wuss, and was hoping this would deliver on its promise of "psychological horror", but I feel about as affected as I might feel after watching traffic pass by for half an hour.\n\nRating: 1/55: Loved it; 4: Liked it; 3: It's OK; 2: Didn't like it; 1: Hated it","November 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Perhaps adding some external immersion, such as setting your surroundings to be dark and scary, would make it a scarier and more immersive experience.

That being said, as someone who hates censorship, I applaud the developer for not shying away from these subjects. It's always refreshing seeing something put forth in any artful medium that is considered taboo by the general public, because you almost never see it.

It may not be the best free horror game on Steam, but it's a nice game which takes about thirty minutes. However, it may even be shorter! The game is very basic. You interact with notes to find out what's happening, and why you're there at this abandoned bunker. The only puzzle in the game is that to unlock doors you must type in codes, which are found in notes most of the time. So, it's very simple and not challenging, but that's a good thing.\nThe big question is: Is this game scary?\nTo me, it wasn't. I rarely get scared in games. I recently just beaten "Until Dawn" and that didn't scare me at all, even though it is a good game. So that answers that question.\n\nSo, this free horror game is worth a shot, because it is good for a free horror game. It's quick, and you will most likely uninstall it after completing it just so you have that space in your computer back. So, yes, I do recommend this game. After all, if you don't like...it's free.

As you start reading the notes scattered around the building you learn piece by piece of what happened. Also you can pay attention to the setting because it unravels information not in the notes itself. In a sense this game is an interactive story more than a game. The only game play here is walking around and pushing the left mouse button. Once you've found all the clues the game will end and ultimately you have to decide what happened.\n\nResult	It's an ok game that has an interesting story, but it has no replayability because the story is the only thing that carries it. It's not a must play and honestly I think watching an abridged video of it will be more worthwhile, but it's ok if you have some free time. I have a video link below if you want to watch a more humorous playthrough it.\n\nTips	1. There is a generator in the first room\n2. Read the notes for the passwords\n3. Type in the passwords on the computer to open areas\n4. nny is part of a four letter word Still stuck? ->  It's backwards\n5. There is a hidden wall hole in the first room\n\nDiscussion	Lots of spoilers here.  Judging from the bloodied tools and the bloodstained table in the basement I believe he killed her and then ate her. From his notes we see that he's denying it, but if he really did throw her into the woods why is there so much blood in the basement? Also why would he remember her screaming? People dying of diesease don't typically scream. It seems like the storage room is where he cut off her fingers judging from the amount of blood. Then he might have kept her alive while he slowly consumed her which might explain her weakened state.	 That's my take on it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4uYd7Jts2s0","September 28, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

And this is just the beginning.  Scattered notes.  Madness.  Hopeless drivel.  Nonsensical rationalism.  End of the world bunkers.   A quick decline out of sanity and morality.  "Freedom" in captivity, incest, ♥♥♥♥, and murder.  A world without anyone where one may do as he/she pleases.  This one has it all.  Surely your woo-hoo thing-a-ma-jiggy down there will get an arousing devilish tickle after you complete this one.\n\nTruly, Incest Mysteries reached a new level of incestuous pedophilic creepiness when David Szymanski came onto the scene with Fingerbones.  His follow-up, The Moon Sliver, expands upon Fingerbones, but it doesn't hold the incestuously creepy vibe  Fingerbones has enduring throughout it.  A third installment has been released, The Music Machine, which I've yet to play, but surely, with all the positive reviews, it appears to be another Incest Mysteries hit.\n\nIf you're into imagining pedophile and/or incestuous relationships with a very young female--or with your own daughter or sister--then look no further to David Szymanski's line of Incest Mysteries games, especially Fingerbones.\n\nDavid Szymanski stands out like no other.  So much Valve has secretly begun a charity fundraiser campaign to pay for a pedophile/incest councillor specialist to council David Szymanski with his incest and pedophile fantasies and inclinitations.\nBut we all know Valve's charity fundraiser for David will fall miserably short of its goal.  Because Valve, at its deepest core, is a strong supporter of David's incestuous and murderous vision of "freedom", and wishes to see such a grand vision downloaded into the minds of their users.  And look at the results: raving positive reviews for David's works, to the lengths and depths of deep philosophy, awe, and praise for his work and vision.  Godlessness continues to reach new heights.\n\nThe simplest solution is for David Szymanski to turn to Christ with all his heart, by calling upon the name of Jesus Christ.  The same with big daddy Valve and his cookie-munching underlings.\n\nThis is lake of fire material.  Turn away, lest you wish to be thrown into it.\n\n","February 19","true","0.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

While it's not overtly scary (haters of jumpscares, fear not - no pun intended), it does build a wonderful sense of unsettledness (is that a word?) and the plot is disturbing at best.  At the end I was left feeling creeped out and disconcerted, which is exactly what I want out of a simple atmospheric game.\n\nSince the game is free and only takes about 20-30 minutes to complete, I'd say it's well worth it.  The only things you need are some free time and the imagination to read between the lines and fill in the blanks from the notes you find.  If you are, like me, a fan of being able to really THINK about a story, you should love this.  (On the flipside, however, if you are the type that likes your story explicity delivered to you word-by-word, you might not be appreciative of this story.)\n\nIf you liked The Moon Sliver, you'll probably like this one as well.  If you haven't played The Moon Sliver and have enjoyed this one, I would go pick it up for a couple bucks; it's longer with more depth and is from the same developer.  He seems to do a good job putting his players into the psychological blender, and I'm looking forward to playing more from him.","September 23, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

We are the first generation to be "raised" with the intellectual freedoms afforded by the internet and thus the first to also have to deal with the dark side of such freedoms.  Although this theme has been explored by generations of humans as far back as the ancient Greeks (in other words as far back as our record keepings will allow us to see), ours is the first where access to such vast amounts of information and sufficient time to ponder on it is available to so many people.  When in times ancient only the elite had the time to ponder and discuss, now anybody with a part time job has such freedoms.  Although this game, what I can only assume to be a way to illustrate deeper a possible dark side to this freedom, throws apocalytic events into the mix and has the protaganist go to carnally tribal extremes to fend for himself, I believe the dark sides of reality are much more boring.  One of them being - me.  Any you.  And anybody playing this game, writing a review, watching a movie, investing endless hours in exploring the entertaining products that have been produced as a result of such freedom instead of exploring a much scarier product, our own minds.","August 4, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The character isn't believable at all. The existance of the notes explaining all his secret codes don't make any sense. Why would he invest so much in a conveluted passcode locking system if he's just gonna write down the codes to all his stuff and leave it around the house. It doesn't seem very consistent with his character. A character that seems so set on portraying himself as someone all about hard science and rationality.\n\nThe only suspense you get is from the cheap sound effects of a girl breathing, and sounding scared. But the sounds don't even correlate to anything that actually exists in the game.\n\nThe notes are the only real content here, and they're pretty laughable. The character just rambles on and on about some social darwinist crap. Doesn't really make a lot of sense. None of it sounds like something a real human would write.\n\nIf you want a good quick slice of pychological horror, go play The Static Speaks My Name.

The first password is relatively simple to work out, with the aid of several notes lying around that hint towards it. How the hell the creator expected you to work out the second and third, however, I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue. I walked in circles around the room for a few minutes, trying to find anything that may hint towards what the password might be. In the end I looked at a playthrough on YouTube. But the guy doing the playthrough had to tab out to look at the answer on YouTube as well!\n\nIn conclusion, the first room is fun and relatively simple to progress from into the second room. However, unless you possess some psychic ability, I don't know how you can be expected to figure out that in order to unlock the door to the third room, you have to run back into the first room and enter "nnyl" on the keyboard. Maybe I missed some note somewhere, but if that's the case, then it can't be very well placed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PantsuAreWonderful/recommended/391270/","PantsuAreWonderful","Dirst","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PantsuAreWonderful/","248 products in account","I think the best way to describe Fingerbones is "fine".\n\nIt's a short game where you explore an abandoned house place and solve puzzles to access new areas that contain more parts of the story. Classic formula for a storytelling game, but in Fingerbones, you move at a snail's pace between the same two areas for 20 minutes, solving "puzzles" so badly made that they can only be thought of as a filler, some excuse to let the developers say it's got puzzles.\n\nSo, the game itself is pretty bad. I say it's "fine" overall because the plot does involve things that normally you'd never see in games, and I like when games have the balls to reach new ground like that. The game has good audio to set the scene, but the pixel style didn't add anything to my experience.\n\nThe gameplay consists of going between two rooms reading bits of paper left around the place, figuring out passwords to enter into a terminal to unlock a door, and then reading more bits of paper. It's a bits of paper collecting simulator, which is a genre that's been done enough at this point, and it's only redeeming point is its unusual plot.\n\nIt also warns that it's not to be played by people who are easily triggered. ♥♥♥♥ that. If people are getting OFFENDED before they're getting scared when playing what is supposd to be a horror game, then I don't want to live anymore.\n\n\nTL;DR: I don't regret playing it, but I wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't play it again.\n\nPros:\n+ Story is different than the norm\n+ Audio is well done\n\nCons:\n- Stupidly slow movement speed means most of the game is spent walking between two places you've already been in\n- The puzzles are terrible\n\n","August 9, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Not what I expected. With every note I picked up I had to stare at the screen for upwards of 10 seconds either to look for the next message to type into the keyboard, or to process what the ♥♥♥♥ happened in that bunker. I knew from the reviews that it had no jumpscares, but going into that cellar I still wasn't so sure. Each passing note revealed another deeper, more disturbing layer in this story.  From what I can gather, a divorced scientist with one child became so smart that emotion and morality didn't make sense to him. He built a survival bunker, waiting for the apocalypse, and then it happened. The game doesn't tell you what exactly happened, but it was bad enough to need a bunker. So he and his daughter ran into the bunker, and he must've gotten cabin fever or something because what he did was not normal. Like the apocalypse, the game doesn't tell you exactly what happened, but it tells you enough to know that it was seriously messed up.  Definitely check this out.

It definatly is a better psycological horror then most I've played. I enjoy horror, especially psycological horror. The graphics aren't bad, but some people don't like Pixel art. It does require a LOT of backtracking when you contrast with how short the game is. I would love to see a sequal which is a lot longer, or a similar title.  The story is nice and detailed, but not too much so it leaves a bit to the imagination.

Rather than the typical jump-scare schlock, this is a much slower paced game resorting not on forcing players to hide from monsters or anything particularly action-oriented, it focuses instead on creating a horror 'experience.' Perhaps something akin to a 'Gone Home' of horror games, though don't let that description turn you off, or on.\n\nIt was enjoyable, and I dare say the short length does nothing but help in this case, though I found it rather predictable, and even a bit cliched, and the writing wasn't too great, but overall, it was something I has happy about going through, and was happy about playing it.","August 3, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Just the abscence of anything happening keeps you on edge, and the sounds only put fuel on the fire. It may not be a game you play over and over, but it's a game to remember, and it is 999x better than anything Five Nights At Freddy's can do. I give Fingerbones a 9.

Not what I expected. With every note I picked up I had to stare at the screen for upwards of 10 seconds either to look for the next message to type into the keyboard, or to process what the ♥♥♥♥ happened in that bunker. I knew from the reviews that it had no jumpscares, but going into that cellar I still wasn't so sure. Each passing note revealed another deeper, more disturbing layer in this story.  From what I can gather, a divorced scientist with one child became so smart that emotion and morality didn't make sense to him. He built a survival bunker, waiting for the apocalypse, and then it happened. The game doesn't tell you what exactly happened, but it was bad enough to need a bunker. So he and his daughter ran into the bunker, and he must've gotten cabin fever or something because what he did was not normal. Like the apocalypse, the game doesn't tell you exactly what happened, but it tells you enough to know that it was seriously messed up.  Definitely check this out. The graphics are nice, the story is obviously the main focus of the game, and the music and sound effects were perfect.","August 3, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","5"

It's hard to discuss without spoilers, but if you go into it knowing anything about what kind of game it is, it becomes jarringly predictable and trite- the story of a self-important, loony, Nietzche-Wannabe jerk who leaves smug notes about the superiority of his moral philosophy on his way to doing something as unspeakable as it is easy to see coming. The last twist at the end surprised me, but only because I wasn't expecting the game to be THAT short and in any case, what of it? How does the big reveal actually change the story? The game is just walking around reading notes and solving incredibly simple puzzles and honestly is neither fun nor really all that chilling. Drastically overrated, but at least it didn't waste THAT much of my time.","August 24, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are no jumpscares, which is obviously not needed in a horror game when it has a good creepy atomosphere, but I always find jumpscares amusing. The thing that mainly gets me on edge in horror games is when you're being chased , and fortunately that didn't happen either in this game. The story the game tells in the form of notes you find is alright, it's definitely disturbing so that's good, though I still don't understand some things. At any rate, this game was definitely worth my time, it was interesting, had a good horror atmosphere, and it's free, so there's no harm in checking it out.","November 10, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty creepy when you get down to it and you find out what really happened in the abandoned building. This is great because it doesn't rely on jumpscares or creepy noises (though there is one scream). SPOILERS: so at the end you find out that your character is a likes to do things like dismantle bodies for his daughter dies in the basement and he cuts of her fingers (hence the name), and apparently didn't like her since he compares her to his ex-wife which is probably why he let his daughter starve to death and threw the corpse in the woods.

This is a horror game but there are no jumpscares, however the whole time you will be creeped out because of the atmosphere, the ambience (I actually took my headphones off mid-way because I was getting so creeped out, but looking up a video of this and re-living the very end, the ambience just gets so intense and horrifying.), and of course the story as it unfolds to the very end. Personally I think a game like this is what most horror games should be like and should become, instead of the usual jumpscares and scary abomination chasing you throughout the whole game, this game uses constant ambience that builds up over time, the environment, and the horrific story that really has you thinking about a lot of things once you're done. For me personally the story was a little hard to understand at first since I didn't know what to really expect or completely make of the notes I was picking up, so I had to do some research and watch a video to clarify what I thought happened and what the story was, and for the most part I was correct in my assumptions. Interpret the story as you will and it may affect others differently, but nontheless it is a slow, creepy and eventually gruesome story that just hits you at the very end, and will have you thinking about some things. Not for the young, the faint of heart, or the easily triggered.\n\nPros:\n+A quick game to download and play in one sitting, <30 minutes.\n+A unique horror game that does not utilise or even need jumpscares to creep you out\n+A story that will keep you wondering and thinking about subjects even after completing the game\n+Simple, yet beautiful lighting and pixel graphics (if pixel is your thing)\n\nCons:\n-Backtracking\n-VERY slow walking\n","August 7, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The great dark ambient soundtrack compliments the simplistic graphical style - a style that at no point diminishes the narrative weight of the piece. It has to be said though, I'm not sure that it's a formula that could be extended. FIngerbones is a very short game, but if it were any longer, repetition would surely set in.\n\nHonestly, this is miles ahead of all of the "horror" nonsense that is squelched through Greenlight these days, and better yet, it costs not a penny!","November 30, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game combines narrative horror, some really creepy not-so-random sound effects that'll make you shiver, and a small puzzle dynamic (not very hard I assure you) to make this game crawl into the pit of your thinking brain and wrack it for the twenty minutes you give it. The amount of subtle implied gore wasn't too bad, if anything it really gave the game some great atmosphere.

What is this all about? What are these notes and what do they me--wait...is this what I think it is? I'm afraid so. Yes...I am almost certain it is. It's awful...but it was a nice short tale.\n\nThis will be a short review on my part given that there isn't much to say about this. It took me 15 minutes to finish this experience and I say 'experience' instead of game because I think that's what the developer was going for. For us to go through this experience, this mystery. More like reading a book or a short story rather than playing a video game and be entertained. With that said. I can't really talk much about it because if I talk about something that is only 15 minutes long there will be nothing for you to find out once you finish reading this so here's what I can say.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, there is not much to say. As I already told you, this is more of a short story someone decided to tell us on the format of a video game rather than a video game to entertain us. So you can only walk and click on things around you. Finding pieces of information that you will puzzle to figure out what everything is all about.\n\nThe graphics aren't good. But don't take that the wrong way. I say they aren't good as in, the graphics themselves aren't pretty. But it transpires the mood and ambience so it gets the job done. And by saying they aren't 'good' or 'pretty', I am not complaining.\n\nThat moody song sets the right tone throughout the whole 'tale'. The sound adds to the ambience and I think it's just as it's creator wanted.\n\nAs you can see I haven't said that much unlike my more recent and well fledged reviews. I am trying to improve my reviews and by having this one shorter than my most recent one was something done deliberately. This is a very short story so I don't want to spoil anything. And to me the right ambience and mood that you dive yourself into while playing a game, is the most important thing. This game has it. During the whole 15 minutes I loved the feeling I got from this narrative. This dark story that someone decided to tell us. If you are a fan of dark subjects and thrillers and any other mysterious genres of video games, check this out. It's free and it will only take you 15 minutes to finish it so go ahead and try it out.","August 7, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I thought it was time well spent; albeit a short amount. That said, once you play it a single time, that's all it takes to get the whole experience. No replay value here.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Ambiance/Atmosphere: Very good atmosphere lends a dark tone to the place, set against the glowing, radiant light from the windows. Nicely done. The added touch of music, and girlish cries adds authentication to the experience, making it that much more twisted a depiction.\n\n+ Story: The underlying story is dark, and really sits well with the ambiance/atmosphere of the place. Although it is a seemingly shallow story, it leaves a lot of questions to the gamer about how/why things went the way they did for the protagonist, and what coerced him to become the man he ended up as.\n\n\n=======\nDo I recommend?\nYes.\n\nIt's a fairly quick, disturbing play through, sure to give any horror fan a quick-fix of what they crave.\nNicely done~ :)\n\n(Uninstalled).","August 31, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player collates the ramblings of a divorced, delusional and deppressed survivalist in notes found as they explore the singular location. As the player progresses they must return to a fixed point to progress, giving the feeling of returnig to the ominously lit surface for a gulp of stale air before delving deeper into the disturbing depths and history of the place. Audio reinforces said historry with chilling inmediacy and the simple geometry and lattice-like, almost fractal pixelated textures keep the imagination engaged, so that the narrative feels more like a memory: a cunning trick given the perspective shift present at the climax.\n\nA simple, yet succesful experiment in interactive narrative that, with little time invesment required and no cost, is very easy to recommend.

However, I don't feel as though the story is up to the standard of the developers later games. The narrative of the came is centered the caricature of a (secular?) man who fantasized about being the last man on earth who could be free to do whatever he wants, and his sick interactions with his daughter. Written from the perspective of someone who obviously disagrees with the type of person the father is, he's winds up being nothing more than a one  dimensional monster. Which is a shame because if his fall was more nuanced and we could find ourselves sympathizing with him, then it would make the end result all the more disturbing.

While yes it did have its grounds in psychological disturbia, it was not in any way a horror game. The only time I felt genuinely scared was when I entered the cellar for the first time, but that fear was soon sated as i read the last note on the table and the game ended.\n\nMy first major criticism is a lack of feedback from the password input keyboard.\n\nI entered Katie about 15 times with out any knowledge that it unlocked anything, the keyboard did not change its light, did not ding, ping, boop or bop. Without any feed back as if i was doing anything wrong or right, i was forced to look up a guide and find out I was doing it right, i just was in no way being told.\n\nAlso onto the theme of the game.\n\nI am critical of games that try to be edgy and fight the whole 'man or animal' kind of arguement in regards to pop culture and how society has melded us.\n\nBut I honestly thought he was going to force his daughter to procreate with him.\n\nI don't understand where her fingerbones became a 'anti religious artifact' and how he states "He can finally fufill his animalistic instincs" when his animalistic instinct is to reproduce, and killing ones offspring goes against that instinct. And it wasn't shocking in any way. I didnt feel that the ending justified any of the build up. It was more of a chore to go back and forth between the keyboard and the rooms to input answers to heavy handed riddles.\n\nhonestly the new password was nny with a letter missing. A little too obvious.\n\nI mean obviously the guy who wrote the password was a man of science for 20 years why would he make such a simple password? and then leave that ♥♥♥♥ lying around. It doesn't make any sense.\n\nin all i'd give the game a 3/5","October 11, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't find it that disturbing; I was anticipating a lot more from the build-up. The story is a series of notes that paint a picture that depending on your imagination, may lead you to be terrified or just kinda, meh. Sadly, I took the later. So while the idea is a bit haunting, as well as the execution, I would have liked a little more story and for that reason, I can't really recommend it.\n\nHOWEVER. It is free and it's certainly a step in the right direction for horror games. More psychological thriller than gore, which is fantastic.

I decided to play this game because i am a writer and thought i might try getting into more horror games for the sake of one of my current writing projects (which is horror-based). Fingerbones, i'm happy to say didn't dissapoint.\n\nWhile the game is short and probably meant to be completed in 10 minutes or so, i spent an hour eating up the scenery. While basic and somewhat reminicent of Minecraft, the graphics formed a very good atmosphere. It's dark and mysterious and somewhat run down. The lighting in the rooms was also brilliant. The sunset you see as soon as you start the game up is GORGEOUS and i haven't seen many horror games that greet you with something as simple yet beautiful as a sunset. So that was a nice change... The gameplay over all is pretty mucha  walking simulator (or in this case, a back-tracking simulator) as you'll be going back and fourth to a small computer (well, technically just a keyboard) to type in code words to advance in the game. And by advance, i mean more just going into other rooms... Granted, as a writer i understand why some games are made and this developer was trying their hand at creating a narrative driven game, which i totally don't mind. I love games with story. For a first attempt at a narrative-driven game i wasn't really dissapointed. From a writer's perspective i noticed some flubs here and there but there is a lot worse fiction out there and the writing here fit the atmoshpere. The game itself also has a few tropes associtated with a first attempt to have a narrative-driven game (such as only using notes or text to convey the story, waking up in a mysterious abandoned location, ect), but i didn't mind that much because it was the dev's first try and I came for the horror elements of the story.\n\nThe character the player takes on is a scientist who has witnessed what he believes is the end of humanity and he has woken up in a bunker and through scattered notes do we the player find out more about the story. The notes are all we get in terms of story so they're all we have to go on to get an idea of the setting and the character we're playing as. Through the notes we find out he has a daughter who he had custody of when everything came crashing down and i won't spoil what happens from there... This character we play as is interesting, from both a scientific and writing perspective, it's not a character we see very often. He is deeply involved in science and is devoted to his work, he can admit that maybe having a child wasn't the best decision in his life and seems geuniely unsure of how to take care of his daughter during this disaster. We usually see a character like this as a villian rather than a main character, so that's a nice change. We're delving into the thought process and mental state of someone who only knows of science and can't really think outside of that structure.\n\nOverall, this game is supposed to be surreal horror in it's narative. Honestly, i like it :) It's my kind of horror, like something you'd see in a foreign horror film. American horror films try to scare you with an antagonist or a monster, but foreign horror films (like ones from Asia) try to get you invested in the atmosphere and the goal isn't always trying to scare you, but more to get you into the story and narrative. The game (as short as it is) kept me thinking the whole way through and though it's not scary in the typical sence (you won't be seeing any Five Nights at Freddy's style jumpscares here), it got me to care and feel somewhat afraid for this scientist and his daughter. It was more the atmosphere that scared you, the sound of a girl crying in the distance, the ambient humming of a generator and a beep from a keyboard, finding the titular fingerbones hidden away...\n\nAs a lover of games with story, the only bad thing i have to say about the game is that it does become more of a back-tracking simulator very fast. You're constantly going back to the keyboard on the first floor to type in code words to advance and go to different locations. But the game was always intended to be about narrative and completed in one sitting, so i could easily let this slide.\n\nIn conclusion this was a short little narrative driven horror game which was FREE to play. I'm happy to say i really like it despite some of it's flaws and i'd be happy to see a fuller version of the story (maybe with a bigger map to play with). Good job dev, i give Fingerbones 4 fingerbones out of 5! AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT FREE!","September 9, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kissera/recommended/391270/","Kissera","Vivian James","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kissera/","423 products in account","The game was genuinely creepy and I'd dare say disturbing, it achieved actual psychological horror using the medium of video games in a way that no other game does it quite right.  You're apprehensive, you can hear something that sounds like a ghoul or a wraith, otherworldly.  It shocks your senses in the right way, and it never betrays you with a cheap RAHHH jump scare, it keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering if and when something terrible might happen.\n\nSomething terrible does happen, but it's based on really good use of video game mechanics, and not on crappy fluff where you get assaulted with Alma from F.E.A.R. or Kayako Saeki from The Grudge.  Instead, this game will freak you out in the right ways.  The only thing I might criticize is that the game's writing is a little too revealing at the beginning.  The game could pull back from a few of the plot reveals so early on (as I was able to easily see what was hiding), but I suppose at the same time, it leaves you with the apprehension of what's to come, so maybe it's not such a bad thing.\n\nIn the end the monster is revealed, but if you hadn't spotted it already, you'll wonder why you hadn't.","November 21, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Going up the stairs after going down is very frustrating, you move at a snails pace, I thought maybe this was a decision but I'm leaning more towards it's something in the character controller as it gives that "pushing through" feeling that box colliders in Unity will often give if the controller isn't accounting for something.  Maybe not casting enough rays or something, allowing the character's collider to move into the surfaces temporarily and move through like in "sludge"\n\n2.  The sound of "errrrt" when you enter a correct password is initially... confusing.  This seems like the noise it should make when you incorrectly enter something, as incorrectly entering something yields no noise.\n\n3. I very much enjoyed the soundtrack and how it was done by having tones placed throughout the environment as actual audio emitters, allowing you to control the soundtrack in a sense.  However I noticed that some of these samples gave a clicking/popping sound when repeating.  That's a sign of the sample not being perfectly seamless or not restarting at the proper point (if it is)\n\nIt could be great, but the clicking noise to me was very grating from the soundtrack.  The sound of the generator was also a bit grating and too loud in my opinion.  Moving slowly by it felt painful wearing headphones.  I am leaning both ways on this one.  For someone who is into this style of game I'd tell them to play through it as it gives insight into a few great things to do in this genre, but there's also a few things that very much bothered me.  For someone new to the genre I would definitely not recommend this, as I feel it could leave a sour taste in their mouth.  Kairo seemed to have a similar atmosphere but was MUCH better in its execution.","August 16, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You know which scene.\n\nYou begin with the first sheet of personal documentation: a run-of-the-mill rambling of an "enlightened" nutjob jotted down on a piece of paper strewn about a desk littered with sharp tools. Harmless enough at first. Despite the disturbing squirms of anxiety that you get from the ambience and atmosphere in the dank room, you continue exploring. And then you progress through the story, read more diary notes, and string them all together. A terrifying image begins taking shape. "What the f*ck is wrong with this sh*tbag?!" you ask. You can kind of make out what this is all ultimately about. The protagonist whom shoes you are in has most probably done and justified something very evil. The disturbing noises that made your skin crawl is now accompanied by feelings of anger. All the pleas of mercy, cries of pain, and howls of fear you'd heard before can no more stop you from unraveling this story. Your curiosity intensifies. You want to know. You want to see.\n\nAnd then you went down the cellar.\n\nYou begin to doubt your own bravado.\n\nYou let go of your mouse for a bit, and lean back on your seat.

A really interestingly made piece of art that makes you think about the standards of society and makes you re-evaluate your morals. The graphics and music are really immersive, and the puzzles are not too hard to solve(although the second one did give me a little bit of head pain).\nAnd the great parts stop mostly there. As for the negatives, they game is obviously relatively short, it doesn't have any save points, achievements and replayability. The "horror" element is only present at the end of the game. Also, a sprint button would have been helpfull. Although I see how walking around slowly adds to the athmosphere of the game, there were times when I finally figured out what to do, and I wanted to go faster to do it... needless to say, it's breaking the immersion as you slowly limp to the place you want to go. Finally the game is free, and for that I think it's a worth pickup for a small, half an hour playthrough. I did make a small let's play video, showing my impression/reaction to the game: https://youtu.be/Af6iqaKvptc .

The 'pixelated' graphics design meshed well with the theme, so did the scary music and sound effects. The ambience sent shivers down my spine while my horror grew as I began to imagine what had been done as I followed the trail of notes. Fingerbones is a very good, short atmospheric horror game and I enjoyed playing it very much (though I've got to admit that the last password was a PIA). The only downside, was continuously running up and down to type passwords (which is a nicer approach than finding keys etc.) and investigate rooms.\n\nOverall a very proper (psychological) horror experience!\n\n7/10 - recommended.","August 5, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is about the story of a family that lived in a bunker during the apocolapse. Your objective: find clues to peice together the mystery. The game has great atmoshpere and can make you scared at times, which it probably will, as it did to me. However, your character moves very slow and the game requires lots of backtracking to complete. I do not recommend this game to impatient players, but for everyone else, I strongly recommend this game.\n\nSide note: This is the kind of game that you only play once, as it does not have much, if any, replayability.

It challenges the player and makes them excersise their keeness of mind, making the player spot subtle cues in the notes placed in the enviroment. These clues help the player procceed forward in the game, making this an experience one will want to keep going through without pause.

I don't want to spoiler anything, but if you are a very sensible person, maybe this is not the game for you.\nAnd I don't mean there are gory or terrifying jumpscares, but the story itself can be very disturbing.\nThe horror element is build only on the psychological level, and the only 'true' scares in Fingerbones are some sounds.\n\nThis kind of horror build-up is what I truly like in Fingerbones, since there are very few games that have managed to do that so well.\nThe anxiety is created as you read the notes and discover the terrible story of the protagonist and the place where you are, and the horror (or disgust) as you realize what has appened.\n\nBut, in my opinion, this is also the main flaw of this game: the focus on the story make it a bit sterile.\nThere is the story, and nothing else, and the plot itself is not completely explored as it deserves.\n\nIn the end, Fingerbones is not a bad game, and in many ways it succeeded where others have failed, but, it leaves the feeling that there is something missing, and the story could have been explained and expanded better\n","August 19, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I decided to play this game because i am a writer and thought i might try getting into more horror games for the sake of one of my current writing projects (which is horror-based). Fingerbones, i'm happy to say didn't dissapoint.\n\nWhile the game is short and probably meant to be completed in 10 minutes or so, i spent an hour eating up the scenery. While basic and somewhat reminicent of Minecraft, the graphics formed a very good atmosphere. It's dark and mysterious and somewhat run down. The lighting in the rooms was also brilliant. The sunset you see as soon as you start the game up is GORGEOUS and i haven't seen many horror games that greet you with something as simple yet beautiful as a sunset. So that was a nice change... The gameplay over all is pretty mucha  walking simulator (or in this case, a back-tracking simulator) as you'll be going back and fourth to a small computer (well, technically just a keyboard) to type in code words to advance in the game. And by advance, i mean more just going into other rooms... Granted, as a writer i understand why some games are made and this developer was trying their hand at creating a narrative driven game, which i totally don't mind. I love games with story. For a first attempt at a narrative-driven game i wasn't really dissapointed. From a writer's perspective i noticed some flubs here and there but there is a lot worse fiction out there and the writing here fit the atmoshpere. The game itself also has a few tropes associtated with a first attempt to have a narrative-driven game (such as only using notes or text to convey the story, waking up in a mysterious abandoned location, ect), but i didn't mind that much because it was the dev's first try and I came for the horror elements of the story.\n\nThe character the player takes on is a scientist who has witnessed what he believes is the end of humanity and he has woken up in a bunker and through scattered notes do we the player find out more about the story. The notes are all we get in terms of story so they're all we have to go on to get an idea of the setting and the character we're playing as. Through the notes we find out he has a daughter who he had custody of when everything came crashing down and i won't spoil what happens from there... This character we play as is interesting, from both a scientific and writing perspective, it's not a character we see very often. He is deeply involved in science and is devoted to his work, he can admit that maybe having a child wasn't the best decision in his life and seems geuniely unsure of how to take care of his daughter during this disaster. We usually see a character like this as a villian rather than a main character, so that's a nice change. We're delving into the thought process and mental state of someone who only knows of science and can't really think outside of that structure.\n\nOverall, this game is supposed to be surreal horror in it's narative. Honestly, i like it :) It's my kind of horror, like something you'd see in a foreign horror film. American horror films try to scare you with an antagonist or a monster, but foreign horror films (like ones from Asia) try to get you invested in the atmosphere and the goal isn't always trying to scare you, but more to get you into the story and narrative. The game (as short as it is) kept me thinking the whole way through and though it's not scary in the typical sence (you won't be seeing any Five Nights at Freddy's style jumpscares here), it got me to care and feel somewhat afraid for this scientist and his daughter. It was more the atmosphere that scared you, the sound of a girl crying in the distance, the ambient humming of a generator and a beep from a keyboard, finding the titular fingerbones hidden away...\n\nAs a lover of games with story, the only bad thing i have to say about the game is that it does become more of a back-tracking simulator very fast. You're constantly going back to the keyboard on the first floor to type in code words to advance and go to different locations. But the game was always intended to be about narrative and completed in one sitting, so i could easily let this slide.\n\nIn conclusion this was a short little narrative driven horror game which was FREE to play. I'm happy to say i really like it despite some of it's flaws and i'd be happy to see a fuller version of the story (maybe with a bigger map to play with). Good job dev, i give Fingerbones 4 fingerbones out of 5! AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT FREE!","September 9, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than shock you into fear, it shocks you into deep thought.\n\nI will not put spoilers here of what occurs, for anyone who wants to play, but I will explain what exactly this game is, rather than "terrifying".\nI myself personally enjoyed this game. I was very curious to figure out what all the hype was, what the horrifying thing was in the story...What the truth reveals, truly is a horrifying happening.\nHowever, what this story truly is about...is human nature.\n\nThis story, should you read all the notes and pay attention to everything written, depicts an apocalyptic setting, where the father (you) and his daughter are the only survivors, with little food left. The father is horribly cold and distant, feeling no real affection for the daughter. As you read more and more of the notes, you realize just how deep this story is. It's not about the survival of this two-person family. It's not about their possible deaths. It's not even about the awful, inhumane things the father does...It's about the psychology behind it, the philosophy behind it. It's religious, anti-religious, philosophical, anti-philosophical, and all around HAUNTING; the music furthers this. You'll understand when you play it.\n\nEven if I gave all of the spoilers, you need to play this game to truly experience the darkness of a human being's existence..and that's what this is all about: What we as human beings can be capable of, physically and mentally; the terrible things we could do to ourselves or to others...all in all, this game and its notes make you question your own existence, the existence of human beings, and the mystery that is human nature and psychology.","December 29, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I thought it was time well spent; albeit a short amount. That said, once you play it a single time, that's all it takes to get the whole experience. No replay value here.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Ambiance/Atmosphere: Very good atmosphere lends a dark tone to the place, set against the glowing, radiant light from the windows. Nicely done. The added touch of music, and girlish cries adds authentication to the experience, making it that much more twisted a depiction.\n\n+ Story: The underlying story is dark, and really sits well with the ambiance/atmosphere of the place. Although it is a seemingly shallow story, it leaves a lot of questions to the gamer about how/why things went the way they did for the protagonist, and what coerced him to become the man he ended up as.\n\n\n=======\nDo I recommend?\nYes.\n\nIt's a fairly quick, disturbing play through, sure to give any horror fan a quick-fix of what they crave.\nNicely done~ :)\n\n(Uninstalled).","August 31, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
