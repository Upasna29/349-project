"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/331510/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Amphora isn’t quite what I expected when I finished the first couple of levels. Not that that’s a bad thing, on the contrary, but its narrative consists of solving separate puzzles that tie everything together. So the story is told by showing you bits and pieces of the bigger story but it never relies on using audio, or text. It’s all up to you how you want to interpret the story, even if some of it is crystal clear.\n\nBehind the gorgeous graphics lies a game that reminded me a bit of WarioWare Inc. The gameplay consists of rotating and connecting items in a specific way in order to get the results you need. Never are you given an objective. Again, there are times when you’ll know exactly what to do, and other times it will take you several minutes before you realize exactly what the game’s asking from you. Discovering how to solve these ‘harder’ puzzles gives you a sense of accomplishment, which is good, but in a way it’s also kind of bad. Not letting the players know what’s expected from them might annoy or frustrate people who aren’t as experienced with playing (puzzle) games as others might be and I’m not afraid to admit that there were times where I became annoyed because the objectives weren’t entirely clear. It also felt a bit like it was a way to artificially lengthen the story, which is already quite short at about 2-3 hours of playtime (I didn’t find this a problem personally, but I know some people might appreciate a game (a little) less because of it). In any case, a small on-screen hint would suffice and help players in need and I think it could easily be implemented by the developer. But that’s up to them, of course, and it’s only a small flaw/complaint from my side.\nAs I said the game plays a bit like WarioWare Inc. That’s because the puzzles feel like mini-games, minus the time limit. You usually have to interact with the scenery and objects to solve a puzzle, so in one level you might have to guide fireworks into the air by positioning tables, while in another one you have to pull a ship to the shore using a block of ice and a specific tool (just don’t ask me what it’s called). It’s all pretty fun. That is, until you hit a level where you’re having a hard time using the physics to your advantage. There was one level where it was perfectly clear what I had to do (save a girl from drowning) and yet, because of the physics, it became a pain in the ♥♥♥ to accomplish. The game could be a little more forgiving in this department. I also reached a point in the game - just a few levels later - where the game just infinitely rotated every object I picked up. There was no way to finish the level so I had to restart the game (after which the problem was solved). I might be nitpicking here, but a game this small shouldn’t have too many bugs or glitches I think.\nNow, it seems I didn’t enjoy it because so far pretty much all I’ve been doing is complaining, but trust me, I really do like the game. The puzzles usually make sense and it’s generally fun to complete a level. And I was intrigued by the way it was telling me its story. It’s certainly different than many other games, and I mean that in a good way. It’s unique and beautiful and people should take note, which brings me to the following: the graphics.\n\nAnd God, these graphics are absolutely gorgeous. It has an Arabian, dreamy, atmosphere where everything in the foreground is silhouetted with only a few parts here and there that are shown as what looks like stained glass. It’s an amazing effect and it looks just beautiful in motion. The background is shown in full color, with gradients and it makes the whole game look perfect. Amazing work was done here, the developers can be really proud of this aspect.\nThe animations could use a little work. Again, this is also partly thanks to the physics (the level with the rabbits is a good example here), and it’s nothing distracting but definitely noticeable.\nThe voice acting consists of little sound bites that are simple but get the job done and the music is subtle but relaxing, and feels very natural in a way that you don’t really notice it while playing.\n\nAmphora is a game that puzzle fans will absolutely love, thanks to the lovely visuals, but even frequent, senior puzzlers might find a couple of the game’s puzzles hard to solve. This is not because the puzzles themselves are hard, because they aren’t, but because the game lacks direction and too often you’re left wondering what to do. If you can look past that then there’s a charming game to be found here. In that case this game is an absolute must. In all other cases I would still recommend it, but some of you might want to wait for a sale. Because it’s pretty good, but nothing revolutionary.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]","November 12, 2014","true","4.8"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","55","57","0","4"

Amphora is not your standard point and click adventure / puzzle. It tells the story in a very interesting way - a series of mini games / puzzles. Each scene can be looked at as on its own, or as a part of a bigger story, that is slowly revealed in front of the eyes of the player. A story of a little girl ... growing up... falling in love ... aaand I'll stop spoiling ;)\nThe game doesn't hold your hand or teaches you how to play - it starts with a couple of simple scenes, where you're left alone to figure out, what actually the goal is, what you can and can't do. You are playing some kind of invisible entity, that's watching over this girl as she grows up, able to move stuff around within the reaching distance of the magical amphora. I guess the game does help you a little bit, by telling you how you can rotate the objects you "hold" in your ghostly hand, but that's about it. When a new puzzle / scene is presented to you, you need to observe, discover what part of the story this can be, figure out what needs to happen and make it happen. Sounds simpler, that it is, and I guess that could be somewhat irritating for people new to the puzzle adventure genre, but I felt right at home. Took me some time to get used to the mechanics and understanding, what exactly the mechanics are, but I guess that's just part of the puzzle.\nHere is what happens : You start the game and dive into the beautiful world of this "1001 nights-themed" shadow theater, you listen to the amazing music and your heart opens, the game touches your heart with it's story, and a strong bond occurs - you're in love with the game. Can only recommend the experience!\nTL:DR you can experience the start of the adventure with me, in my overview video :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=340962204\n","November 12, 2014","true","5.5"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

The stained glass, art style and hauntingly, beautiful music are the strength of the game, but sadly are not supported well enough by the gameplay. While the mechanics are interesting, the puzzles never really challenge the player, and feel like they were the last thing on the developers mind. I really enjoyed my time in the world of Amphora, and give it 7 out of 10.\n\nDesigned by Moondrop, a two person Norwegian developer, Amphora is a physics puzzle game, with a strong narrative. The main story of Amphora follows a girl as she grows from a baby to a young woman, meets a partner, and then struggles through the challenges of war. The story is beautifully portrayed through the speechless and text-less imagery of the game, with perfectly paced and balanced music, supporting it every step of the way.\n\nMoondrop aimed to portray their tale through a shadow theatre style, and with the striking colour schemes used, have made an outstanding visual experience. The music used through this touching tale is a cross culture mix and is a pleasure to listen to.\n\nThe main puzzle mechanics of Amphora are simple. The player is able to move objects within a certain area, and utilise various chains for hanging objects, pushing and pulling objects and for adding weight to lever systems. These base mechanics all work in well with the general physics of the game world, but sadly I found the puzzles all too often lacked depth.\n\nIn fact, I got so deep into my puzzle solving mind frame, that I started to smash through levels too quickly and missed large chunks of story all together. Don't get me wrong the puzzle mechanics are clever, but the developers missed opportunities to overlay multiple mechanics or really utilise the physics system.\n\nI recommend taking your time with this game. Stop at the start of each level and soak up the ambience and think about what the scene is saying to you, before diving in and solving the puzzle. I used this approach on my second play through and found it to be far more rewarding. The playtime of this title may be a little short for some gamers, at only a touch over an hour, but after completing this game I wasn't disappointed.\n\nFor my full review and other delicious content see Glitch[glitchnews.com.au]","November 17, 2014","true","3.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It's mostly physics based puzzle solving, where you play as an entity that's going through an adventure in other peoples adventures, which I find it new and an awesome way to tell a story. Keep in mind that there's no text or voice in the game that will tell you the story. Think Journey.\n\nYou can look at the trailer and see how nice and the graphics and art are. They're warm and fuzzy. I also love how they made the entity you play as kind of look like a hand, which really adds charm when solving puzzles. Also, it's sometimes silly and funny with some of the interactions you can play with, just randomly fooling around.\n\nThe puzzle are really simple and mostly straight forward, just use the tools that you have in order to solve the complications that the characters are facing, and as an entity where you can create connections, you'll unlock different and stronger type of connections as you progress, to help you finish later levels, so this kept the puzzle solving interesting and with low redundancy. Although one could argue that the mix of story and gameplay alone keeps the game interesting on its own.\n\nThe whole game is charming, with how your journey is helping other people's journey in their best and worst times, through puzzle solving, and you do it in a way that actually interacts with the progression of the story, as mentioned above, and it would be great if more puzzle games, or games in general, made it so you interact with the story through gameplay like this game, because it's refreshing and barely any game use this technique. But yea, the game is great to look at, heartwarming to experience, and fun to play-through.\n\nI'd take the game to a nice Shawarma restaurant and buy them a Shawarma.

You learn about the game, its story and its mechanics by simply exploring the lovely scene in front of you.

One of the hardest things about it is the lack of words and/or hints for some of the puzzles - it's difficult to understand the goal for some of the levels. The story it tells through the puzzles is sweet, if generic and never all that deep. Occasionally physics is a little broken (mending a flag by adding chains to it and throwing it around until it works? Seriously?) and a few levels are unnecessarily difficult in that you must draw a perfectly straight line of very long length or you have to start over. The music does a really nice job of setting the tone and geographic area.

You will be playing the part of a mist/smoke that has a sphere of influence. Inside this sphere you will be able to influence objects in many different ways.\n\nGraphically we are talking about a very unique and pleasing looking game. Everything is either in silhouette or in stain glass. The people and the objects follow that decor, and I have to say that it looks sharp. As stated before you are going to be going through a tale of a girl as she grows so you will have plenty of different levels, with all different looking mechanics to try to navigate through.\n\nThere is no voice acting, but that's not the point of the game, this game is set to teach you through action. There is, however, a very soothing soundtrack that will follow you throughout your gaming that keeps you calm even when there are frustrating parts to the game.\n\nThe controls are pretty straight forward and they all revolve around your mouse. You will be utilizing both mouse buttons to perform actions, and depending on what you are trying to do you will find many different potential solutions, hopefully one of them will get you through the level.\n\nSo this was one of those games that I heard about through another game's advertising, and I thought, man that looks like a unique game. So I had to try it, and when I did I sailed through about 30% of the game without even breaking a sweat, and then I hit a wall, a big one. Unfortunately this is one of those games that basically gives you the keys to the kingdom and then fades into the background, which is great because you have free reign to try several different things within your sphere of influence, but it did grate on me that there wasn't going to be a very intuitive way of completing the stage, or so I thought. I did break down and watch a YouTube video and had an immediate face palm moment. So I think I can safely tell you that there is definitely some challenging levels that will make you think outside the box, but not outside the sphere of influence ;)\n\nThis is definitely a game for those who are more interested in unique puzzles, and enjoys the soft flowing melodies. Throughout my playing of this game for reviewing purposes I have to say that even when I hit an obstacle the overall feel relaxed me, and with that I would like to give this game an 8.3 out of 10.","January 20, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Какой ритм, какой звук, какая атмосфера! И эта музыка не упакована в непонятные форматы, а спокойненько лежит себе в папке с игрой…\nТак, стоп. Я же пишу отзыв об игре, а не о саундтреке.  Действительно, в этой игре сразу бросаются в уши и глаза две вещи: музыка и графика. Всё это очень атмосферно и сочно наполняет игру от начала до конца. Но к сожалению, промежуток между началом  и концом в Амфоре не так уж и велик, уровни проходятся быстрее, чем длятся их загрузки, а уровней не особо много (за 5 часов я прошла игру раз 10, при этом получив все достижения) . Сначала трудно сообразить, что делать в тот или иной момент, но затем понимаешь всю суть, и уровни начинают завершаться один за другим.\nЯ бы сказала, что 300 рублей это не стоит, но всё же рекомендую игру. Почему? В ней можно неплохо повеселиться, прицепляя пугало к двум людям и кидаясь черепахами. Ну а если серьёзно, то Амфора создаёт особенное сказочное настроение, которое пойдёт на пользу любым творческим людям и, возможно, вдохновит на парочку шедевров. Кого-то игра заставит немного поломать голову, у кого-то вызовет улыбку. На распродаже, если таковая будет, можно брать без сомнений.\nВывод:  Цену на игру следовало бы назначить в два раза меньше, вам решать, согласиться на её приобретение или же взять что-то аналогичное. Хотя подобный интересный квест с чудесной начинкой вы вряд ли найдёте.\n\nOh yeah, once again, once again I need to listen to this masterpiece soundtrack at the beginning of the game. What the rhythm, what the sound, what the atmosphere! And this music wasn't packed in some unknown format, it is just placed in the folder of the game…\nUm, stop. I'm writing mention about the game, not the soundtrack… Indeed, there are two things in this game that catches the eye and the ear – music and graphics. They fills the game with brightness from the beginning to the end. But unfortunately, the interim between them isn't big, levels can be passed faster than their loadings, and the number of levels isn't big at all (for 5 hours I passed the game about 10 times and get all achievements). For the first time it's difficult to grasp what to do in some moment, but then you understand the whole point, and levels end one by one.\nI would have said, the game doesn't justify the cost, but I still recommend it. Why? You can have fun hitching the scarecrow to people and throwing turtles. More seriously, Amphora creates the special fabulous mood which can benefit creative people and, perhaps, inspire them for some masterpieces. The game can make you puzzling over or bring a smile. You can buy it on sale without doubts.\nTo sum up,  the price of this game should be several times smaller. Well, it's your decision to buy this game or something else. It's hard to find similar interesting quest with wonderful filling, though.\n","May 26","true","5.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Just another puzzle game where the logic is easy, but the physics is just too damn annoying and your sollutions ends up being highly inelegant.","July 2, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's a bit short, and it left me wanting for more. I'll probably play it again to try and get all the achievements. I tried playing it with the Steam Controller and it felt clunky, so I recommend sticking to mouse / keyboard if possible.","February 12","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the real problem is the gameplay. It's a catastrophee. Even when you know what to do, it's often difficult to do it. It's a true deception for me.","February 18","false","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I updated everything, changed some apps, etc to my laptop and yet it still wouldn’t load. Talking with steam support seemed helpful but what they suggested didn’t fix the issue either. Too make it worse my computer then decided the game was a virus, locked it down, and made the choice to delete the whole game file! The only thing i can say is to make sure your laptop or desktop has the abilities to play all games, and that your computer can support the games you want to play because now I'm out $13.99. Seems like a great game though!","January 16, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","18","2","11","2","0"

I didnt find logic in a single place ... Also, physics is strange, chains break with small objects or they hold large ones, throwing objects is just unpredictable, etc. + Tutorial gave no information at all, you need to randomly interact with things to uncover what may happen. + Some levels are just irrelevant, want me to kill a girl which I helped and watched her grow? NO PROBLEM! OBVIOUS THING!\n\nThough idea is nice, I feel like someone was high when designing levels and quests and "physics".\n\nBtw, sometimes you have to pick up objects twice in order to rotate them.","November 15, 2014","false","7.1"," 10 of 32 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","10","32","0","0"

It's a series of levels that are beautiful beyond words, each with a different puzzle to solve. There are glitches that made me have to exit the game and go back in to fix the level, but I didn't have to do that more than twice. The mechanics of the game are easy to understand and as the stages change, you understand what you have to do differently in order to solve the puzzle. The story is vague at first, and I was unsure of what I was seeing from stage to stage, but it slowly comes together as you complete more levels. The music is just as lovely as the stained glass scenery.\n\nI would pick this game up when it's on sale, because it's only a 2-3 hour game with very little replayability. Also, having a narrator to strengthen the story would have helped the player understand what was happening and made a better emotional connection to the game's storyline. Overall, a good indie game.","November 26, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
