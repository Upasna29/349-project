This is not a pleasant red pill to swallow. Just stay outside of the Rabbit Hole to Hell where it's safe and warm and fuzzy.\n\nI'm not even going to get into detail on the points of this game that have been absolutely beaten to death, such as a lack of character import, changing [wrecking] of classes, and whatever other terrible ideas were implemented here. Remember that whole "If it ain't broke don't fix it" thing? Can't imagine what happened there.\n\nI've played this game two times. Over the course of that period I have probably reloaded this game well over 10 times. This thing seems to enjoy crashing to desktop more than anything I've ever played. Move to the next area? Crash. Alt tab out? Crash. Start a cutscene? Crash. Friend joins you in multiplayer? Crash. My system is MORE than enough to handle this game. None of my files are corrupt. Neither are my friend's. We've both suffered endless crashes while trying to attempt to use this steaming pile of co-op. Numerous instances of our data being lost because it refused to save before we loaded the next area.... or tried, at least, because loading means playing Russian Roulette.\n\nI don't know what inspired Neocore to treat their CUSTOMERS as UNPAID BUG TESTERS, but this is not acceptable. Not at all. The 10 hours I've spent in this game is probably 7 hours of gameplay and 3 hours of just trying to recover from the blasted crashing. The loading screens are just as lengthy as the last game, but at least you don't have to worry about losing all data up to the point you click to move to the next room.\n\nI've never gotten so fed up with a game that I had to just up and quit playing half way through. The frustration of the bugs is beyond me. I hear many people say "OH well it's always super buggy at release so just wait a few months for them to fix it."\n\nThat's not a reasonable expectation.\nNot going to happen.","October 12, 2015","false","10.4"," 224 of 238 people (94%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","94","224","238","20","4"

Scenarios are not working. No Neverending Story. Unless you play Multiplayer, but the itemlvl will be 1 again even if you play with your lvl 30 character. 6 new classes which most of them are weak and one being to strong. Skill tree has been cut down which leaves you with 3 skills max ( there are more but most of them are useless ). Character import copys your name and glory points but nothing more. You will be rewarded with an epic ring that you can throw away after the first 10 mins.\n\nOverall I wouldnt recommend buying it in its current state. Its not very rewarding in terms of item drops and replayability.

Say goodbye to the ability to carry both a ranged weapon and a Melee weapon (I'm playing through as the Bounty Hunter class). The difficulty due to poor weapon stats is horrendous, and by this I mean if your weapon does around 250 per hit you will encounter monsters that have health ranging from 2500 - 20000. 10 or less enemies are fine but anymore, as I was playing a ranged character, means you soon get swarmed/surrounded leading to certain death due to your own incredible low health, you get trapped and can't move at all.\n\nThe skill tree's have also been vastly simplified and no-longer offer anywhere near as much choice as they did previously. Gameplay is a little stutttery (i5 3570k,GTX Titan,32 GB ddr3 1600mhz), not in combat, but just walking around the level....loading issues maybe ? Also fighting enemies on stairs produces SQUARE poison mists on the outside edge of the animation.\n\nI would save your money and instead look at The Final Cut and hope that everything is put back to how it should be in that version.","November 9, 2015","false","4.8"," 103 of 118 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","103","118","2","5"

You can't import your character as expected because of the entirely reworked skill tree and class system. The skill trees have been significantly dumbed down, many abilities are gone, auras are pointless, and each class now only has one combat style with no more switching between ranged and melee combat. Level cap reduced down to 30, Katarina's is 25. No starting on veteran mode with an imported character.\n\nThe game has its fair share of bugs too. The controller profile does not allow you to access all parts of the character creation panel, nor can it access the bonuses in the skill tree when leveling up. I've also encountered a game-breaking bug preventing progress in Valley of Frost due to my character constantly falling through the floor.\n\nBugs aside, this could be a decent ARPG title for ~$12, but it's not a very good Van Helsing sequel.\n\nedit: Latest patch has addressed the falling through the map glitch. I'm not sure if the controller scheme issues have been fixed since I progressed through the game with mouse and keyboard instead. The game is less than 10 hours long. Glory points seem to be broken, so there is literally no point to importing a character at all, since those were the only things that would carry over. Multiple achievements are still broken, like reaching level 30 with a certain class, hitting an enemy over 1K damage, being hit for 1K damage, etc. There is a tower defense quest that still cannot be turned in. Even if Neocore fixes all these bugs, it still remains a really poor finale to what was once a great series.","May 25, 2015","false","13.5"," 81 of 97 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","81","97","3","0"

As if they decided that their second installation had too much content, and decided to tear it out by spine. Incredible Bugventures Of Glitch Helsing is an incredibly sad attempt at that of a sequel. Usually you expect either, more by terms of general content or incredibly unique features added. Or, what's that? Perhaps even thoroughly more refined concepts?\n\nDon't come knocking on this door if you want a solid, playable and satisfying experience. Bugventure is hardly a game at this point, just a beautiful test of true endurance. However the second installation is miles beyond what three is, it actually seems like this game was released before the second. If you want an idea on how entirely nonsense the class system is compared to the first, Constructor and Plog is literally just a Engineer class from the second cleaved in twain. Seriously though, by means of depth Glitch Helsing 3 is that of a kiddie pool, compared to 2 which is like that of a ♥♥♥♥ing ocean.\n\nIn short, buy 2. Forget this game ever even existed and you will probably be doing yourself a favor. Unless their so called 'free DLCless content release patches' essentially shoves half of two back into it, I kind of doubt it.\n\nSo, for now enjoy your 30 level cap, six skills per class and six auras if you've made the grave mistake of purchasing this game.","May 24, 2015","false","14.7"," 113 of 149 people (76%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","76","113","149","15","6"

I would say co-op is the best way to play this game, but that's assuming you manage to play the game without a thousand and one crashes, which is literally impossible. While a friend of mine was the one hosting the game, I would frequently (read: nearly always) CTD when trying to enter a new area. This is awful in itself, but it gets worse. If the new area is one you haven't been to, and you CTD while loading it, attempting to reconnect to the host game gets you a message that you can't join the game because you haven't reached that part of the story yet. I cannot begin to count how many times this has happened, and it is absolutely disgusting. The game is so ♥♥♥♥ing buggy and ridden with random crashes that it BREAKS CO-OP.\n\nThis isn't even touching on how godawful their changes to the basic formula of the series are. There was no reason whatsoever to change the system of the first two games. When you make two games out of a trilogy and people like them (other than their general bugginess, which can be fixed by TESTING AND CODING YOUR GAME BETTER), the last thing you should EVER do is needlesly change ♥♥♥♥. Between VH1 and 2 you could import characters. They removed that from VH3. Why? No reason. No really, there's no good reason; there can't be. VH2 was an incremental improvement and expansion of the first game. It was about two steps forward for the series. VH3 is about six steps back. There was no reason to take those six steps, they just decided to do so for REASONS. The first two games in the trilogy were some of my favorite games on steam, but for whatever reason they tried to change a formula that that was proven to already work and they ♥♥♥♥ed it right up.","October 12, 2015","false","10.4"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","53","59","2","0"

Unfortunately they are mostly negative.\n\n- At the moment I cannot import my hero - who travelled through the first two games - even though this is a direct continuation of the plot.\n- You now have a level 30 cap, having previously had a level 60 cap. Why?\n- The new character 'classes' are just the old classes but spliced into their constituent parts. So no longer can you carry pistols and a sword - it has to be a pistol class, or a sword class.\n- Combat is a lot less fluid. Let's take the pistol class as an example - what has happened? You have to stand still and hold down the mouse button for 3 seconds to deal maximum damage? Why?\n- Sometimes your mouse and keyboard presses do not register, meaning you don't shoot or use your skills on time.\n- I always start my Van Helsing games on Hard mode. The first two games were punishing (but fair), but this is ludicrous. One of the first monsters you encounter can one-shot kill you. This isn't difficult, it is bonkers.\n- Katarina's AI is still wonky. In the previous games you basically had to keep her in spectral form, because she would either aggro enemies you wanted to avoid, or else ignore enemies you wanted to aggro - and would die in a heartbeat. Still happening.\n- The skill trees are even more cluttered than usual with useless skills and options that are frankly unclear.\n+ The music is excellent, as ever.\n+ The voice acting is great, as ever.\n+ The new Protector class feels like something new to the franchise and looks great.\n+ Random Sean Connery gnome.\n\nI cannot currently recommend this to anyone new to the franchise, and if you are a veteran... my advice echoes that of other reviewers: wait until Neocore have patched the thing a little more.\n\nGutted.\n\nIn the meantime, boot up VH1 and remember when simpler was better :)","June 15, 2015","false","5.3"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","49","57","3","0"

The third installment focused more on Katarina's backstory. We learned her origin story in this game and how she became a ghost. The story telling is about what you would expect if you've ever played a Van Helsing game then you'll be right at home with the witty dialogue and action combat.\n\nThe Good:\n\nGameplay:\n\nIf you've ever played an ARPG you'll know what to expect here. Tons of monsters, loot, and quest for you to do while you level up your character until you reach the level cap so you can farm for legendary gear or make a new class. It's no different here, but The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is different than your typical Diablo game. Van Helsing games have always had a mix of tower defense segments in them. Deathtrap is a good example of how they'll play out and if you don't know what Deathtrap is I encourage you to read my review here.\n\nThe major difference that sets The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III apart from it's predecessors are the six new character classes. I originally thought that these new classes would be available alongside the three we already had, but I was mistaken. The original three character classes from Van Helsing I and II are gone, but I'll go more into detail later on this review.\n\nYou'll obviously run into a lot of loot while you're out slaying monsters and you'll probably be making frequent trips back to your secret hideout or you can just give Lady Katarina all of your loot and let her sell it for you. This is a really great mechanic and I'm glad it's still present in the game.\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nThe soundtrack here easily beats both Van Helsing I and II. The opening menu theme is beautiful and it really sets the tone of the game. Every track fits the stage it's on nicely and it really added to the experience for me. The only track I didn't like was the final boss one. It was just your average encounter music.\n\nSix Character Classes:\n\nAs I stated above there are six character classes in The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III. All of them are vastly different than each other. I enjoyed my playthrough as an elementalist, but I do wish the skill tree was a lot deeper. In Van Helsing II we had over 20 magical skills to master over the course of our playthrough. In Van Helsing III we only have 8 and I beat the game only using two of them.\n\nStory:\n\nI was originally going to place this in the bad section of this review, but learning what happened to Lady Katarina and saving the world helped to place it in the positive section. There is nothing groundbreaking about the story here, but it gets the job done. I was disappointed in more than a few parts of the story, but I enjoyed the ending to the game. I would say it's a toss up between good and bad, but I enjoyed it more than I hated it.\n\nIn Van Helsing III your former ally, Prisoner 7, has betrayed you and is trying to convert the world back into the way it was in the past and to do that he's using the Ink to shape everything in his image. Van Helsing must save the day once again and get his revenge at the same time.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nYou Can't Import Your Old Characters:\n\nThis is probably my biggest problem with the game right now. All of that hard work I did going through both Van Helsing I and II was pointless. Why let us get attached to our old characters if you were never going to let us finish the trilogy with him?\n\nThe New Skill Tree Looks Nice, But It's Lacking:\n\nThere's no denying that the new skill tree in Van Helsing III looks better than it ever did, but we only have a fraction of the skills that we had in previous games. The only two spells that I used throughout my entire playthrough was my two lightning spells. The ice spells are useless and the only cool fire spell is the summon that you get, but what's the point of that when I one hit just about everything with my lightning?\n\nThe passive skill tree is still there, but it's also been gutted to hell and back. I don't understand why they decided to dumb the game down so much. Is it because it's going to the Xbox One?\n\nLevel 30 Cap:\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II had a level 60 level cap. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III took it down to 30 for some reason. Why? Your guess is as good as mine. That's not the only thing that went down though. The game is way too easy. I started playing this morning and beat it a few hours later. It took me hours upon hours of gameplay to reach the level cap in Van Helsing I. It took me 7 hours to reach it in part III...\n\nYou Can't Buy Healing Potions Anymore:\n\nWho thought it would be a good idea to take away our healing potions? I really want to know this so I can slap them in the face. Why would you take potions out of an ARPG? Instead of potions we get a single health/mana potion that takes an eternity to cooldown for another usage. Give me back my potions. I liked having over 100 of them.\n\nNo Neverending Story:\n\nEvery Van Helsing game had a Neverending Story mode. It's Van Helsing's version of a new game plus. It ramps up the difficulty and lets up play through the game as many times as we want. Why is it missing in here? The only thing I got after I completed the game was Scenario Mode, but I never really liked that mode.\n\nLittle To None Replayability:\n\nSince there's no Neverending Story I don't really feel like jumping back in this game and I just started it today. I feel like Neocore Games ran out of funding for this game and just released it as is.\n\nVan Helsing III Is Nearly Unplayable Right Now:\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III is filled with bugs. I had to figure out a way, by myself by the way, to enter the game. The developers had no idea what was causing my game crash. I can't even play this online right now because the game will only turn on in offline mode. I've walked on floors that were missing textures, and fell through the floor to my death a few times. There is a ton of missing dialogue. I could be talking to an npc that I'm actually interested in and the dialogue would just skip itself and go to the next line. This game was not ready to be released. It feels like a beta some times.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III right now is the weakest game in the trilogy. I have no idea what the devs were thinking when they stripped this game down and released it. I love the gameplay and I love Van Helsing, but I think I'll stick to parts 1 and 2 before I touch part 3 again. I'll wait until there's more content and I'll consider writing about this again one day, but I'm really disappointed that series ended this way.\n\n6/10","May 26, 2015","false","0.4"," 56 of 79 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","56","79","0","14"

More features (Neverending Story, levels up to 60, probably a few completely new features). If this bothers you, wait a while, instead posting negative review.\n\nRather than continuing leveling from VH2 - (characters can be imported, but they don't keep levels and items, they DO keep glory points and are given Epic item at start), the game offers whooping SIX classes, some redesigned builds from earlier games, but some rather unique to the whole genre, as is strength-based-stealth class I play.\n\nThis, however, is a good thing, according to yours truly. Rather than continuing old imbalances, player is offered a 'clean' start, with a NUMBER of skills reduced, but CUSTOMIZATION possibility of each increased greatly. Some players complain about lowering number of skills - but, in my 11 years of everyday playing D2:LoD i used MAX 10 shortcut skills, and even then few were timed buffs. I found no problems with number of skills.\n\nIn my opinion, done much better than in... another aRPG game, where most of skill customization is plagued by one, dominant, choice. But, as said, this is an early review, and I'll update it soon... Anyhow, each skill is highly customizable, which would (probably) lead to many player-specific styles - you don't like how certain skill works? Customize! You like a skill above all the others? Boost it to the max! And suchfort...\n\nVoice acting, graphics and humour - a trait really rare in the genre - is on very high level, as in previous two games. Gameplay is intensive and diverse for each class.\n\n[UPDATE]Itemization:\nFirstly, most of item slots are unique to a class. Some are not (rings, and some other), so there won't be instant-godlike characters, but rather somewhat 'boosted' ones, with shared item-slots, gold and essences, which is more fair and challenging, yet not completely overpowered.\n\nSecondly, crafting items to be exactly to needed specification is no more. Rares can be enchanted, filled with essences and have ONE affix rerolled (as many times as gold permits, though price increases every time). This is a fine addition in my book, and fully developing character to be able to play on high difficulties and gameplay worth WON'T be a 5-6h - unless you plan to speed-run casual or normal, in case when you got what you deserved.\n\nCasual players, playing with friends, also needn't to worry - following story, exploring maps and finding secrets and easter eggs will take over 20h of gameplay for sure. If you want to do this with different characters, more.\n\nSets are improved, from being useless but so hard to get in VH2. They could use more buff, as well as some Epics I found, and I believe it will be done in one of next patches. Probably more will be added, VH2 had a free patch that added 120+ Epic and Godlike items.\n\nMultiplayer - well, I don't know about it - according to developers, a new generation of netcode is implemented, so MP problems plaguing first two games should be worked out. I can neither confirm nor deny this yet.\n\nPvP - same applied.\n\nEndgame:\nUPDATED: As said above, finished version WILL have 60 levels and Neverending Story. Current version 1.0.2 has Story Mode (up to level30) and scenarios, which are randomly created adventures consisting of three mandatory and three bonus maps, each of which require a random victory condition (eliminate main boss, collect loot from the special chest, catch Domovoys - hilarious on later levels, and so on). When the Neverending Story, a mode that will be supposedly unfinishable, is added, scenarios will serve the purpose of training characters (Glory) and farming gold (upgrade items) and items (increased droprates) to equip character better.\n\nI know this functions, since all my playhours were with same character :)\n\nEvery now and then, a-bit-better-rare drops, then I spend some money to improve it. Improving items is luck dependent - if it fails and gives bad affix, it can be rerolled, but there is everincresing price of that service. To put simply, there is no more one hundred click on reroll until exact affix is rolled. Perhaps if the game let me import my hundred zillion billions from VH2 :) but, fortunately, it didn't.\n\nSo, I EXPECT farm more satisfying endgame, a number of reasons led me to this. But currently, it's just as said above, farming has a good timing between better item is found and it's rather promising.\n\nMandatory pizza comparison:\nFor a value of one, perhaps two, player will get rich (and funny) storyline, where quests, even if not unique, have a genre-parody value... C'mon, everyone has killed 8 pigs, then 10 pigs, and quest can't get dumber than that. Inhere, however, even when such a quest exist, it contains a well measured quantity of biting-satire, which makes it far less boring, or even funny to do... Whatabout pizza? Well, for a price of 1-2, you'll get a game that will entertain you for at least 20 times than pizzas would, and possibly much more so.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is of near-AAA quality, and for a price several times lower. Some things, like cultural references and jokes, are unique to the rather bleak (or at its best - gloomy and depressing) genre atmosphere.\n\nShould you buy it? If you like aRPG in general, but value unusual storyline, humorous dialogues and  story-driven game - YES! If you expect game that works absolutely flawless (mind you, after few hours of gameplay - no bugs observed) - probably 'yes', especially if you played that other AAA aRPGs, which failed to deliver at the launch...\n\nUPDATED: If you want completely finished, polished, bugless game - you should wait some more time, it won't take long now.\n\nRather WAIT, than buy it and then whine and post negative reviews advising players not to buy it... This is *mine* review, and it contains what I think is objective and how *I* feel about the game. If it misled you into buying, rate it unhelpful, that's why the option is.\n\nBut if *you* wrote own negative review after 0.2h of play, and now are going around lowering positive reviews ratings - rather mature thing to do, you should be proud - one who does that will recognize himself, though there are others, too - it kinda breaks whole point of reviews. But you don't care about it, anyway.\n\nDemo:\nThere also should be a free-demo, I've been told, if so - download and decide for yourself. According to me, an aRPG veteran, this is one of the best games in the genre and absolutely worth the bargain price. Compare it to the D3, TL2, PoE, GD? I *could* do it, but why so? This game is *different* in atmosphere, and close to original D2, from which all of the above derived.\n\nEDIT: as a answer to FREDDY, in my opinion games should be played in order - if for nothing else, than for rich and high-quality storyline - from what I've heard, writer is an publisher author and it shows well - a deep and rich lore, a developing story - it looks much lighter and simpler in the VH1, but gets more grim later, with the part 1 story-revisited (to a point) from a quite different angle in VH3... If you want just one, then VH2 is more feature-rich and sports leveling up to lvl60 - and then, there is where Prisoner7 appears, whose voice-acting is nothing short of amazing!\n\nAt the end, a temporary conclusion:\nIf you're in situation to, support indie gaming companies who make quality games. I do it - though I was a beta-tester and therefore got the previous games for free, I still contributed financially. I'm not a rich person, but I could afford to (avoid couple of pizzas and) actually *pay* for every NeoCore game so far - developing doesn't come free and one should support what one loves, or there will be none in the future.\n\nEnough said, best of luck!","May 22, 2015","true","157.9"," 79 of 118 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","79","118","0","11"

Although everything does feel a little more streamlined (and easier to figure out). If you're returning to the franchise for the final leg of the Van Helsing trilogy, you're going to love every second. If you're new to the franchise, $15 isn't much to support a great team of Devs and an amazing RPG-esque monster slaying experience.\n\nA greater selection of classes makes for a bit more depth on each subsequent playthrough, which adds a little space for replayability once you're done with the main campaign.

Although not an overwhelmingly bad experience, it has failed to match the heights of the second game, which remains the best in the series. Fortunately the world and monsters remain consistently impressive, almost enough to recommend the game. The iconic character has been diluted to bring class variety that was not required. It is also a shame that the Tower Defense missions and Secret Lair aspects have regressed. Likewise, Lady Katarina is a ghostly companion that never quite met her potential in the trilogy. Numerous technical issues make the game difficult to recommend for cooperative play, and some single player bugs add chinks to the flawed armor.

Let me put it straight - this game is not bad in any way. Its RPG system is great, its visuals are good, its story is interesting. But it's excactly the same game as the first one was two years ago and the second one last year. New part of the story, few (2, if I'm not mistaken) new characters and better audiovisual - with not so great optimization - is hardly enough changes to justify that it's "3".

The baddest of the land took over. You have been cleaning up the new scientific scurge, unraveling subplots of maniac generals, and generally kicking the b*tt of any monster who roams the country side. Good fun that...\n\nYou have been betrayed by an ally. The city is rulled by gangs. And your betrayer has a crazy cult running around causeing trouble for every one. And it's up to you to save everyone once again.\n\nThis is a wonderfully darkly humorus mix of classic horror monster and steampunk world they give you to play in. Well crafted, sounded, and drawn. Very enjoyable, easy to play fun to master rpg.\n\nGame specifics\nGood top down (nice camera angle) 3 person graphics. Yes you player image changes with equipment choices. Hat/helmet choice is as always important.\nNice background music (easily mutable with little loss) soothing but still mildly inspiring.\nComfotable click to slash or shoot, use wasd to move controls. Any seasoned rpg player will find the controls downright instintive within a few minutes.\nThey thoughtfully used the same voice acting as the first two games. And those were solid choices from the start.\n\nPros:\nNew character classes available. Which means new talents, skills, and auras to master. I like the new ones, though I do wish the old ones were available too.\nYou now get to send agents out on city underground movement missons. It's nice to feel you alone aren't trying to save the city.\nYou also get a treasure hunting Chimera. Think of it like a goodie sniffing ink jumping war dog. Pick a far off ink location and enjoy the magic items he returns with.\nYes the dark sardonic humor is intact, it's enjoyable listing to the npcs.\n\nCons:\nYou could carry a character over from Van Helsing 1 to game 2. Currently that isn't possible in the third game. You have to start over with a totaly new charcter simply because you can not play as ANY of the old clasees. New classes, so you start with a new charcter. I like the new classes, but this just sucks.\nMy greatest beef however is they still do NOT have the glory points system working. Honestly I never gotten it to work in any of the earlier games.

As a big fan of the series since the first game, I can't help but be majorly disappointed.\n\nThe jump from Van Helsing 1 to Van Helsing 2 was pretty big. You got another large and interesting story, the level cap was doubled and the skill tree was also double. But it seems like they've taken all that back out for this installment.\n\nThe story is painfully short and feels rushed, the final boss fight is a joke and an absolute pushover, the level cap has been halved back down to 30, and the skill tree has also been dramatically reduced to a tree that's even small than the one in the original game. They try to make up for the small skill trees and low level cap by having 6 character classes instead of 3 but that opens up another problem.\nThe 3 original classes are gone meaning, as most other fans of the series have pointed out, no character import.\nAs far as I can tell, the original 3 are still there in spirit. The Hunter now being the Bounty Hunter, Arcane Mechanic now being the Constructor, and the Thaumaturge now being the Elementalist. But these classes have been changed and reduced down so much that they're just shells of their former selves.\n\nAnother thing that got to me a bit is the lack of New Game+. This is more of a personal thing to me but when I finish the game, I like to go back to the start with my high level character, and play through again on a higher difficulty like you can do in Titan Quest and Dark Souls for example.\n\nBut, does this game do anything right?\n\nActually yes. The gameplay itself is very enjoyable. It's a solid ARPG, it's challenging in places and there's plenty of little side areas to explore and secrets to find. The graphics are pretty and the Elementalist's skills are especially flashy! (I like pretty lights!)\n\nConclusion:\nA fun game, but feels more of an addon to Van Helsing 2 with it's short story, reduced level cap and reduced skill trees. It does have some plus sides but as of now (26/05/2015) I can't recommend it.\nI have heard that the devs will continue to add free content updates in the future, so I may come back to this review then and my opinion may change.\n\nThanks for reading!","May 26, 2015","false","19.2"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","0"

I thought it was a pretty fun game and cheap too. There were a few bugs but this was just a cheap game to change things up and was fun...right.\n\nThen I see VH2 and VH3...VH3 coming out in a few days figured must be good...more classes....3rd installment...must be a better game.\n\nMeh....They seem to have added a lot to do. Maybe too much in some ways. I ended up spending quite a bit of time in the secret lab running all the way across the damn thing to do one thing or another. I think it could have been smaller just so I didn't get sick of running back and forth...no reason for it.\n\nThe things that are added in the lab are sort of like a cheap war table from dragon age inquisition almost and a beast you can send out on missions to get loot.. I don't like it; I'd rather just fight and get my own loot...but loot seems rather limited in the game so far. Basically the fun I was having in the first VH was just running around killing stuff and getting great drops and making a lot of cash so I could try different gem sockets combos etc....or just to buy junk. I wasn't trapped in town much and the areas I did so far in VH1 were pretty big and fun.\n\nAnother thing I noticed on VH3 the areas I reached seemed really confined some of the tougher mobs were really obnoxiously over-powered for starting out (at least in my opinion.) I made it through fine...I like a challenge but something about the game so far just seems to lack the fun factor for me.\n\nI tried all the classes and only liked one because it wasn't squishy and shoots rockets...who doesn't like rockets...\n\nI dunno I guess I would give this game so far about a 4 out of 10....would maybe give it a 5 but the music REALLY sucks too...Maybe it gets better...at this point I'm just going to go back to VH1 and finish playing that...not sure if I will come back to this one.","May 25, 2015","false","25.4"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","8"

This game is so feature-gutted that it doesn't even feel like a Van Helsing game outside of aesthetic and a few simple concepts.

The skill trees are non-existent and now you are presented with a sparse selection of abilities for each class that don't even feel that different.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serivik/recommended/359900/","serivik","Serivik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serivik/","379 products in account","Note: this review is written for players of the previous two installments. If you are a new player to the franchise, I would NOT start here. Play the previous two and, if you enjoy them, you might want to risk the third game just to complete the story.\n\nI like a lot of what they did with the mechanics and streamlining. No need to collect potions or split the stack and hand some to Katarina, you both have infinite potions on (I believe) the same cooldown from the previous games. The classes are more focused to particular playstyles, so you don't waste a skill points picking up a single rank of a skill you will never use just so you can get to the stuff you want. Several of the classes possess unusual gameplay mechanics (such as the Protector's block skill) that make them unique, rather than Class A just increasing a different set of numbers than Class B. Every class has every skill available from the get go rather than having to gain 20 levels and traverse a skill tree to make your build.\n\nOn the other hand, some of it feels really shoddy. Each class has a much clearer focus than in the previous games and they could have used that to make the skills deeper and more rewarding, but instead they just tacked on two more passive upgrades per skill and called it a day. Sending your officers out on missions becomes mostly luck-based later in the game, as the mission descriptions are not as clear and your soldier effectiveness is much harder to maintain; I tried to make logical choices, but my officers failed almost every mission from midgame onwards. Tricks were removed entirely, cutting out one of several major features meant to allow customization. The level caps are insultingly low (30 levels for Van Helsing, 10 reputation ranks, and 25 levels for Katarina) and easily reached before the end of a single playthrough on Normal.\n\nThe story is rushed. They hint at some interesting lore, but ultimately the delivery falls flat. It is cool to learn about Katarina's past, but it comes so quickly over the course of a single (short) act that there is no time to really explore it or allow much interplay between Van Helsing and Katarina. The ending, especially, is anti-climactic. The big bad goes out with a whimper instead of a bang.\n\nIt's not just the story that is hurried, either. Equipment upgrades are so frequent that the few unique/set items you find are unlikely to last more than a few minutes. This also means enchanting and essences, the other major customization features in the previous two games, are a hassle at best and detrimental at worst, encouraging you to waste money on rapidly obsoleted equipment. Your chimera still has slots for summoning candles in the UI, but there are no candles in the game, and even if there were, there are no Tricks so you have no way to summon him anyway. Katarina has all of her old skills, but with only 25 levels, she can't pick up the final two points of her final tier skills because she has to be 26 and 27 for the 7th and 8th points, respectively. The game doesn't feel polished at all.\n\nI am apparently lucky and had a bug-free playthrough. The only thing that felt like a bug was when I encountered a few monsters (including the final boss) that had immunity to every damage type. I don't know if there is a trick to fighting them or not, but Katarina can damage them for whatever reason and I played a Protector, so I tanked them and let her take care of the heavy lifting.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty big step down from the previous two installments. I loved the previous two games, but I can't recommend this one. If you really must finish the story, go ahead and buy it. I recommend tempering your enthusiasm, though, so hopefully you won't be as disappointed as I was.","May 26, 2015","false","12.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

The balance between the classes is off, the monsters have unpredictable spikes in power, and it appears that their are parts of the game that are not even enabled yet.\n\nAs much of a fan of this series as I am, I cannot recommend it. I will change my review later, if the bugs are removed, the characters and monsters balanced, and all the aspects of the game are fully implemented.","May 24, 2015","false","4.3"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

Reminds me of the letdown from Sacred3 but not nearly THAT bad.. I mean that Sacred3 scam was just horrid..\n\nHere's a list of about a dozen things I found wrong with the game in the first 10min I played and persisted through the few hrs I put into it: (but in short it's basically half the game it used to be LITERALLY! half as many activate skills (like 3 total) Half the level cap.. Half as much time to complete)\n\n-Lacks features from previous games in the character development area. (seems like they took skills from previous chars in past game and made new characters out of them. Hence why Bountyhunter no longer uses melee for example..)\n\n-Sound effects missing.(ex: Phlogistoneer's rockets make no sound till they hit something) and if they're fired without something to auto target they just explode in your face.\n\n-Some sounds just seem wrong.. Like the footsteps of the protector sounds like he's wearing dress shoes or high heels.\n\n-When Protector blocks projectiles they still just go through him like he's a ghost or something.. No audio for the block or animation like he actually blocked something. When holding block he just becomes a rotating statue. sigh..\n\n-Controls are clunky and inconsistent from one class to another. (example if you hold shift and left mouse on melee char you'll attack in place, on the bountyhunter you'll just stand there and hold your gun up till you let go of the mouse then you'll fire, and it auto aims so you cant just fire shots in the direction you want if there's say a barrel near by you'll auto target it, THEN on the constructor it does nothing at all..)\n\n-When the constructor is firing he just stands there with no animation. They couldn't even make the bullets or lasers come out of the gun properly. At one point the laser was coming out of my chest. Could have at least made him aim the gun at what he's firing at but no he points the gun in one direction and the bullets/laser goes in another..\n\n-Movement is clunky.. If on a melee char and something walks (JUST WALKS) away from you. You'll half swing then step forward half swing step forward over and over doing this stuttering Mike J Fox crap and will never actually hit the S.O.B. till it stops moving...\n\n-Silly mistakes like.. Since the UI layout is differ when using a controller the tutorial tips that pop up point at empty space where the UI item was when using a mouse/keyboard.\n\n-Bout 6hrs to complete the game, level cap is half what it used to be, only 30 now. LOTS of stuff just copy and pasted from the previous games. For example potion drop chance skill yet, potions don't exist in this game...\n\n-There's more but I really don't want to waste anymore time p1ssing and moaning about it..\n\nSeems like they had a lot of good ideas but just half @ssed it... Like a quick cash grab so they could work on other projects/games.\nBUT on the bright side they priced it accordingly so you really can't be that upset. It IS worth the cost. You pay 1/4th the cost of a decent game and get... 1/4th of a complete game..\n\nGraphics and voice acting is good but that'll only get you so far..\nI imagine the people who voted positive for this game are just drooling brain deads that are just easily amused by anything with pretty colors or flashing lights.. If you haven't played Diablo3, Torchlight2, TItanQuest, GrimDawn, Path of Exile, Sacred 1&2 you've got a lot better choices to waste your time with. Don't make the same mistake in supporting this like I did. It only influences companies like this to keep doin this crap.","May 22, 2015","false","4.3"," 115 of 197 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","115","197","6","9"

Between Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest and Path of Exile for example, i will always come back to Van Helsing. Why? Because it has that "je ne sais quoi" hidden flavor, that thing that makes your brain giggle, your heart pump in fear and your muscles cling to the last drop of clicking power. It has complexity, it has tons of hours of gameplay, huge storyline and references. tons of dialogues and most of all, replay-ability. And that's why i choose The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.\n\nNow, getting to the third part of the trilogy ... the civil war has ended around Borgovia but the sinister Prisoner 7, who betrayed Van Helsing in the end of the second game, meddled with the Ink and new monsters have risen to give our hero no time to rest. In The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 3 you will find 6 classes which you can play with: defeat your foes as the melee-specialist Protector, be the most accurate shooter as the Bounty Hunter, master the weird science as the Phlogistoneer, engineer your tactics as the Constructor, control the magical forces as the Elementalist or become a dark, stealthy killer as the Umbralist. And bear in mind, you are still accompanied by the beautiful, humorous, lethal but loyal lady Katarina. I was glad to hear that in this last part of the trilogy we will learn the story of her past.\n\nSet in a steampunkish-gothic environment, you will have to take your time and admire all the surroundings. Clear up the level filled with monstrosities, set back and watch how every single detail brings you closer and deeper into the grim story. There are also secrets hidden around, so watch your step and search every single corner of your road ahead.\n\nThe customization levels are vast enough so you can set your own playstyle and combat strategies. Perks, auras, skills and talent points will be a sweet experience for you ARPGs lovers and also the plethora of items you will find around. Katarina will also have all of these customizations available, so keep an eye on her level-up and the items that she can use.\n\n- this was a part from the preview I made  here on the Steam forum","May 22, 2015","true","8.2"," 61 of 102 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","61","102","3","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/359900/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","The dungeon crawling role-playing game genre has always been dominated by Blizzard's Diablo series but this doesn't mean that other, smaller studios have given up on the market. Quite the opposite, as there's been stiff competition from the likes of Torchlight and an even smaller experience, in the form of The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, coming from Hungarian studio Neocore.\nAfter delighting plenty of fans with the first two installments in the series, the developer's back with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III, which continues the story, adds quite six all-new classes, and continues to refine the gameplay mechanics from its predecessors. At the same time, however, it does make a few sacrifices, as veterans can't import their old characters and the level cap has been lowered to 30.\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III picks up from where its predecessor left off, continuing the story by focusing on what Prisoner Seven plans for the world of Borgovia, as well as on the origins of Katarina, Van Helsing's ghostly companion. The plot is pretty interesting but what really elevates it is the fun dialog that retains the wit and sarcasm from past entries and doesn't even require knowledge of previous games to enjoy. There are also plenty of hilarious sequences involving monsters and other such things, offering a change of pace from the somber things you'll see throughout the rest of the plot.There are a few interesting twists and turns but some you can smell from a mile away. Even so, especially for veterans, the plot is pretty enjoyable. In case this is your first Van Helsing experience, while you certainly take greater pleasure if you've gone through past titles, you'll still be brought up to speed through cinematic sequences and diary entries.\nIn terms of gameplay The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III brings a few controversial changes over its predecessors. While it's still a pretty good dungeon crawling RPG experience, Neocore has made some sweeping modifications to a few mechanics, not to mention its classes and skill trees.\nGone are the three main classes from past games and in are six all-new ones that offer some pretty varied experiences. For melee enthusiasts, there are two wildly different classes. The hulking Protector wields a giant flail and a shield, similar to Diablo 3's Crusader, but can actually use the shield in combat to block damage, instead of it acting as a passive damage reduction. The Umbralist is a swift dual-wielding rogue that uses twin blades to inflict plenty of damage.\nThose who prefer shooting from afar can pick from the other four classes. The Elementalist feels like the traditional Wizard from Diablo 3, for example, but his flashy abilities bring plenty of style. The Phlogistoneer is certainly the most intriguing in terms of visual style, unleashing fire, rockets, and other projects at foes, while relying on a shield to protect himself in close quarters.\nThe Bounty Hunter relies on guns to do the damage, so don't expect him to act like the Hunter class from past games. Last but not least, there's the Constructor, who relies on building gadgets and machines to do the dirty work for him. In combination with Katarina, who can engage enemies in melee or ranged forms, you can take a hands-off approach to combat.\nAll the classes are pretty varied but the fact that they can only be leveled up to a cap of 30, after Van Helsing II's 60 limit, does put a hamper on your fun. The skill trees are pretty varied but they require quite a lot of study and experimentation before you can really master them. Throw in the same rather complex interface that hides things away with buttons, tabs, and panels, and you'll need to invest a bit of time before you can really figure things out. The other dungeon crawling mechanics, such as the inventory or the loot systems are still quite good, offering plenty of different gear and options for your different classes.\nBesides the regular dungeon crawling mechanics, you can still engage in Tower Defense missions, which offer some pretty interesting challenges, but also in mini-games that task you with managing your forces and your Chimera by sending them on missions in exchange for loot and other rewards.\nUnfortunately, you can no longer go through the game via its Endless Story mode, which acted as a sort of New Game +, so there aren't a lot of reasons to replay it. There is a Scenario mode that allows you to try and complete certain situations in the fastest time possible, so players are encouraged to keep coming back to the RPG.\nThe level design is very good, managing to offer plenty of different environments to explore, including hidden nook, crannies, and Easter Eggs that reward thorough players.\nLike previous titles, Van Helsing III offers an online cooperative and a competitive mode. Up to four players can go through the story together while up to eight can go up against one another in a test of skill and gear. The multiplayer mode handles relatively well but matchmaking is a bit lengthy, especially during certain time intervals. Even so, it's pretty fun and a nice diversion over the regular campaign.\nIn terms of graphics, Van Helsing III retains the style employed by its predecessors and, while it's not that detailed or pretty to the eye, it's still fairly good and manages to keep things fresh for an isometric dungeon crawler. Enemies in particular are varied and well-designed.\nThe soundtrack is also pretty good but some of the audio taunts and effects used by certain enemies can wear on your nerves. The voice acting is great, particularly when it comes to Katarina, which manages to deliver her witty remarks very well.\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III is a good game but it might not exactly delight all of its players. Yes, it's a pity that players can't import their characters and classes but the new ones are quite varied, even if they can only reach level 30. For such a low price, Neocore's RPG is a great investment.","August 17, 2015","true","30.6"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

Bottom line, this game is a very weird, too tight niche where you can sort of shift things around, but you're still very resticted to classes the abilities of which are rather 'meh' if not needlessly redundant. How many different ways does a video game really need to have to apply shooting bonuses?\n\nUpside? Aesthetics. The prior versions were much better. You could make it as combo oriented, or meat and potatoes beat stick as you like. If you want to play, effectively, somebody else's conception and character, have at.\n\nKInda makes me flashback to Torchlight 2. They should just call that game Shieldquest.\n\nTo be fair, alot if most games are like this now. The illusion of choice, but like the stage magic strategy , it all ends up being a funnel to the same stuff, so I suppose in a way AVH3 is more honest, because you start at the end of the funnel and work to the other as opposed to being herded to the end.","May 23, 2015","false","0.5"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","23","39","0","2"

Overall at this price it is well worth it.\n\nDetailed version\n\nPro:\n- Nice story, great characters, the dialogues are funny and fitting, quests are interesting. You are accompanied by a female ghost, who makes witty remarks and they chat a lot and such, so it is not the silent protagonist silently killing, but something more lively.\n- Kinda polished, I did not meet any freeze or bug or low FPS.\n- A lot of "other" stuff to do, the game has a garrison system like in WoW where you can send your lieutenants on missions and develop them, a basic crafting system (with essences and stuff), enchanting and so on.\n- A lot of ways to develop your character, passives, skills, the ghost companion's skills (and she has a lot!), unique unlockable perks, elixirs that permanently increase some stats, etc.\n\nSo-so:\n- Pre-made levels take some of that roguelike feeling away. Maps aren't random (well, monster distributions and loot are random), but at least they are well done, and have hidden areas and quests.\n- The character advancement is a bit weird, you can have quite some skills, but why would you spread your talent points over several skills instead of focusing just 1 or 2? So kinda the same problem that Diablo 2 had and POE has. Retalenting is cheap tho.\n- I really like that the dialogues are funny, but sometimes the references and jokes are a bit too much. Like the "torturing with poem"part, I got the Galaxy reference, but that was a bit out of place.\n\nCon:\n- The skills lack impact. That is so well done in Diablo, that even basic skills have a "punch", is missing here. It is more like PoE in that regard.\n- Graphics in general is so-so. It has its strong moments, but sometimes there are cheap solutions.\n- Balance can be weird. You get oneshotted a few times, because your opponents skills aren't really telegraphed as clearly as in Diablo for example. Sometimes you mow down hordes, sometimes a few of the bigger ones just beat you to a pulp. I wouldn't play this game in hardcore.","May 22, 2015","true","10.5"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","32","59","0","2"

It's not even worth the $11 and change they are charging for it.\n\nI bought this against my own better judgement. The price was cheap and I was just looking for a new ARPG. My biggest gripe is the ridiculous damage that gets thrown around right at the beginning of the game. This is while playing on normal. I have no heal or defense spells yet. I can't build my character any differently because he is still level 1. I can't change my gear to stuff with more defensive stats, because I've only found two or three items so far. But they decided to introduce you to mobs that nearly insta-gib you at level 1. From what I understand, it's still just as bad on the casual setting (the game is essentially the same difficulty on any setting)?\n\nI'm not sure what on earth they were thinking here. I thought the first Van Helsing game had some balance issues (melee vs. range), but this is ridiculous. For what it's worth I'm used to playing "difficult" arpgs (grim dawn on veteran, diablo 3 inferno at release, path of exile, etc.). The difference is those game don't really ramp up the damage while youre still at level 1. You know why? Because that's awful game design.\n\nEdit: Gained a level and used my companion's skill points to boost her health. I have her in melee while I play ranged.

I'm not an action RPG expert, but after having sunk over 80+ hours into Diablo 3 and expansion, 30+ hours into Torchlight/Torchlight 2, and a little bit into Grim Dawn and Path of Exile, I still find the Van Helsing series my favorite ARPG.  Yes, better than the mighty D3.  Hands down.\n\nIn terms of mechanics, the game is solid.   Easy to play, satisfying combat, and even a whole major tower defence subgame!  The developers have distilled the essense of an RPG and captured it precisely.   It's also very pretty; hand crafted dungeons are more interesting than the random generated crossword puzzles of certain other ARPGs.   Also: gamepad support for you TV players!\n\nIn terms of narrative ... love it.  The gothic steampunk world is dark and interesting (and most importantly, not a cliche).  The dialog between the characters is amusing without ever getting tiresome - and the humorous bits (and pop culture references) are genuinely funny.    Whomever did the North American localization for Neocore - you sir/m'aam did an amazing job.   There isn't too much dialog, (never too far from the action), and I was always interested in seeing what happened next.  It's also decently voice acted, too.  (Especially Katarina...actress totally nails the psychotic haughty eastern european diva)\n\nNow, having said that, let's focus on this particular chapter, the third and final one.\n\nFlat out ... it's a bit of a step backwards.  As much as I love the series, this one isn't quite as good as the second one (or even the first).  There's a low level cap, the skill system has been changed a bit (for the worse), there are no character imports - and the game just feels shorter than the previous games in the series.   The loot drops were much stingier, and though I didn't encounter any of the "uncompletable quest" bugs people have written about, I did suffer frequent crashes to the desktop - which was exacerbated by a painfully long load time.\n\nIs it still a hell of a good time?  Yes.   Is it the weakest in the trilogy?  Sadly yes.\n\nBut here's the thing: if you've played the other two in the series (which you probably have), you will enjoy this.  If you haven't, then pick up the first one and check it out.    Then get the second, and then the third.\n\nEven better, Neocore has just released word of a "final cut" edition of all 3 games that will be FREE to all owners of all 3 games.  Come on guys...that's a wackload of content there.\n\nIgnore the haters.  BUY NOW.  And fund a second trilogy!!!!   Hey Neocore:  prequel story of Van Helsing Senior and Katarina?

I've tried out the Bounty Hunter and Phlogistoneer.  I expect I'll finish the game with the Phlogistoneer next, it and the Constructor are my favorites so far.  The Bounty Hunter is a fun unique diversion, but feels ill handled for spawning mobs that a few enemies can throw at you - probably better to play in multiplayer.  The Elementalist became quite enjoyable as soon as I added Frost wall to my skillset.\nI feel Van Helsing III has the best balance for the Constructor tower defense play style compared to any other games I've tried similar classes as I feel the towers and gun skills are equals none overpowering the other nor being to weak to bother with.  If you enjoy such classes (Dungeon Defenders, Rocket Raccoon in Marvel Heroes, or Sentry play in Diablo 3) then I expect you'll really enjoy this class.\nThe game does a wonderful job of keeping leveling up exciting and rapid.  So far I feel in need of the level up and am happy enough with the results.  It's easy to sink hours into this game in a single sitting, wanting to try out another skill or level them up.  Additionally the environments and enemies have continued to stay fresh.\nIf you do get in a rut you can always return to your base and partake in other meta games like tower of defense and sending minions out on jobs for loot.\nThe story doesn't have me overly excited but it's at least been enough to keep me following it versus ignoring dialog.  It's a surprise considering the low price,that very nearly all the dialog is spoken.  Then there's a journal if you want to read further into the game's world.\nI tired of the original Van Helsing for a mere 7 hours (enjoyed it for the first few hours) getting bored with what seemed to be a constant battle tactic of being forced to fight a horde of enemies over and over without enough variety in the repetition and lost interest after checking out various sword/gun skills.  I skipped VH2, VH3 has many classes to chose from which all sound vastly different to play so surely you'll find something you enjoy in this final episode.  Unless you play ARPGs for story there is no need to play VH1 and/or VH2 prior to this one.  It's improved in it's mechanics even though most fights are fighting groups of enemies they vary much more in speed/approach and aren't in such huge horde numbers and often there will be 1 different powerful enemy by itself or mixed in to groups of 2 other types of enemies.  It's got more variety in the combat, you aren't going to have great success repeating exact same combos each attack, you have to vary it based on terrain and enemy placements (at least for Constructor class).\nThe Loot isn't as exciting as Diablo 3 Loot 2.0, but it's plenty competent for a $15 game.\nIf you are looking for a fun cheap ARPG this is a great value.\nFor more info see comments.","May 23, 2015","true","44.5"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","15","28","2","2"

Don't listen to all the doomsayers...\n\nImho VH3 shows more improvements and changes than VH2 did. If that is for better or for worse is up to you to decide.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 6 "new" classes: Those are pretty much the old 3 classes split down further. You have your ranged hunter, which is a class I simply can't really play so well anymore, because his main attack forces you to repeatedly press the left mouse button instead of simply holding it down like in the previous games. Why? Because if you hold it down you "charge" your shot. It's a cool feature, but something that should have been a secondary attack instead. Afaik there is no good skill to replace this with, because they all cost mana and the hunter does not have much mana...\nNext is some sort of "tank" with a shield, then the classic mage, some sort of rogue, and engineer who relies on minions, which take up 50% of the screen estate, and my personal favorite, the Phlogistoneer, a mechanical exoskeleton with a flamethrower and missiles and a shield. That is my chosen class for now. It's fun and you're pretty well off with the first 2 skills. I didn't bother with anything else for now...doesn't seem worth it. My second pick would be the Mage, but he's a real glass cannon...\nThis, however, means you can no longer import your char from a previous game. You can import a lvl 60 char, but it only gives you some small perks for your new level 1 char...\n\n- The skill system has been "dumbed down" or refined as I would say. Van Helsing traditionally offered lots of skills that were locked behind a progress wall and realistically not feasible to invest in, unless you want to respec and completely rebuild your character perhaps. This time around there are less skills, but they look more meaningful. Since I don't hardcore this game I don't really care that much. It's a short and cheap trip.\n\n- The setting is as hauntingly beautiful as ever with improved graphics and effects. Nothing to dislike here if you liked the first 2 games. Also in comparison to VH2 this one does seem to offer a bit more diverse landscapes up to now (about 50% completed).\n\n- The music is also again very great.\n\n- Voice acting still ok.\n\n- Story is more confusing and kind of loses sight of the supposed main villain...again, which is said. Side quests are still fun.\n\n- The Lair is back and as annoying as it was before.\n\n- The humour is also still there.\n\n- The difficulty seems to be a bit better balanced. Although you can still die in 1 hit on casual...lol\n\n- Some features have been removed: For example you can no longer switch weapon and skill sets, which is a bit sad. I also haven't found any scrolls yet and runeforging seems to be gone as well. Also health and mana potions have been removed and replaced by a cd "skill", which is basically exactly the same system minus you don't have to collect or shop for them anymore all the time, which is a great addition really, because money was never really the problem anyway. What IS weird though is that in the game you still have short cuts and even empty buttons for removed features. That's lazy...and misleading.\n\nBasically, if you liked VH 1+2 for the story and setting you will also like this one. If you liked them because of their character and skill system you may be disappointed by this title.\n\nWhat people need to realize is that all 3 VH games only cost 35 euros at most (without any DLC, probably around 50 with), which is still cheaper than most "higher quality" ARPGs out there. For that you get 3 different "episodes", the last one being quite different in terms of class design, of the same game, which gives you about 30 hours I'd say for 1 playthrough, which is adequate.\n\nAll in all it's not a bad game and so far I have not encountered any bugs or crashes, so there is no reason for me not to recommend the game for a quick joy ride. Apparently the level cap is now 30, but then again, you have more characters to try your hand with and let's see what DLC they release. There is supposedly and endless mode and scenarios as well as multiplayer, so have at it.","May 26, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

VH3 is definitely a downgrade over the previous games, the biggest regression being the skill system, it has been dumbed-down by removing many skills and changing others, this leaves you with very little choice when it comes to creating your build. The toughest decision you'll have to make is which of the skills you'll max out first, as you'll end up maxing out most of them by the end anyway. Another major issue with the game is simply the classes aren't fun to play, the skills are boring, the skill trees are bland and I honestly felt only two of the six classes were enjoyable enough to finish the game with.\n\nIf you can get past the boring classes and restrictive skill system another backtrack from previous games is the loot, much like in VH1 you will rarely find any legendary items, by the end of my play-through I only had two equipped. In VH2 this was fixed and the loot progression was great, I was regularly finding interesting, build changing legendaries and I have no idea why they went back on this in VH3.\n\nNow if you can look past the bad, underneath it's the same old Van Helsing, so if you enjoyed the first two games you'll probably enjoy this one too, just not as much as the previous entries. The solid voice work and humor once again carries the game and makes you forgive certain downfalls, and if you want to see how the story ends I would suggest picking the game up when it's 50 - 75% off as it's not worth full price. That being said, if you own all the Van Helsing games you will be entitled to the Final Cut edition for free which is releasing next month, it's basically all three games combined and improved (although we're not sure how, but they have said they're overhauling the skill system which was absolutely necessary IMO). My advice would be to wait and play the Final Cut edition, instead of playing VH3 as a standalone game.","August 26, 2015","true","11.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Features have been stripped to the bone. Level cap reduced. 6 classes, most of which are terrible. Crafting and Enchanting seem to have taken a nerf. The skill system feels dumbed down, with seemingly less types of skills.\n\nIt's a shame as the world/lore crafting seems to be okay, with its own quirky pop-culture references.\n\nAs it is, I recommend buying VH2, it's a far superior game. Try it out before they ruin it with their plans to implement the 6 class system into the previous games.","May 25, 2015","false","1.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The new level system seems to restrict diversity in builds and encourages min/max game play and it seems to be a bit shorter than the others were. There are some bugs and crashes that caused a slight annoyance, but not enough to keep me away from the game.  Also, after 1 and 3/4 play through I haven't seen 1 set item drop, but have received a lot of unique drops.  UPDATE: set items started dropping while doing the nightmare scenario's after i had beat the game.  Still sad to see lower level set items removed.\n\nMe and a friend walked through hard mode with no problem and put it on fearless to fight the final stage and boss and still had zero trouble clearing the game.

But that's irrelevant, because it's continuation of the story and I played it for the story (well, and murdering fun, which is still here). Mechanics (skills, skill trees, leveling, multiplayer) were slightly different across all parts. However, as most people who followed the story have all three parts anyway, they'll be getting Van Helsing - Final Cut (for free, heh), which is "the actual" complete (all three parts in one, higher level cap, etc. - so basically all the complaints about VH3 are void once this comes out) VH aRPG.\n\nI'm personally quite happy with VH3. Still the same stunning visuals, insanely awesome(!) music and humour in one of my favourite genres... just done right.\n\nOf course it still has some bugs and glitches, but nothing gamebreaking, at least for now. And I'm mostly playing it multiplayer, so they really fixed most if not all network bugs we had in VH1.\n\nGet it if you liked (and have) VH1 and VH2.

That's never a good thing.\n— Van Helsing\n\nEarly in the game, while walking through a forest, Van Helsing and Katarina come across a gigantic crystal thingy just sitting there, doing nothing. Van Helsing is nervous. Katarina, curious. “Hit it, Van Helsing,” she says. I had the option to do as she asked, or refuse. Obligingly, curious myself, I took a shot at it. Three monsters promptly spawned and, yowling, I ran off to a safe distance from which to shoot at them. When I was done, Katarina goes, “That was exciting! Hit it again!”\n\nFour, perhaps six times, I hit it, alternately spawning monsters and items. One of the spawns was some manner of rabid bunny. Each time, Katarina was equally excited. And I was cracking up behind the keyboard.\n\nThe third and final installment of the Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing trilogy, this hack-n-slash turned out to be a heck of a lot more fun than I had imagined. It only took ten, maybe fifteen minutes for me to get into the game – because Van Helsing offers one thing that a lot of games try at, but miss – humour.\n\nThe full review and score are here, on Nerd Rock from the Sun - http://nerdrockfromthesun.com/game-reviews/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-iii-review/\n\nNote: We were given a review code for the game by the developers.","July 23, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Plus, for the 11 Euros I paid for it, some might argue I got my money's worth (I actually only did it to complete my collection and receive the Final Cut for free).\n\nThe story is cute, as always, though maybe a bit repetitive and predictable. I feel that, considering the scope of this game, it would've fit better as the second title in the series. Having played the considerably more vast Van Helsing 2, I can see how you might find the end of the trilogy somewhat underwhelming.\n\nReally not a bad game, if you go into it with realistic expectations about what it is.

It is definitely worth the time to finish up the story about Van Helsing and not least Katarina.\nHowever the game does feel short in terms of real boss fights, no unique boss strategies, like the first and second game had. Just like the other two games there is alot of bugs right now at launch, some big and some small. Some pathing errors, some scenarios cant be completed, neverending mode doesnt work at the moment.\n\nI get the feeling of the developer somehow lost the interest in the game after VH2. The game feels like they are saying, we started a triology, but we really dont want to do this anymore, so lets just get it done, which really shows in lack of content.\nIn VH1 i spent hours lurking all the small crooks of the game, for some sashy comment from Katarina. I still did that here, but i did not find the same amount.\n\nThere is 6 classes now, which is GREAT !, but the lack of skills in each class is really depressing, there is no room for experimenting. Sadly we see this trend in more games, so its not a single flaw just existing in VH3.\n\nIn short i would recommend the game to those who loved the Van Helsing games so far, and i would be hesitent for newcomers, but i would tell people to wait 2 months for sorting out the bugs, and hope more content would be added.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStory 9/10\nKatarina 9/10 (Yes she is entitled to her own category, since she won't get her own pony)\nGameplay 5/10\nVisual/Audio 7/10\nReplayability 3/10 This is 3 days after launch, so this will improve.\n\nI love the game, and ill be playing it, but thats because i love the universe, but overall i would prefer playing VH1 or VH2 instead.","May 25, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But we can't import our characters (in my opinion thats not a character import where you get the same name and an epic ring), we lost our skills and stats. The developers remove many good points of the game for example set items, runecrafting, and the skilltrees etc... In my opinion they put too many workhours into the Deathtrap they didn't enough time to finish the VH3.\nIf you a real fun you feel yourself a little disappointed.\n\n- lower levels\n- no character import\n- much less skills\n- removed set items\n- removed runecrafting\n- no mastery level perks\n- potions removed (cool down system of the potions)\n\nThere are many good things.

I'd recommend it, as the game was fun, but whether I'd recommend it at full price I don't know.\n\nI started to get a bit worried about this game before I even started it. With VH2, there were pre-orders, you could get extras, and it felt like we could be much more involved. That wasn't the case with VH3. No pre-order, no bonuses, no benefits for those of us who owned the first two games in the series.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe new classes are a lot of fun - I played through as the Protector and really enjoyed it. Given that these games are a bit samey, I don't think I'll play through it again as a different class.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nI essentially see Neocore as an indie outfit, so they can be forgiven for some replication - but this is essentially exactly the same game with new maps and new classes.\n\nThe Tower Defence elements have been stripped right back. It only occurs three times and it didn't feel nearly as fun as it did previously. In the last one, one of the traps didn't actually work - you couldn't even place it. (I forget the name of it, but it's the cage that houses the werewolf-type creatures).\n\nBuggy. Not only the trap mentioned above, but some of Katriana's skills didn't even seem to do anything.\n\nToo easy. I played on the second-hardest setting (not sure why, usually go for the hardest settings but maybe I'm getting old!) and there was no challenge to the game. The Protector was such a powerful class that I just steamrolled everything, including the final boss, who barely took me below 100% health.\n\nLoot. The loot was just a bit uninspired. I just kept swapping between very slightly better versions of each item. The only upgrades I ever seemed to get were from the shop. Drops were terrible. I didn't get one item better than rare, and none of the items had any interesting effects to them.\n\nThe So So:\n\nThe skill trees. I didn't like skill trees from VH2. There were too many skills, most of which were useless once you got the better versions. It didn't have the same kind of progressive feel of games like Diablo 2. In that regard, the trees in VH3 are better - but perhaps they've gone too far in the other direction. I only had four skills for the entire game. The other two were pointless. More to the point, those were the only skills available at all - there was no choice between play styles or using one skill over another.\n\nHaving read my review, I'm not sure why I'm recommending the game - but even with its flaws, it's still better than a lot of games out there. It might be samey, but at least it's samey as compared to great games.","June 1, 2015","true","18.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The first one was a stellar entry for the genre, but the second felt a little bit of a step down, and the third which I've just finished playing was mediocre in comparison.\n\nWhile the addition of the new classes was interesting, and the music was absolutely fantastic, the fact that I couldn't import my characters and items from the second was frustrating to say the least. I carried on grinding after the story ending in VH2 to get all the godlike items, and amassed a fortune, only to find VH3 WOULDN'T LET ME CARRY A SINGLE ONE OVER! ARRRRGGGGGH.\n\nNext, what was with the loot? VH1 and VH2 let me indulge in my love of hoarding loot, with great sets or epic items being dropped. Perhaps it was just my game, but not a single set item showed up, and I had all of 2 special items. It was nice however that Katarina had her own stuff at last, rather than things I didn't want anymore.\n\nAlso, why such a low level cap?! Yes the leveling in this game has been restructured and a bit more freeing, but the level cap for my character and Katarina was just too low.\n\nI also encountered some frustration with the final boss fight, not loading at all when trying to get in, not connecting to my co-op buddy, crashing, and then when I finally made it back in, doing some awful things with the camera so I couldn't see what I was hitting.\n\nAnd what happened to the LAN? That suddenly disappeared which makes no sense at all.\n\nFinally, this franchise has been great with all of its pop culture references, dealt out with some style and wit. Unfortunately, it felt as if the game was rushed out without putting that much of this in, so I quite missed these.\nOverall, this might sound like a bad game, but honestly, it's not. It's just that in comparison to the other two, it feels more acceptable, rather than good. What I can't complain about however is the price point. It's a decent enough game for the price, £11.99. It just didn't feel like a fitting finale for what has been a great franchise overall.\n\nI'd say buy this to support this independent developer, but for a game you can really enjoy, VH1 and VH2 are your best bets.","June 1, 2015","true","13.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'd recommend it, as the game was fun, but whether I'd recommend it at full price I don't know.\n\nI started to get a bit worried about this game before I even started it. With VH2, there were pre-orders, you could get extras, and it felt like we could be much more involved. That wasn't the case with VH3. No pre-order, no bonuses, no benefits for those of us who owned the first two games in the series.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe new classes are a lot of fun - I played through as the Protector and really enjoyed it. Given that these games are a bit samey, I don't think I'll play through it again as a different class.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nI essentially see Neocore as an indie outfit, so they can be forgiven for some replication - but this is essentially exactly the same game with new maps and new classes.\n\nThe Tower Defence elements have been stripped right back. It only occurs three times and it didn't feel nearly as fun as it did previously. In the last one, one of the traps didn't actually work - you couldn't even place it. (I forget the name of it, but it's the cage that houses the werewolf-type creatures).\n\nBuggy. Not only the trap mentioned above, but some of Katriana's skills didn't even seem to do anything.\n\nToo easy. I played on the second-hardest setting (not sure why, usually go for the hardest settings but maybe I'm getting old!) and there was no challenge to the game. The Protector was such a powerful class that I just steamrolled everything, including the final boss, who barely took me below 100% health.\n\nLoot. The loot was just a bit uninspired. I just kept swapping between very slightly better versions of each item. The only upgrades I ever seemed to get were from the shop. Drops were terrible. I didn't get one item better than rare, and none of the items had any interesting effects to them.\n\nThe So So:\n\nThe skill trees. I didn't like skill trees from VH2. There were too many skills, most of which were useless once you got the better versions. It didn't have the same kind of progressive feel of games like Diablo 2. In that regard, the trees in VH3 are better - but perhaps they've gone too far in the other direction. I only had four skills for the entire game. The other two were pointless. More to the point, those were the only skills available at all - there was no choice between play styles or using one skill over another.\n\nHaving read my review, I'm not sure why I'm recommending the game - but even with its flaws, it's still better than a lot of games out there. It might be samey, but at least it's samey as compared to great games.","June 1, 2015","true","18.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The first one was a stellar entry for the genre, but the second felt a little bit of a step down, and the third which I've just finished playing was mediocre in comparison.\n\nWhile the addition of the new classes was interesting, and the music was absolutely fantastic, the fact that I couldn't import my characters and items from the second was frustrating to say the least. I carried on grinding after the story ending in VH2 to get all the godlike items, and amassed a fortune, only to find VH3 WOULDN'T LET ME CARRY A SINGLE ONE OVER! ARRRRGGGGGH.\n\nNext, what was with the loot? VH1 and VH2 let me indulge in my love of hoarding loot, with great sets or epic items being dropped. Perhaps it was just my game, but not a single set item showed up, and I had all of 2 special items. It was nice however that Katarina had her own stuff at last, rather than things I didn't want anymore.\n\nAlso, why such a low level cap?! Yes the leveling in this game has been restructured and a bit more freeing, but the level cap for my character and Katarina was just too low.\n\nI also encountered some frustration with the final boss fight, not loading at all when trying to get in, not connecting to my co-op buddy, crashing, and then when I finally made it back in, doing some awful things with the camera so I couldn't see what I was hitting.\n\nAnd what happened to the LAN? That suddenly disappeared which makes no sense at all.\n\nFinally, this franchise has been great with all of its pop culture references, dealt out with some style and wit. Unfortunately, it felt as if the game was rushed out without putting that much of this in, so I quite missed these.\nOverall, this might sound like a bad game, but honestly, it's not. It's just that in comparison to the other two, it feels more acceptable, rather than good. What I can't complain about however is the price point. It's a decent enough game for the price, £11.99. It just didn't feel like a fitting finale for what has been a great franchise overall.\n\nI'd say buy this to support this independent developer, but for a game you can really enjoy, VH1 and VH2 are your best bets.","June 1, 2015","true","13.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Despite the nitpicks of other players, this is a solid ARPG. As can be said of any ARPG, they are a treadmill, and a time waster. And this is where Van Helsing III falls short. There is a low level cap. About 30.\n\nSecondly, your beastie shares the same level cap. Game was over before I knew it. BAM! Levelling was consistent thereout. The loot system was solid. Combat felt great! The skilltree? Underrated. Picking passives is awesome. It means your skills never lose their utility, but unlock different variables and special abilities as they go.\n\nPowering up your abilities detracted from the whole game, as time spent waiting is time I'd rather spend killing. It seemed rather superfluous to the whole system, as well. Was it fun? Yes. Does it beat Path of Exile and the competition? It stands alongside. Proudly, in this reviewers estimation.\n\nI'd really like to praise the devs in making old skills feel new again. As expected, this is a narrative-driven Diablo, and there are bugs. The main problems are in consistency, as a treadmill should not end so briefly; and the endgame felt abrupt. The new classes, however, really are where this game shines. I played a stealth character this time through, and was not disappointed. There are worse ways of spending ones hours. Really.\n\nNor am I going to be an apologist for this game. It is great. I would give it a solid 7/10.\n\nPros:\n-Fun\n-Consistent levelling\n-Basically whatever can be praised about any ARPG\n-Passives Skilltree\n\nCons:\n-Low levelling cap\n-Low beastie levelling cap\n-Low Katarina levelling cap\n-Game was over before I knew it.\n-Game does not explain that picking passive gifts is permanent\n\nA solid $20. I'm glad I threw down on this game. Apparently, it's not everyone's cup of tea. Better to watch a gameplay walkthrough, then decide for yourself. In contrary to public opinion, I am going to rate it up, as I feel it deserves a higher rating, and is a solid release on its own ground.\n\nI also found a few bugs, though I hope this has been cleared up by now. Despite my nitpicks and annoyances above, give this game a go. It is nothing revolutionary, it won't reinvent the wheel, but it is solid entertainment for a good 20 hours; which is $1/hour.

There's no sense of building up to something awesome at the end of the skill tree and no encouragement from the game to mix up your strategy or try new skills. The skills themselves have some variety but each class doesn't have many of them. I had the same complaint about Diablo 3, but it's worse here. Leveling up just isn't very exciting because you already have all your skills.\n\nThe itemization is a lot worse than the first two, also. Since every class has their own set of items, there are a lot fewer unique items and sets for each one (maybe more overall, but you'll only ever get items unique to your class).\n\nAlso, there's more "traditonal" horror elements like ghouls/ghosts/vampires, which I find kind of boring, instead of the mad science from the first two, but that's a matter of taste.\n\nAll those complaints aside, it's still a lot of fun and action packed... just kind of repetitive.","May 30, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I feel kind of bad that I never put it up… or finished it. On the other hand, it was pretty stinking awesome! Now the third installment of the game is out and it’s also blowing my mind. A built-in tank class (Protector)? Yes please!\n\nSo this takes place after the second game in which you stopped a big civil war, but the world is never truly fixed is it? No… not if we need more games in a franchise it’s not! And luckily it’s not over yet since they gave me a giant mech to play with this time. I’m a bigger fan of the thought of playing a tank (the Protector class), but not this time. I’ve figured out that class enough to know that it’s not crazy-super-tanky, it’s the regular type. It’s cool, but with my playstyle, it just wasn’t working out. Now the guy pictured above is where it’s at! He’s not a tank, but what do you need to tank when all the enemies are already exploded? Nothing really. This guy shoots out a ton of rockets and then mops up with a flamethrower! I don’t care what you think about this game, this class is fun!\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III (gosh that’s a keyboard full… well just call it Van Helsing III from here) controls much the same as in the (I assume since I haven’t played the second one yet) much like the earlier two titles. It uses the typical ARPG click to attack fest with hotkeys for select moves. It still works well here. There isn’t as much funky “can’t get there from here” as I experienced in the first game so the path-finding seems to be better. That did kind of drive me nuts in Van Helsing I. The only thing that bothers me is when loot drops off a cliff or behind something and I couldn’t get it. Now… I was in a giant suit of armor and I’m not that small, I get it, but why couldn’t my smarty-pants ghost buddy Katarina pick it up? She’s a ghost… it’s just physics! Or science… or ghost physcience… or whatever you want to call it where she can go nab my loot for me when it falls behind something she should be able to phase through. Luckily, this only happened twice or so in my 16-ish hours of playing.\n\nThere are, once again, skill trees to explore and different options to level up and all that jazz. There aren’t so many that it’s overwhelming, but there are plenty of options that will make you salivate since you’ll want them all if you’re anything like me. One look at the trees after about twenty minutes of play and I can usually map out where I want to go. I’m a big fan of moves that go boom and stuff, oh and feeling awesome. I love using the rocket move solely and the ability to strengthen them and add more rockets to your salvo just makes me happy. I think I would have loved a bit more destructible environments, but I don’t need that in every game… but it would have been neat.\n\nThe mini game where you play tower defense is back. While not my favorite part of the game, it is pretty cool. I do enjoy the fact that you can run around with your character and help your turrets and traps with all the nifty moves you’ve leveled up in the main game. (There’s an achievement for not helping though… jerks. Don’t they understand I’ve got rockets that need to go boom?) Plopping turrets and flame units and a few spike traps helps to kill the baddies before they reach your spherical ball of funkiness. Don’t let them touch the funk! It’s not the greatest tower defense, but it’s a neat addition to the game (again) and is a good way to break of up the “monotony” of stabbing and blowing things up by… stabbing and blowing things up… in a confined area.\n\nThere is also a way to manage the resistance (that I believe was in the second game). I’m not sure if it’s improved from the second game, but it was interesting. Having completed a few missions in it I can honestly say… I’m not sure what the point of it completely is, but it’s neat to have that part of the story be fleshed out some more. It’s kind of like it’s telling you that there is more going on in the world than just what you are doing. As if the world would stop if/when you left your base. While it may not be amazing, I think it makes the game a bit more full and better for having it in. That and the tower defense really just add to the experience.\n\nIn Van Helsing III you are starting to unravel the story behind Katarina and it’s pretty interesting. It’s not super gripping, but it’s one of those things that you’re glad you learned the back-story even if it wasn’t life-changing. The banter back and forth between Van Helsing and her is still good as good as it was in the original and will still give you a few chuckles throughout the game (maybe not when they are being all serious though… nah, there’s still humor there about ponies and such). All good things must come to an end and stuff, but I’ve enjoyed the series and I’m excited to see what else NeocoreGames has for me later on down the road.\n\nScore: Gewd.\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III doesn’t go above and beyond so much so that it feels completely different from the first game. There are improvements and new things to do in Van Helsing III, but nothing jumps out as “holy crap amazingly different”. Which isn’t to say it’s a bad thing. Having loved the fist installment and I’ll probably enjoy the second when I get around to it with my bud, more of the same good quality game is just fine with me especially when they continue on from themselves to tell a fun story that I want to finish. Van Helsing III is a great title to play solo or with buds. If you’re interested in this game, I’d highly recommend picking the other two up as well as the story does lead from one to the next. You don’t need to play them, but there will be spoilers to be had and I know that bothers some people.","June 4, 2015","true","16.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

They replaced them with a reusable potion that heals 100% of your health or mana.\nThe potions do still exist in the code, and I was able to get the monsters to drop them by changing some config files.

Next to Diablo III this is probably my next favourite game in this genre.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JjiJSFIY14\n\nIn Van Helsing III, the civil war is over in Borgovia, but the future looks grim. The city of weird science is in ruins, squabbling factions and criminals fight for power and a strange cult prophesizes the coming of “The end of times.” And they might be just right: A wave of uncanny events shakes the land, and it’s all connected to a mysterious creature, a former ally turned into a fearful arch-villain. Which means that Van Helsing will do what he does best: He wields weapons, prepares his deadly tricks, and hunts down the most dangerous monster who has ever lived… and this time it’s personal. He’s prepared to do anything to achieve his goal, even to face the darkest secret about the birth of the modern Borgovia.   - Highly Recommended!","June 10, 2015","true","2.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

As a side note, if you have played the other games you already know flaws with the combat. Flaws such as ignoring the rage mechanic for more damage, keeping karatrina in ghost mode so shes a health battery, building crazy amounts of crit change and crit damage, and equipping your chimera with candles that reduce his time down from 10 minutes to 4 minutes. these are the same flaws that i had with the second game in the series, not that it was a bad game, just that they didnt change the mechanics much. the class i played was a big exoskeleton with a regenerating shield, the shield started regenerating 2 seconds after not taking damage which felt really broken as i was a ranged cahracter and didnt really get hit that often. There was still the flaw that i only had 2 abilities, a flamethrower and a missile launcher, and i never felt like i needed to have any of the mine abilities. im sure its probably the same for other characters as well as this is consistant with my playthroughs of all the games. Overall as with any action rpg it was pretty much what is expected of the genre.  I had no major complaints, but nothing that amazed me, if you have played the other three games it does put a conclusion on the story so i will give it a 7 out of 10 if you have played the other two, and a 6 out of 10 if you only play this one.","August 9, 2015","true","9.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

MORE LIKE HYPBRID","http://steamcommunity.com/id/THE_BATPOOL/","136 products in account","The question you must ask yourself before buying this game, is why? In fact, in my time with this game, the only question I can seem to ask myself is "Why?" Why a top down dungeon crawling RPG? Van Hellsing, the most badass monster hunter on the face of the planet, could do so much better in other generes! A game like witcher 3 would have done the character so much more justice! Skip to the end for a pros and cons list.\n\nWhy the horribly bland music? It's not good, and it's not bad, it's just bland. I just don't understand why! The OST could have been awesome! But it just falls short. Also, why the god awful menu sound? Why the horribly flat voice acting? It's not like the writing is bad, the writing is actually really good! The voice acting is just... Flat.\n\nWhy the horribly bland graphics? Much like the music, the graphics are not good, and they are not bad, they are simply bland. The graphics are just there. They don't stand out because I guess the devs wanted a realistic vibe? Why the lack of animation? The game feels dead! Preset death animations! No physics! Nothing! That combined with bland graphics, and the world feels like a reanimated corpse!\n\nThe gameplay itself is fairly rubbish, it's nothing you haven't seen before in ANY OTHER RPG! The combat feels dead to. Recycled sounds, etc. And Van Helsing himself as I'm sorry to report, is a boring ♥♥♥ character. When I think of Van Helsing, I think the following: "Cocky, arrogant, powerful, armed to the teeth, GIANT HATS, wooden stakes, crosses, etc." This, has stripped Helsing of almost all that but his giant hats. He's just action hero 101, with a pinch of wit.\n\nSo before I reach my conclusion, have some pros and cons!\n\nPROS:\n\n-Van Helsing\n-Big hats\n-Van Helsing fans will enjoy the game\n\nCONS:\n\n-Boring music\n-Boring graphics\n-Bad animating\n-Boring in general\n\nConclusion:\nWhy? Seriously, why does this game exist? It's not like the last two were best sellers! It's not like it's that creative! So why make this game? More importantly, why buy this game? Go buy FATE or Torchlight II, both of which deliver more updated experiences. As for myself, I will continue to play this because I enjoy the concept of a badass monster hunter, no matter how underdone it may be.\n\nLike the review? Want to see more serious reviews?

This one needs a little work.\n\nThere are lots of bugs. Several quests don't complete correctly. Steam achievements don't work yet. The maps are a lot shorter than the first 2 games and there's less to do. Level design is more linear and uninspired compared with the previous games. Potion functionality has been changed to a timer (for the better imo) in that there are no potion items, but aura skills are reused so there's still +chance to drop potions. Classes aren't actually "classes." The skill trees from the first 2 games were just split up and a class is basically a limited build option. Instead of having a fairly large skill tree and some combination skills, the classes are limited to 6ish skills and 6ish auras. Technically the first 2 games would count as having more classes since you could mix and match your own skill choices. VH3 adds unique artwork to each class, so that's something I guess. Spell effects on inclines still render horizontally, so it looks pretty bad. There's errors in item tooltips and enemy descriptions. Skills are terribly unbalanced and don't really "synergize" well with each other, which also kinda defeats the purpose of a "class." Also, I bought it with the 10% off discount, but now it's 20% off for some reason.\n\nThat said, it's only a $13 game. The music, voice acting, and sound effects are great. I liked the overall story arc this one completes from the first 2 games. The art and animation is fantastic.\n","May 24, 2015","true","28.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

This iteration of the series is very different in a lot of ways from the first two, though it plays a bit more like VH1 to me, which is my preference.\n\nOn the plus side, like its predecessors it's a very good-looking game with excellent voice acting and characterization--Van Helsing and Katerina are as entertaining as ever, and the quests are imaginative and fun in terms of keeping you both mentally and physically occupied. The pace seems less frenetic, and the locations are more like those in VH1, open and interesting, less jammed with meaningless  explosions and low level trash mobs every two feet and far less confusing than the opening of VH2.\n\nI personally have not found it buggy, but there *are* all kinds of annoyances, like almost no loot drops (on Hard difficulty) long cooldowns on potions, a slow level process and reinstatement of the original level 30 cap, not to mention  the ability of offscreen enemies to attack and wipe you out when you can't see or target them, etc. I also wish the option to bring in your old character and or at least play the old classes was here- I miss my vanilla ranged hunter and thaumaturge. The 6 new classes with just a few skills each are rather disappointing after the first two games and their intricate skill trees, more flashy than really interesting to develop, kind of style over substance, and the VERY stingy skill point allocations mean that you generally stick with what skills you start with because there's no room to experiment with a new skill.  (Gold to re-spec, and essences to enchant are  also much scarcer so far than the first two games in my experience.)\n\nSo, is this a perfect game? Not in the least. But it is an entertaining and interesting seven or eight hours of solid casual arpg play, and hopefully will be improved and fleshed out a bit more if all three games are integrated in the future. I recommend waiting a bit for a few patches if you have doubts, or sticking with the first two games for now if importing your character is important to you. For the price, as some have said, you get what you pay for here, and not much beyond that, but I don't in any way feel ripped off, especially if there are truly plans to merge the three games and hopefully address some of the issues above.\n","May 24, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

This iteration of the series is very different in a lot of ways from the first two, though it plays a bit more like VH1 to me, which is my preference.\n\nOn the plus side, like its predecessors it's a very good-looking game with excellent voice acting and characterization--Van Helsing and Katerina are as entertaining as ever, and the quests are imaginative and fun in terms of keeping you both mentally and physically occupied. The pace seems less frenetic, and the locations are more like those in VH1, open and interesting, less jammed with meaningless  explosions and low level trash mobs every two feet and far less confusing than the opening of VH2.\n\nI personally have not found it buggy, but there *are* all kinds of annoyances, like almost no loot drops (on Hard difficulty) long cooldowns on potions, a slow level process and reinstatement of the original level 30 cap, not to mention  the ability of offscreen enemies to attack and wipe you out when you can't see or target them, etc. I also wish the option to bring in your old character and or at least play the old classes was here- I miss my vanilla ranged hunter and thaumaturge. The 6 new classes with just a few skills each are rather disappointing after the first two games and their intricate skill trees, more flashy than really interesting to develop, kind of style over substance, and the VERY stingy skill point allocations mean that you generally stick with what skills you start with because there's no room to experiment with a new skill.  (Gold to re-spec, and essences to enchant are  also much scarcer so far than the first two games in my experience.)\n\nSo, is this a perfect game? Not in the least. But it is an entertaining and interesting seven or eight hours of solid casual arpg play, and hopefully will be improved and fleshed out a bit more if all three games are integrated in the future. I recommend waiting a bit for a few patches if you have doubts, or sticking with the first two games for now if importing your character is important to you. For the price, as some have said, you get what you pay for here, and not much beyond that, but I don't in any way feel ripped off, especially if there are truly plans to merge the three games and hopefully address some of the issues above.\n","May 24, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

While it's a pretty big deal to be honest, VHIII is still the same Van Helsing game we loved.\n\nIt has some negatives like the difficulty is not balanced: hard is super easy, but the difficulty above that is punishingly difficult (I'm saying coz I'm not a regular arpg gamer). The game has less side quests and puzzles than the previous installments which makes the game more grindy which is not a good thing. It doesn't bring new elements to the series either.\n\nBut it has some good things as well. The story is more enjoyable than the previous games, Katerina's side story is particularly well written. The ending is satisfying unlike some other franchizes. The artstyle of the areas is the best in this episode, and also the level design is quiet good. I enjoyed the boss fights as well. They bring some freshness to the usual game play.\nThe soundtrack is also the best here.\n\nOverall is a fun and solid closure of the series. If you enjoyed the previous games and you can live with the fact that you need to start a new character you will enjoy this game.\nIf you were not a fan of the previous episodes, there is no reason for you to buy this.\nIf you are a newcomer, play the first game which is the most original and complete experience of the series.

I just loved it, i don't get all the negative reviews and if you played the first two, you just must play this one also.\n\nMost important of all we get Katarina's backstory.","October 21, 2015","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Best part of the game is the mini deathtrap game but with the current chars just need to camp the mobs entrance gates and thats it, shame really as the maps are huge and need to be ported to the "Deathtrap" game ASAP, infact would even say if they bothered to port the chars and maps from this version to "Deathtrap" would be able to get at least 100 hours worth of play time, think they have walked the wrong income stream with this version.","October 12, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat feels awful, like you are not even touching the enemies, which is my main gripe. However, the UI is also confusing and there is no "tutorial" meaning you do not have a clue what to do if you are not entirely familiar with the series. I would not recommend as the combat is so bad, and because of the nature of the game it is 70% combat.","May 26, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played 1 and 2 , then play 3  for the story.\n\nI played as the constructer and for the first 30min kept forgeting I now had robots to fight for me and wound up rushing in to the fight and dying ,lol.","July 9, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This also makes quest rewards like additional level ups.\n+) Headquarter doesn't tell you to come back immediately. You still have to go back during the quest but it's better than Van Helsing II which tells you to come back immediately: Huge Buzzkill.\n+) Lady Katarina has become more amazing woman.\n+) Lady Katarina became tougher.\n+) Healing and Mana potions has become some sort of basic skills with cooldown. They are now infinite.\n+) Images for Rings and Amulets became more stylish.\n+) More Images for trophies.\n+) I love the background music.\n+) The mood is even greater than before.\n+) No additional mana cost for higher skill level.\n+) There aren't that many army commending quests.\n+) Chimera levels up faster.\n+) Some of the land marks were amazing!\n+) It was nice to see max level being set. This seems more propriate considering the length of game play.\n+) Shops have good items time to time.\n+) Dialogues were really interesting.\n\n-) They shouldn't have changed the classes. They should've just added more.\n-) Bunking Van Helsing character like second one was terrible move. What was even worst was that Van Helsing character can now only use ranged weapons.\n-) Van Helsing character's skill window was not even finished!! There was only one skill in each tab for his skills menu! That's not a bug, that is just not finished! What the heck man?! Get a grip man!\n-) Character description was wrong. For Umbralist it should've been 'Hit and away' not 'Hit and run'. Run sounds like actually runing away: far.\n-) Skill description for 'Blink Assault' should've been different. Instead of saying 'Simultaneously hit six enemies' which sounds like you won't be able to do anything until the action is done, they should've said something like 'casts a shadow that hits 6 enemies.'\n-) You still can't do side-quests or events after the main quest is done. Some main quests pop up all of a sudden. What is this? We're supposed to fail or ignore the quests you made for days or months?! Why put'em there then huh? Do we need to do a web search and get spoiled in order to do all of them? What's the point?! Don't expect users to play your game more than once. That's arrogance. I did but Not everyone would do that. Wake up, get a grip man!\n-) Skill description for 'Hunter's Rejuvenation' is wrong. It starts from +3 hp, not +10.\n-) In Empyrean defense mission, they made ink portal hard to notice. This obvious is on purpose. This kind of approach towards adjusting difficulty is that of 90s. Come on! Wake up man! Game industry needs to be developed! Not go backwards.\n-) There are some places that once you get in it is hard to get out simply because some giant terrain object is making your cursor unable to click out of there. Come ON MAN! GET A GRIP FOR GOT SAKES! THAT IS SO BASIC! I appreciate you put a lot of perodies that we can laugh about but do that after dealing with this basic things man!","May 9","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
