There are some environmental type puzzles, although they're not all that challenging - but this game isn't trying to be that in any way. UnderGarden is more about relaxation, exploration, and having something nice to look at on the screen. UnderGarden hasn't crossed that line where it's more "art" than game; it is definitely still a game, but just don't expect tricky platforming or any enemies. I'm not even sure if you could call it platforming - you just float around making cool glowing stuff grow and weird dudes play music while nobody attacks you and even explosions don't hurt, and eventually you find your way to a portal and then go some place else and do more of the same and maybe you put on a hat. I like this game; 6 out of 10, would propagate.","July 18, 2013","true","8.7"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","41","43","2","0"

Good for that slow lazy evening yet offers a bit of a challenge if going for gold.\n\nThink Creavures, Aquaria, even Sparkle 2 Evo - a slower-paced adventure with a heavy focus on mesmerising visuals and a soothing soundtrack. The aim of the game is to pollenize the underwater flora and explore the levels for secrets. There's no need to rush so it's perfectly fine to just relax and take time solving the odd puzzle. For those more interested in score it's certainly possible to go for speed as each level is scored and time is recorded. Something to appeal to both casual and core gamers.\n\nThe puzzle design is not ground-breaking but does what it has to do without compromising the relaxing nature of the game too much. There are lever puzzles, push-buttons that have to be held down (or up!) by special seeds, and some other physics-based puzzles. Some puzzles have alternative, less obvious solutions that lead to secrets and bonus collectibles so it's certainly worth the while to experiment a little and try to explore every nook and cranny.\n\nI suppose I would recommend the game to anyone looking for a decent time without the fast pace of more modern games. It's not often that I play casual games like this, but the visuals and an overall calm atmosphere are hard to pass up.","May 26, 2014","true","5.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

Your only objective is to get to the end of the level, and you can't be injured, so all the collectables feel rather arbitrary--but what game isn't? It's ambient and weird in ways that I don't think were necessarily intended, suggesting much, offering practically nothing.

As a game tagged to be a "relaxing casual puzzle" experience, Undergarden shines. In a world of hype, it is exactly what it claims to be.\n\nHave the flu, a concussion, a hangover, had only 3 hours of sleep this week, but still want to play a game? Play Undergarden. Annoyed with coworkers, significants, laggy servers, patch day or your throttled internet? Play Undergarden.\n\nFloat through botanical space caves, enjoying the tranquil visuals, sounds and motions. No one is going to send you a tell that you are a $%&# for supposedly taking their leather belt. You won't get shot and spat upon if you go AFK in order to take meds, call the doctor, puke your guts out or slip into a well-needed coma. Even if you have trouble with a puzzle, you will still be swaddled in a cocoon of glowy fauna and soothing, tinkly atmospheric sounds until you get it "right".\n\nThe Undergarden is a meditative experience. Providing you don't have a weird compatibility issue, like the other couple bad reviews I saw, you will find your "relaxing casual puzzle" game here, if you want it.","January 18, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

(The musicians' music sometimes dissonantly clashes with the otherwise good background music.)\n\nWhile the first third of the game is nice and relaxing, I didn't find the rest of the game particularly calm, as increasing amounts of quick and precise (and lucky) actions are needed to reach collectibles, and later to even finish levels. While the controls are atmospheric and good enough for the slower part of the game, they are not responsive or reliable enough for the more action-ey parts. And anyway who wants action and platformer elements in a supposedly relaxing game? >_>\n\nI recommend the game for the relaxing parts, beautiful flowers and lights, the cuteness, the puzzles requiring wits instead of quick action.\n\nBut recommend it reluctantly because of the more stressful parts, and the spiky&mineral visuals of some of the 2nd half.\n\n(I got hopelessly stuck in the last map because of the ♥♥♥♥ing cannon puzzles.

Mechanics involve moving and triggering various plants and "entities" in the 2D environment, with gravity triggers and so on.\n\nIt's probably aimed more at children, it's certainly not heavy on action, etc etc, but that's fine - if you like 2D esoteric platformers, and have young children, this is quite an acceptable choice.","May 5","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This itself was not in a lack of interest, but to another video game that took said interest.\n\n\nIt was my girlfriend at the time who found interest in the game and began playing it. Now, I had been playing some games that stress my hardware, but this game was no where near the extent of the other games at the time.\n\nHence my surprise when my PSU exploded when she was playing this game. Typically, I would have excused this as a hardware issue on my part and would have not had any discomfort with the ownership of the game... Until it happened again. And again. Strike three was where I decided to make a sub category entitled, "Games of Shame," that includes games that are either unplayable or that I just don't typically like, and placed the game into said category.\n\nFrom what I was able to play and/or witness, it is quite a beautiful game well suited for the casual/indie demographics.

Bought it on sale, would appreciate it a little bit more if it were ftp, but it needs more work. Not worth two dollars, might be a game for some, but take a closer look in steam store and you will find other games to fill your free time with - not this.","March 21, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","5","23","0","0"

You would be better served by changing £6.99 into 1p pieces and trying to force them all down your bellend. At least that would involve a sense of danger and some form of challenge.","February 28, 2011","false","0.2"," 11 of 38 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","11","38","0","0"
