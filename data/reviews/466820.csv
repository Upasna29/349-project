This type of game has been my go-to bread and butter forever, and Zenodyne R absolutely delivers.  The gorgeous 2-D sprites and pixelated soundtrack are enthrallingly nostalgic, and the gameplay is straightforward and flies by at a fast pace.  While Zenodyne is not innovative, it doesn't need to be.\n\nWhat is a little innovative and modern is the progression of unlockables.  As you complete missions, you earn Technical Points (TP).  You use these TP to unlock new ships, extra credits, and lore.  Compared to the past where you simply die over and over to farm the continue credits necessary to complete the game, Zenodyne rewards you for performing better during the mission, choosing Hard mode, and not losing lives.\n\nAlso innovative is the ability to choose easier or harder versions of the second half of each mission.  At the halfway point, you're given the decision to pick either Easy or Hard.  I thought this was a cool addition because it doesn't force you to suffer quite so harshly against a boss you find especially difficult.\n\nA couple minor qualms: the Medals that you collect on-screen are obnoxiously large and distract you from enemies' shots, and the menus are needlessly difficult to navigate as you can't press B to go back (you have to move up and down on the d-pad and select "Back").\n\nNonetheless, that's not nearly enough to stop me from recommending Zenodyne.  You know what you're getting into.  And it's a ton of fun. :-)","May 29","true","1.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

This did not sway my thinking in anyway, all opinions are my own.\n\nZenodyne R is a remake (hence the "R") of the original Zenodyne with elements of another title in the series, Zenohell. This title was meant to address "flaws" made in Zenohell, along with delivering a brand-new experience to players.\n\nShort ReviewZenodyne R is a fun shoot-'em-up from the guys over at Grybanser Fox. The reason I say fun is because it was very enjoyable to play through the game, gradually unlocking more things and discovering the lore behind it.\n\nLong ReviewTo start this part off, I'd like to point out that HeavyViper, the Musical Composer, did a wonderful job creating the soundtrack for this game. It was great to listen to while playing and fit the theme well.\n\nZenodyne R improves upon the "mistakes" made during the development of Zenohell. What Zenodyne R includes are animations for the player and enemies, amazing level designs, awesome sprites, enemy AI, and more. These things together are what make Zenodyne R a great sequel to the original. While I can't mention a lot of things without spoiling the game, the storyline and lore are well made, also.\nWhile you continue throughout Zenodyne R, many things are unlocked for all playthroughs. Things such as extra ships, more continues, and more game modes are made available. This will keep the player coming back for more and more.\nAs for the actual gameplay, Zenodyne R improves upon the classic shoot-'em-up formula. Enemies, powerups, bosses, etc. Extreme customization features are included, like a debug menu, window size, controls, screen rotation, scanlines (which are really cool to use, would recommend), antialiasing, Vsync, and more.\n\nPros\n-Unlocks to make us come back for more\n-A greatly improved Zenohell and original Zenodyne\n-Great effort on the developer's side\n-Amazing soundtrack\n-A great sequel, continuing the story of the original two games\n-Fun shmup\n-Extreme customization features that made my experience great, and will do the same to yours\n-Bug-Free, at least in my time playing\n\nCons\n-None to list, the game is great and I have found nothing wrong with it.\n\nZenodyne R is a great game for both casual and hardcore players. It delivers a fun time for the player. I would totally recommend it. My score for the game is 9.5/10, totally honest.\nThank you, Grybanser Fox, for making such an awesome game!","May 29","true","23.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","10","15","3","0"

Zenodyne strikes the right balance of filling the screen with things to dodge, but not so much that you can't get out of most situations with good reactions. Each stage will start you off with a bit of a warm up, throwing smaller enemies until the game asks you to choose to fly through the easy or the hard version of the level, allowing for a branching pathway and letting you decide how confident you feel on the fly. The boss ships attack patterns are particularly well done, forcing you into uncomfortable positions while you wait for an opening to let you get back into a position where you can start shooting again.\nGraphics are crisp and the things that kill you stand out well from the backgrounds, very reminicant style to that of early Genesis shooters.\nThe soundtrack is excellent, I believe rendered on an actual Genesis sound chip, using a lot of the same tricks and sounds that will be very nostalgic to a lot of people.\n-\n(Edit: The game has been patched to give out more tech points than before, fixing the following issue.)\nI find the progression system that is used to unlock things like more continues (eventually a free play mode), extra ships and additional flavour text to be a bit stingy in handing out the medals used to unlock these things. Making progression in that regard a bit grindy, but I think part of that is me needing to get good.\n-\nA difficult but fair shooter with smooth controls that work well with an analogue thumbstick I don't regret purchasing this game at all even if it may be some time before I get good enough to see everything in the game.\n\nA little gameplay I recorded here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tf2zC686VA&feature=youtu.be","June 3","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A lot went into this fixing the flaws of Zenohell and expanding on new ideas.  For starters, the game is overall more fine tuned for balance in difficulty and the ship choices than Zenohell imo.   The game adds easy and hard routes to take so that less experienced players do not have to get crushed by the hard route.  As the player has a choice of difficulty along the way, the game doesn't feel very cheap or unfair, and is not too overbearing or too much of a cakewalk.\n\nThe game also gives a good sense of rewarding the player.  Complete stages, beat hard routes, get through stages without dying, and other tasks will give you additional tech points that go towards unlocking additional content.  The game starts you off with limited continues unlike Zenohell, but you can earn more.  The better you play, the faster the unlocks will come.  Even if you credit feed with what you have to the end of the game you still get tech points so it gives everyone a chance that is not a hardcore shmup veteran.\n\nSeveral new animations added to the player's ship for movement and ship banking are implemented as well, making them more visually appealing while playing.  I feel that the detail of enemy sprites has gone up as well, especially one that I can't spoil in this review from it's predecessor.  ESPECIALLY this one because it gave me chills seeing how much more menacing it appears this time around.  Makes the one in the previous game look like a baby.\n\nAs many people pointed out with Zenohell that it's soundtrack was nice, the soundtrack for Zenodyne R is once again fantastic.  A different approach is taken this time to the tune of a Sega Genesis sound chip.  The way the visuals come together with the music, it really is incredible.  It truly makes me feel like I'm playing a retro game, especially since this makes nods at a few other shmups along the way.  It's enough to make me wonder how well this game could be imported to an actual Sega Genesis cartridge.\n\nI really hope that other people have as much fun with this as I am, and that they also hold the same opinion that this is a step in a better direction than Zenohell.  I'm not saying Zenohell was particularly bad, it's just this game feels more "right" with game mechanics and atmosphere.","May 29","true","4.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
