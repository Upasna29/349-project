I've bought crap games for more so I can't really complain.\nIf you are a casual gamer don't pick this one up, if you like to die alot to progress and retro feeling gameplay then you should buy it.\nIf you don't like how the game looks in the screenshots/video then you shouldn't buy the game seeing as it's basically taken straight from the game no sugarcoating it like some games do.\nI just hope the devs will make it possible for users to make/upload their own levels.","September 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","0"

I know you don't mean any buttons on my controller because there's no support for that, so I make a good guess, hit enter, and am rewarded with success: new game, load game, or options. there actually are no options; two separate volume controls and a window size control. don't think about rebinding keys because it isn't happening for you. oh, and if you hit escape from the second menu, it pings helpfully and superimposes the "PRESS TO START" command over it. awesome.\n\nanyway, start the game. it has some control instruction which is handled very straightforwardly by flatly scrawling it across the screen with a "hit h to toggle" command, so at least there's no mystery here; hit space to jump, and... s a i l across the screen like Luigi from Mario 2 just stepping out of a moonlander. mein gott, is the control and movement intended to be this mushy or is the game just that painfully laggy? my machine runs Skyrim on ultra-high quality with no problem; it handles Risk of Rain on Monsoon dfficulty three or four loops in, no problem... if this is bogging me down it's the game, not the computer, and that's assuming that isn't just ... how this game plays. the store page video didn't really shed any light on it either. the combat seems like it could be good but the opioid languor with which it proceeds makes it impossible to tell. oh yeah, and that other basic I mentioned above? there's no pause. inventory doesn't pause; it just obscures a still-active screen with the inventory (a decision other games than this have made, granted, and which I fail to understand in any context outside of online play). map doesn't pause either; it doesn't provide a map - oh no, it takes you TO an overworld map, the existence of which was not hinted at beforehand and which ends your progress in the level it dumps you in at the start. and escape... well, escape just pings stupidly and achieves nothing.\n\nso in summary I cannot recommend this game without some serious fixing; it seems like a kernel of a good idea executed very frustratingly.","November 1, 2015","false","0.3"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

Oh my god!\nI don't think that you know how to programming, and please learn how to use it first, i don't think a indie can  make game without learning program.\nWell i just want to say, the launch price is $9.99, and drop it to $4.99 without 2 day, this is not a good marketing strategy.\nAnd by using game engine to make game, it is more easy, so you just add some more level but no careful game design?\nI suggest you play more game and learn from them first, i don't think you have played much game and know about game design.\nLastly, i don't think this is a final product for release to sale, it have bugs, and why you need customer report bug to you, not you try your game first? I don't think play game is helping developer to find bug, well this is not a early access game.\nWhen you release it, you need to know that customer is playing your game, not testing you game, this is a different of final product and early access product.\n\n22 September\nEvil Hazard Update 1.2\n1. window title fixed\n2. minor bugs fixed\n3. screen tearing fixed\n\nUpcoming changes:\nFull screen mode support\n\nwhat is this?

Strange that they have you use Q+W to attack, E to block. Basic default typically is WASD (or arrows with Z+X for attack). Whatever happened to configuring your own controls, just something to think about when designing games. A gamepad would have been nice on this, too bad. It has a good concept but the bugs need major reworking (ie. hitboxes are off, blocking works 50/50). Also the hazards are too tight together, meaning you jump avoiding one spike to hit the other. If the general idea is to progress by trial and error then it needs to in my opinion gradually work you into it and not such a high chance for failure. I'm just nit picking now but the tracklist could be widened, it's literally one track on loop. You have three screen modes: small, large and full screen.\n\nIf it was in EA I would give it more grace but it's just a pretty high price for something that is hardly playable due to bugs and is supposively feature complete. Updates are meant to add to your game and not the completion of your game.\nIt sold me on the pixel art and the fact that it was on sale, but that's currently all it has going for it.\n-- If it ever gets any better I will likely update, until then I have to give this a pass --","November 29, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This wasn't that.  It's incredibly punishing right from the beginning and the controls aren't good enough to justify this kind of torture.  Music is bad but the overall graphics remind me of Castlevania which is a plus.  In the end though this is just too damn punishing like nobody tested it before it released.","January 27","false","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It needs a lot more work, but the devs appear to be working on it actively. Just be aware that if you buy it at this point you're going to have a very mediocre game on your hands. On the other hand, I'm optimistic that this game will turn out to be good once they've finished it. As with all EAG, decide for yourself whether you want to take the risk of buying in early and supporting the devs.","September 29, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
