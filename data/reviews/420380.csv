I think this is among the best fishing games of all time.  In fact, I'm now on a journey to play every single fishing game after I played this.  This really holds up.  I declare it the second best fishing game on Steam.  If you want something that is really cutting-edge, play Dovetail Games' Euro Fishing.  But if you wanted something a little bit more arcade-y and has that almost-10-years-old retro feel, pick this up for sure.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcBpmY8obro\n\nIt is unfortunate that the resolution is low.  The aspect ratio is only 4:3.  But this game works and it's really fun.  One thing I have no doubt you will be impressed by is the Xbox 360 controller support.  In my opinion it's one of the most important aspects of any game, but on an old port it makes it playable right out of the box.  If you saw a 1989 flight simulator on Steam would you complain that it is old, or would you be happy it is available?  This game is from 2009.  That was awhile ago.  Maybe someday they will revisit this franchise.\n\nThis is one of those fishing games where you can change your viewing angle so that you can see your lure in the water or you can view your perspective from the boat.  Not a lot of games allow you to control the lure in the water like this...  It's not a very simulator-y type of feel but it's fun.  In many fishing games that I played, the fish models are really ordinary and boring looking but in this game they look very cool!  Almost cartoonish.  And even the animation when the fish goes to bite on the lure is very exciting.\n\nMUST OWN if you are a fishing fan that can tolerate a lower video resolution.","January 9","true","0.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

The sound quality is also atrocious, there was zero QA when this was ported to the PC, as a casual fishing sim goes, it's pretty good, but not worth the hassle with all its technical shortcomings. Rapala Pro Fishing on PC way back in 2004 had better gameplay and visuals and still works great on modern hardware while this game from 2009 is just trash on PC.\n\nVerdict: REFUNDED!","May 30","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
