Crap like Blood on the Sand, Deadly Premonition or that one where the President of the USA pilots a mech? Yeah, this is nothing like it.\n\nIt's complete garbage. It's Cry of Fear with a vaguely racist Eastern European sense of humour. If you're as dumb as me to drop ten bucks on this then you want your head looking at. Are you thinking of buying it and making funny videos laughing over it? Don't bother, pick a game that isn't painful to play.

I was curious as to whether this game would be the B-movie trash fest the makers claim it to be.... It's not. Let's start with the voice actiing... Oh god, the voice acting. Not only is it obvious the actors recorded their lines over a cheap microphone setup, but you also don't understand what they're saying half the time. Sometimes their accents become too thick to decypher (the main character's especially) or for some baffling reason the volume drops to a whisper. And why must my character freeze in place every time he starts talking with a person? Must he devote all his intellectual and physical prowess just to hold a simple conversation?\n\nThe AI isn't bad so much as very simple. Enemies just come running at you, spawning in from out of nowhere. (Think Aliens: Colonial Marines... better yet, don't) A few bright spots is that the gun play is all right, if nothing new, and the price isn't outrageous, although I'm probably not going to finish this game.\n\nBuyer beware. The makers of this game try to hide the flaws in their work under a paper-thin veneer of poor humor and an 'Oh, you're not meant to take it so seriously' frontage. Do not expect much from this product. Don't even expect an options menu (cause there is none, seriously).","May 1, 2014","false","1.4"," 128 of 183 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","128","183","2","5"

The player takes control of Peter O’ Brannon, a detective who is sent to investigate the death of an elderly man in New England. Upon arriving at his cabin, you realise that all is not right and something sinister is going on.\nThe game makes a poor first impression. The game starts with ultra-low quality artwork and a surprisingly small amount of menu options, there is absolutely no configuration options. To configure the controls you have to edit a text file.\nGameplay consists of exploring bland locations, completing bland objectives and killing bland enemies. In order to complete the games puzzles, you often have to go back to rooms you have already explored to find that objects have magically spawned there. When you finally get past the obstacle, the game is kind enough to spawn an enemy directly behind you.\nThe graphics are bad. Into the Dark features completely antiquated visuals.\nThe voice acting for the game is beyond awful. For me it was nearly impossible to hear what is being said, it made it nearly impossible to follow the story.\nIf that is not enough, there are several technical issues; invisible walls block a door or you could stuck in such a wall. Loading up a saved game, starting a new level and even just doing nothing: all of them can cause crashes.\nThe best part in Into the Dark is that it includes the complete movie of Night of the Living Dead.\nMy advice take a look at other horror games.

I was super excited about this game because it sounded like it was tailor-made for someone like me. That much is true for the content of the game (at least the half hour or so that I saw of it). The problem is that the game is almost unplayable. The sound quality is ridiculous; it sounds like the voices were recorded in one day over Skype. The soundtrack consists of one Midnight Syndicate track on a loop and a never-ending shuffle of footsteps, regardless of whether or not you're moving. There is no way to adjust settings in-game; you have to edit a file in order to re-map controls and the like. Most of the puzzles are solved by pressing up against random objects in the room until you pick up the one you're looking for. Overall, the mechanics foiled what was probably otherwise a funny, kitschy game.","October 12, 2014","false","0.6"," 38 of 51 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","38","51","3","0"

Its not even "just bad". It is terrible.\n\nI get it is supposed to be a low-budget "trash" game, and it seems like it could be fun, but its just too damn buggy and annoying to be fun.\n\nI can forgive the boring repetitive rooms and horrid voice/sounds, due to the low budget, the following list is just what annoyed me the most, and stopped me from playing it. any further:\n\n- Red Key / Red Door old-skool gameplay, except it is always not clear what the key to proceed to the next area actually is, and sometime it doesn't even appear unless you have done something else first (what was once an empty room can later have a critical item in it), the game even mentions this. This is just plain annoying and no reason why it should exist in the first place.\n\nExpect plenty of roaming thorugh the repetitive levels again and again, looking for the next damn interactable object.\n\n\n- UI might as well not exist. Approaching a door says, "Key Required" whether you have the key or not. You have to press "USE" to open the door. In game hints are pretty useless.\n\n\n- Extremely Buggy. Crashes quite often, saves disappear or corrupt. Sometimes loading the game has zero health and you die straight away, or items are missing etc.\n\n\n- Very imbalanced.

The game, when it works, plays like a very hastily and poorly modded fps from saaaaaaaaaaaaay ten years ago? Twenty? I dunno. It's bad. But they have my money as well as the cash of all the poor peeps above and below me on the review list. So, at least someone somewhere is happy because of this game.\n\nPros:\n\n-Short download time?\n\n-You always hear your footsteps. This may not seem like a pro, but I list it here because the game a) doesn't have many/any pros and b) because I would like to attribute the never ending clunking boot on wood floor sound to the protagonist constantly dancing in place off screen. I'm choosing to imagine that this is the case rather than that it is just another example of horrible programming. Because I'm a glass half full kinda guy. And I have a massive imagination.\n\n-Maybe the creator's finished off a house payment cause bought their game? Maybe they had a nice lunch? For two if they're supes a' dupes frugal? Maybe that cheapo twofer lunch turned in to a fruitful, marital relationship for them? Maybe you would have gotten into a car wreck or died horribly if you'd gone out and tried to do something worthwhile instead of taking the time to buy and download this game. That's right. It's a possiblity. If that was the case, this turd sandwich just saved your balogna grubbin' life. Totally plausible.  I'm going to imagine that's the case so I can sleep at night with this still residing in my Steam library, mocking me with its existence, a constant reminder that I paid for it.\n\nCons:\n\n-After purchasing it, you have to get someone else to buy it too or you'll die in seven days. Luckily, for you at least, this game has sucked out my will to live.\n\n-Suuuuuuuupah buggy. And not in a funny or enjoyable way with craptacular renderings, objects comically going through walls due to poodoo collision, and other crazy visual effects that you can document and laugh at so much as an, "Oh, there's my desktop and an error message. Again." kinda way.\n\n-Some settings require adjusting an .ini and the game tells you as much. Lollios in a box of lols, true believers.\n\n-You pay for it. Like, this would be an okay game that somebody pops out for free as a means of getting their career up n' runnin' but ten daru is pricey for what plays like a buggy mod of 007: Goldeneye with improved graphics. Feel free to put quotation marks on "improved" if you're feelin' picky.\n\n-Think of a con. Flip a coin. If it's heads, it has it. And my money. It totes has my monies regardless of which side of the coin you see.\n\n-You feel like a failure after buying this game. A rube and a failure. With ten fewer dollars in your bank account. That you'll never have back. You coulda got a value meal at Wendy's, large and with all the fixin's, but nay. NAY! You fell for paltry advertising, you skimmed over descriptions, and totally failed to look up the background of an unknown game. You instead went all Fry meme style and said, "Take my money!" And they took it. Oh, they took it. And now you feel ashamed everytime you see this game listed in your library. Mocking you with it's lame achievements. You don't want your Steam friends to know you have it. Heck, you can't even complete the game just to feel like you used what you bought because it's a crashtacular crashmo with extra crash gravy on the side and crunchy crash chips on top. So, instead, you describe your failure in a review, putting your own purchasing experience in the third person so you don't have to consciously own what ya did.\n\n-You waste, like, five minutes writing the game a bad review because it totes took ten dollars from you that you'll never get back and you're all butthurt over it.","March 24, 2015","false","1.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","2"

A great example of this is Rat Hunter (FPS) or Harvester (old point and click with FMV). I heard a lot of people say Into the Dark was a buggy pile of poop but was over the top, outrageous, and entertaining. I can put up with poorly made buggy games, but this came is in the class of:\n\nSo Bad, that is really is Bad.\n\nThe game is terribly frustraiting, with a lot of senseless, extremely poorly executed puzzles that are game stopping.\nOften, you will find yourself referencing a walkthru or reloading because you die so easily in the same room for any random reason. In FPS games, IT HAPPENS, but the load times are long for an old looking game like this (looks 15 years old).\n\nNothing is explained well, you pretty much run around a series of rooms trying to figure out how to advance to the next room/rooms. This makes progression extremely slow and cumbersome. There are a lot of other features, situations, humor, etc., but you can never appreciate or enjoy them because you are too busy trapped in some place because there is no clear way to get out. I don't expect hand holding but the game is very vague and the mechanics are so poor they do not marry to what you need to do to progress.\n\nA lot of times, any in-game speech or text alludes to what you must do, but the game level doesn't match up with what they are talking about. "Put the bomb in the hole under the door". There are lots of doors and none have a hole - for example. The mechanics are extremely inconsistent with the game engine so prepare to screw up a lot.\n\nIn fact, the puzzles are so bad, there are pictures of the game developer in the game giving you hints.\n\nIn the level I mentioned, the other problem was just learning that you have to make a bomb. In a prior level, you could shoot an explosive "cube" from a distance to blast through. In another level, you find a cube, but it doesn't explode if you shoot it. So the rules change for that level without the player being told. You see some explosive gas tanks but they kill you regardless of difference. Once you get the bomb making materials, you have to put in on a lab table, but you are not told that , or which one. You just have to use the walkthru.\n\nIf this was some game where you are told there is way to craft things, and these are the hotkeys, then that would make sense. But this is designed to operate as a simple FPS, so YEAH, the puzzle solutions totally do not marry well.\n\nThe generic monster enemies charge you and pound you to death.\nThere is no way to sneak around them and if you blow your ammo, you are screwed.\nThat's fine, but sometimes, you can die in 5 hits or 1 hit. It's pretty random.\nSame with the enemies, one monster took 3 hits to die, another took 8.\nHeadshots, heartshots, stuff like that don't even matter. So it's all random.\nThis means, even if you conserve ammo, you can blow your ammo, and still not bring the enemy down.\nThey can also randomly spawn.\n\nIf you want a very challenging game, give it a try, and don't use the walkthrus (even with, still challenging).\n\nIt's too bad, if the game didn't have so many puzzles slowing it down, it would be much more enjoyable. Good: the dark grittiness, the cheapo-creepy atmosphere; I even enjoyed the bad voice acting.\n\nI surmise the obstacles were designed to make the game feel longer.\nAfter playing the "Into the Woods" free "game" that comes with this, if you buy it on Steam, the flaws of Into the Dark start to make sense. Into the Woods: you wake up in a forest and aren't told anything. No problem with that. You explore some ruins, find some ammo, a key, then bad guys spawn to kill you. Each small area is gated so you must find the key to get to the next one. It can be anywhere, laying in the grass, in one of many ruins, etc.\nWhen you finally get to a certain area, the game ends. EXTREMELY short.\n\nIt seems Into the Dark is the same. Very small levels, but a lot of glitchy and almost secret puzzles, to slow down the whole thing down. Previously, this game was put out as a horror FPS. I noticed they now say it's an Adventure/FPS. LOL.\nAlso, look at the description 11 levels but 67 puzzles.\nThat's a lot of puzzles for such a small game with small "levels" (more like collection of connected rooms).\n\n\nThumbs down primarily due to:\n-Long Load Times\n-Puzzles that you didn't know were puzzles and that couldn't even be solved the way they need to, the way described, in a limited FPS game environment\n-Never got to see the boobies and hookers","April 29, 2015","false","1.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I don't know what exactly made me get this game, perhaps the motto, perhaps the cover, perhaps the tittle, or everything combined. In any case, i was going blindfolded in this. But i don't regret a thing. This game is bringing back so many F memories. I mean, since i was a kid i was playing all kind of stuff like AVP or Doom 2 or.. Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Speaking of gameplay and the horror style, this game reminded me so much of my childhood when i was playing the tittles mentioned. Nowaday games have a lot of "prepared" scarejumps, cinematic horror moments which creates more of a tension rather than a scarry moment. Back then, the horror was purely because of the dark-grim atmosphere, ambient and that no one is asking you " are you prepared to get scared, kid ? ". I feel like nowadays, the devs are somehow protecting peoples health issues and "prepare" them for a scarry moment. That's what Into the Dark has, he ♥♥♥♥ing oldschool scare jumps, scarry moments and some doses of "WTFs".\n\nRegarding gameplay, i don't have much to say, it's a pretty basic shooting game, with some pretty puzzles to create a diversity in the game and everything needed to create a minimum of interest to the players, regarding strictly the gameplay. If you are gameplay freak, well, my advice, stay away :) A game is a masterpiece combined with almost every form of art in my opinion. It has the fun factor and by that i'm reffering to the gameplay, a story, an atmosphere, visuals, almost everything you need.\n\nSince i'm a bit too young or perhaps a bit ignorant, i didn't got all the references and jokes inside the game, but reading the steam comunity and having some of my older friends playing the game, i started to get almost all the references, which makes this game more and more interesting. Last game that kept my interest like this for a long long time was Cryostasis. Although, some references that i got them really put a big laugh on my face, or at least a stupid positive smile like " i see what you did there ".\n\nTo sum it up, i really enjoyed this game simply because it brought back memories, lots of them and it was a fresh air from the daily template of games that are geting out nowadays.\n\nMy pros are: the story, really puts the wheel in your brain in motion; the atmosphere of the game which totally nails the genre of the game; the easter eggs, the references, some nicely designed rooms – and, yeah, you can watch the entire “Night of the Living Dead” flic in an ingame cinema accompanied by walking skeletons serving Schnaps.\nMy cons are: the voice fx, i can barrely understand and i'm not reffering to the accent as much as i reffer to the quality, but i hope that the next game won't have those issues; the gameplay could get better a bit, like, the puzzles improved, the AI improved and less glitchy. And the animations are also quite basic for most of the enemies.\n","February 28, 2015","true","3.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

I could write a book about it and still it wouldnt cover all aspects.\n\nIs it the next "oh look how bad it is" experience like surgeon or goat simulator?\nNope.\n\nIs it a trash game as advertised?\nYes, it has a certain B-movie atmosphere, it is extremely cheesy when it wants to be, but its not something that feels put together cheap and quickly. The sheer amount of small details hidden in all parts of the levels tells otherwise.\nAs well as the fact that political events from the last three years are covered and the game had been in development since 2011.\n\nIs it a horror game?\nIt has jump scares and goosebump moments, but thats not the essence\n\nIs it a shooter?\nYou have some challenging firefights, but thats also not the essence of the game.\n\nIs it an adventure?\nNope, while there are some interesting puzzles, most of the tasks are looking for keys and items that are used by pressing "Enter" on a single spot.\n\nIs it funny?\nOh my god, yes, it is!\n\nIs it worth the time and money?\nFor me a clear "yes" on that one.\n\nIs it a good game?\nWell, thats the point where things get complicated.\n\nIf you are one of those players who expect a game to explain everything to you, to lead and guide you, to highlight and show all you need to do, a game that pats you on your shoulder for klicking the button it has highlighted previously, run away and never look back. You have no right to be here.\n\nIf you dont have a PC that is at least between the min and the recommended specs, forget this game. When I play on my office machine, which is close to the min specs, I get all the bad behaviour people are complaining about - > sloppy physics, stuck monster, horrible AI, sloppy responsiveness. When I switch to my gaming laptop, I get superlethal soldiers chasing me around using elevators and hideouts, beutiful ragdolling, smooth gameplay...\n\nIf you dont agree to the developers arrogant demand to play the game as righthander with WASD controls, think twice. There is no option menu. And when I tell you no options menu, I am dead serious. All is changed in a script (including screen brightness, which is another, different script), and there are multiple-pages tutorials on how to do so. The devs are supportive, they will even write you custom ini scripts, but the sheer blatant arrogance to publish a game without options menu is so amazing that I am not even mad.\n\nIf you stop playing a game because of occasional crashes, turn around here. They are rare, some can be prevented, there is always a savegame to load afterwards - but you wont get through without experiencing them.\n\nIf you are a success-driven finisher, a player who is dedicated to "beat" a game as fast and efficient as possible, spend your money on something else.\n\nRead the following lines:\n\n"Mc Carthy"\n"Necronomicon"\n"Maniac Mansion"\n"Nikola Tesla"\n"Giana Sisters"\n"Commodore 64"\n"George Romero"\n"Project Paperclip"\n\nIf 4 or more didnt ring a bell, you are wrong here.\n\nHowever, if you made it so far without being sorted out, and if you are not cursed by either an IQ below the average room temperature or the unspeakable someone could call "typical German humor", you might enjoy this game to an unhealthy degree. Because it is unique, it is funny, it is intriguing - if played right.\nAnd that means taking your time, reading the ingame notes, the mission notes (triggered by "M"), tinkering around to follow the hints, reading most of the paper pieces hidden on walls, floors, drawers, listening to the dialogues (oh my god, that voice acting alone will either brake you or make you laugh) and, most of all, trying out even the most stupid things. Like getting drunk before a fight or playing a piano in a brothel full of zombie hookers.\n\nThe reward is a mixture of excellent jokes, insane easter eggs, funny references, a trashy B-Movie-storyline, shameless backtracking, dozens of "WTF" moments, some boobs and ♥♥♥♥♥s, even more trashy cutscenes and. if you get them, some really intelligent, subversive and cynical political statements.\nPlus "The Night of the Living Dead" to be seen in an ingame cinema, full lenghts, accompanied by some skeletons who claim to be extras from the movie.\n\nI still cant tell if its good for you, because so much depends on who you are.\n\nMy personal opinion is that this game, in all its trashy quirkyness, is among my all-time-favorites and gave me plenty if really entertaining hours, hopefully there are more to come. The developers should be slapped for their lazyness, arrogance and disrespect for comfort functions, but afterwards I would praise them for something that is in its better moments far more entertaining than any AAA game today.\n\nAlso, I am not stating "All people who dont find this game to be funny are stupid" as some other "fans" do, I go with "People who dont find this game to be funny are people I wouldnt invite to my parties".\n\nI love this game, but I cant tell if you will, too. At 10$ asked, you should try it yourself.\n\nPS: An interesting side note on the reviews. While they are mixed, there is a significant difference in the positive and negative reviews: Most positive reviews talk about the flaws, too, they warn, they tell "the recommendation depends on (insert variable)". Most negative reviews tell outright "its bad" or even (gosh!) "Its not funny" in a way that seems like the writer wants to tell others what to think. Some even bash those who like the game.\nSo, while they certainly failed to create a perfect game, the devs perhaps suceeded in creating a playable hater detector :D","August 12, 2014","true","13.3"," 35 of 66 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","35","66","0","5"

In a bundle.\nThis is punk rock as sh*t\n\nDepending on your view this can either be a good or a bad thing. I don't understand why everyone feels the need to point out that the developers said it was like a B-movie, but I'm going to do the same thing. In fact, I'm going to go further and say that it's more of a C-Movie. If you're not into underground gore flicks, you're probably not going to enjoy this game.\n\nThat genre translates well into this medium.\n\nNot B-horror, but C-horror and no budget horror. Look up a movie called Zombie Bloodbath by a Director named Todd Sheets - I think it's up on Youtube for free right now along with some other stuff. That's the genre we're talking about here. The worst recordings, the bottom-of-barrel editing. This game has it all, but tops it off with the worst voice acting I've ever heard. There are two ways to do horrible voice acting - good or bad. In this case, it's pretty good.\n\nI was asked to review the game...\n\nNot by the developer, but it came up from someone I know, and it had been awhile since I've picked it up and played it - so WHY NOT, I figured, I'll play it again. Sometimes the humor in it can be way, way too much to deal with - that's just the nature of low budget/no budget movies put into a game.\n\nThe mini game doesn't work at all.\n\nNever has.\n\nThe game is huge...\n\n5 gigabytes is ridiculous for something like this.\n\nIf you want something a little different...\n\nIf you want something a little different, you should look elsewhere. If you want something a lot different, you might like this. As other people have said, this game feels a lot like something you yourself could make. In fact, it seems like something you yourself could make with very little effort - even though a lot of effort probably went into it. It's made with Game Guru, which I still maintain doesn't make a game bad - and it's pretty goofy. There are some really bizarre hiccups in the game that should really be ironed out, but if you can deal with closing and reopening a game a bunch of times, they're not too bad. It's okay - get it in a bundle, or something.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","February 15","true","3.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","14","26","4","6"

Unfortunately neither these gamers nor the developer unterstand how the whole "So bad it's good"-thing works. Watching a bad and unintentionally humourus movie is like seeing someone fail and that is genuinely funny. It's like watching a skateboarder trying to do a trick but falling on his face over and over again. You just  know it is not the morally right thing to do but you still find it funny. Playing a bad game is more like being the skateboarder. While a game is still a guided experience someone else pulled out of his ***, you are in control and have to adapt to the scenarios the developer is throwing at you. That is why seeing a "Let's play" of a game like "Ride to Hell Retribution" is fun to watch the whole way through while actually playing it quickle dwindles to pure frustration.\n\n"Into the dark" has no redeeming feature whatsowver. Even the humour is never as smart or self-aware as it wants to be. Refering to quantum physics and popcultur isn't funny without a context, it's just trying way to hard. However the game doesn't stop there: The controls are slow and clunky, the key bindings very uncomfortable, the graphics subpar and WAY to dark and the shooting mechanics unimpressive and overly frustrating with enemies often spawning behind you and clipping through virtually every object. The puzzle design shall not be named as such, with unintuitive solutions and keys randomly appearing. And if you still want to play it, get ready for the same one-minute piece of music repeated over and over again, even during menus.\n\n"Into the Dark" is a bad joke that will be gone soon and rightfully so. If you want a B-movie experience I recommend "House of the Dead: Overkill". Comes without headaches.","July 10, 2014","false","1.4"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

I don´t buy more than 2-3 games per year, and the only reason I signed up with steam was the free key I got for having bought the Into the Dark Desura version almost a year ago.\n\nAnd even I tell you, that this game is really great value for the little money asked.\n\nFirst of all, forget all the morons who write bad reviews after playing less than 2 hours or having unlocked less than 40% of the achievements yet. Judging the game upon such impressions is like judging the old Star Wars movies upon the flying text in the begininng.\n\nSecond, you have to deal with the fact that the game won´t make it easy to change the controls if needed (but the default ones are good enough if you aren´t left-handed). And you have to deal with occasional crashes. These are not a big deal, as long as you exit the game after dying and follow the guidelines posted, you won´t have more than 2-3 crashes total. all of them on loading a new level. And the game creates savegames prior to the exits, so no big deal.\n\nThe game itself is weird, beautiful, excentric and strange. You have to look around carefully to get all the beautiful and fascinating details the developers crafted into the levels, and it´s totally worth it. The shooter part works really good as long as you have a fast PC, and some of the puzzles are quite interesting.\n\nBut, most of all, the ingame bonus content, the jokes, references, gags, political messages, slapstick moments and dialogues are over the top. Yes, Pete has a horrible accent, but that´s part of the game - and even part of two puzzles. Yes, the voice actors are amateurs, but they talk naturally to each other, instead of actors who read their lines alone in the studio. The visuals are ugly where showing ugly places, and stunning like the Playboy Mansion where beauty is asked for. From a technical point of view, the graphics are clearly above par.\n\nYou would have to be either stupid, ignorant or a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥ with no humor at all to find this game NOT amusing, entertaining and funny.\n\nThe Desura version was my best buy 2013, and the Ste4am version is indeed better.\n\nIf you have the wits and knowledge needed, and some good nerves for occasional crashes, it´s a best buy for sure.","June 15, 2014","true","8.1"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","15","33","0","2"

As an example, instead of offering a settings menu, it simply draws its GFX settings from your graphics cards driver settings and the resolution from your displays native resolution. Clever idea, but if you want to override it, you have to go into the setup.ini hell (which is explained pretty well in the forums and the manual).\nEnter is the default key for any environment interaction, so you have to let go your mosue to interact.\nStupid? On the contrary, that gives a good feeling that you are right now doing something in the game where you need both hands and cannot shoot in the meantime.\n\nThe developers also tricked many DRM- and Steam-opponents like me to hook up with steam by giving free Steam keys to Desura buyers. Not sure, if this is a good thing or something evil.\n\nAll those facts ignored, the game is still a matter of personal taste - and the intelligence of the player.\nIf you got the wits and the basic knowledge to at least most of the jokes, and if you are a player looking around carefully instead of rushing through the levels, there ain´t many games out there more entertaining than this one.\n\nIt´s filled with bad jokes, sinister jokes, references, political messages and a dense web of connections between all those, with so many details and depicted thoughts it can blow your mind.\n\nWhile it looks ugly, the consistency of the art design in the levels is pretty good, and most textures are extremely detailled, from the technical point of view the graphics aint bad at all.\n\nThe crashes are annoying, but not game-breaking, as there is always a savegame to go on.\n\nIn the end, the conclusion will always be "You either love it or hate it".\n\nHowever, for 10$ (or 2,50 in the Gala bundle or 6$ during the summer sale) you got the movie "Night of the Living Dead", a song by Nox Arcana AND a game with 6 - 12 hours of playtime that you will either hate or really enjoy as guilty, trashy pleasure.\nNot hard to recommend at all.","July 14, 2014","true","7.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","1"

But on the other hand, you will find yourself having fun with all the side blows, hidden remarks and strange events you will be facing that it lets you discover. But be warned, half the fun is finding everything there is to find, and it certainly won't present all its beauty on a silver platter for the lazy CoD-Player to be consumed. And be to look up a *lot* of stuff on wikipedia when it comes to historical and/or political references. At least I had to, and the depth of several findings in there only revealed itself after getting to know the details of e.g. McCarthy era America or "Project Paperclip".\n\nDon't expect a lot in graphics, it is sufficient and functional, no more. But the attention to detail the Devs put into every single room, every single table, yes even every single rack standing around is just astounding, and makes the world more alive in your head than any stunning graphics dazzler puts in their levels.\n\nAll in all, definitely not a game for everybody, but recommended nonetheless!","January 19, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"
