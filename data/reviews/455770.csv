Will come later on though so hold your panties.\n- I think I yelled too much at my girlfriend\n\n10/10 would recommend my bearded friends again!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6zEPg5WY6U0","April 1","true","0.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","8","9","3","0"

Fortunately for me I could plug the PS4 controllers to play instead of using the keyboard. Last I checked, I had clocked around 7 hours in YamaYama and I can say that I've had incredible amounts of fun and laughed until my abs were sore. The game is basically a collection of minigames that you play through in a random order - or creating your own playlist. I've found that I like some game modes better than others, so I usually play through my own playlists. Anyway, to wrap things up here are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Hilarious gameplay moments.\n- Art is ridicilous and only fuels the hilarity.\n- Easy to pick-up and play a few rounds.\n- Also fun to play for hours.\n\nCons:\n- Even though the game is probably most fun with your friends next to you, it could use an online option.\n- It's hard to stay quiet when playing!\n\nIf you're looking for a fun party game to play with your mates, this is probably one of the best values you can get. But as it has no online multiplayer or single player, it's strictly a couch game.","April 6","true","8.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

A party, for family or just having fun with your friends. There is no online yet but it will come in the future.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that likes having fun.\n\nIts only 6.99$ which is an excellent prise, for an excellent game.","April 1","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
