"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/220740/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","So far the Deponia franchise is definitely keeping up appearances.\n\nI played and reviewed the first game in the series and honestly do not remember having one bad thing to say about it. I’m glad to be able to say that the same goes for its sequel.\nIn the first review I said that with some point and click games it can be hard to follow the creators logic when it comes to item combination and puzzles, which more often than not, results in rummaging through a walkthrough at least once or twice and asking you’re self “how was I even supposed to get that?” but with these games it isn’t like that. It is consistently logically throughout the whole game and that definitely applies to Chaos on Deponia as well. Although I found this second game a little more challenging when it came to figuring out what to use with what, (it was either  a harder game or my brain was just refusing to work, which wouldn’t be surprising) I also found it quite a bit more humorous.\n\nThe sense of humour in these games is a particular part about them that I enjoy the most. The main character is as egotistical yet loveable as ever and there’s some funny references in there that make you chuckle as you play through.\n\nArt wise, it is a beautiful as ever. Maybe even more so than last time, you can tell there was a bit of a leap in budget for the game when you switch from the first to the second. Same goes for audio, there is a huge difference when it comes to audio, it sounds a lot clearer and sharper than before, which is a nice addition to the game as a whole.\nThey focus a little more on water rather than land in this one, and I really liked that. There were points during the game where I couldn’t help but just think to myself, “Wow, the graphics for the water look really good.”\n\nOf course, I have to quickly mention the chorus singers. What would the Deponia experience be without them? I love them, they are amazing. I look forward to every song between chapters.\n\nAnd lastly, the achievements which I seem to like enough to have played through this game 2 and a half times. (The half because I forgot one measly achievement on my second “achievement gathering” play through.) The achievements definitely aren’t as obvious as they were in the first one, at least that’s how it seemed to me. With the first game I managed to get most of the achievements on the first play through just from general curiosity. This one I managed to miss quite a lot, which even then, although I missed a lot more, it definitely wasn’t as hard as getting all the achievements for the first one. Anyone that has played the first one would know that there was one pesky achievement to try and get, the “Droggeljug” mode achievement. When I started Chaos on Deponia I crossed my fingers and hoped so hard that there wasn’t a similar achievement in this game, and I was in luck!\n\nAll in all it is a really fun point and click game with a lot to offer. Any fan of the genre would enjoy this franchise. I have heard that a few people didn’t enjoy it because of the main characters stuck up and self-centred ways, and believe me, when I started the franchise I felt the same. But if you can get over that first hurdle in the first game, I promise you he really starts to grow on you as he progresses and grows as a character.\nI have yet to play the next one, and I have no doubt that it will tie up the franchise nicely.\n\n\nTL;DR : Logical item combinations, great humour, wonderful art, engaging story, an improvement audio/graphics wise from the first one, a great way to continue the series and just generally a great game for your point and click collection. Buy the series!\n\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Deponia:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/214340/\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Goodbye Deponia:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/241910","December 2, 2013","true","19.5"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","46","51","0","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/220740/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Chaos on Deponia starts with a repeat of the first game’s tutorial. Deponia’s anti-hero, Rufus, immediately complains and points this out, making me feel that Rufus and I are on the same page. It’s a nice beginning but what follows is even better.\n\nThe true opening of CoD is one of the most knee-slappingly funny and creative intros I’ve seen in an adventure game. It brilliantly plays upon the tropes of the genre and established fiction of Deponia. Rufus is brought into the home of an elderly couple, who bicker and talk about Rufus’ as the player kills their pet, breaks their plumbing, and burns their house down. If only all of CoD’s puzzles were so humorous and self-contained.\n\nI would actively steer clear of giving spoilers, but CoD would have to have some significant plot reveals and progression first. For a sequel to a game that ended on a cliffhanger, CoD’s plot goes absolutely nowhere. Correction: It goes backward. The plot of CoD mirrors that of the debut: Rufus has once again damaged Goal’s memory implants and must traverse a large city hub to solve puzzles and piece her back together. There is a twist, however. Goal has been split into three personalities: spunky, lady, and child. All of the puzzles in the city progress Rufus in convincing each side of Goal to merge together again. It’s a good concept but I often grew tired of navigating the same dialogue options with all three versions of Goal.\n\nIf the opening city hub of Deponia made you fall to your knees, you’re going to faint when you enter CoD’s main city that is double, if not triple, in size. CoD is not for the novice adventurer, since there are always so many locations, people, and items to factor into a puzzle. This is not the game’s problem. Its problem is that it frequently does a poor job in directing the player and subtly dropping hints. Perhaps something is lost in translation from the game’s original German, but I often felt lost and frustrated. Grim Fandango has a similar structure but I always thought it was my fault upon discovering a solution. I either wasn’t paying attention or listening to dialogue close enough. This is rarely the case in CoD and considering the game’s large world, that’s unfortunate.\n\nThe structure of CoD can be frustrating, but the puzzles themselves are often fun and just challenging enough. As with other Daedalic titles, you can always skip a puzzle. But why would you want to skip battling as a platypus? Not all of the game’s puzzles and minigames are great, but they are interesting and nicely tie into the story. You’ll occasionally come across one that will drive you nuts. I feel almost obligated to give the solution to what is one of the most obtuse puzzle solutions ever put in a game. It gives Psycho Mantis a run for his money, that’s for sure. I’ll just say this: Don’t count out the options screen in your puzzle-solving. I nearly went nuts, so you don’t have to.\n\nWhere CoD fails as a sequel, it succeeds with flying colors as a stand-alone, comedic adventure. Curb your expectations and you’ll discover a great cast of characters that are much better written and voiced than anything else Daedalic has put out. From Rufus’ hard-to-please father to the deluded renegade leader, CoD strives on the strengths of its outlandish characters and gorgeous world. As unlikely as it sounds, CoD manages to look even better than the first title. Secret of Monkey Island-style close-up dialogue scenes add some much needed variety and personality to presentation, and the large city hub is fantastic, full of color and detail. The backdrops still lack animation, though.\n\nAs disappointed as I am that CoD isn’t more progressive in its design or storytelling, it managed to win me over with its characters, dialog, and slapstick comedy. There are few revelations and twists in CoD, to the extent that I’d recommended it to those that haven’t played the first. Although I loved the comedy and characters of this entry, I miss the scale and sense of adventure that the original game contained.\n\nIn contrast to the first game, Chaos on Deponia leaves me a little less excited for the next entry, but it also leaves me a little more satisfied with the adventure I just had. If you are up for a serious challenge and some hearty laughs, you won’t be disappointed.","October 8, 2015","true","14.2"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

I bought the Deponia trilogy when it went on sale for $14  on greenmangaming. Worth? I think so. I really liked the story because it has it's funny moments. But I suppose because I am new to this genre, I would often find myself stuck and wondering what do next. If it wasn't for online walkthroughs I would never have completed this game. But after completing it with much help, I'm glad I picked it up. It was fun, memorable, and something that I am not used to playing. I suppose trying something new was what made this game refreshing for me.  I would recommend it for that reason alone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/recommended/220740/","MakoSipper","MakoSipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/","3807 products in account","HUZZAH ALL OVER AGAIN!\n\nShort Verdict: Slightly better than the previous game. Must-have for point-and-click fans. Nice humor, interesting story, great puzzles, unique characters, hours of fun!\n\nOverview: Chaos on Deponia is the second game in the adventure, point-and-click trilogy made by Daedelic. You control Rufus, a self-centered jerk who, more than anything, hates Deponia - some kind of a junkyard planet - and wishes to go to Elysium. Well, if you played the previous game,you know now he wants to save Deponia, too. The result is a game full of comedy, awkward moments packed with fun, and even romance.\n\nPros:\nThe interface is really great and easy to navigate\nThe story is interesting, packed with good quality humor, and you'll probably have lots of fun in the way\nGood length for an adventure game\nThe puzzles are really nice and sober--the game provides you not-too-obvious hints when you interact with the world and they've really hit the perfect mark in this aspect. Also, if you need additional in-game help, you can press space to see the hotspots, which is always good as an option. You probably won't need a guide, if you can deal with just the right amount of frustration that pushes you forward.\nCharacters are really cool and fun. The main character is embarrassingly annoying, but that allows for some "role play", you can say, when you try to think like he would as you try to solve the puzzles.\nGreat voice acting\nThe 2D graphics are really amazing\nThe BGM is really awesome--specially the Huzzah songs\nThe cliffhanger for the next game is just perfect--it closes a chapter really well, but you'll want to know what happens next\nCons:\nThe game crashed a few times for me (probably 2 or 3), mostly after videos. But according to my experience, it never happens if you skip the Daedelic intro.\nI can't say it's a huge con, but the pacing of the game is a bit weird for me. At the beginning, you're thrown in a huge area to explore and you have to deal with a lot of tasks. After that, the game becomes a lot more linear. Seems like they rushed to finish the game a little bit.\nBought on: Steam Store for R$ 4,99 (US$ 3.99 on the US store at the same time). If you don't have any of the games in the trilogy and think this game is for you, it might be a better idea to buy The Complete Journey (the full trilogy) instead.\n\nVerdict: If you're a fan of adventures and point-and-clicks, you most definitely have to check the Deponia series! It's precious. I'm not easy to please when it comes to humor and comedy, but Deponia just manages to do it better than all other games I've played (well, maybe except for Sam & Max, imnsho). Also, like I've said, the puzzles are really smart, the story is interesting, characters are unique, and basically everything you need in an adventure game is there. Don't miss it! But make sure you start with Deponia--don't skip to Chaos on Deponia, it won't make much sense.","January 17, 2015","true","11.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Chaos on Deponia is another sucessful installment of the Deponia series. What makes this game so good is the fact that they stay true to the style of the game, but are able to add enough layers to make it a great game on its own. It was another opening scene that grabbed my attention (getting the hammer). I was back on another crazy adventure with Ruuuuufus. The witty humor, amazing storyline, new great tunes, and the ever so amazing puzzles make for hours of enjoyment. To expound a bit more, the humor brought in funny stuff from the first game, but always had a fresh twist to it. The story was the same way. If you have watched the trailers you know that Rufus is trying to get off Deponia, but the way the story was written, you hardly remember that is the goal. I never felt like the game was trying to outdo the first one. So although this game is full of Chaos, it was actually planned out very well!\n\n"Huzzah, one more game to buy!"\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!","August 25, 2014","true","15.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The sequel has a lot of nicely done puzzles, an amazing soundtrack, and great character development. The humour is even better than in the first game, and it's basically impossible to laught at least once every 5 minutes.\nGameplay: It's a Point and Click adventure game, you walk around the Floating Black Market, and need to do various asks by the big number of your friends (Or foes). They can sound simply, but you might have to do a lot of walking to do it. You collect items as you play, and you either have to give them to someone, combine it with another item, or put it somewhere. And as you play on, you have to solve puzzles which require a lot of thinking, but are really well made, and fun to solve. If you're very bad at puzzles, then don't worry. The game allows you to skip puzzles if you want. The gameplay gets a 10/10.\nSoundtrack: The soundtrack is really amazing, it fits with the locations you are currently in, and the instruments sound like the surroundings (Ex. You're near a lot of junk, and the music is done from pots being hit, etc.) And they executed it incredibly well. Another 10/10.\nCharacters: You play as Rufus, which needs to save Deponia from being up by Cletus, and also find Goal and fix her Brain Implant which got split into three parts: Spunky Goal. Lady Goal, and Baby Goal. While you play, you need to make her every personality agree to go to the Doc, which can combine all of the personalities into one. You get a remote which switches between the three personalities, and you need to use it to your advantage. Rufus has apparently "Changed" But he's still the same, old, genius. He's extremely funny, he still makes a lot of mistakes, and still thinks Bozo is a pirate.\n10/10.\n\nThe game is really incredible, and I extremely loved every single bit of it. If you loved the first game, definitely get this. You won't regret it.\nFinal Game Rating: 11/10. I look forward to buying the third game.","November 1, 2014","true","15.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","1"

This game doesn’t kid around. The tone is more serious, and in some regards, darker: you are required to commit murder and animal abuse, just to name two of the morally questionable mandatory actions.\n\nThe story puts a larger emphasis on Rufus and his interaction with Goal (or Goals, since she is three people now) and the other characters. This not only portrays his selfish personality, but also evolves it in a quite realistic way. The dialogues are, without doubt, the greatest strength of the game.\nThe plot… not that much. The central issue of the planet’s destruction is shoved into the background to lead you in some wild goose chases. And when the story arc finally remembers it should lead somewhere, it suddenly abandons several smaller threads without explanation.\n\nProgressing can sometimes be a gargantuan task with intricate, several-step, whole gameworld-spanning puzzles based on typical adventure game logic. (How do you win at rock-paper-scissors? By destroying a pair of sunglasses to gain entrance to a submarine, of course!) The minigames are more forgiving, thankfully.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Chaos on Deponia is the highlight of the trilogy, and one of the best Daedalic games– worthy to be in the library of any point ’n’ click fan.","June 9, 2015","true","11.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

After a long time nearly 2 years i come from the epic Deponia now to part 2 and its still so epic like part 1. Its my Nr. 6 Daedalic Entertainment game (Edna Harvey Harvey New Eyes, Breakout, 1954 Alcatraz, Journey of a Roach, Deponia) and all 5 games was really amazing for me, dont expect wonders, but its feels a bit like old good Lucas Arts Adventures, sure nothing come on the exact level of quality) The graphic has still the charm, the sound are mid-class (not very good not annoying). So the dialogs are still some funny things and there are nice extra cameos if you play the achievements: Star Wars: I am NOT your FATHER (Luke, Vader, Rufus, Seagull) or there is a point someone go and catch it Tiger (Spider Man 2 with Tobey M.), there are many more like Achievement (the Dinos NOT THE MOTHER (Baby Sinclair to Father) but this dont know everyone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkAEH6uX7hQ and if you try to catch an item to far (ONE PIECE RUFFY http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Gomu_Gomu_no_Mi/Techniques) or a Harvey Cameo, Back in the Future, Pokemon, Captain Planet (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMoodiD0UEI). Sure there are some more and i forget some and maybe i dont know everyone too. So there are many puzzles to do and i love all of this game, some parts are really hard to do and the achievements have many tricks surprises you should see (Alice in the mirrors? Terminator Rat? A strange world of another Daedalic Game Inner World or something else i think). So enjoy this game. I give this game as a click and point fan and i think i couldnt be better (only longer) but i need 10 hours so more then double the time for part 1 i give 97 %, for many people it will be 82-92 % maybe if they dont hate point and click and dont expect to much.

The title was initially released a mere 10 months after the original, showing that Daedalic had already made plans to further the series before they even knew whether or not it would be a success. This review has been written with the idea that you, the potential buyer, have already finished and/or know the basic story of the original Deponia; spoilers for the first game ensue.\n\nThe sequel picks up what seems like only a few hours where the original had ended, bringing Goal and Cletus back into the picture almost immediately. The storyline sticks to the same basic plot, where Rufus attempts to escape the junkyard of his home planet by finding a way to Elysium. Further plot points are unveiled, including new information on the Organon, and the exact reason as to why they want to blow up Deponia, and what they stand to gain if they do. Wenzel is missing from this installment, but a plethora of new characters are introduced; although most of them do not stand out anywhere near as well as the original cast does. Still, most of them are enjoyable additions to the crew, and characters that were introduced later in the first Deponia see their backgrounds flourish.\n\nAs anyone who has played the original Deponia knows, these games are tough point and click adventures. Chaos on Deponia is even harder than the original, and much more confusing at times. Instead of just one Goal, now Rufus must focus on three different Goal personalities; Lady, Baby, and Spunky, all of whom must be interacted with using certain dialogue points, at specific times, to trigger events that will further the progress of the game. On top of that, there are more obscure solvents to puzzles, like putting a straightened banana into a drain, and turning down the in-game music volume at a determined point; just very bizarre, cryptic solutions which seem to plague the entire game. Likewise, there are also some rather frustrating mini-games, most notably the dolphin/submarine battleship simulator. This, again, is not a game for those who do not enjoy a hefty challenge, or who do not wish to use a walkthrough.\n\nThe charm of the humor and wit within Chaos on Deponia seems to have worn thin from its predecessor, as a good chunk of it is just more of the same. As the story wears on, Rufus becomes progressively more irritating rather than humorous, and it gets tiresome hearing Goal and the rest of the crew putting him down and rejecting him constantly. Sure, he's the main hero and he's also an idiot, we as the audience understand that; it really doesn't need to be pointed out during every single snippet of dialogue interaction between Rufus and the others. On a brighter note, the voice acting is still superb and the communication between characters is well written. Daedalic have also kept in the Chorus Guys, which are an absolute fan favorite from the first Deponia.\n\nAs far as the graphics go, they're even better this time around than in the original title. The colors are more lively and vibrant; where Deponia mostly stuck to rustic browns, reds, and oranges under a bright blue sky, Chaos on Deponia steps out with lavish purples, greens, and blues, all the while keeping the grimy hues and undertones of a world encapsulated by, and built out of, junk. To convey the feeling of visual depth and activity in the scenes, there are a variety of things that move in both the foreground and background now; the water is one that I really noticed the most. As well, the soundtrack has even gotten an upgrade, which I didn't think was possible; yes, it's even better in Chaos on Deponia than it was the original game... so good that I wonder why they haven't made it available for sale.\n\nWhile Chaos on Deponia is a decent follow-up to the highly acclaimed Deponia, the title just doesn't stand up to the classic; even though they were released such a short time apart. This sequel does last longer, however, especially if you're not using any sort of walkthrough to assist you; otherwise, you're looking at 8-9 hours of playtime. If you really dug the original Deponia, go ahead and grab this to further the story. However, if you're thinking of getting in to the Deponia series, just grab the classic instead; even though this game does give the backstory at the beginning. I wouldn't call Chaos on Deponia disappointing, but rather just not as charming as its predecessor.\n\nHuzzah, druggeljug!\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 17","true","8.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/220740/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account",""Reckoning up the sum, the best was yet to come, for the end of part one seemed a little too coarse. To amend we'll send Rufus to attend a second chance for a decent happy-ending: a grand fling with dancing and booze and so forth..."\n\nTo put it simply, if you liked Deponia, you'll certainly like Chaos on Deponia. Part of that's because it has just as much quality in its art, characters, story, music, puzzles, etc. The other part is because it more or less follows the same motions. Rufus solves an enclosed introductory puzzle, then builds a contraption involving rockets to launch himself into the sky, winds up crashing into a vehicle which contains Goal, both plummet to Deponia, you solve a handful of major problems by solving a ton of smaller ones in a large town area, then a smaller transitional act, and finally the twisty confrontation.\n\nAnd yet, despite featuring the same framework, the body is all-new. New faces, new locations, new puzzles. There's much to do and explore. So much of the world of Deponia to learn about, and a diverse and creative cast of characters to meet, all weird in their own ways.\n\nAnd oh my god, the voices are so much better. I mean, the majority of Deponia's voices weren't a problem, but the Organon's certainly were. Luckily, though the voices still have the same electronic filter, the volume has been turned down from "standing beside a malfunctioning stage woofer" to "playing on a rusty seesaw". I never liked Goal or Toni's voices much in Deponia, either, but unless I'm less of a cranky old voice snob than I used to be (unlikely - I'll be a voice snob 'til the very end!), the actresses have gotten a better hang of their characters, this time around. Goal, in particular, I thought sounded very nice. And she'd have to, considering the actress now had to keep up with three or four variations of the character (each of which sounds distinct, but intentionally similar enough to be the same character). Rufus does sometimes have lines that are delivered in ways that don't seem to match the situation at hand, and I definitely caught a flubbed line here or there (which the subtitles at least got right), but even still, his V.A. does a fine job with the other 98% of his lines.\n\nWeird translation problems do crop up from time to time, and they can have varying impacts. Chaos on Deponia was made by a German team, and it seems a little obvious here and there. For the mostpart it doesn't matter at all. On the whole, the English version of Chaos on Deponia shows an expansive understanding of the language. But there are some lines that just didn't make it through unscathed (at one point, a character asks, "What? I'm pardoned?" when he's supposed to say, "What? He's pardoned?"), and some jokes seem weird in ways that suggest that they worked a lot better in their original language.\n\nOn that note, I also want to mention that Poki's folky narrative songs are more... chaotic, this time around. Maybe that was a thematic choice, based on the title. But I'll be honest, those songs were one of my absolute favorite parts of Deponia. With maybe the exception of the third song, in this game they're much harder to follow. If it weren't for the subtitles, I wouldn't have a clue what he's saying half the time, with odd rhymes, lines with way too many words, and lines that end in the middles of words. I suppose this adds to the zaniness in a way, but I still preferred the old ones better.\n\nThe puzzles are more imaginative than I had expected, even having played the first game. Where Deponia featured a borderline obsessive number of puzzles centered around washing things, the devs have put forth a much stronger effort to keep you one your toes, this time. There are some dips into moon logic territory, but even those are more to do with the problem presented (such as as a head-sized human nose sticking out of a wall as a security device), or with how extravagant the means to solving them are (the lengths Rufus goes to in order to recognize a cat door are astounding, and perhaps a little unfortunate depending on your affinity for cartoon wildlife), and maybe one or two where I wasn't sure what I was accomplishing until I had already accomplished it (ding-dong ditch comes to mind), rather than just a straight-up complete and utter lack of logic. Several puzzles are downright ingenious, though. One puzzle involving a secret knock is about as weirdly outside-the-box as it gets, and I love it in all of its fourth wall-breaking splendor.\n\nDaedalus has struck a good balance in the difficulty. It's not as though I never got stuck. I did. In fact, I got stuck on the follow-up to that knocking puzzle simply due to a confusing sound effect. You have multiple secrets knocks which, though they should all sound different, all use the same sound effect, which made it tough to figure out how I was meant to go about solving the problem. But the vast majority of them were a joy to solve, with the game giving you just the right amount of clues necessary to understand what you're doing, without being so simplistic as to make you feel like a toddler. And there are a number of segments which take chances and break out of the typical talk to people/use items mold. You'll play an interesting take on a fighting game, compete in the weirdest form of rock-paper-scissors that I have ever seen, and take advantage of a complicated loophole in fast food pricing, among other highlights.\n\nThe puzzles are good, I like the puzzles. They're not 100% perfect but they're like 80-90% perfect. Boom, could have saved you two paragraphs of your time if I'd just written that first.\n\nI said it about Deponia, and I'll say it again about Chaos on Deponia: the game feels like a true evolution of the old SCUMM-based Lucasarts games. Not a copy, nor even an homage. But something which could have naturally formed from Lucasarts themselves in an alternate timeline. I mean this as a great compliment. If you can stand some translational oddities, you'll find that Chaos on Deponia is a beautiful - albeit junk-strewn - world filled with strange people and creative solutions for even more creative problems. I can easily recommend picking it up. Though I of course recommend picking up Deponia, first, if you haven't. Or the recently released Complete Journey which collects the whole trilogy. If you're a fan of silly, imaginative adventures like Day of the Tentacle or cartoony ones like Curse of Monkey Island, you're in for a treat with these.\n\n"HUZZAH, PUT BALLS TO THE WALL!"","July 28, 2014","true","16.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

This was in 2013. Despite numerous, highly-populated threads on the Steam forums, Daedalic never fixed the bug.\n\nSo eventually I started the game again, played all the way from the beginning back to where I left off, and started making progress again. Then, I don't know, but they must have released another patch. As of now, the game will boot up but it will crash whenever you try to start or continue from the main menu. Not even completely uninstalling and downloading again has fixed this problem.\n\nThe only conclusion which can come from all of this is that Daedalic are fantastic game makers who are absolute imbeciles when it comes to the technical details of releasing and supporting their product. I've played Deponia 1 and half of 2, and I bought Deponia 3 in anticipation of completing the story. If you can get them to actually run then you will have a blast - all those other positive reviews are right on the money.

I recommend you play the first game first so that you will understand the story better and get more attatched to the main characters.

It is not too hard to make sense of, but can be a little bit annoying if youre paying attention to it. For any fan of anime or subtitled foreign movies, you probably won't notice much, though.\n- One or two puzzles/'minigames' that required me to google or skip.

Chaos on Deponia could easily have been removed from the trilogy since it does almost nothing to further the plot of the series. It features some incredibly obtuse puzzles, and a huge number of locations to explore straight from the beginning, making it confusing to know where you should be going and what you should be doing.\n\nMy main gripe with all the Deponia games (outside of the terrifically unlikable main character, Rufus) is the gratuitous amount of completely pointless, filler dialogue you have to slog through just to complete simple tasks. Nearly every character you meet will supply you with 6+ dialogue options which will each spawn at least 15 lines of completely inane banter that does absolutely nothing to further the story or even provide mild entertainment. This isn't quality dialogue, like in older LucasArts games, where you actually want to click every option. Even if you ignore most of the extraneous dialogue options, often just trying to accomplish tasks will result in Rufus droning on and on and on with his signature, humorless commentary. It doesn't help that his voice is about as fun to listen to as a nursery full of teething babies with diaper rash. By the end of the game I was skipping through most of the dialogue since it added zero value to the story.\n\nThe only real point to play Chaos on Deponia is if you already own the trilogy and want to play the games in order. If not, don't bother and instead pick up an adventure game that's actually good, like one of the Special Edition Monkey Island games (which, despite people's insistence on comparing them to the Deponia series, are actually nothing alike, apart from sharing a genre - and that's a good thing).","December 28, 2014","false","8.6"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","23","42","0","2"

Daedalic decided to start this sequel in a way which left me feeling uneasy throughout the rest of the game (I really tried EVERYTHING! Please forgive me, John Thomas!)\n\nThis part introduces so many new concepts and gives vast space for sophisticated character development. A pity that the protagonist decides NOT to learn anything from his experiences. But in all honesty, I can't imagine Rufus-da-dufus being a mature adult, so I guess he just grows in his own emotionally disconnected and reality-twisting way.\n\nBut as much as I have trouble relating to the main character because of our issues (more often than not, I just want to slap him Tyrion-style), I do love me some ubiquitous innuendos. The plot gets better and better, proving that it is possible to combine careless humour and seemingly random songs with a much deeper story.\n\nFor these reasons I will definitely play the next part!","August 11, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In Deponia you'll get tons of hints, in dialogues\descriptions\etc... you'll always find great hints.\nAwesome graphics\nAwesome musics\nAwesome voice acting\nNice story\nFUNNY !

I've lost it at the gondola part. Having to watch Bozo and the weapon manufacturer fight 20 times over and having to hear to same horrible junkcrab song 20 times then having to go back and forth over and over just to figure out the exact order of actions was just the last straw.\nI've spent a pretty good amount of hours in that game and I'm still in the first town (which happens to be the half point in the game... yes you spend more than half the game in the same town)\n\nSo far, the whole story can be summarised in one line : You're in the black market and have to find ways to make all 3 or Goal's personalities accept a brain surgery.\n\nThere's NO STORY. The whole point of the game is to live a story (since you know, point and click games pretty much have no gameplay) but there's none. It's LONG and not rewarding one bit. You keep on going around the same town, talk to the same people, do the same things over and the story doesn't move on one bit. I'm frustrated, I want to like this game because it's pretty well made but it's just SO DAMN BORING.\n\nYes, that's it, it's long, tedious and boring.\n\nEDIT : This is my personal experience and feeling.

It is a sensible continuation of part one and basically features the same goodies and problems - see also review for part one  - including my main problem of the dislikeable main character Rufus, i.e. the player's avatar.\n\n+ Beautiful comic style graphics\n+ Nice intermission songs\n+ Very good voice acting - believable characters\n+ Good story\n+ Mostly very good game/puzzle logic,\n+ Shortcuts to menus, quick-save and quick-load, fast access via inventory\n\n- Dislikeable main character that I want to slap in the face from time to time\n- Some graphical glitches\n- Some subtitle glitches\n- Sometimes unnecessarily loud sound pieces\n- A few crashes directly following sequences\n\nDespite Chaos on Deponia being generally a great game I still have some issues with the game. Admittedly, all of the problems seldom appear but still distract (me) from the game.\n\nSound:\nThere are some entities with kind of electronic voices, e.g. the guard dog in front of Doc's. They are designed with mixed-in white noise which results in an awful experience.\n\nGraphics:\nSequences often work with half-static pictures sensibly restricting updating screen space to what is actually changing, e.g. eyes and mouth in a close-up of a face. Unfortunately, sometimes the game fails to correctly position the updating position resulting in a black line on the screen, e.g. when reading the note from Bozo.\nThere have been some instances where pictures/elements of the screen are slanted. It looks like the picture is read from some map with multiple pictures and the width to read was read 1 pixel to big. Examples are the cursor on Grandma Utz or the squirrel in the get-the-egg-game.\nWhen credits roll there is a gap at the bottom of the screen where you see names entering the screen before being obfuscated by the waves (on the top layer) and then reappearing in the planned display space on the sign.\nThe cursor flickered in the dialogue with the pharmacist.\n\nSound+Graphics:\nSubtitles at times contain typos or do not match what is actually said.\n\nOverall, Chaos on Deponia is a good game and continuation of Deponia. I'm looking forward to Goodbye Deponia and hope the final part of the trilogy will teach Rufus basic social skills.","May 2, 2015","true","32.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After some first hesitating steps in this world where I regretted my purchase for some minutes because I thought this kind of game would just not fit me, I simply fell in love with the whole gameplay and its setting.\nThe storyline itself is, well, just like the first part, very Rufus-ly. But that's what you expect, isn't it? :D\n\nThe puzzles vary in their difficulty, but even the harder ones can be solved with (sometimes a lot of) endurance and paying close attention to the scenary as to what the characters say.\nAlso, I enjoy the soundtrack (especially the introduction as the transitions between every "chapter" of the story are very lovely and I get excited every time I hear their melody :D).\n\nMaybe I'm a little too positive about everything because of my little crush here, but I'm sure that when you enjoy point-and-click -games and have a sense for dark humour, you're gonna love this one!\n","December 23, 2014","true","23.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a sensible continuation of part one and basically features the same goodies and problems - see also review for part one  - including my main problem of the dislikeable main character Rufus, i.e. the player's avatar.\n\n+ Beautiful comic style graphics\n+ Nice intermission songs\n+ Very good voice acting - believable characters\n+ Good story\n+ Mostly very good game/puzzle logic,\n+ Shortcuts to menus, quick-save and quick-load, fast access via inventory\n\n- Dislikeable main character that I want to slap in the face from time to time\n- Some graphical glitches\n- Some subtitle glitches\n- Sometimes unnecessarily loud sound pieces\n- A few crashes directly following sequences\n\nDespite Chaos on Deponia being generally a great game I still have some issues with the game. Admittedly, all of the problems seldom appear but still distract (me) from the game.\n\nSound:\nThere are some entities with kind of electronic voices, e.g. the guard dog in front of Doc's. They are designed with mixed-in white noise which results in an awful experience.\n\nGraphics:\nSequences often work with half-static pictures sensibly restricting updating screen space to what is actually changing, e.g. eyes and mouth in a close-up of a face. Unfortunately, sometimes the game fails to correctly position the updating position resulting in a black line on the screen, e.g. when reading the note from Bozo.\nThere have been some instances where pictures/elements of the screen are slanted. It looks like the picture is read from some map with multiple pictures and the width to read was read 1 pixel to big. Examples are the cursor on Grandma Utz or the squirrel in the get-the-egg-game.\nWhen credits roll there is a gap at the bottom of the screen where you see names entering the screen before being obfuscated by the waves (on the top layer) and then reappearing in the planned display space on the sign.\nThe cursor flickered in the dialogue with the pharmacist.\n\nSound+Graphics:\nSubtitles at times contain typos or do not match what is actually said.\n\nOverall, Chaos on Deponia is a good game and continuation of Deponia. I'm looking forward to Goodbye Deponia and hope the final part of the trilogy will teach Rufus basic social skills.","May 2, 2015","true","32.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will need to have played the first game for this one to make any sense, as it picks up exactly where the first one leaves off.\n\nThe gameplay is traditional point-and-click adventuring, which means an abundance of item-based puzzles along with the occasional skippable mini-game. It also includes standard control shortcuts such as double-clicking on arrows for instant movement, left-clicking to speed through dialogue, and ESC to skip scenes entirely.\n\nYour character is Rufus, a sorry excuse for a human being if ever there was one, and your goal is to help him "save the world" by dealing with his brain-malfunctioning cliche of a companion, driving his friends to drink, and being at the top of PETA's most-hated list.\n\nThe game is significantly longer than the first, and involves multiple new locations to explore (i.e. wreak mayhem upon).\n\nSome of the things I liked:\n\n- There is a good amount of humor in the dialogue, lyrics, and situations that occur.\n- Many of the puzzles were intuitive enough to not need a walkthrough, but clever enough to not be boring.\n- The side characters (Doc, Bozo, etc.) were cool, and imho more interesting than the main characters.\n- The overall plot was solid, and included some twists and depth that I definitely wasn't expecting.\n- Platypuses.\n\nSome of the things that bothered me:\n\n- The pacing felt off. The start of the game is bogged down with cut-scenes, heavy dialogue, and one-room puzzles, and then the game dumps you out into a larger non-linear sandbox to explore. The juxtaposition is jarring and slightly uncomfortable. I think the first game was more successful in making the exploration feel natural.\n\n- In order to get all of the achievements, you need to play two particularly obnoxious mini-games without skipping them. One is a quick-reflexes fighting game, and the other is a corner-the-enemy strategy game. Both are tedious, and are completely outside of the normal skill set for this genre. Neither are in any way "fun."\n\n- Rufus is pretty unlikeable, and tbh, Goal isn't much better. They tried to give her a larger role with actual character development, but it's marred by the fact that her dialogue and actions are internally inconsistent. Even with the craziness of the main plot device, it still doesn't make sense that she would randomly forget to take key pieces of information into account, or that she would flip-flop between loving you and hating you at the drop of a hat, or that she continues to be a walking stereotype who is affected by the plot rather than driving it. There were moments of awesomeness with her character, but she really needed an overall editor.\n\n- Was the animal cruelty really necessary?\n\nOverall, it is a solid adventure game with a dark sense of humor and a full cast of non-heroes. If you liked the first game in the series and said "I want more of that, only with less moral fiber and more Goal", then you will absolutely love this installment. I give it 7.5 platypuses out of 10.","April 24, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles made even less sense in this game then the previous one. I hate to say that I pretty much had to use a walkthrough libberally throughout the whole thing which for me says that the game didn't do a great job of helping the player figure out solutions on their own. I used a walkthrough in the first game but at least the first had a few areas I could figure out on my own. Still, a great series but now that its over, I don't understand why they didn't just release a game that includes all three parts as one whole game. Sounds like a bs way to make extra money but whatever. Buying the daedilic pack at 90% off was the best for this anyway.

I've found this game to be more difficult than the first because at some point in the game you'll be given the freedom to travel to different places instead of being stuck in one place, which adds a whole new dimension of difficulty to the puzzle mechanics. Although there are some iffy moments where I was forced to refer to a walkthrough for help because some of the solutions are just too out-of-the-box, the additional challenge adds a certain charm to the game and it definitely keeps me entertained enough to play through the whole game in one day. The story is still great and I do feel that there are definitely more interesting dialogues between MC and the people around him.\n\nThis game has earned a solid recommendation from me to anyone who has played the first game and enjoyed it, and if you haven't, then I'd also recommend the first game to those looking for good puzzles and good story in a game.","July 7, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a fun, indepth world to explore with more interesting puzzles to solve and characters to talk to; finally with a story that rackets up where the first one left off and deals you with plot twists you did not see coming.\n\nIts a longer game than the first one, But it feels a slightly more enclosed world, the majoriy of the game is inside a ramshackle maritime city, The Floating Blackmarket. But because of the world and story its no less detailed and fansinating.\n\nI think the one thing that weared thin was the main character, Rufus. I was hoping for him to start to grow out of his immature, unintelligent self-delusioned nature; go beyond being an unbearable underdog and become a sort of an unlikable anti-hero. But Rufus' accute Aspergers doesn't do enough to dampen the enjoyment had in Choas in Deponia....\n\nGoodbye Deponia; the conclusion of the trilogy will come out this coming August. I'm anticipating a clever, over the top ending of the series. I look forward.","February 18, 2013","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Honestly these additions (chapters?) should have just been a massive expansion, very little of the gameplay was changed as far as I can tell. Not a bad thing, just an observation since the story does continue directly where it left off.\n\nI actually disliked this one the most out of the series mainly because it revolved around a single location with sectors. This meant a LOT of retracing steps and moving back and forth. It became tiring and made some of the puzzles mundane or nonsensical because you're basically re-using the same stuff over and over again.\n\nThe story was still solid here though, and the voice acting had improved significantly. Characters had deeper and more bizarre personalities.

It lets you explore a new part of Deponia (though it is rather small) and introduces a bunch of new colorful characters (O, Donna, your dim-witted giggles melt my heart!).\nLike previous game, Chaos on Deponia looks absolutely fantastic and is really funny. But also like previous game it contains a lot of bugs, most of which are the same as in the original Deponia. They are not game breaking (though some Steam achievements do not work), but it really saddens me to see that Daedalic still doesn't care to fix them.\nOverall it is fun game but besides game bugs it contains some other drawbacks. It is really short and ends abruptly only to tell you to wait for the third part to see the end of the story. Some people will find various jokes offensive because of animal cruelty and the main protagonist is still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which makes it really hard to sympathize and root for him.\nBut in the end, Chaos on Deponia is really funny quest with great characters, amazing graphics and interesting story.","November 9, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's still hilarious, still fun and it still has a good story. There were two problems, in my opinion:\n\n1. The puzzles were sometimes too obscure. While this game certainly improved on some aspects of the first game (most of the time I actually had some idea of what I was doing, and some sense of progress, whereas in the first one I tended to get stuck much more often) - it still suffers a bit from being a little too hard in places. I'm not saying that I want it to be easy - no thanks - but this game is so big and sprawling that it sometimes got very confusing as to where I needed to go next. (on the other hand, it did improve quite a lot on the first game. Some new mechanics were pretty good).\n\n2. Parts of it do feel a bit like filler. The actual story part of the game is extremely stretched out (you spend the majority of the game trying to convince all three goals to agree to have surgery. Basically the whole of the Black Market was devoted to this one puzzle, and it's a big place). It was fun, but it was slow going. It set up a lot of important stuff for the third game, obviously, but not a lot happened in this one compared to the others.\n\nBut, still, it was a good game, like the others. I love this universe, the characters, the humour. In this game, it was especially the humour, being a bit more lacking in story and character development than the others.\n\nOverall, it was fun, and important as a setup for the third one, which I think is easily the best. Obviously, if you're playing the trilogy, you can't miss this one - you probably won't even be reading the reviews for the second game if you've played the first - even so, I'm going to give it an 8/10 for anyone who might be reading.","November 22, 2015","true","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately this is not the case, as shown wonderfully in the beginning sequence. Despite the optimism of Rufus' new friends, he is just as bad as ever.\nI actually enjoyed the second game on the whole. Although, I'm not sure if it really stands well on it's own. There's a lot of back story in this segment and new gorgeous locations to explore, but not much in the way of plot. The puzzles are still fun, but I have to admit, I needed to look up a walkthrough for a couple of the more obscure ones, and the floating black market is great. I especially loved the robot in the gadget store and the platypus 'poet'.\nUnfortunately there are some cons. Goal's brain implant becomes damaged and her personality is split into 3 people and they seem to be baby, snobby ♥♥♥♥♥ and angry ♥♥♥♥♥ :\ ,also, the only other person who is seen to have a brain implant is also a woman, I'm not sure what Daedalic are trying to say with that. At the end of the game it's even suggested that a Goal with only one personality is better than a fully functional Goal, as she's easier to deal with and doesn't have her usual issues or naivety (at least it is the 'bad' guy who say this and not Rufus who argues against this, +1 for Rufus).\nRufus is still an awful person.","November 11, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

About 1/4 in the game I had to turn off the volume because the in-game character couldn't remember a knocking rythm. The third wall has been broken down since the first game and it looks as if Deponia 2 is going to break the whole house. I wonder what will happen in the third game...\n\nThe story is still continuing like it was in the first game - Rufus *trying to escape Deponia (*note the trying).  The plot does have some parts that are confusing and annoying like Rufus buying the bad type of cartridges for Goal's brain and then it's split into 3 parts and then he has to seduce every part of Goal to proceed with the story (uugghh... come on). Maybe the story is being stretched too long??\n\nThe second part of the series has more difficult minigames and you can't even skip some.. I had troubles with the Platypys Bataka (couldn't see where Goal was looking), but after a series of serious ragequits I got past that and continued on with the story.\n\nOverall the game is quite fun and interesting. The series is maybe meant for a bit more open-minded people with good memories (not me). Just like in any Point-and-Click games, you need to remember the clues. Play the full game in one go or in a few days.

I managed the game without a walkthrough, but don't feel bad if you need one. The strength of this game is not in the puzzles, it's not the protagonist either, though YMMV. The setting is great, the side characters are funny. The main character is a horrible egotistical jerk that does horrible things. Worse YOU have to make him do these things. Some of these are really stupid, some illogical, many unethical.\nActually this game has a lot of bad points, but still ended up enjoyable. I think it's mainly the setting and the side characters.\n\nOne puzzle I'm going to gripe about, since it was the one that took me quite literally HOURS to solve. To get the swordfish protected by a motion sensor, you have to cut the power so it's dark. This makes NO SENSE AT ALL, since motion sensors are made to detect motion in the dark. They generally work better in dim light than in bright light. Oh and don't tell me you cut power to the motion sensor itself. No anti-theft measure should be without backup power, and when you grab the fish, there's no wires at all.","January 22","true","10.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The plot takes on a much more sinister and pressing twist than the first game as the tension on Deponia escalates and the desperate protragonist is caught between keeping the love of his life and his saving his home plant in a fiendish catch 22.

Not to mention the extremely irksome dialogue by the even more annoying idiotic protagonist (if that is even what you should call him).  Highly uncreative, and the only pro I can think of is, the pretty cool cartoon art for the characters.

This is the weakest episode in the series.  If you played and enjoyed the first game, you will enjoy this one.  If not, you can stop here and not bother continuing.  If you are starting the series fresh you should pick up the first one.\n\nAs a part of Daedalic's Monkey Island-like humor series, the jokes are in there, and they are numerous.  Again, I can't say anything here is any better than the other two games.  Translation problems factor in and some of the humor will leave you confused, as it did in the other two games.  Some of the humor is unintentional because of the aforesaid translation.  Some of them, a few of the less funny sexist jokes, the Scandinavian guy, that part where you ----- -- baby dolphins ---- ----, did not leave me insulted so much as wondering how the writers could have believed I would think that funny.  Perhaps this is just me not entirely getting the German sense of humor or me just calling out tasteless as I see it.\n\nThe pace of the story has slowed down a lot.  A large chunk of the game involves character development for Goal.  Rufus changes little from the first game and any hopes  you may have that he is really a decent person are taken outside and shot several times.  Any character development he receives follows the direction of writer's butt monkey and someone the player wishes something bad would happen to.  Fortunately, you do become attached to the colorful cast of side characters and part of the enjoyment of playing the game involves seeing who's life Rufus will ruin next.\n\nThe gameplay shows Daedalic's polish to the adventure gaming genre which leave you wondering why nobody else tried some of the changes they made.  As an example, the inventory can be brought up and down with a hotkey on your mouse wheel.  Details are well drawn and animated, with your attention going to things you should pay attention to so you don't have to do the mouse search across a background for that one object.  There are keyboard shortcuts and a highlight button to show all the intractable objects.  Things like this keep me playing Daedalic's games even through parts I don't enjoy.\n\nThe puzzles are more complicated than they were in the first game.  If you don't like being in an area with a large bloated zone with several puzzles dropped in your lap at the same time, working on all of them at the same time, that is the entire first - and largest - part of the game.  Nothing drove me to frustration and any problems could be solved by thinking about them for a while, but there is a large area to cover and a lot of things to tinker with in order to figure out what you need to do.\n\nThere are a few stand out moments, the first puzzle you solve, teaching you how to apply several gameplay basics, after you go through the basic tutorial was hilarious.  Hilarious enough for me to restart and replay it a few times.  The second moment was when I had to go and change the game's options to solve a puzzle.\n\nYour mileage may vary for a lot of this game but I'd still call it the weakest episode in the series where Daedalic tries to correct some of the problems made in Deponia and end up creating new mistakes.  If you are not into Daedalic's adventure games or adventure gaming in general this is one you can skip.  If you are into the Deponia series and really enjoyed the first game enough to continue the story then, by all means, pick this one up.","January 23","false","8.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jumpingghost/recommended/220740/","jumpingghost","The Jumping Ghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jumpingghost/","33 products in account","I generally enjoyed the first Deponia (I propose to rename the series "Disapponia") game, but the horrible pacing of the ending made me wary of getting this one.  It was on sale for $3 so I decided to go for it.  If the most favorable outcome were true, this game would have made up for the faults of the previous installment with better writing and a larger world.  Unfortunately, that is not what happened.  While the world may indeed be larger, my desire to explore it has been completely destroyed.\n\nIn the hour that I played, every single line of dialogue was about how much of a fool Rufus is.  All realism has been thrown out and Rufus no longer behaves like a human.  The humor is predictable and the actual game seems less important on the developer's priorities than the bad jokes about the protagonist.\n\nI simply couldn't continue playing after the scene with the robotic dog because the writing was that bad.  The same voice recordings were recycled too many times throughout the dialogue and the puzzle was severly disappointing.  My favorite parts of the first game were the unconventional and devious puzzle solutions that weren't immediately obvious and helped me to relate to the character of Rufus.  This scene alone destroyed that as the solution to the puzzle was yet another joke about his inhuman stupidity.  Rufus went from a likable trickster to a complete clown who cannot hope to be passed off as a realistic character.\n\nThis is very disappointing, as the world in which Deponia is set has the potential for a great experience and I was genuinely interested in where the story would go in this game.  Now I have no motivation to play any further because I just don't want to see whether the writing could possibly get any worse.\n\nIn addition to the poor writing, this game also seems to have worse voice acting than the first and the animation just feels lazy.  The latter of these complaints was also a problem in the first Deponia game, but I was willing to overlook that for a well-made game overall with good art and effort put into other places.  Since this game obviously doesn't have the second part, the lack of believable animations only adds to my disappointment.  It's unfortunate that I will not be able to enjoy Deponia's wonderful art because of the horrible design of the game.\n\nI really have to wonder what this game's target audience is.  The humor is too banal and predictable to be enjoyed by an adult but the puzzles are too difficult to be figured out by a child.  I was under the impression that the first game was targeted to adults but I have trouble beleiving that could be true considering how immature this one is.\n\nMy advice is that you do not invest in the Deponia series, as this really isn't worth anyone's time.  If you don't believe me, you should be able to come to an agreement quickly enough to still be eligible for a refund.  While the first game was a good experience for a $2 game on sale, this is overpriced even at its current $3.","April 5","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Much of the interesting ideas the series presents have been explored, the characters have grown, the world is saved and there's a bittersweet note that provides some great texture and complexity.\n\nBut mostly, it's the main character Rufus.  Throughout the first game he becomes more and more insufferable.  It's endearing at first, but near the end it starts to become exhausting.  By the start of this sequel, he gets to the point of being completely intolerable.  He abandons any growth he might have attained in the first game, and devolves to even more of a jackaninny than he ever was.  While it's obvious they're trying to channel Guybrush Threepwood, it crosses some hard to define line at some point where it's just not funny anymore.  Perhaps it's when he causes even more irreversable brain damage to the woman he claims to love (in addition to the damage he'd done previously) for a lollypop.","December 23, 2013","false","7.1"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","1"

The plot this time around is more or less exactly the same as in Deponia: Rufus attempts to get to Elysium, hurts Goal in the process, saves Goal, then they both arrive at some sort of 'emotional finale'. The only actual tie-in with the overall story is the ridiculously unlikely romance between the two leads. There was plenty of opportunities to allow for some character development to take place here, but the developers must have thought Rufus is perfect the way he is. I doubt I am alone in thinking otherwise.\n\nThe comedy found within is more miss than hit, usually revolving around racial and gender stereotypes, slapstick, and Rufus' narcissism. Characters you meet are one-dimensional walking punchlines, only they lack actual punchlines. Often, Rufus will be painted in a good light while characters opposing him - specifically women - are seen as ♥♥♥♥♥y obstructions in a great man's journey. When that fails, crude humour comes into play in the form of dead baby animals and belittling of others. I picture the developers staring longingly through the windows of residence Monkey Island, soaking in the rain while contemplating ringing the door bell and asking for worthwhile ideas. A shame they instead resorted to the trash bin.\n\nThat being said, if you are a fan of point-and-click games, you should definitely consider giving it a shot. The gameplay is good fun, the art is gorgeous, and the English voice actors usually play their roles very well. The enjoyable musical numbers separating chapters are still present, but it's now even more painfully obvious they struggled to fit the lyrics to the songs. Sadly, all of this is not enough to warrant anything other than a red thumb.\n\nIn summary: If you find it appealing to control the bane of human existence sort of bumble from one mildly logical puzzle to the next while listening to him comment on his surrounds with punchable smugness for 8-9 hours, then by all means give this a try. I can promise if you did not like the first game, you won't find anything here to make you want to see trilogy's inevitable end.","April 24, 2014","false","9.2"," 16 of 39 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","16","39","0","1"

Huge. Just right off the bat, you're forced to just figure things out, and that's alright in a game that's designed better, but here, anything and everything could be the ONE object you're supposed to interact with. That's just a bit too much to deal with, esspecially when the objects blend in with the background.\n\nSo this one part here at the beginning sounds, you know, pretty annoying, but at LEAST it's short, right?\n\nNo.\n\nI swear, this first part of the game goes on for at least four to five hours. Four to five hours of just pixel-clicking things to see if they do anything, walking, looking around, scratching your head, and going on GameFAQs.\n\nI don't remember the first game being like that. I remember it being fun and fair, not this overly-slow, cryptic trudge through samey diners, alleys, and laboratories.\n\nAnd what happened to Rufus? I thought he went through a huge character arc in the last one, learning his overt flaws and blatant vulerabilities? Wasn't there this big thing about how he actually was his enemy's greatest admirer only proving his rapid insults to be numbing hypocrisies, almost like he was subtley deconstructing his own personality indirectly? I thought the whole point of him "acting" cool was only to bottle up his true feelings of inferiority to the upper-class Elysiums that he so wanted to be a part of? It was only until the end where he realized that a change is needed for him to be in the right. He realized that the person he should be admiring the entire time should actually be the everyday, caring people that he surrounds himself with, including his own true love which he is determined to find once more and correct himself in her eyes. It will only be then when he can live without the shadow of his own pathetic whining ego crying in the deepest recesses of his mi-\n\nPFFFFFFFT. NAH.

The game brings nothing new to the genre, however it has great and funny characters, nice riddles, okay mini games and a fantastic atmosphere once you get passed the first puzzle to get off the Floating Black Market. The first riddle is fustrating and almost made me want to stop playing. Regardless, I am glad that I pushed through it. The second half of the game was allot of fun and became quite enjoyable. The puzzles are allot harder in this one than the first. Overall, I am glad I continued the story but I will admit, the first one was more fun. The puzzles are tough enough that you probably won't figure them out right away, but they're not so tough that they'll stump you for days at a time, either. It's guaranteed to provide you with a few good belly laughs, plus some genuine brain teasers as well.

Many point and click adventures have degrees of moon logic where a nonsensical combination of items and actions somehow solves the problem, but Deponia makes it somehow seem almost rational in hindsight.  Rufus often made me simultaneously gasp in horror and laugh at some of the stunts he pulled on his fellow Deponians.\n\nGameplay:  It has a moderate amount of pixel hunting.  Some of the scenes are extremely cluttered and can make finding the one thing needed difficult.

I also did not appreciate some of the puzzle solutions, it painted Rufus as being a much more sadistic character than simply the clueless idiot that he is otherwise.\n\nWhile this isn't an issue with just this game but rather the point and click genre as a whole, many of the puzzles have completely illogical (but usually at least still entertaining) solutions, so unless you enjoy lots of trial and error, I highly recommend finding a good guide to maximize your enjoyment of the game.","May 6","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
