"http://steamcommunity.com/id/samysalti/recommended/204360/","samysalti","Samy Salti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/samysalti/","250 products in account","Introduction:\n\nCastle Crashers was my personal favorite Xbox Live Arcade game when it was first released back in 2008. The Behemoth continued to give this game more life with it's DLC of character's that had unique abilities, animal orbs that would accompany you throughout the game, and weapons that would improve your character's growth (or vice versa if you are looking for a challenge). The game was later ported to the Playstation Network with exclusive mini-games in 2010. Castle Crashers eventually was ported onto Steam, but was ported badly onto PC on launch; however, the game was redeemed to be fun and playable again after The Behemoth made necessary updates.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis title is a hack and slash RPG, and has been widely recieved by many gamers who appreciate the genre (even those who don't). The game can feel a bit tedious at times, but as you level your character(s) the gameplay will feel slightly different before it tends to get repetitive once again. However, the game keeps the game fresh upon every level with unique scenary, opponents, and even jokes. If you plan on purchasing this title it's obviously more fun to play it with friends then it is with complete strangers, so try to convince your friends (and if they've convinced you to buy it listen to them). Completing the title will be a mission, but personally I think that's half the fun of trying to unlock every single character, find every animal orb and weapons. Give this game a try by downloading the demo. If you find the game a bit pricey than wait for a discount (or a Humble Indie Bundle that has this game packaged with it).","November 26, 2013","true","18.1"," 221 of 238 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","221","238","0","6"

I'd heard a lot of people talk it up and even tried the demo before deciding to get this bad boy when it was on sale for Halloween. You get four characters to choose from, so you can potentially play a 1-4 player game right out of the gate. Each character has their own starting weapon, magical element, and appearance. You go through levels beating up bad guys and trying to save princesses. Along the way, you'll find some cool weapons and animal orbs that give you special perks, You can switch between them between levels by visiting the blacksmith. I don't typically enjoy beat 'em ups. They tend to get stale and boring, despite how many combos or different weapons the game wants to throw my way. But Castle Crashers adds in some RPG elements to keep it interesting. Sure, the different weapons, different characters with their magic, and different animal buddies all add some customization, but the leveling system is what truly gives this game replayability and a sense of progression. Upon leveling up, you'll gain points that can be put into any of the four stats you have, strength, defense, magic, and agility. Depending on what kind of playstyle you want to use or what role you have on the team, you can build accordingly. Do you want to focus on one or two stats? Or would you rather be more well rounded? How will you compliment your teammates? Or what is best for solo play? It gives some complexity to the otherwise simple concept, which is great.\n\nThe ability to play locally, cooperatively, or solo is nice for varied options and experiences. Essentially, each character you use equals one campaign. And there are a lot of unlockable characters, so this game does have a lot of replayability and lifespan. I also like the simple cartoony art style and some of the music is pretty cool. The main game with single and multiplayer, insane mode, two mini games, achievements, there's a lot of hours to be had with this title.\n\nHowever, I DO need to point out a few flaws in the game. Castle Crashers is a game of diminishing returns. When you start, there's lots of new and exciting things to keep you hooked. New characters, new weapons, new animal buddies, new secondary items, new levels, and a blank slate to upgrage how you see fit. But after a while... it loses its luster. There are only so many characters, items, animal buddies, weapons, and levels in the game. Your upgrades get harder and harder to improve as the game goes on and you will start to gain less points per level. You max out at 78 and from then on it's very little change between levels. Insane mode, aside from a few exceptions, is basically the same as the normal game... excpet enemies take longer to kill and can kill you faster. More frustrating and time consuming than an increase in challenge. Also, the online isn't always the best. It depends on game settings, connection speeds, and the locations of the players for sure, but laggy games can be tough to get through, especially in crucial moments the requre precision. Not to mention that when the game literally has to stop and wait for the other players, it can get very annoying and tiresome. So I'd recommend finding people close enough for online, or simply doing local play if you're going to do multiplayer.\n\nI like Castle Crashers. Sure, it has diminishing returns, and if you want to complete it with everyone at maximum everything... you'll be playing longer than you enjoy. But playing in moderation, trying to win rather than max everything, playing with other people... all of this can easily extend the playtime of the game while keeping it fun. Is it worth $15? Well... it really depends. If you like beat 'em ups a lot, then probably. Try out the demo and gauge your excitement. I'd say this game is probably worth about $10 generally, and when it goes on sale it tends to be cheaper anyway, so definitely go for it. I'd give Castle Crashers a solid 7/10. A good game, great for fans of beat 'em ups, but still alright for people who don't much care for them as well. I'm sure I'll get lots of hours in this game over the years, and you might too.","November 16, 2014","true","20.8"," 114 of 124 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","114","124","7","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/viceous/recommended/204360/","viceous","Vicevic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/viceous/","236 products in account","Castle Crashers is insane\n\nGTA, Saints Row, Manhunt? Not even close. In terms of sheer gore, those games have Castle Crashers beat, but there are few action games out there without plenty of gore. No, the traumatizing, soul-crushing characteristics of Castle Crashers is not about gore or level of violence, it’s in between the lines of the actions of the “heroes” you play. On the surface, it might seem like your average ‘hero on a journey to defeat evil’ type story, but if you look more closely, you will quickly realize that the heroes you play are among the most monstrous, psychopathic killers you have ever had the opportunity of controlling.\n\nLet’s have a closer look at your actions throughout the game, which means in the case that you feel the story is of importance in a game like this, you should know that there will be SPOILERS ahead.\n\nThe Corncob. This poor vegetable had the sad fate of being either: being born very differently from the other maize, or having had some spell cast on him to turn him into a monster. He’s probably been bullied by the other corncobs his whole life. Is it strange that this unfortunate soul is a little aggressive? And yet what is the logical conclusion that the “heroes” reach when they meet the corncob? They slaughter him, and then proceed to eat his remains. Follow me on this, they slaughter a lost, confused creature, whose only crime was being different, and then consume his dead body because it’s tasty. The motivation? The corncob was kind of in the way of a place they were looking for, and decided it was too much trouble simply going around him.\n\nNext up, genocide. On their journey, the player champions and the army that follows them encounter a primitive tribe of polar bears. The bears like to eat fish, sleep and dance in the rain, and are completely oblivious to the ongoing war. When an army invades their land, the bears will naturally try to defend it out of fear. Do the good guys try a diplomatic solution? No, they exterminate the entire population of polar bears without mercy.\n\nWedding crashers. Our righteous heroes crash a wedding, destroy the cake, and murder the guests and the groom, whose only wish was to get married. The groom was quite the villain though; his evil weapon was a musical instrument. Be grateful they saved us from that guy. The champions are not quite finished, though. The groom was the Cyclops’ only friend, and upon seeing him dead, the Cyclops flies into a great sorrow and rage, escaping to his cave to grieve. You get one guess at what the heroes do to the Cyclops. Wrong, they do not simply murder him, but make sure to give him the horribly painful death of molten lava.\n\n‘But wait!’ A player familiar with the game might say. ‘They rescue animals!’ This is true; they rescue a selection of animals from both battlefields and black market vendors throughout their journey. Then they proceed to use them as weapons. Baby seals, kittens, birds. You name it; they probably threw it right into the bloody war, to fight for their lives for their own cruel and selfish gains.\n\nWhat about the hermit in the mountains? The heroes meet a crazy, old hermit living in the mountains, who only wanted to show them his sock puppet show. They kill him because he has a steering wheel that they want. Oh, and the aspiring painter, let’s not forget about him. He also only wants to show off his artistic prowess by displaying his paintings. They kill him because....no reason what so ever! F*ck art, apparently.\n\nIf this is not convincing enough, then I don’t know what more to point out. Except that if you decide to play multiplayer, when you rescue princesses, you will casually be fighting your friends to the death if it means you’ll get some of the fair maidens' sweet lovin’. This is the heroic thing to do, of course.\n\nDoesn’t get more morally rotten than this. Final verdict: Awesome\n\nSide note: after approx. 50 hours of playing, a bug caused my entire save to get erased, without chance of recovery. Not so awesome.","January 19, 2014","true","53.3"," 138 of 179 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","138","179","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/204360/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","Probably one of the best 4 player co-op games you can get in the Steam Store! Apart from Left 4 Dead that is. Castle Crashers has a lot to offer to those special groups, composed of four friends, as you'll find your team gaining experience, learning new unique moves in combat and fighting to the death of every chapter, all with a touch of humour. This game reaks of Indie-goodness and it goes for a fact that I love that type of game producing and development; Independently made, tying in nicely together, to make a labour of love.\n\nI love the particular 'crude' and simplistic art style this game has. Coming from the beloved artist, Dan Paladin, his ingenius creativity is best said as beautiful and completely staggering. Every character has a ''comic-component'' to them, including their emotions being presented in that of a slap-stick type of fashion. Interaction with random NPC's and the wacky medieval environments are top-notch and goofy and the rest can be left as fun. What more could be said?\n\nThe game's appeal and genre, being in the typical 2-D Adventure Beat 'em Up hybrid, relates to the classic and retro games like Golden Axe for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, the classic Arcade game, Final Fight and even dating way back to Double Dragon and Battletoads for the NES. All of which shrouds you in a distant yet cherished memory, while this game adapts to its own heartwarming and charmful stylish nature. If you have played all of these previous games or other games that shares this joyful genre, you will most likely adapt to this game's control with pure expert skill.\n\nThe game's mechanics are very immersive and easy enough to figure out even for first timers. Most battle systems work in waves; with a certain number of enemies that increase in power as you progress and defeat all enemies in a specific wave, which lets you advance further within a level. Most levels end in with a big boss battle, where your techniques, might and agility is put to the test, as you'll take down numerous tyrants and beasts, again with all a touch of humour and creative cartoon-ish atmospheres. All of this, to uphold the traditional tale of medieval times, where a brave knight will rise up and save the princess, either from evil tyrants, corrupt kings or beasts and the much darker figure that is behind the game's plot overall.\n\nThough this game is impeccable and fun with friends, this little gem doesn't seperate itself from its own fair share of problems. First of all, I find the controllability with the keyboard a little finicky and hard to manoeuvre when you're on the field, smashing vikings and gladiators alike. Understandably, the game does warn you right from the very beginning that a controller is highly recommended, but it doesn't distinguish the fact that a keyboard is optional and here's where I think a little more work should've been put in. Another problem I keep running into is the multiplayer connectivity. Me, neither of my mates who I've played Castle Crashers with had no internet connection problems at all, while the game seems to freeze, not respond and generally lags while in-game.\n\nTo me, this game is one of the biggest icons, to serve off as inspiration to even those small Independent game developers who will hopefully get their projects recognized around. As well as a big Indie-icon, a definite recommendation from me as you will soon find out that many people have this in their own game library. I will conclude this review by saying that this game is just that damn good.","October 11, 2014","true","5.6"," 68 of 78 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","68","78","5","0"

Beat up baddies! Crash their castles and fight for honor and love! Hack n' Slash your way to glorious victory with a few poop jokes along the way.\nCastle Crashers is an Action Co-op Beat 'em up Flash game!\nDeveloped by The Behemoth, originating from their popular website, http://www.newgrounds.com/. Knowing that, the game comes with hilarious, but crude sense of humor, which is all part of the game's special charm. The game is all hand-drawn in Flash, giving it a nice and colorful artstyle that adds a cartoonish appeal to the game. Additionally, most of the music in Castle Crashers are submitted by loyal Newgrounds fans!\n\nHack! Slash! Smash! Abracadabra!\nThe gameplay is what makes this game great. It's your usual beat 'em up formula, with light and heavy attacks, performing combos and such. But in addition to that, you have the ability to cast magic! Controls the elements as you spark fire, summon icicles, conduct electricity, fling poison and throw buzz saws? Castle Crashers also features RPG elements, as you gain EXP for every hit, and with enough EXP, you level up! Granting you points in which you could assign to either physical or magical power!\n\nThe Evil Wizard has kidnapped the King's daughters!\nThe story can't be much simpler than this. As your king's loyal knights, you venture off to save the 4 princesses that has been taken away by the evil clutches of the Final Boss! You journey through war fields, forests, deserts, snow lands and many more as you battle various bosses such as barbarians, trolls, robots, dragons and aliens! Whenever you save one of the princesses, the true battle begins, as you and your friends fight to the death to win the princess' kiss! During your free time, you're free to participate in other game modes such as Arena; as you duel your friends gladiator style, and All You Can Quaff; where you and your friends race to who can "Quaff" their food the fastest!\n\nJourney alone or adventure with your buddies with up to four players!\nEither local, online, or hell, even both! You can select from a variety of knights, each with their own unique magical element, with many more unlockable characters as you play through the game. You can also select from a variety of weapons and pets, or "animal orbs" as the game calls them along the way, as most of them are cleverly hidden all across the map. However, this becomes a problem for most unlockable characters involve beating the game as certain other characters, then beating them game with those newly unlocked characters. Most of the characters are pretty much the same anyway for they share similar magic, while certain ones break the game from how Overpowered they are. While the game is relatively short and fun, it could be bothersome to most who plans to unlock everything.\n\nFinal Verdict!\nWhile the game is fun alone, it is strongly recommended playing with friends. The game is unfortunately dying, so there are not many people playing online that often, so it's best to just host private games with friends. While unlocking more characters, animal orbs and weapons can be fun, it's still dependent on the player if they're into that sort of thing, and if they're willing to play the game numerous times just to achieve them.\n\nGrab the game when you can! Get the 4-pack, even! The game went as low as 90% off on sale, so you have no reason not to get it! And when you do start playing, don't play as any of the DLC characters for your first playthrough, for they do not unlock any new characters if you beat the game as them. Despite all these flaws, I'm a fan of it myself, so if you need someone to play with, give me a holler and we'll crash some castles together!","October 13, 2014","true","127.5"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","60","68","4","6"

A fun 4 player co-op game where you and your team (or even by yourself) go through many battles and boss fights leveling up your character to learn unique skills, combat skills etc. The game does not have the best graphics, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still a fun and of course an addicting game for you and your friends to play together. The game has a lot of enjoyment to it, the type of game where I would spend my time on for a while showing lots of love for.\n\nBasically, a couple of enemies have come to your castle and stole the princesses. You and your friends go on adventure progressing through many battles and boss fight trying to save the princesses by being "Castle Crashers" if you know what I mean. It starts off from easy battles to becoming more difficult but you'll be able to level up your character so he/she could become stronger and acquire unique combat skills and magical abilities. Shops will also be available for you around the map so you can buy healing potions, weapons, and even cute little pets on your journey.\n\nThe maximum level you can reach each character is 99 as I believe. Once you reached level 99 or completed the whole story, don't think you're finished yet. There are lots more things you could do. While you are on your adventure, note that you could've missed a lot of "secret" items hidden around certain parts of the map whether it's weapons or pets. Battle arenas are also around the maps where you can test out your characters combat skills fighting certain multiples of the same type of enemy (Yes, there are different types of enemies). Now, if you're sure you're 100% completed the game, try maxing out another character to level 99, or even better, do it with a couple of friends. It's usually fun when you're playing with friends even if you've completed the game.\n\nYou'll have the ability to unlock many different characters in the game with diverse abilities. While progressing through the story, you'll be unlocking new playable characters. Many characters can be unlocked through completing battle arenas, or completing a certain area on INSANE mode like the royal king of your castle. Insane mode is a special mode after you complete the story. It's much harder but you'll gain a good amount of EXP.\n\nIf you're into some fun humorous RPG games, I'm 100% sure you'll like Castle Crashers. I've spent most of my hours on this game alone but still have fun playing it. Great content, great story, great features. Overall, it's just addicting as hell.\n","January 27, 2015","true","22.3"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","44","47","3","0"

Though it can be done, single-player assaults are more frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with other people. The biggest issue in trying to take on levels solo is that multiple enemies can assault you with ranged attacks, making it difficult to even stand up before being knocked down again. Animal orbs are probably my favorite thing in Castle Crashers because they're just so damn cute.\n\nPRESENTATION:\n\nThe story is straightforward and the game is easy to pick up and play.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nEverything is beautifully drawn and animated.\n\nSOUND:\n\nThe digital, techno tunes are upbeat and perfect background music for raising hell.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nClassic side-scrolling brawler gameplay mixed up with fun boosts and magic makes for a great time with friends. Slightly busted multiplayer is a downer though.\n\nLASTING APPEAL:\n\nThe campaign is short, but there are multiple characters to unlock, lots of weapons and animals to unlock and 99 levels to max out, making it a game you can spend some serious time with.\n\n\nTwo other negatives:\n\nThe game is not worth the high price. Buy it on sale instead.\nIt can be rather repetetive.\n\n6/10","November 2, 2015","true","13.7"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","32","35","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/204360/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","This game is what I would call a classic of the modern gaming era. It's not exactly new, but it still manages to keep a certain freshness to it, which is actually quite impressive.\n\nWhen I say "classic", I mean a game that is a sort of important pillar to gaming in general. Now, I wouldn't say that it changed the whole industry per say, but I still consider this one to be a game that is part of my childhood to an extend. Many can possibly relate to that thought, I'd wager.\n\nNow, what exactly is Castle Crashers? Well, to resume the whole experience in a single sentence, it's basically a "smash right through the enemies, save the princesses and defeat the evil king". Sounds simple, doesn't it? That's no surprise; because this game is simple.\n\nThe true experience truly comes to life when you bring a friend or two along the ride. As most multiplayer games, having someone to play with you really is a must to enjoy the full adventure. Honestly, playing through this game alone is kind of boring, and considering that the designs of the levels highly support multiplayer, trying to go through the game alone can prove to be a chore. Then again, I did play and finish it alone the first time, but when I replayed it with a few folks, my overall opinion changed drastically.\n\nThis game is huge. Don't let the tiny sixteen bucks tell you otherwise; it's probably one of the biggest adventures I've seen for a Smash 'em up. The adventure itself isn't much to speak about, my friends and I started from the beginning and finished after around four sessions of one hour each. What makes this thing so huge is the unlockable content. There are a ton of them, such as characters, pets, weapons, levels, and even a secret difficulty. You'll be grinding and repeating the same levels many times to find rare items and weapons if completion matters to you.\n\nI'd like to speak about the difficulty, since I feel like difficulty is something that matters for many players and buyers. The game in itself isn't harshly hard. Most bosses have simple patterns, the level designs can be either fair or sometimes overwhelming, and the overall product will not make you frustrated to the point of screaming. Of course, I won't say that it is an easy game either; sometimes it feels like the game throws so much at you, I find it almost unfair. Without spoiling too much, the final boss in particular has a lot of annoying patterns that can drag for a while, especially if alone.\nUpon finishing the game, you will have the option of changing to an even harder difficulty. I will warn you : It is cheap. Enemies are insanely powerful, and quite frankly, it's not fun. If that sounds appealing to you, then go ahead and try it. I, for one, will stay away and advices you to do so as well.\n\nThe game has two primary mechanics : Physical attacks and Magical moves. Physical attacks are, as the name says, attacks with weapons. The damage that you will do to enemies is generated by how much points to give to your Physical stats. Magical moves are attacks composed of magic. Giving points to this stat will not only grow your magical abilities and make them more powerful, it will also make the range and overall usefulness much more adaptable.\n\nThe best idea would be to try to make a balanced knight, since enemies later on will either be extremely resistant to Physical attacks or highly resistant to Magic. You always need to have an alternative, or else it becomes truly bothersome.\n\n\nI believe that I mentioned every aspects worth mentioning. This game is great, and while not a masterpiece by any means, it should prove itself quite worthy of your purchase. Do not forget to try and ask a few friends if they wish to play along!","October 19, 2015","true","55.1"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","22","25","3","0"

Aajwdlijf ajw dhrugdh 11/10!!'Now considering I took a 4 year hiatus, I'm sure a relatively large sum of you guys reading this review are in the same position as me.....'\n\nI was first introduced into the wacky world of Castle Crashers back in 2008 via the mini flash-game Castle Crashing "The Beard." Back then, Kongregate was the king and it quickly became my favourite platformer. Despite the simplicity of the artwork and game mechanics, the game had character and it was obvious that the developers weren't afraid to show off their work against the smorgasbord of stereotypically depicted knights, castles and overworked medieval warfare.\n\nWell a few months later, it was announced that Castle Crashing "The Beard" would fully mature into a proper side-scrolling beat-em-up platformer with an actual story (like fighting a giant beard would be believable lel)! While I was quickly swept away by the hype, I wasn't an Xbox owner and the prospects of getting one just for Castle Crashers weren't high. And so after beating the flash version a few times, I slowly let go of the unattainable and moved onto other things.\n\n4 years later, things had certainly changed; games were easily attainable now that I had become a successful Steam trader and suddenly out of the blue, Castle Crashers appeared on the Store page! So much time had passed that embarrassingly, the switch inside my head didn't immediately click... I saw the 4 knights and noticed the mellow colours but couldn't put my hand on why they were so familiar.. After a quick google search of "Crashing beard game" my mind became frantic, the impossible was finally possible, I HAD to play this game!!\n\nNow considering I took a 4 year hiatus, I'm sure a relatively large sum of you guys reading this review are in the same position as me. While the flash-version was extremely addictive, Castle Crashers is a refreshing rendition.\n\nHere are a few reasons for which Castle Crashers is a must-buy for people in the same position as I was:\nThe simplicity of the fighting mechanics and overall movement has been entirely conserved.\nArtwork and soundtrack stays true to the original version :).\nExtensive storyline that will take you through an epic journey where you will meet the most creatively designed foes.\nLocal and Online Multiplayer!\nAbility to play as other characters other than the 4 knights including...Pink Knight :D:D:D  (Yes, Pink knight from Crashing Beard is in this game with his lollipop sword!!!!!)\nNow unfortunately there are a few downsides:\nLatency issues and lag when playing with others across the world (Yes it's an old game, luckily its smoother with peers who live closer to you).\nFew features and special attacks are missing from the flash-version including Orange Knight's special pheonix attack.\nGrinding: there will be unavoidable moments where you will need to grind certain stages of the game in which you will need to repeat certain levels to kill enemies due to the simplicity of the game's levelling system. For each character, you will need to spend a few hours on the same level to be able to play insane mode.\nFortunately a few of these issues will be addressed in the Remastered edition to be released later this year (2015) including performance improvements - especially in online multiplayer. If you don't enjoy the grinding, just play with a friend, the social interaction will definitely put the boring aspects of the game to ease ;)\n\nOverall, I definitely do recommend Castle Crashers, if you loved the game on Kongregate or Newgrounds and don't trust the "overwhelmingly positive" review rating, let me assure you that it is undeniably worth it's weight in gold.\nAlso the game does drop to $1.49 and usually below $5 during the Steam sales so there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't give it a try!","July 1, 2015","true","17.7"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","20","22","3","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trapfly/recommended/204360/","trapfly","Trapfly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trapfly/","85 products in account","I've had some mixed feelings regarding this game.\n\n[MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD]\n\nFirst of all, I played the main campaign with three of my friends locally, which I'm going to assume would enhance the Castle Crashers experience.\n\nMy initial impression of this game was extremely positive. This is, without a doubt, one of the best beat-em-up games in quite some time, and its popularity really reflects that.\n\nThe game sports little in terms of story, besides a standard rescue the princesses plot, and there's absolutely no dialog except for informational text. That being said, this is actually beneficial, because it allows you to focus primarily on the gameplay.\n\nIts soundtrack didn't stand out to me very much, except for two tracks in particular (the world map theme and a certain battle theme that plays frequently). The sound effects are decent too.\n\nNow, then, onto the gameplay. Castle Crashers is a hectic, zany game in which you travel to various fantasy locations and beat the stuffing out of strange things. These include giant cats, corn, knights, and... strange sketches of unicorns.\nGenerally, there are high amounts of characters on screen at once, so it's quite chaotic and new players might lose track of their avatar at first. You can equip various types of weapons, some being humorous, and others quite formidable looking. In addition, you can also collect pets that grant you stat bonuses. These can all be selected at the blacksmith on your map once you locate them.\n\nLevels contain numerous secrets and loot, and they have quite a few interesting stage hazards.\nAt the end of most scenes, you'll fight a boss enemy that can take extreme amounts of damage before dying. Normally, these are creative and relatively fun to fight. The giant corn cob and the Frost King are not in that category though, because they teleport so much that it turns the game into whack-a-mole.\n\nAttacks come in two varieties: magic, and physical. There are obviously status effects too. In the beginning, each character only starts with one spell, but as you level up your magic stat you can unlock more. Experience is earned by slaying enemies, and other upgradeable stats include strength, defense, and agility (although I might've left out a few).\n\nIn addition, you can use your shield to block enemy attacks at strategical moments, do a basic attack with your weapon, or a slower, stronger attack with a different button. When enemies are knocked down, you can also stomp on them or throw them. Jumping is a feature too, so that's nice.\n\nItems in this game are extremely useful for surviving. Potions are the most important, as they restore your health completely, and even activate automatically when you die. The bow is useful at first, but becomes increasingly useless as you advance through the game. You can get a shovel to dig up hidden treasures, and a horn that only opens one door in the game (but can help you find certain secrets). There are also bombs, peanut butter and jelly (which makes you giant and powerful), and a boomerang.\n\nPersonally, I feel as though the gameplay got a bit stale after a few hours, but that wasn't due to level design flaws (which is a bit creative), but rather due to the fact that you can button mash your way through most opponents if you have a decent amount of potions. The game doesn't appear to have too many outstanding combos either, besides the magic spells and a few you unlock for leveling up.\n\nEven so, the art is great, character designs are excellent, and each location is unique and interesting.\nIf you think it's too easy, you can unlock an insane mode after completing the campaign. I haven't actually tried it (since it wouldn't work in multiplayer for me), but I'll update this review if I do.\n\nAh yes, before I forget, the game has an impressive amount of unlockable characters. These can be earned through naturally progressing through stages, or through other, more secret and difficult conditions.\nEach seems to have a unique bow, starting weapon, and spells to keep things fresh, so you could get a lot of replay value out of leveling them all up if you're into that.\n\nPvP is quite hectic, but not really a selling point. All You Can Quaff is nothing but a glorified Mario Party minigame, but the arena mode is better. It has giant cats. I've never played it online though, so I'm not sure if it's unbalanced or not.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the confusing save system. The game seems to save after every boss fight, but checkpoints are unlocked before that which you can access on the world map. Even so, if you exit the game before beating the boss, you can't continue from the checkpoints. It just seems a bit strange, like old Magicka. Also, when playing in two player or singleplayer, my progress seemed to vanish completely. This might just be due to different characters being related to the save files or something. The PvE arenas are only playable solo, which slightly irks me too.\n\nCurrently, Castle Crashers has two DLC packs, which offer additional characters. They only cost two dollars each, and the proceeds allegedly go to charity, so you should purchase those as well.\nAs a bonus for having Battle Block Theatre, you get to play as Hatty, which is definitely a great bonus. He even comes with a whale pet.\n\nSo in conclusion, Castle Crashers is a hilarious brawler with tense gameplay, and it's also a great way to spend ten hours with friends at your side. Never before have I seen a game in that genre quite as random as it (considering you battle a knight playing an organ minutes before fighting bandits and bears atop a carriage), and it's certainly well worth the time invested into it.\n\nOh, and the ending legitimately caught me off guard. Props to the devs.\n\nPros:\nHectic gameplay.\nIt's pretty humorous.\nLevel design is great.\nSo much to unlock, plus it has a bonus hard mode that you can use to unlock more things.\nCons:\nSave system is difficult to understand at first.\nYou can just button mash through most of the game if you have many potions.\nOverall, I'd give it a... 8 / 10.\n\n(Tell me if there's a way to play through insane mode in local multiplayer too, and if it's worthwhile.)","March 12, 2015","true","24.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","18","19","4","1"

I ended up picking it up on a Steam sale for my son, who wanted it. To my surprise this game is a blast. You pick one of four knights each with a special ability. Fire, Poison, Electricity, Ice, you get the idea. The powers give you a special attack that does significant damage, as well as decides the color of your knight. The game supports full controller, local co-op, online co-op, and local plus online co-op. This is the way it should be. Local co-op, and split screen belong on PC! The game features three modes, campaign, versus, and a jumping mini game (not my cup of tea, but some may like jumping). The campaign mode is where it's at. You, and up to three friends button mash your way to victory against the evil horde to save the princesses. The combat gives you some options aside from hack n slash, like your special power, bow, bomb, and a few simple combos. The music is great, they did a nice job on the tracks for this game. The monster design is comical, and slicing the heads off little minions is fun.  The game will run on almost any PC (Not your Commodore 64, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). If you've been passing on this one, give it a try at the next sale.\n\nOLDER GAMER APPROVED  POTATO PC CERTIFIED\nVisit our Currator Page","December 2, 2015","true","6.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/recommended/204360/","outlaw953","Metal Bison [33rd]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/","263 products in account","Brought to you by The Behemoth crew, Castle Crashers is a four-player hack ‘n’ slash three-dimensional side-scrolling title that rivals and is reminiscent of Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara…well, if it held a different tone. Castle Crashers retains a resonance with the cast of the game, featuring the likes of Dan Paladin, Will Stamper, and several others, and mashes comedy into the classic ‘your princess is in another castle’ story arch. This title features four base knights-green, blue, red, and orange-with varying powers, and adds Hatty Hattington to the roster if you own BattleBlock Theater for Steam; there are also twenty other unlockable characters as well as two purchasable knights, but I will speak further on the said two in a later section.\nHere are a few things that I find interesting about Castle Crashers:\n\nLeveling System - Players have to put in some work to level up, as experience is granted based more-so on enemies routed and hits connected than overall damage done. What I love about this take on level-ups is that it blends well with the player-versus-player elements, and allows the more tenacious ‘crashers’ to gain levels more frequently than those attempting to preserve health; the player-versus-player aspect will be explained in further detail next. As an individual knight gains a level, he has the opportunity to allot a gen number of points into four different traits: Strength, to determine the power of the knight’s attacks; Magic, which improves the knight’s magic attack maneuvers, spell effectiveness, and how much energy a spell utilizes on cast based on the total amount of energy; Defense, which dictates the knight’s health point total; and Speed, which determines how much damage the Bow item deals with each strike and, obviously enough, the individual knight’s movement. Combined with varying statistic-altering weapons, items, and pets, this leveling system permits players to create their own form of strategy.\n\nForced Player-Versus-Player - Castle Crashers is a cooperative experience, so what could it possibly mean to ‘force’ players to combat against each other? At the end of each stage resulting in the liberation of a princess, only one knight may earn the kiss of valiance from the fair maiden. To effectively decide who is chosen, the players duke it out with all of their acquired abilities and equipment. Unlike most things in this title, a princess’ kiss does not grant any boons, bonuses, or additional equipment; however, it is very satisfying viewing the ‘saltiness’ on friends’ faces when you have stolen the embrace from their colored princess.\n\nMinigames - With various landscapes and degrees of difficulty between the stages, the campaign offers an abundance of cooperative play. But minigames are available to sweeten the deal. I must admit that I have not played too many of them, but the few that I have experienced-like beach volleyball-were so much fun to play with friends and online, win or lose.\n\nHumor - Simply put, from its theme to its plot twists and cutscenes, Castle Crashers is a title that will provoke, at the very least, a snicker. I feel as though I should refrain from revealing too much from this engaging title’s comedy approach as it is very well written. It can also be humorous when played with friends even at points when it is not necessarily meant to be; this is enhanced through splitscreen play.\n\nTL:DR - Castle Crashers is highly enjoyable, especially for fanatics of hack ‘n’ slash and cooperative titles, character leveling and building, and of The Behemoth’s previous title, BattleBlock Theater; speaking of, I also recommend-if you do not already own both games-the purchase of the bundle featuring Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater. I would also recommend the purchase of the Pink Knight and the Blacksmith downloadable content since proceeds are given to various charities. Whether solo or in cooperative play, with BattleBlock Theater and the downloadable content or not, Castle Crashers is a laughably good time. I had wanted to mention other notable features in this title such as its outstanding level design and themes, gameplay, and specific items but I feel as though I would be continuing on for days if I started. On a side note, I would like to mention that I will gladly play with anyone that owns this title or others. Simply add me on Steam and post the reason why you plan to add me on my profile. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

That was the most annoying part considering my boyfriend had to revive me without seeing the meter and i couldn't see my enemies majority of the time.\n\nI really like the wide range of weapons/pets & am hoping for armour to be added later.\nIf you wanna get money really quickly I suggest beating the barbarian boss over and over (you get a load of gems and coins) or if you want exp one hit kills are pretty sweet if you wanna do it quickly (like the scorpions and in the sand biome, the barbarians before the boss and the alien minions on the space craft).\n\nOverall the game is about an 8/10 just because of those couple of annoying features and the fact that I've had to grind like a lil ♥♥♥♥♥ for hours to get high enough levels to progress.\nI'm not yet done but am really enjoying it so far.","November 2, 2015","true","16.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","12","14","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/204360/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nCastle Crashers is a side scrolling Beat 'em up developed by The Behemoth (A developer I'm falling deeper in love with) and released in 2012.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Castle Crashers takes place in a cartoon Middle Ages universe. The knights are sitting around a table eating a feast, but suddenly an evil wizard steals a large gem, and runs off with four princesses! Being a knight, it is your noble duty to save the princesses, the kingdom, and retrieve the stolen gem.\nQueue Adventure!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=507999966\n\nGameplay: The Castle Crashers recommends you use a controller, when you first launch the game. Anyone who knows me; knows I'm stubborn and refuse to purchase a controller for my computer. So... regarding the controller suggestion: Yes, it would be much easier on your progressing-carpal-tunnel. But, the game is completely doable with just a keyboard. (It's worth noting that the game key prompts on the menu and in game are actually for a controller; but again, you just get used to it)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=507997046\nThe controls are pretty basic you have three types of attacks: light attack, heavy attack, and throw item. (you can unlock and use different combos between jumping, quick attacks, and heavy attacks) You also have a block button that slows you down, but if you time it correctly, it can literally save your character's life.\nAs you progress through the game your character will gain experience points, money, animal orbs, and new weapons that you can purchase or will randomly drop off enemies. Your unlockables are accessible at the Blacksmith, and there are plenty of things to collect to keep you busy.\n\nAchievements: There are 12 achievements in Castle Crashers, this is one of those games that is relatively easier to get 100%. However, four of these achievements require playing with at least one other player. One achievement requires being in a four player game.\nThere are only two achievements worth warning/note: Arena Master (Win 40 Arena Online Matches) and Glork (Win 20 All you can Quaff Online Matches). I won't lie, to earn these achievements, I ran between two computers. My brother was nice enough to be a punching bag, when he was away at work or school.\nAlternative strategy: Hit the fourms and see if anyone wants to trade off, you could do something else while you get beat up... …..likeeee Battle block Theater! link at bottom. :P\n\nPrice: Castle Crashers is priced at $14.99, for the amount of time you'll spend playing this game on your own, and with friends, that's a fair price. However if you're the first of your friends to play this game (unlikely... but who knows, maybe it's possible?) you should grab the 4-pack so you can play with 3 other friends. (Trust me, the game is even more fun with a friend)\n\nConclusion: Story: Pretty stereo typical story line, but it's delivered hilariously and without any voiced/text narrative (bonus points) and with plenty of humor. Gameplay: Suggested controller, but doable with a keyboard alone, I won't pay for carpal tunnel treatment. Shush! Achievements: Fairly obtainable 100% without too much of a time commitment, but you will need another friend or three. Price: Fair, better with a sale, or buying a bundle deal on sale.\nAll in all, this game appeals to anyone who might have enjoyed playing an arcade styled game, indie platformers, 2D, indie graphics, 4 player games, or just wants to support The Behemoth.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=507994483\n\nMore from The Behemoth\nIf you want to see my review for BattleBlock Theater,\nclick here!\nIf you *just* wanted to check out BattleBlock Theater, click here... :'( but my review will miss you.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update August 28, 2015:\nSpell checking, Thanks Angfucious!

Why they were kidnapped beats me, so there are a couple of plot holes. Should you care? Not really, because this game doesn't really focus on the plot in the first place.\n\nEach of these four knights have their own special ability that can be executed on the battlefield. You take your weapon, your shield, and your power, and you hack and slash through swarms of enemies and the occasional boss fight. Yes it has the potential to get boring, but I haven't reached that point yet.\n\nThroughout the game, you can discover and pick up new weapons and little pets to follow you around, all to be saved in a little shed that you can go back to to change up your stats. So it's your decision whether you want to destroy enemies with an epic vorpal sword or a slab of meat, and whether you want a tiny floating ram following you around or a tiny floating cat.\nEach time you play through this game with a different knight, you unlock another character to rip through enemies with, which does add to the motivation of playing.\n\nThis game is very quirky. There will be moments in the background that make you look at it and say "Did that just happen?" in the ridiculous sense. These moments will even happen in the up close foreground. There are many moments that made me chuckle which made this game all the more appealing.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty badass\n\nIf you're looking for a coop game, local or online, definitely consider Castle Crashers. It was an enjoyable experience, but it's certainly one that requires you to play with others to be fully satisfied.\n\n100/10 MASTERPIECE!","December 14, 2014","true","29.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Your only goal is to rescue the four distressed princesses from formidable foes and earn their kisses as a reward. This game is best played with two to three other friends, a controller, and a box to pizza to share.\n\nPros:\n-Over 30 unique characters and dozens of weapons to unlock and choose from.\n-Cheap DLC characters with proceeds going to charity.\n-Can be played on keyboard or a controller.\n-Wonderful cartoonish graphics and easy-to-learn gameplay.\n-Constant action and a simple levelling system.\n-Crude humour with poop jokes.\n\nCons:\n-Game can get boring and repetitive after completion with multiple characters.\n-Lacks a high number of achievements for achievement-loving gamers.\n\nOverall:\nCastle Crashers is a fun game to play with friends and is a must-buy when on sale. It is simple and provides constant action throughout the story. Beating the game with certain characters unlocks other unique characters that all have their own pros and cons. With so many weapons, pets and characters to choose from, Castle Clashers is surely an enjoyable classic.

With an intriguing art style by Dan Paladin, and tight controls, Castle Crashers is a great experience, multiplayer or single player. What really makes the game special though is the multiplayer. If you do choose to buy it for single player, there still is a buttload of content, but it is endlessly entertaining to work together with friends to steam roll enemies. If this is your first time looking into this genre, you won't be upset.

The humor, game play and the low price make it worth every penny. Unfortunately, the developers were a bit lazy making the port - When playing on a keyboard you will have no idea what you are doing. The game doesn't tell you how to play and the tutorials show the Xbone(xbox) controls, not the keys.\n\nOverall though, the game is damn near perfect. If you don't own a controller but don't mind 30 minutes of fiddling and clicking, the game is perfect for you. If you own a controller and can connect it to your PC...BUY THIS GAME NOW.\n\nOne of the best indie games ever made hands down. It has it all. Fun medieval sword fighting against evil knights, monsters and strange creatures. Good graphics and addicting levels. Castle Crashers is best enjoyed through multiplayer. The game lets you enable voice chat for a more fun experience. I seriously think it's a powerful and engaging fighting experience, even if it is  cartoony.\n\nPlenty of replay-ability in this title also, with arenas and arcade modes available. 10/10 for me.","December 17, 2013","true","5.1"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

It's one of those games that is best enjoyed together with friends but also very do-able on solo. In my case i can't say how much fun i had with this game whilst playing together with a friend on his playstation.\n\nThe story is pretty easy to understand, the castle you live in is under attack by barbarians and the king has something stolen from him so it is up to the player(s) to get it back for his majesty. It's an arcade style adventure game where you will fight enemies along the way and every once in a while you can expect to be treated to a bossfight so be sure to gear up. Castlecrashers also has an awesome ingame soundtrack made by various users over at Newgrounds which set a proper athmosphere and to be honest can be very catchy.\n\nWhen it comes to leveling and items the game also comes with a level system (1 > 99) and during your playthrough you will find different weapons and items that will fit your playstyle and will unlock different skins with each their unique attacks and magic. There are also pets you can find in the world to aid you along your travels.\n\nCastle crashers is definitly recommendable. It comes with a normal mode and a very challenging hardcore mode so ye be warned.\n\nAll the best!\n\n(s.i.e)","August 8, 2014","true","7.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingofgummyworms/recommended/204360/","kingofgummyworms","barble","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingofgummyworms/","76 products in account","Played this game thoroughly on Xbox a few years ago, and it's still just as good as  a PC port years later. Any character can fufill the warrior, mage, and rogue archetypes, or you can go as a Jack-of-All-Trades master of all four character skills: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. Not to mention, there's a huge selection of 80+ weapons and 20+ "animal orbs" (pet followers) with special attribute bonuses that make archetypes even stronger.\n\nThere are a few levels, such as Lava World and Full Moon (at least for me) that can come as a pretty big challenge if you're not prepared, meaning a bit of grinding might be in store if you don't have friends to back you up. However, even the grinding isn't as tedious as other games, as you can potentially revisit past areas and pick up weapons and animal orbs you might have missed.\n\nThe game is even more fun with a friend or two, cos why beat up a horde of enemies on your own when you can juggle them back and forth with a pal? However, the game lacks the same "more loot per additional player" mechanic that Borderlands 2 has, meaning that weapon, animal orb, and boss chest loot is often unfairly divided. However, the loot is not a large problem, since as long as you have a good sword that matches the build you're going for and enough money to buy some potions, you should be able to survive and thrive.\n\nThe game is good for quick, casual fun with friends, and can also satisfy more gameplay-hungry players with it's "Insane Mode", which rescales the entire world so characters that have beaten the game can replay from the start (retaining any levels, skill points, weapons, and animal orbs you collected so far) with enemies that remain challenging.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It's suitable for all types of players, whether you play for 1 hour or 100 hours. Everything in the game feels good, from leveling up and developing your character's skills, to watching your collection of weapons and animal orbs grow with every cleared area, to finally beating that one boss that looked so threatening at first. Buy it, it's well worth the money.\n\n((also, if you do buy the game, get the two DLCs too. it's cheap, has good content, and 100% of the proceeds goes to non-profit good-will organizations))","November 29, 2014","true","34.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The story actually has 2 parts. The 1st part is a wizard takes a giant crystal from the king and flies off with it. The 2nd part is actually more interesting since you wont really care a lot about the 1st problem, a group of barbarians kidnap the king;s '4' daughters. This game is a action, adventure and a hack and slash. You must fight waves and waves of enemies to progress through the level. If you are playing multiplayer, there will be more enemies, have more hp and when you beat the boss with a princess, you duel to see who gets a kiss from her.There are a vareity or sword you can pick up in this game and every sword change your stats or give you a chance to freeze/burn/critical/poison your enemies.\nThere are also pets that give you a small bonus making it useful. There is a leveling up system in this game and every level you get, you can rank up your stats for either Strength,Magic,Defense and Agility.\nThere is over 25 characters to unlock which can be a pain to do since most of them require to beat the game with a certain character and they all have diffrent magic so choose wisely.\nI give this game 9 out of 10 due to the communications when someone else wants something that you dont want.","July 6, 2014","true","401.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I would do it with friends just because by yourself its really hard especially halfway through. The All you can Quaff game i think its called is so much fun. The arena fights is fun except for the thieves one just because they just keep on firing arrows when you're on the ground. But still a fun, hilarious game. Their was also the combat style: HACK AND SLASH! Just like the Devil May Cry series. And also the DLC. What can i say about it. You have 2 other players and 10 new weapons (5 for each).

Where have you been living the past 5 years if you aren't even remotely aware of this title by now?\n\nThis game basically has a perfect mix of brawler and RPG elements with optional 4 player co-op. Plenty of secrets to find and gear to collect. Juvenile humor is abound and plentiful. Great soundtrack as well. Brought to you from the artists over at Newgrounds.com.\n\nMy only  real complaint about the game is that there are way too many characters to unlock and the amount of content is limited... too many clones of characters, not enough diversity, makes the game a bit stale over time. By the third playthrough it gets pretty obnoxious having to repeat the entire game over again instead of just allowing you to select your favorite stages.\n\nI wish they would of added more levels or an extra mode that allows you to unlock / level your characters without having to replay the entire story line over again. I mean once or twice is enough... you can't really skip cut scenes either which adds to the annoyance factor. Other than that, it's a great game to play with some friends.","October 7, 2014","true","15.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

The game really starts to grab you in by the cajones when you unlockl the Pink Knight in the DLC. Once you get the Pink Knight the plot thickens, enemies get tougher, and princesses get uglier. I like the part where you tell someone to go away from where you are digging, you dig up the giraffe, and then he takes it. The excuse was "I didn't know a giraffe was going to pop out of the ground" as he was told to get away. But the moral of the story is, no matter how far or how long you travel, never trust a purple haired, downfaced, orange dress wearing princess.\n\n2.5/10 would crash again.","June 28, 2014","true","22.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

It's great by yourself and much, much better with friends. Would definitely recommend.\n\nCastle Crashers is a comedic beat 'em up game that incorporates silly content and solid gameplay to create a fun, classic, and heavily group-centred game. You traverse the land, beating the ever-living crap out of every enemy in your way. All the while, you're able to take in the hilarious atmosphere around you and excercise your level of completionism by hoarding money from your friends and grabbing as many pets and swords as possible. There will seriously be moments where you'll be taken back for a second to laugh and say "I can't believe that just happened!" In addition to the button-mashing combat that is fun and challenging, you can enchance gameplay with unique magic powers that every character has.\nPlaying single-player is great, but the real fun comes from multiplayer. You fight each other indirectly for items and money, while at the same time really being on the same team when it comes to battling enemies. The game even has segments where you actually do fight each other, in arenas and when jockeying for a princess's kiss, which keeps playful competitions between you and your friends. At the end of it all, you truly feel accomplished and satisfied by working as a team.\nI would certainly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a game with their friends, the whole experience is wonderfully fun. Any negative points are honestly mitigatable, such as there being sub-par support for keyboard users which can be circumvented by using a controller or simply not caring. All in all, this is truly a wonderful game. Play it, and play it with friends.","May 31, 2015","true","16.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I think what makes the game as good is its simplicity and yet nice variety.\n\nIt does not have the depth of proper RPG games, and yet it offers the basic functions and symbolics :  personalities of the different characters (color, element etc), weapons with different characterics, leveling, possibility to create a mini "builds" (based on strength or magic or agility etc).\n\nThe game is super adjustable. Each session is different. I love the possibility to change color and magic from session to session, when I play solo or with friends. A big thumb up for the Pink Knight, it gave me and my friends hilarious moments.  Also, the levels are sometimes pretty short, sometimes not, which allows for different types of gaming sessions, when you just want to have a short break for 15 up to 30 minutes, or when you wish to explore the aventure mode.\n\nYou can play solo easily at first, but as you progress, you'll need to be cautious and understand the mechanics if you wish to succeed (many many ennemies and long bosses).\n\nIt is MOSTLY recommended as multiplayer, so much on the screen, so much to do, combos... It's a massive source of FUN. Because that's what this game is about, fun. In its gameplay, design, sense of humor.","December 12, 2014","true","7.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

All the while, you're able to take in the hilarious atmosphere around you and excercise your level of completionism by hoarding money from your friends and grabbing as many pets and swords as possible. There will seriously be moments where you'll be taken back for a second to laugh and say "I can't believe that just happened!" In addition to the button-mashing combat that is fun and challenging, you can enchance gameplay with unique magic powers that every character has.\nPlaying single-player is great, but the real fun comes from multiplayer. You fight each other indirectly for items and money, while at the same time really being on the same team when it comes to battling enemies. The game even has segments where you actually do fight each other, in arenas and when jockeying for a princess's kiss, which keeps playful competitions between you and your friends. At the end of it all, you truly feel accomplished and satisfied by working as a team.\nI would certainly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a game with their friends, the whole experience is wonderfully fun. Any negative points are honestly mitigatable, such as there being sub-par support for keyboard users which can be circumvented by using a controller or simply not caring. All in all, this is truly a wonderful game. Play it, and play it with friends.","May 31, 2015","true","16.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a thing that lives among us in the most blatant of displays, or it can harbor itself within our deepest mental crevices. When the thirst is in it's most realest of forms, it can take the tightest chains of comradery and render them weak and rusty only to be snapped and scattered amongst the ground. Trek through forests, mountains, volcanos, deserts with your friends, conquer your enemies and vanquish every obstacle as a team with your fellow knights.

This once unique blend of indie magic leaves the player feeling like the game could have been a lot better if some obvious changes had been made as to how character progression worked, and reminds us why the Xbox is a failure as a platform for indie games that get ported to PC.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RustyBoom/recommended/204360/","RustyBoom","KiggerBoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RustyBoom/","269 products in account","A classic game that really does require a controller/pad. Get together with 3 friend or power through by yourself. This game is cute, challenging and 100% funny! An absolute must have if I do say so. If you have played previous games from the makers of this game (For example; Alien Homind) you will see that they do carry on their previous ideas and even add to the game with them. You start off with 4 knights, but you unlock many more as you carry on. Each have their own spells and each level seperately and go through the story seperately. Graphics are cartoony, but they suit the game perfectly. Even if this game is old, it's still one you will continue to play and I don't ever seeing this being one of those "Games of the past" because when you do think back to it you'll end up saying "Let's just go on it for old time's sake!"\n\nAlthough I do recommend getting it on sale, I wouldn't have too much of an issue if I paid £9.99 for it. I got it for 90 pence during one sale and don't know how I got by without it! One thing that is worth mentioning, when you unlock new weapons and pets (There are pets with indivual buffs/talents), they unlock for all characters! So there is no real repetitive grind with this game. Truly a game you can always go back to.\n\nShould you get bored too, see if you can't button bash harder than your friends in the "All You Can Quaff" mode! Bash X and Y as fast as you can to eat as much as you can as quick as you can! Finish all the plates before your friend and gain your very own boasting rights! (Terms and conditions apply. Pain in the hand is a known side affect. All rights reserved. Don't see online for details.)\n\nThis game really does speak for itself and one of my most highly reccomended games.","April 26, 2015","true","5.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gumballtoid/recommended/204360/","gumballtoid","Gumballtoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gumballtoid/","86 products in account","An evil wizard steals a large, mystical gem from the king of an unnamed empire, as well as kidnapping its four princesses. The king sends the four brave knights that spearhead his guard into the vast land to rescue the princesses, recover the gem, and defeat the evil wizard. Unfortunately, the knights first have to contend with an army of barbarians storming the king's castle as the wizard makes his escape.\n\nCastle Crashers is a gem among the endless onslaught of casual games available on Steam. It has its flaws, of course, but when all the elements are considered, it makes for a fantastic, "I'm bored, let's play" sort of game that you could very well find yourself coming back to again and again.\n\nThe game is a side-scrolling, linear beat-'em-up, with a silly plot, very apt character design, and great handling in terms of gameplay. When you begin, you take control of one of four knights, each with a unique elemental affiliation; the Green Knight wields deadly poison magic, the Orange Knight pyrokinetically commands fire magic, the Blue Knight freezes enemies with ice magic, and the Red Knight shocks his foes into submission with electric magic. As you progress, more characters are unlocked and thusly become playable, most of which are enemies you will face on your journey. However, replaying the game as a new character gets tiresome if done in excess. Regardless, the wide array of playable characters allows you to find one you like. I adore games that allow for this,\n\nThe gameplay handles well, with a great capacity for combo attacks. Chaining melee attacks of varying strengths, ranged arrow attacks, and magic blasts aptly is the key to victory. Get surrounded, though, and constant attacks will quickly see you beaten down. Drink potions to restore health, or revive fallen comrades with first aid practices. Level up and enhance your knight in one of four fields: power, defense, agility, and magic. Find new weapons with varying properties that can either complement your knight's strengths or cover for his weaknesses. Animal orbs serve as companions and can provie passive benefits, so find as many as you can! The amount of additional goodies you can find is staggering, and it allows you to further set yourself apart amongst your group.\n\nThe multiplayer mode makes this very enjoyable, and since the level-up mechanic is based on hits landed, a player playing through alone from the start would be on even grounds with a group of four playing through from the start for most of the game. Multiplayer also greatly increases your chances for survival, as potions are used automatically and players can revive fallen comrades. It's a lot more fun to play with a friend or two.\n\nThe art style is adorable and hilarious, and it offers a lot of laughs. A forest filled with lovable critters that are inclined to soil themselves is not to be overlooked. There are a bunch of little things that make this game that much more charming, and that's partially why I love it so much.\n\nThe game does have its flaws, though. Some of the bosses have frustrating attack methods that is countered by almost nothing. The Conehead Groom boss, for instance, can be either exploited into submission or result in you being swiftly beaten down without a chance to heal. This is also an Xbox 360 port, so the game even insists you use a controller. A keyboard is usable, but it's very awkward and sometimes more trouble than it's worth. The game can, for some, degenerate into "run forward, mash buttons, run forward again." In that case it simply may not cater to you.\n\nThose aside, I adore this game and it's always great to come back to, especially with friends.","January 4, 2013","true","94.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I like it. The humor of The Behemoth is also something to enjoy, like the pooping owl and the small boss that gets replaced by a bigger boss--not to mention the hilarious unveiling of a certain princess.\n\nIt took 13 hours for me to complete the game, which is on the longer side. It usually only takes 5 hours (according to what I've seen posted) to complete the game. CC has tons of replayability with so many characters and insane mode, but I'm just not one for doing the same levels over again.\n\nAll in all, I'd give it 8/10, and say it's worth playing at least once.","December 31, 2012","true","29.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gumballtoid/recommended/204360/","gumballtoid","Gumballtoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gumballtoid/","86 products in account","An evil wizard steals a large, mystical gem from the king of an unnamed empire, as well as kidnapping its four princesses. The king sends the four brave knights that spearhead his guard into the vast land to rescue the princesses, recover the gem, and defeat the evil wizard. Unfortunately, the knights first have to contend with an army of barbarians storming the king's castle as the wizard makes his escape.\n\nCastle Crashers is a gem among the endless onslaught of casual games available on Steam. It has its flaws, of course, but when all the elements are considered, it makes for a fantastic, "I'm bored, let's play" sort of game that you could very well find yourself coming back to again and again.\n\nThe game is a side-scrolling, linear beat-'em-up, with a silly plot, very apt character design, and great handling in terms of gameplay. When you begin, you take control of one of four knights, each with a unique elemental affiliation; the Green Knight wields deadly poison magic, the Orange Knight pyrokinetically commands fire magic, the Blue Knight freezes enemies with ice magic, and the Red Knight shocks his foes into submission with electric magic. As you progress, more characters are unlocked and thusly become playable, most of which are enemies you will face on your journey. However, replaying the game as a new character gets tiresome if done in excess. Regardless, the wide array of playable characters allows you to find one you like. I adore games that allow for this,\n\nThe gameplay handles well, with a great capacity for combo attacks. Chaining melee attacks of varying strengths, ranged arrow attacks, and magic blasts aptly is the key to victory. Get surrounded, though, and constant attacks will quickly see you beaten down. Drink potions to restore health, or revive fallen comrades with first aid practices. Level up and enhance your knight in one of four fields: power, defense, agility, and magic. Find new weapons with varying properties that can either complement your knight's strengths or cover for his weaknesses. Animal orbs serve as companions and can provie passive benefits, so find as many as you can! The amount of additional goodies you can find is staggering, and it allows you to further set yourself apart amongst your group.\n\nThe multiplayer mode makes this very enjoyable, and since the level-up mechanic is based on hits landed, a player playing through alone from the start would be on even grounds with a group of four playing through from the start for most of the game. Multiplayer also greatly increases your chances for survival, as potions are used automatically and players can revive fallen comrades. It's a lot more fun to play with a friend or two.\n\nThe art style is adorable and hilarious, and it offers a lot of laughs. A forest filled with lovable critters that are inclined to soil themselves is not to be overlooked. There are a bunch of little things that make this game that much more charming, and that's partially why I love it so much.\n\nThe game does have its flaws, though. Some of the bosses have frustrating attack methods that is countered by almost nothing. The Conehead Groom boss, for instance, can be either exploited into submission or result in you being swiftly beaten down without a chance to heal. This is also an Xbox 360 port, so the game even insists you use a controller. A keyboard is usable, but it's very awkward and sometimes more trouble than it's worth. The game can, for some, degenerate into "run forward, mash buttons, run forward again." In that case it simply may not cater to you.\n\nThose aside, I adore this game and it's always great to come back to, especially with friends.","January 4, 2013","true","94.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is fun both single player, and multiplayer. If you can, I would play multiplayer with friends, or even just randoms. If not, then single player is just as good. However, It is lacking that bit of competitive spirit in between you and your teammates. The fighting system is solid, and fair (No PVP stunlocks here folks!) and it can be great fun playing the multiple game modes with others. Also, if you can't play online for whatever reason (Like me 99 percent of the time) but you have friends around that want to play, you can do local multiplayer for all game modes. Even all you can quaff. Ohhhhhhhhhh my thumbs...\n\nOverall, I would say to buy this game.

After many years of playing that game off and on I read in a gaming magazine that The Behemoth was going to make a whole new game that would be similar to Alien Hominid but with Knights. When it eventually came out I grabbed it on the X-Box marketplace. Honestly I must have spent Hundreds of hours on it over the years. It was the go to game when friends came over. We would consistently work towards unlocking new characters and trying to find different swords. There was a lot of fun nd incentive in coming back to play the game over again. It was probably a collective favorite of all my friends and my personal favorite side scroller.\n\nNow years after that constant obsession with Castle Crashers on X-box, it's on Steam. And it is still amazing. The keyboard controls are a bit difficult at first. But after you get used to it the game is smooth and fun. I'm incredibly happy it's on Steam and I highly recommend it.","August 19, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Excellent fluid gameplay that stands up to multiple playthroughs. It's filled with humor added with some blood and gore to the mix with its Beat Em Up gameplay style, level up system which adds a bit more depth to the overall gameplay experience as you can increase your stats or learn new attacks. The game also provides a great multiplayer experience with up to 4 players who can engage to the main campaign which comes in two difficulty flavors or duke it out in a arena type PvP style mode. Play as different types of characters with their own magic style, it's pretty a lot of great humor added throughout the game and Nostalgic Beat Em Up Genre and finally.. Decent plotline. Overall! It's a great Indie game Beat Em Up that contains with RPG and Action, i recommend this game for people who are interested with Beat Em Up and Hack and RPG with Action.\n\nRated: 9.3/10","June 26, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/recommended/204360/","cyberusuk","CyberusUK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/","271 products in account","Castle Crashers is not a new game to me, In fact I pretty much played it non stop when it was released on the Xbox 360. But I’ve finally got round to playing it on the PC and my love affair has started allover again.\n\nBehemoth have a history of shall we say quirky but brilliant games, Alien Hominid and BattleBlock theater are the best known of them. Castle Crashers is no exception to this ether, the age old tail ofKnight rescues Princess is turned into the most ludicrous romp you’ve ever seen. You’ll find yourself retrieving weapons from the mouth of a giant toad, battling a Giant Cat Fish that is more cat than fish and even kissinga clown! Castle Crashers is anything but normal in any sense of the word and that’s its charm.\n\nThe game its self is a fast paced side scrolling beat em up, much like Streets of Rage and Final Fight but completely different at the same time.  It has RPG elements too with characters being awardedpoints for each level they increase that they can spend on various skills such a magic and speed. Weapons can also be discovered through out the game, but with the exception of a few later ones offer very little advantageexcept cosmetics. The starting line up of four characters can be increased as you progress through various means. Pretty much every character in the game if a similar size to the starting line up will become playable.\n\nThe story is set in medieval times, with your Knight sent off to rescue four Princess’s from an evil Sorcerer who has stolen the Kings prized emerald. As I’ve said, its not exactly original, its the\nway its told that’s original. Don’t misunderstand, its not Shakespeare but its extremely funny all the same. You will find yourself travelling through enemy encampments, lava worlds, deserts and even travelling on pirate\nships and alien spacecraft. Castle Crashers isn’t afraid to be obscure or bizarre and we love it for that. The boss battles are imaginative and just as off the wall as the rest of the game. The first boss sets the tone for\nthis very well, You enter an arena to be greeted by a giant barbarian only for him to be squashed by an even bigger one! Or there’s the Giant Metal Hand, the Cat Fish, Medusa and the list goes on.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, its not going to change the way we game or rewrite the genre. Castle Crashers is the ultimate pick up and play game, you don’t need to have played it before and you don’t need\nexperience with scrolling beat em ups. You just play it, there’s no better way to explain it, you just do it. I could explain to you how holding this button and pressing this makes your character do that. But it would be\npointless, the system just works and works well. Its worth pointing out though that although most characters magic ability’s are the same with different effects. Some characters powers really are different and can change\nthe way you play.\n\nThe graphics may not be cutting edge or super realistic, but all the same you’d be hard pressed to find a more stylised example of 2D draw sprites. There fun, colourful and unique, if you’ve played\nany of Behemoth’s other offerings you know what to expect.\n\nSee this and more reviews here http://cyberusuk.com/2015/03/03/castle-crashers-by-behemoth-review-be-a-knight/","April 6, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Purple ( blacksmith ) for example , his first skill is to summon a toad that deals some pretty damage and knock up and then you have these cool hammers spinning in the air throwing them at the enemies , and he's overpowered too.\nIf u like hack'n'slash games you will fall in love with this game . There are like 32 characters ( I'm not sure ) and a lot of bosses , you have arenas and if you complete one you will get a new characters :D , this game is epic and the first time you see the game you don't thing it's so good , but when you play it with your friends this game is very very fun.\nOh , and a thing , every character comes with his unic skills and a weapon ( more weapons in blacksmith's and purple's case )","June 18, 2015","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's defiantly better with a controller. So if you don't have one you wouldn't be getting the full experience. It's also kinda fun by yourself but the downside is you'll be wanting to level up because with friends you can do harder levels with co-op so you should get your friends to play with you as many times as you can with this game. I have not used the keyboard controls so I cannot say they are good or bad. If you have a controller for your PC and almost never use it or need a game that you want to use your controller for get this game. I forgot about the story, it's funny more than serious so keep that in mind. It's pretty solid but if you are fighting your friends it's kinda weird when you are an inch above them and not hitting them. 9/10","January 6, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CeeLoGreed/recommended/204360/","CeeLoGreed","The Papa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CeeLoGreed/","223 products in account","Castle Crashers starts with a mysterious man snatching a large (and what I assume is also expensive) crystal and four lovely princesses from the King's throne. As one of the knights of the castle, it is your duty to retrieve the stolen goods and fair maidens. There's no dialogue, so you won't get more of a story than that unless you use your imagination. That's not a bad thing, though, especially for a brawler. If you're like me, you probably don't need an excuse to chop enemies up into little pieces.\n\nThe best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world -- there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. From slip-n-slide icy terrains to sandy deserts, it's clear that every area was crafted with care by the Behemoth's resident artist, Dan Paladin. His unique art style really brings the environments to life, and even the most ferocious monsters are still pretty cute. To counteract the adorableness of Paladin's creations, the game includes lots of potty humor and gore-filled battles.\n\nThe four starting knights wield magic powers that are differentiated by armor color -- Red has lightning, Green has poison, Orange has fire, and Blue has ice. Armed with magic and steel (or maybe a stick), you'll hack your way through mounds of enemies, gain experience points, and level up. As you progress, you'll garner more skill points to divide amongst four traits: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. You can build up your character however you'd like, but that's not the only way you can customize.\n\nOn your quest to save the princesses you'll discover two other tools to help you: melee weaponry and animal orbs. You can find new weapons several ways; some will be obviously given to you and others you'll need to dig up or purchase at a store. Every weapon will affect your stats either positively or negatively. A regular sword might take away a point of Strength but add a point to your Agility, so you'll need to make the call on what traits are more important to you. The urge to find a better, cooler weapon never dies, so you can expect to search the many hidden crevices of the game until you find something that suites your style.\n\nAnimal orbs are probably my favorite thing in Castle Crashers because they're just so damn cute. There are 28 creatures (the two DLC animals from the Xbox 360 version are now included) scattered across the lands, and it's up to you to find them. Each animal provides a different boost and comes complete with an endearing name, so Meowburt the kitty increases your agility skill while Owlet the owl can retrieve food items for you. It's fun to battle with a small animal hovering around you, especially if it's Rammy the ram who will ram nearby enemies for you.\n\nThe Behemoth is known for making difficult games, most notably Alien Hominid, and that reputation stands true if you try and take on the campaign by yourself. Though it can be done, single-player assaults are more frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with other people. The biggest issue in trying to take on levels solo is that multiple enemies can assault you with ranged attacks, making it difficult to even stand up before being knocked down again. Since it's designed to be a cooperative game, it's hard to scold The Behemoth for making it incredibly difficult to conquer on your own. There's no "I" in team, after all.\n\nSpeaking of friends, you can crash castles with the favorite people on your friends list either locally or online. With local co-op mode, you can't sign into multiple accounts like you could in the Xbox 360 version; you can only split up the main PSN ID into quarters. Friends curious about the game can also drop-in and out from the map, but not in the middle of a level, so it's not truly drop-in, drop-out co-op. Despite that flaw, it is nice that you can mix up the local and online co-op modes, so if you and a buddy at your house want to pair up with some other people on your friends list, you can do that.\n\nIf you're lucky enough, you can successfully create private matches with your friends, but out of several people only one of my friends was able to host a match without getting an error. Dropping into quick matches, however, seemed to work just fine. While playing online, there was some noticeable lag, but it didn't actually interfere until the worst possible moment -- once I made it to last part of the final boss, the game I was in suddenly dropped. Curse you, wretched servers!!! I can only hope that a patch fixing these issues will become available for the PS3 faster than it did for the Xbox 360 version.\n\nSince the game had to be re-coded for the PS3 anyway, The Behemoth added in some minor differences throughout the campaign along with some major re-hauls. The most noticeable change is that the former mode All You Can Quaff has been removed and replaced with Volleyball. True to real life volleyball, there are two four-person teams playing against each other. The only problem is it's really difficult to figure out if you're on the same plane as the ball, so expect to get scored on a lot until you get the hang of it.\n\nTeam Arena has also been updated to include teams. Now you can pair up for some two-on-two battles, or prove yourself against three other people. There's also an Insane Store that's unlocked once you've beaten the game on normal difficulty. All former DLC offerings and the popular Alien Hominid character are included, some are found in the Insane Store, while others have to be earned in different ways.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nThe Behemoth's incredibly fun cooperative beat 'em-up would have been pure brawler perfection if the multiplayer had launched in better form. It's incredibly frustrating that it's easier to play Castle Crashers with strangers than with your friends, but it's still a great brawler that will soak up your time. Between unlocking new characters so you can level them up to finding all of the hidden weapons and animal orbs, there's a lot to do in the campaign mode. If you never experienced the Xbox 360 version, or you happen to have more friends on your PSN list, Castle Crashers is a great game though you might want to wait for a multiplayer patch before investing.","March 21, 2015","true","54.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CeeLoGreed/recommended/204360/","CeeLoGreed","The Papa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CeeLoGreed/","223 products in account","Castle Crashers starts with a mysterious man snatching a large (and what I assume is also expensive) crystal and four lovely princesses from the King's throne. As one of the knights of the castle, it is your duty to retrieve the stolen goods and fair maidens. There's no dialogue, so you won't get more of a story than that unless you use your imagination. That's not a bad thing, though, especially for a brawler. If you're like me, you probably don't need an excuse to chop enemies up into little pieces.\n\nThe best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world -- there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. From slip-n-slide icy terrains to sandy deserts, it's clear that every area was crafted with care by the Behemoth's resident artist, Dan Paladin. His unique art style really brings the environments to life, and even the most ferocious monsters are still pretty cute. To counteract the adorableness of Paladin's creations, the game includes lots of potty humor and gore-filled battles.\n\nThe four starting knights wield magic powers that are differentiated by armor color -- Red has lightning, Green has poison, Orange has fire, and Blue has ice. Armed with magic and steel (or maybe a stick), you'll hack your way through mounds of enemies, gain experience points, and level up. As you progress, you'll garner more skill points to divide amongst four traits: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. You can build up your character however you'd like, but that's not the only way you can customize.\n\nOn your quest to save the princesses you'll discover two other tools to help you: melee weaponry and animal orbs.

Ever.\n\nAt first, I was a bit skeptical if I should buy this or not, even though I had played the demo. I was in a good mood, so I went and bough the game.\nOnce I got into the game, I realised how awesome and fun it truly is.\nThis game is probably one of the best games of this generation, and I know it will certainly be a good nostalgic memory for gamers all over the world.\n\nPros:\n+ Full of crude, dirty and extremely enjoyable humor\n+ Lots of weapons, characters and animal orbs, each have a different effect, so you can customize your player to your liking.\n+ Game is super long, and does NOT get boring after the first few levels.\n+ Even once you do finish the game, there is insane mode, which I have yet to defeat. (It's INSANE)\n\nCons:\n- Once you've beat the game (including insane mode) it can be kind of dull and boring searching (the internet) for all weapons and animals.\n\nAs you can see, there are much more pros to this game than cons, so I highly reccommend it to anyone who is looking for endless hours of fun, a neverending quest to beat your friends, or even just "chilling out with the bros", this game is perfect by all means.\n\n11/10","August 23, 2014","true","108.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Because if it weren't for the sale I wouldn't be able to come across with such an enjoyable game. It has both humor and action in it. Not to mention the awesome combat style.\nWhat I observed in this game, however, it tries to put you to a class like ''take this stick, increase your intelligence and be a mage!'' but being a mage is not really powerful in the game. You end up using your ''stick'' in melee combat and go with it. There could be more options if only the game allowed it, such as being an archer if there were more types of bows.\nBut then again these do not change the enjoyment of the game. I do not yet had the time to play it with my friends but I'm sure that it'd be even more fun like it is possible. And you can have cute pets with nice perks!\nAll in all I just cannot stop playing this game.

This game is amazingly addicting and it is super fun to play with friends. This game does have its defects like being 2D or that some of the music is ♥♥♥♥ but still I will always love Castle Crashers it holds a really really special place in my heart, lol. It is a difficult game but it has so much to offer. You don't have to do the campaign you can work on trying to get other characters from arena's or find certain weapons and even play a different character.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/204360/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","**AT THE TIME OF THIS REVIEW, I COMPLETED ONE PLAYTHROUGH ON NORMAL, SO SOME POINTS COULD BE MISSED**\n\n\nCastle Crashers, developed by indie devs The Behemoth, became famous at the release of one of the top selling games on XBLA, Castle Crashers. It was highly praised by many and lots of my friends used to play and were obsessed with the game. I wasn't much of an Xbox guy at the time, and therefore did not buy it. After four years of castle crashing, it was finally released on PC. Then, over a year later, I decided to give this game a whirl and bought it. I must tell you, I was very impressed.\n\nI'll start with the visuals. I actually enjoy the graphics in the game, taking a rather simple style. It doesn't get all artsy like Braid and Bastion, nor does it get too realistic like Crysis. It sits in the middle, and I'm happy it doesn't have graphics like that. Not all indie games need to be artsy and heavily story based platfomers or whatever. For the most part, I do like the visuals this game offers.\n\nNow, I'll move to the gameplay. This is probably the first reason Castle Crashers is so awesome. It's a beat-em-up game, so let me make this clear: THE ENEMIES ARE TOUGHER THAN THEY SEEM. Be warned when buying this if you're looking for a simple, kill-this-guy-quick kind of game. You WILL be dissappointed. The gameplay is simple, yet challenging.  I didn't discover any horribly unbalanced weapons, which makes the game even better. Bosses are usually quite easy, but there are a few notorious bosses in the game to look out for, none of which are extremely hard. One other thing this game has is an arena where you can duel it out with friends or fight groups of enemies. I love the gameplay, but not the best part to this  game.\n\nStory time, kids! I have very little to say for the story. Repetitive and cliche, but adds some unique twists to the generic "kill the wizard and save the princess" kind of style.\n\nAudio is good mostly, but could be fine tuned so there are some more individual boss themes, like most of the bosses besides the final boss. I could be incorrect, but for some of the major bosses, it was a simple theme, while others didn't even have a theme at all!\n\nNow for the best part about this game: The replayability. After you beat a short campaign (which is actually necessary in this case) then you can beat it as another character. You can unlock the 28 Animal Orbs, the 30 characters, and then beat the game with all of them, then you can go to insane mode after completion. You can also find all of the weapons to this game, play All You Can Quaff, which is a food eating game or something like that, Arena, which is simply a battle arena, and maybe help a few newbie friends or anyone in the CC community that is new or even a veteran. On average, most of my friends who play with me have usually 200 hours, and they only have one or two level 99 characters. Quite a bit of content here, so there is about 500 hours, maybe tops, if you're extremely dedicated to doing everything this game has to offer. Kind of surprising for me, even for this kind of game.\n\nJust a few flaws I want to point out: The shield is pretty clunky and is pretty difficult and annoying to use. Also, because this is a PC port, it seemed a bit rushed and only showed the buttons for an Xbox 360 controller. One other issue I found is that the multiplayer can be quite laggy, and can ruin multiplayer experiences sometimes. However, that isn't too frequent for me.\n\nOverall, Castle Crashers is an amazing game that I cannot stop playing. I highly recommend this game, and I'm always willing to play with you guys. Add me if you want to play!\n\nGraphics- 8/10\nGameplay- 9/10\nStory- 5/10\nAudio- 6.5/10\nReplayability- 9/10\n\n.:8.0/10:.\n+Highly replayable\n+Humorous\n+Mostly balanced\n+Simple graphics\n+Lots of content\n-Clunky shield system\n-Multiplayer lag\n-Port seems "unfinished"","May 28, 2014","true","31.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

While it is nothing that  we haven't all seen before,  Castle Crashers executes all aspects of this  type of game perfectly.   Each character, do to color coordination, is easily identifiable.  Unique special abilities help each player  stand apart, as well as weapon choices, secondary items and companions that add passive abilities and stats.\n\nThere is an rpg aspect that allows each player to upgrade his or her character's stats separately from the rest.  The enemies are well balanced as well as each type possessing its own attacks and abilities.  Almost every level has a boss at the end.\n\nSimilar to Diablo, you can play back through after completion for a greater challenge.  I recommend having 4 players when you do this; otherwise, the game might begin to feel off balance.\n\nThe game as a whole offers solid game play, good re-playability, fun co-op and many laughs.  A good buy if you plan on playing with a group of friends.\n\nNote: there  is a bit of lag when using the keyboard; the game is built around the game pad.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=112619740","October 7, 2013","true","8.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/204360/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","While there will always be plenty of room in video games for nostalgia, creating something brand-new that tickles those same sense-memories is a challenging proposition. There's plenty of familiar stuff in The Behemoth's Castle Crashers, a game that owes as much to Gauntlet as it does to Final Fight, but it works because it doesn't lean on lazy “hey, remember?” references. Instead of pandering with faux-8-bit graphics and repetitive button-mashing gameplay, Castle Crashers delivers an art style that is crude and playful in its own way, and button-mashing gameplay that REWARDS progress and evolves just enough to keep you engaged. The only things really holding Castle Crashers back are some unfortunate technical problems, but they're not enough to entirely suppress the game's gleeful abandon for both hacking and slashing.\n\nThe SETUP is straightforward enough, with players taking on the role of one of four Crayola-colored knights slicing their way through armies of goblins, demons, skeletons, and the occasional screen-filling boss monster to recover a bunch of princesses and a gigantic magical stone from an evil wizard. What keeps it all from being some tired-♥♥♥ Dungeons & Dragons knock-off is the colorful art of The Behemoth's Dan Paladin and an absurd and unapologetically puerile sense of humor. Oversized treasure chests fall from the sky accompanied by cheesy techno, terrified deer rocket across the screen from the sheer force of their uncontrollable bowel movements, and when little yellow aliens show up halfway through the game, it's pleasantly unsurprising. The ending alone, which reminded me of Amped 3 in a free-association kind of way, is worth playing through the game to see.\n\nAs much theoretical fondness as there is for old-school beat-'em-ups, there's a reason those games fell out of favor--hitting one button for hours on end is straight-up boring. There's an inherent repetition to Castle Crashers, but the game mitigates this problem in a number of clever ways. In addition to the two basic attack buttons that can be strung together into multi-hit combos, each knight has its own elemental magic attack to blast enemies with. Figuring out the right attacks for the different enemies keeps things interesting, and you can do lots of crazy air-juggle moves which, when executed CORRECTLY, allow you to take out a number of enemies without touching the ground.\n\nThough you can carry up to five health potions, the game only allows you one life per level, and there are definitely encounters that you'll be lucky to walk away from on your first try. While this could've been a recipe for massive frustration, there's a light RPG element that BALANCES out the difficulty, rewarding you with new attacks and the ability to customize the strength, magic, defense, and agility of your knight. You can also revisit levels that you've already played, so if you're having trouble getting through a certain section, you can fall back and grind a few levels out on an earlier stage.\n\n\nColor Me Badd.\n\nYou'll find weapons on enemies and in stores that confer various combat BONUSES, as well as animal orbs--essentially plushy animals whose effects range from increasing how fast you gain experience to helping you find secret items in the environment. Their effect on the actual gameplay isn't overly obvious, but I really appreciate the way they just indifferently float along behind you as you wreak mayhem. These features let the game go on for longer than you might expect from an arcade-style game like this, and it took me a good five or six hours to get to the end credits.\n\nAny progress you make works seamlessly between the single- and multiplayer modes in Castle Crashers, though unfortunately, the online mode barely works at all, with rampant disconnects being a major problem. I also found that when playing with the full four players, Castle Crashers can be a bit too chaotic for its own good, and it ended up obscuring much of the complexity I enjoyed in the single-player game. The multiplayer isn't inherently bad, but I definitely found there to be diminishing returns as more players were added.\n\nThere's also a well-known bug in Castle Crashers that can annihilate any of your character progress, something I experienced firsthand. The Behemoth has stated that a title UPDATE is forthcoming, though a date hasn't yet been given, so until then, buyer beware. Despite these problems, and the game's higher-than-average $15 price tag, I thoroughly enjoyed Castle Crashers, though they also keep me from recommending the game as wholeheartedly as I'd like to.\n\n9/10","June 13, 2015","true","4.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Play it with friends. Behead enemies. Run away from terrifying creatures on the back of a deer. Slam your axe on your friend's face and get the kiss from the princess. All in the name of good fun.\nThe game is easy to learn, control and play. It's hilarious and you'll be laughing a good part of the game.\n\nThere is an issue though. Although the game is easy to control with the keyboard it should be more specific to the people who are playing it for the first time.\nThe game will tell you what you need to do in certain occasions but it will do it with the controller buttons signs.\nIf you don't know what the LT or Y o B are in your keyboard shortcuts then you might end up a bit frustrated and failing in something important... like reviving someone. The game should give you the hint with the key you choose, I don't think it would be that hard.\nIf you have a controller, use it. You will save yourself some disapointments, at least until you know where everything is because after that you will do things automatically\n\nOther than that, thumbs up and, in the end, stick your axe in your friend's face.\n\n(If you can get the 4-pack and spread the love... with your axe)\n\n","December 2, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

You may also upgrade either defense,strength,magic, and agility. Including the skills and the knights, this gives multiplayer lots of possibilities, you can have a level 11 red knight and a level 20 orange knight. but there srent just 4 knights, you can also unlock other knights and also dlc, so it would be hard to call this game repetetive! This is a realistic game like battlefied, more like a cartoony hack and slash, but the visuals are still pleasing. Unfortunately, thats all the positive things i have to say.\nBUT there arent a lot of negatives, but multiplayer has WAY too much lag. And remember the upgrades? Those are use a skill mechanic, every time you level up, you get 2 skills, but once you reach the level 10 and up, it takes way too long to level up. and no matter what, you will always get only 2 skills, this makes it so that it takes way too long to upgrade, if we were to get 3 or 4 skills once we go over level 10, i wouldnt mind.\n\nSo there you have it, MY PERSONEL OPINION of castle crasher\noverall i think it deserves a 6, 7 or maybe an 8/10, but the multiplayer lag really provents it from getting a 9/10","July 27, 2014","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are a knight, who has a magic spell, a sword, and the ability to pick up items and use them. You destroy many different things and people, but the game is not an easy one. The beginning is a very quick and entertaining intro which sets the game up to have humor throughout, and can be beaten in 10 hours. The end is a series of incredibly hard, boss fights which took me more than 3 hours of my time playing the game through with my friend. There are very few bugs, and this game flows and preforms very well. If you beat the story, you can play in arenas, with friends, or even play through the exciting story again!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyldw3st/recommended/204360/","wyldw3st","Wyldw3st","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyldw3st/","1575 products in account","I had never actually heard of Castle Crashers until one night at a friends house where he introduced it to me on his Xbox 360.  Castle Crashers was also one of the first Indie games I had ever played, before I actually knew about Indie games, so I was really confused as to how such an awesome game had not been on my radar.  Not only did Castle Crashers introduce me to the magic that is Indie games, but it also gave me so much entertainment with its funny, and yet at times intense gameplay.  The Beat'Em Up/Action game not only offers excellent gameplay for a single player experience, but Castle Crashers truly shines due to its amazing Local Co-op.  The amount of laughs and entertainment my friends and I received from sitting on the couch together playing Castle Crashers is just to high, and are a few of the reasons why I love this game so much.  With refreshing animations and art style, classic gameplay and a mix of comedy, you end up with a game that is not only fantastic, but quite possibly one of the most entertaining Co-op games I have ever played.\n\nIn Castle Crashers, you assume the role of a knight who will be searching the land for the kidnapped princesses.  Starting off, there are a few knights at first to choose from, but as you progress through the game you can unlock many more.  Each character has four stats, attack, defense, magic, and speed, that you will upgrade as you level up throughout the game.  The most characterizing feature of each character, other than their appearance, is their spells.  If you choose to level up the magic stat, every few levels will grant you a new spell to use.  This alone will give a lot of replay value for the simple fact that each of the spells are unique and have different effects in battle. The stats make for a lot of customization when leveling up your character, as you can choose to be a tank, mage, melee damage, or a combination of multiple stats.\n\nThroughout the campaign, you will face several different enemies, that will become tougher as you advance, as well as some very memorable boss battles.  The plot of the story is a simple one, but in Castle Crashers, gameplay and fun is heavily favored to a intriguing story.  Fighting tons of enemies in a classic Side-Scroller Beat'em Up be it alone or with friends, provides a lot of fun, as well as a lot of replay value.  The combination of addictive gameplay and multiple unique characters, make for numerous playthroughs without ever feeling bored.\n\nI truly cannot recommend this game enough, especially due to Local Co-op.  My playtime on Steam does not show even a quarter of my actual playtime, as I spent majority of the time playing on Xbox 360 with several friends as once a week we would get together after going out for dinner and then play Castle Crashers for a few hours.  If you have a few friends who are looking for a great Co-op experience, then look no further.  Pick up a four pack of Castle Crashers and get ready to be heavily entertained for a while as you and your friends play through this absolute gem of a game.","December 20, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Play it with friends. Behead enemies. Run away from terrifying creatures on the back of a deer. Slam your axe on your friend's face and get the kiss from the princess. All in the name of good fun.\nThe game is easy to learn, control and play. It's hilarious and you'll be laughing a good part of the game.\n\nThere is an issue though. Although the game is easy to control with the keyboard it should be more specific to the people who are playing it for the first time.\nThe game will tell you what you need to do in certain occasions but it will do it with the controller buttons signs.\nIf you don't know what the LT or Y o B are in your keyboard shortcuts then you might end up a bit frustrated and failing in something important... like reviving someone. The game should give you the hint with the key you choose, I don't think it would be that hard.\nIf you have a controller, use it. You will save yourself some disapointments, at least until you know where everything is because after that you will do things automatically\n\nOther than that, thumbs up and, in the end, stick your axe in your friend's face.\n\n(If you can get the 4-pack and spread the love... with your axe)\n\n","December 2, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyldw3st/recommended/204360/","wyldw3st","Wyldw3st","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyldw3st/","1575 products in account","I had never actually heard of Castle Crashers until one night at a friends house where he introduced it to me on his Xbox 360.  Castle Crashers was also one of the first Indie games I had ever played, before I actually knew about Indie games, so I was really confused as to how such an awesome game had not been on my radar.  Not only did Castle Crashers introduce me to the magic that is Indie games, but it also gave me so much entertainment with its funny, and yet at times intense gameplay.  The Beat'Em Up/Action game not only offers excellent gameplay for a single player experience, but Castle Crashers truly shines due to its amazing Local Co-op.  The amount of laughs and entertainment my friends and I received from sitting on the couch together playing Castle Crashers is just to high, and are a few of the reasons why I love this game so much.  With refreshing animations and art style, classic gameplay and a mix of comedy, you end up with a game that is not only fantastic, but quite possibly one of the most entertaining Co-op games I have ever played.\n\nIn Castle Crashers, you assume the role of a knight who will be searching the land for the kidnapped princesses.  Starting off, there are a few knights at first to choose from, but as you progress through the game you can unlock many more.  Each character has four stats, attack, defense, magic, and speed, that you will upgrade as you level up throughout the game.  The most characterizing feature of each character, other than their appearance, is their spells.  If you choose to level up the magic stat, every few levels will grant you a new spell to use.  This alone will give a lot of replay value for the simple fact that each of the spells are unique and have different effects in battle. The stats make for a lot of customization when leveling up your character, as you can choose to be a tank, mage, melee damage, or a combination of multiple stats.\n\nThroughout the campaign, you will face several different enemies, that will become tougher as you advance, as well as some very memorable boss battles.  The plot of the story is a simple one, but in Castle Crashers, gameplay and fun is heavily favored to a intriguing story.  Fighting tons of enemies in a classic Side-Scroller Beat'em Up be it alone or with friends, provides a lot of fun, as well as a lot of replay value.  The combination of addictive gameplay and multiple unique characters, make for numerous playthroughs without ever feeling bored.\n\nI truly cannot recommend this game enough, especially due to Local Co-op.  My playtime on Steam does not show even a quarter of my actual playtime, as I spent majority of the time playing on Xbox 360 with several friends as once a week we would get together after going out for dinner and then play Castle Crashers for a few hours.  If you have a few friends who are looking for a great Co-op experience, then look no further.  Pick up a four pack of Castle Crashers and get ready to be heavily entertained for a while as you and your friends play through this absolute gem of a game.","December 20, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No matter single or co-op it's scaled to be challenging but not impossible to beat.

I highly recomend anyone who likes games where you get to wail on anything in sight. it's amazingly fun, the levels are cool and the bosses are too. sometimes things can get tedious, but that's when you get your friends in your game to help you out through those parts! after the game there are so many things to do, you can go around and do a bunch of stuff like try to unlock all the weapons in the game, and go and try to unlock all the characters, and there's even a special "Insane Mode" which i haven't tried yet but I would have to guess it's a RIDICULOUSLY harder version of the game, and if so would recomend getting a band of friends to get together and play it.

Two more additional things, Behemoth, and I think Battle Block Theater should be on steam.\n\nCons: CONTROLLER OR DIE, playing without friends is boring, difficult playing alone.\n\nOverall: Buy the game when its full price. If you have a friend (or a few) that want to play too, buy a copy for each of them too. Endless hilarity insues amongst your friends, the game itself, and soon you will be cackling over the micrphone about the endless laughs and enjoyment this game will bring to your life.\n\nEnd note: I wasn't kidding about "CONTROLLER OR DIE" if you want to NOT be confused by the game's UI, get a WIRED Xbox 360 controller. Trust me, it'll boost your gameplay experience by about hmmmm: 25%-60-ish%.","December 23, 2013","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
