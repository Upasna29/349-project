The classics are working fine for me. By the way, you must download the DLC to be able to play the campaigns in the remastered edition. Issues thread: http://steamcommunity.com/app/244160/discussions/0/617328967243529430/\n\nLet me tell you something about homeworld (1+2 AND the lost game, homeworld cataclysm). Even 15+ years later, it's still the gold standard for 3D RTS. Here's a few big points:\n\nVery intuitive controls. Movement control is a simple two step, where the first sets horizontal movement, then *optionally* holding shift or click and drag for height. I've yet to see another 3D RTS which even comes close to how quickly and simply that I can give move orders in a 3D space, even though mice and monitors are 2D devices.\n\nExtremely helpful *contextual* visual indicators. When in the process of giving a move order, a lot of supporting information for movement then pops up. For example, to show how high other ship's height are above yours in the 3D battlespace, an ecliptic disc is drawn centered on your ships in the move order interface, and vertical lines are drawn from that disc to those other ships. It GREATLY aids in plotting the movement order so you can order your ships to intercept over long distances. Once the move order is given, all of this goes away so there isn't information overload.\n\nBattles actually take place in 3D space as well. Skilled players WILL use height to flank from above and below to avoid being subjected to a full broadside of guns. Fighters zoom around ships without regards to direction, attacking from multiple angles. This isn't "2.5D" as I would call it, you NEED to use height, especially with fighters.\n\nTwo camera modes. One is the standard battle camera, which you spend most of your time in for orders in a small area, and a strategic camera, which is an "at a glance" of the battlespace with a LOT more information and large map wide movement. The space bar is the simple key to switch between them.\n\nIn the story, you must be somewhat careful of losses (but it's not so bad that it inhibits gameplay). Every mission brings the resources, ships, and research that you have from the previous missions. You are quite literally a nomadic fleet. Resources on each map are *not* regenerative, even in multiplayer, so grab what you can! Think starcraft in terms of resources: it's plentiful, but resources will run out in a prolonged battle.\n\nThe story itself: It's of loss and sacrifice, hope and victory. It's quite a roller coaster of emotion.\n\nSoundtrack: Very "spacey" feel that is well designed to suit each mission. Plus, mission 3 on HW1 had the best freaking use of a classic choir song (Agnus Dei - Adagio for strings) I've ever heard.\n\nMy only regret: the source code to HW:Cataclysm is lost. There's no remastering it. It's not considered canon, but it was still fun playing as the mining faction's ship "Kun-Laan" and fighting the galactic cancer known as "The Beast".\n\nEDIT: Made a grammar mistake, fixed. Kun-Laan is the mining faction's ship, but I forgot to mention that their faction name is "Somtaaw"","February 25, 2015","true","18.9"," 552 of 600 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","552","600","11","29"

As soon as the Remastered version came out, I had to buy it.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with the game. The remastered version is beautiful, and in my opinion one of the best things about it is that it has a great storyline behind it. While I understand that not everyone cares about that, for me it makes the game so much more. Homeworld offers a rather unique experience as a strategy game in a 3 dimensional enviornment which isn't really like anything else I've played.\n\nBoth HW and HW2 remastered versions seem to be optimized well, as I've never had any lag or framerate issues. I can't speak for the mods, as I haven't yet felt the need to utilize any - there hasn't been any that I've seen that have caught my eye as a "must have".\n\nSome people have complained about scenarios being more or less difficult depending on how well you're doing throughout your campaign. Say you fail a mission, but you rememeber what's thrown at you and plan accordingly beforehand - the next time you start it stronger only to find there's even more enemy ships. Personally I kind of have mixed feelings about this aspect, it makes the game more unpredictible and more challenging, as you can't plan for everything the way you can with most other game's missions/scenarios.\n\nAs a negative, I have encountered a couple small glitches with scenarios, such as objectives not checking off as complete even though you've finished it, therefore making the scenario impossible to finish. I also don't particularly care for HW2, the storyline and ship variants just don't do it for me. In my opinion the first game is far superior but that's simply a matter of opinion. I can't say I have anyone to try Multiplayer with but I think it would be an excellent MP game with a few friends looking to out-strategize one another.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking to try out a new type of strategy game in a 3D space enviornment, or anyone who gets their kicks out of a great back story like myself.","September 30, 2015","true","110.9"," 221 of 258 people (86%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","86","221","258","19","0"

Things like small ships not needing to refuel anymore or changes to research costs and other stuff. Don't expect the exact same game from 15 years ago with just better graphics since it's not that. Is it still enjoyable and epic ? Yes!\n\nHere is a full ist of the changes made from classic to remaster:\nhttp://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/another-ye-olde-homeworld-players-view-on-remastered/98847\n\nRelease:\nHomeworld is a space strategy game that redefined the RTS genre, and remains today as the only game that did it right. A deep and thrilling story (30 missions over 2 campaigns), powerful and anomalous music, and a very unique style of play. A true space opera!\nEven though games are nearly 15 years old now, the mechanics and gameplay don’t feel outdated. Instead, they are still unmatched by any other space RTS that have released since. The three dimensional environment requires a whole new level of thinking when it comes to strategy.\n\nNow let’s talk about the Remaster and a company that actually put effort into a remake.\nThis was crafted with the assistance and guidance of the original creators as well as the help of a passionate fan community.\n\nHere’s a list of some of the changes:\n\n- Significantly upgraded visuals, including high-res textures and models\n- Up to 4k resolution\n- Sound and music overhaul\n- Upgraded cut-scenes with clean artwork and some new 3d animations\n- Redesigned UI for HW1 (from HW2 which also got an update)\n- Mod compatibility and workshop support\n- Compatibility with newer operating systems\n- Combined Multiplayer between both games\n\nAs you can see, they put a considerable amount of effort into this remastered version of Homeworld and that's why I totally think it’s worth the price tag, unlike any other HD remake out on Steam. You also get both of the original games with this package, which were previously hard to get ahold of, and they are even updated to be playable on modern operating systems.\n\nIf you enjoyed Homeworld 1 and/or 2 in any shape or form, you should strongly consider buying this, as it really is a whole new experience!

The campaign in HW1 Remastered is amazing and I expect HW2R's to be great as well. The story, cinematics, music and atmosphere all get 10/10\n\nCONTROLS:\nSome players have a little trouble getting used to the controls and while this is in part due to the fully 3d nature of the game I also feel it is in part down to the developers descision to keep the old control system rather than improving upon it. That said, everything works nicely and I found everythign easy to get used to. 8/10\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThe game is simply stunning close up, ships are well detailed, docking ships looks awesome, the enviroments and FX are great. Could they be better.. Probably.. Are they good enough, definitly. 9/10\n\nMULTIPLAYER:\nPvP is still in beta, so it is hard to judge, but so far things seem real good. There are objectives and that is something I find very interesting as it is unheard of in other PvP games I play. AI is skilled enough for skirmish games and will give you a real run for your money, Changing tactics from game to game and really testing you. Only real issue is possibly balancing still needs to be done on some units. But hey, this is something completely new to the franchise so it was always going to take time. There is however no co-op campaign.. Something I find sorely lacking as it is my prefered game mode ussually. 7/10\n\nOVERALL:\nAn exellent game, I highly recommed it to anyone who loves, RTS, sci-fi, or who is just looking to try something new or find a great story to be immersed in. 9/10","February 28, 2015","true","39.8"," 223 of 267 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","223","267","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aniqiewan/recommended/244160/","Aniqiewan","Aniqiewan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aniqiewan/","860 products in account","The first thing I noticed on playing HW:RM was how the HW2 UI and seemed to be everywhere. It was as if the whole HW1 game had been transplanted into the HW2 engine... turned out I wasn't far off.\n\nHomeworld 1\nUnfortunately there are a few things that bring the quality of the remaster down as a whole - players aren't able to experience HW1 with it's Ballistics physics engine intact (shots fired could be evaded or go on to hit something else), instead shots fired by ships generally always hit (some RNG seems to be involved) the selected target as in HW2. This is a large part of what made HW1 stand out from other RTSes at the time (in fact most RTSes nowadays) and made certain manoeuvres such as doing increased damage to ships when attacking them from behind, etc, possible since damage resistance was also modelled as part of this engine. As far as I can recall this was not something that was taken through to the original HW2 or the Remaster. Pretty big deal in my opinion.\n\nFormations in general are completely borked, meaning that a lot of the tactical (and at the time, genre defying) flavour of HW1 is completely absent; while I don't particularly miss the fiddly micromanagement and lack of context sensitive clicks, I do miss the extra depth of tactics that formations offered. If Gearbox ever start work on a Homeworld: Cataclysm remaster (the original HW:C = my favourite game of the series) they have to get this fixed. Good news is that a patch may be on it's way to restore formations to their intended form.\n\nOverall I still enjoyed playing through the HW1:RM campaign, and ultimately found it more "playable" than the original (especially while using a Steam Controller). Basically I found the game easier and more accessible than it used to be, which for newcomers and busy old-schoolers like me is not a bad thing. I think it's a huge shame we never got to see the original ballistics physics etc on todays capable machines however.\n\nHomeworld 2\nBeing completely honest I originally played Homeworld 2 the least of the games in the series, however I feel that the remaster did a solid job of restoring and enhancing the game for compatibility while staying pretty faithful to the original.\n\nThe remastered graphics really shine here, fleet battles are a thing of beauty. Seriously, pick a fight and soak in that goodness, JUST DO IT\n\nSince the remaster has been so good to the game I have in effect enjoyed HW2 anew - I'd basically offer this collection as an instant recommendation for fans of the original. The only issues HW2 fans might have is that the voice actors from HW1 have been used instead of the ones they may remember from HW2, as well as a few other VA changes here and there (notably Makaan).\n\nGeneral\nGearbox have been patching things up slowly, with various bugs and issues like bad pathfinding (crashing into asteroids) being fixed. There are still issues like formations not working properly and friendly ships merrily continuing to pour heavy firepower on ships you are boarding/salvaging to add to your fleet, amongst other things.\n\nScoring based on faithfulness to the spirit of the originals;\n\n-GFX/FIDELITY 8\nGlorious hi-res Fleet battles and Furballs, gorgeously updated and retouched. The UI scales perfectly and there are sliders allowing you to adjust the scale of varying UI components manually.\n\n-AUDIO 7\nRemastered audio (apparently; I can't tell I'm no audiophile), original voice actors (notably Fleet Command/ Mothership from HW1) brought back and re-recorded. HW Classic sound effects are particularly dated and low-def when compared to the remaster, so good job I guess.\n\n-GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS 6\nIn regards to HW1 the best I can say is some patching is definitely needed. The atmosphere and\nHW2 on the other hand is in a good place. If Gearbox attempt a remake of Homeworld: Cataclysm, I hope they get a better handle on what made these games great in the first place.\n\n\nAs a Remastered Collection It's a good update on the originals, however it's not perfect by a long shot. It's also a shame that some of the technical limitations that held the old games back have not really been challenged (in fact the opposite, much has been dumbed down). The unfulfilled potential is pretty crushing in my opinion.\n\nMultiplayer is also a bit hit and miss, in that Gearbox are clearly putting a lot of work into the facilitation of mp matches, but the bugs/missing mechanics are keenly apparent at higher levels of play.\n\nIn any case I have to thank Gearbox for bringing back these games, and can only recommend this Collection as an essential for RTS fans, and those gamers who enjoy a good story alongside a challenge.","November 16, 2015","true","30.3"," 131 of 144 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","131","144","5","0"

Good news!\n\nUPDATE: I created a video review to go along with this one in which I illustrate my points and do some side-by-side comparisons.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icwqd2Q49uc\n\nIf your concern is primarily for the (IMO) far superior Homeworld 1, as mine was, you may end up quite disappointed by Homeworld Remastered. This review is for HW1R specifically. I haven't played HW2R and I don't care about HW2R, despite the fact that Gearbox apparently spent most of their effort on that game and neglected the original.\n\nThe good things are obvious; the graphics are pretty, the textures and backgrounds are nice, the new UI is "ok" and scales with your screen resolution. Modern screen resolution options are available without hacking the game.\n\nThere are three big, deal-breaking problems I have with the way HW1 was ported to the HW2 engine: formations, tactics and the ballistics model.\n\nFormations and tactics from the first game are thrown out the window in this remaster. For new players who don't understand the significance of this or older players who are a little fuzzy on how these worked, please set your sights on the wall of text below.\n\nIn old HW1, ships would hold their formation while engaging the enemy (unless you set them to evasive tactics; more on this later). The various formations had intrinsic tactical advantages for different situations. You could have capitals concentrate into a tight wall to focus fire. Fighters could form a claw formation to envelop/focus their targets while still remaining mobile and making passes. Ships in Sphere formation would surround their target, all facing inward pouring maximum shots into the enemy at the tradeoff of being fairly immobile and vulnerable to return fire. You could also use Sphere to, say, have a squadron of Defenders form a defensive screen around your Heavy Cruiser to protect it from bombers. There were many other formation possibilities, but those are a few examples.\n\nIn Remastered, all these formations options are still *technically* available, however they only affect the basic parade stance of your ships. That is to say, upon contact with the enemy your ships will immediately break formation. Strike craft will split off and fly around the enemy in a disorderly fashion, failing to concentrate fire. Capitals will float around doing their own thing, bumping into each other and getting into each others' way instead of remaining in an organized wall formation. They still mostly function, but the biggest hit is to strike craft, which are FAR less effective without formation coherency.\n\nTactics worked in combination with formations when choosing how you want to engage the enemy. Is the enemy coming at you in small groups? Do you have a keen numerical advantage? Use Aggressive tactics. Your fighters will move slower and attempt no evasive maneuvers, but they will close to a tighter formation and put more shots into the enemy, doing more damage. Are you at a disadvantage and need to bog down the enemy in a protracted dogfight to buy time for reinforcements to arrive? Evasive tactics will cause your strike craft to break formation, split off into pairs, and make quick passes at the enemy while performing evasive maneuvers, doing less damage but living longer. The default Neutral tactics provide a happy medium between these two: your ships will hold their formation, however they will spread out a little and perform small jinking maneuvers during attack runs to dodge some incoming fire.\n\nIn Remastered, you still have three stances available, but they are nothing like what I just described above. They only determine your units' engagement setting (don't engage/engage nearby/pursue enemy relentlessly). Basically, HW1 tactics are GONE. They no longer exist. Again, strike craft suffer the most from this change. The combination of formation and tactics you chose for them made strike craft very versatile and useful units to have around. Now they are just cannon fodder to fly around and distract the enemy whilst outputting Evasive level damage all the time.\n\nNow onto the ballistics model. HW1 used an ahead-of-its-time physics-based model for weapons. When a Heavy Cruiser fired a bullet from one of its cannons, that bullet traveled through space as a physical object toward its target. A stray fighter could pass in front of it and be obliterated, or the target could suddenly change vector causing it to miss. It may then travel on past the intended target and hit something else. Maybe a friendly! The bullet would also impart physical force to the target, visibly pushing back a frigate, for example.\n\nIn HW2, and thus in HW:R as a whole, this model was replaced by an RNG (random number generation) model that you might expect to see in a cheaply made traditional RTS game. Your Heavy Cruiser will fire a shot, and that shot may have (making up numbers here) an 85% chance of hitting another Heavy Cruiser or Carrier, a 70% chance of hitting a destroyer, a 50% chance of hitting a frigate and a 5% chance of hitting a fighter. This system was likely instituted to save CPU for HW2's ambitious number of ships on screen at once, but ported to the original game in Remastered it removes a lot of cool emergent moments from HW1. Also because of this simple RNG model, tactics (discussed above) were apparently seen as no longer relevant since fighters physically taking evasive actions no longer factors in to whether something hits them or not. The most common defense of this system is "engine limitations" but I can't accept that argument seeing as how the source code and engine were heavily modified to begin with.\n\nOh, strike craft also no longer have fuel in HW1. So another layer of strategy is arbitrarily deleted.\n\nOh and no borderless window. What the hell?\n\nIn short what I'm saying is this: Homeworld 1 Remastered is essentially a lazy port into another game's engine and much of the magic is lost. Can it still be played and enjoyed? Sure. Will the game have the same strategic and tactical depth as you remember? Not even close.","February 28, 2015","false","15.9"," 1,523 of 2,043 people (75%) found this review helpful 76 people found this review funny","75","523","2","76","117"

My grandfather introduced me to the game, and whenever I go see him I will still play LAN games against him, on the same two disks that we have always played on. Now, with that being said, at 8 years of age I didn't really understand tactics or how to win, the main objective for me was to build a heavy cruiser and try bum rushing the enemy mothership, praying that my prized cruiser didn't get salvaged in the process! As I grew older and understood the game more, I enjoyed it more as I began using formations and tactics to alter the outcome of battles, some of which were against slim to none odds.\n\nThe depth and complexity of this game was really what hit the mark for me as I grew older. I played Homeworld nonstop until Homeworld 2 came out. I enjoyed playing that game as well from time to time as well, but my Homeworld life changed forever when the Complex mod came out. This mod essentially combined the tactical and strategical gameplay of HW1 with the beautiful graphics and upgraded UI of HW2. I have played this mod since it was released, all the way to 9.1 which is where it sits now.\n\nNow fast forward to 2014, when I learned that my favorite strategy game was getting remastered. I poured over screenshots and gameplay, developer interviews and every last piece of media I could grasp my hands on. The promise was simple, updated graphics, and no changes to the original engine this game ran on. Unfortunately, this was a lie.\n\nWhen I first booted up HW:R I was amazed with the beauty of the game, but felt betrayed as I continued to play on. The most important feature of early combat, even going forward to endgame combat, the formations and tactics features, do not work. This is a gamebreaking feature people, because strikecraft are worth their weight in gold at all stages of the game. The fact that you can no longer use bombers and corvettes to their full potential will ruin the game for anyone who has played this before. The developers essentially put everything HW1 onto the HW2 UI, all for the sake of being able to play Kushan VS Hiigarrian in multiplayer. While this introduces great improvements, such as better 3D movement and harvesting, the developers lied in their statement of, "Nothing but the graphics will change". The month is now June, and the Dev's haven't even made a comment of when these issues will be fixed, no issued an apology for their lie.\n\nAlso, mods will STILL not work the way they should in the classic versions of the game. I would be fine if I could still play Complex 9.1 on the classic HW2 game, knowing that the fix will come eventually and formations will be able to be used again. However on bootup the mods (and I'm talking other mods too, the star wars mod, the halo mod, etc) will crash and burn, leaving you empty handed. The dev's should have kept these engines separate, as even on multiplayer, HW2 strike craft will always slay HW1 strike craft, because the HW2 squadron formations still work.\n\nAs a man who has played thousands of hours of Homeworld, and in light of this 60% off steam sale going on currently, I strongly advise putting your hard earned dollars, euros, pesos, or whatever currency you're using into something else, unless you have never played this game before, because you may be able to enjoy it for what it currently is. If you have played even one skirmish vs cpu match on the original HW, don't even bother picking this up.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nAs of today, 9/20/2015, the game is still borken, formations are still not usable, and now mods are ceasing to work as the dev. launches half ***ed patches ever two months in order to justify a poor excuse for a "Supported" title. Folks, for your money id say buy an actual HW2 disk, so at least you can play the great mods that have been released. This, sadly, is not the Homeworld Remaster we were promised or expected it to be.","June 12, 2015","false","58.2"," 456 of 593 people (77%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","77","456","593","20","20"

The other eye candy like HDR and shadows is very welcome and really calls out to my first experiences of playing HW1 in 2000. Sounds and voice-overs are also remastered to a very high standard though some of the inflections aren't to my personal taste, but that's just me.\n\nNow then, onto the bugs and why I can't recommend HW:R in its current state. If you've read the other reviews by now you'll probably have found some pointing out the bugs with formations and strikecraft in general. I am no purist, but quite frankly I think these issues have been understated so far. Not being able to put your fighters or corvettes into formations massively affects the combat effectiveness of your strikecraft (less so for capitals). Since they refuse to maintain formation (regardless of tactics set) they will not fire en masse and you the player cannot position them precisely where you need and want them. A wall of just 9 heavy corvettes in HW1 would easily demolish a flock of enemy fighters if managed correctly. In HW1 the same force takes at least 3 times as long to complete the same engagement and you’ll probably take losses. I've seen positive reviews on here downplaying this issue which I find hugely disingenuous to say the least. I'm going to have to make a video showing HW1 and HW1:R side by side to really illustrate just how much this affects the game and almost everything you do in it, it really is that fundamental.\n\nFormations aside, the path-finding for strikecraft again is quite poor. Ships like the heavy corvette with heavy forward firepower seem to insist on circling the enemy and trying broadsides to no effect, which is probably why the fights take forever to finish. Because your ships refuse to stay in formation they will also largely ignore player attack-move commands during combat (ctrl+A).\n\nOther reviewers have already pointed out the firing system changes as well, but I really have to emphasise just how much this negatively impacts the game. Basically, in HW1 your ships would fire bullets that would actually travel through space i.e. no hitscan or RNG. Since this is no longer the case your ships are at the mercy of the Random Number Generator and setting them to evasion tactics has literally no effect where as in HW1 it could vastly improve the survivability of your strikecraft.\n\nI understand a lot of these changes were implemented to allow compatibility between HW1 and HW2 to enable multiplayer which is just fine imho. However, I consider the formations and tactics issues as bugs since they severely handicap HW1 strikecraft compared to their HW2 counterparts, not to mention that it robs the player of a huge degree of tactical control.\n\nI love Homeworld, but being unable to control my strikecraft effectively reduces the whole thing to pumping out ships, sitting back and hoping for the best.

The music and voice acting is still spot on. I found myself re-living all of the excitement and wonder of the original release.\n\nThe only thing missing is the exclusion of Cataclysm (which in my opinion is the better of the three games). Let's hope that Gearbox can find the missing(?) source code for Cataclysm and give us the missing chapter of the saga.\n\nIf you like Real-Time Strategy, well crafted stories and truly challenging gameplay (your tank rush will NOT work here for every mission, you're going to have to really think about what you build, capture or destroy), this blast from the past will sate that hunger.

Amazing\n\nGearbox did an astonishing job with Homeworld. It really got what it deserved. The sound and graphics were amazing for the time (15 years ago for the ones that don't know Homeworld). With the remastered edition they did such a great job with improving everything and keeping the game practically the same. The sound is amazing. I did the first mission in 30 minutes. I was just listening to all the gorgious sounds. And i haven't talked about the looks. The graphics are so good looking now. It all looks really high detail even upclose. And the cool thing about up close view is the new Depth of Field. I just love watching a huge destroyer firing its guns at some frigates in the distance. It sounds amazing. It looks gorgious and it plays wonderfull. And you can get some amazing screenshots when you turn off your HUD (Backspace).\n\nTL:DR\n\nIf you love Homeworld, you will love this.

So much. So, so much!\n\nFull disclosure: Before the Remastered Collection, I only played a few missions of Homeworld 2 and barely remembered much of it coming into this (I was also, like, 11 years old or so). I've now completed Homeworld 1 and 2 Remastered as well as Homeworld 1 Classic (as of writing this). I grew up with RTS (real-time strategy) games and I'm nearly kicking myself over the fact that I missed out on these games originally!\n\nPersonally, I believe this is a fantastic package. And although I'm not really one of the original Homeworld fans (or 'vets'), I can seriously tell that Gearbox and Blackbird Interactive poured a lot of love into this.\n\nI understand the negativity from the vets regarding some of the changes, removals and/or additions, especially with regards to Homeworld 1 Remastered. That said, if you're a newcomer to the series, please, please scan widely when looking at opinions, reviews etc. The opinions of the vets are valid, yet there are plenty of newcomers (myself included) that have had a lot of fun with this collection.\n\nI, in no way, see this as a 'lazy cash-grab'. There are certainly balance issues (but they said time and again before release that the multiplayer would be a beta on release). There are also bugs, but I really don't think there was ever a perfect, bug-free video game release. There are always a wide variety of systems amongst a player base, so it's inevitable that issues may arise on different configurations (and sorry if you are one of those people, I can understand the frustration and I apologise if it seems like I'm demeaning you all and problems you may be experiencing). Updates (patches) have happened and I believe they will continue to happen. They are listening to the community and taking feedback.\n\nPlus, in the end, it was quite hard to obtain the Homeworld games before this collection was released (at least digitally). This collection contains the original Homeworld 1 and 2 with only minor alterations (e.g. Homeworld 1 Classic doesn't have the original credits song due to liscensing issues), at least as far as I am aware.\n\nAs for the games themselves, I think other reviews, videos and descriptions will do a far better job at explaining it for you (and hopefully convincing you!) than I. Hell, you really should look into it, as the Homeworld games may not be for absolutely everyone. But know that I love them a lot. I adore the gameplay (thinking in three dimensions is very intriguing!), the aesthetic design, the sound and musical design, the writing and the story (even Homeworld 2, which some people don't like, but I understand the reasons why).\n\nAnd finally: On the technical side, I think the UI (of the remastered games) is excellent (there are some minor issues however). The options menu is extensive. Performance is fantastic from what I can tell.\n\nTL;DR – Seriously? When it comes down to it, I truly and highly recommend this.\n\nHere's hoping they find the Homeworld: Cataclysm source code, eh?","March 15, 2015","true","60.3"," 80 of 100 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","80","100","6","3"

What I though was going to be a true-to-original remaster, was too far off to keep playing. Being a fan of HW2, and reading the reviews and complaints of HW1 carefully, I thought I would pick it up on sale. Playing the first two HW1 missions, I saw what some folks were talking about in the way that GB had changed the fighter behaviors, and other details. I also some improvements they had carried over from 2 such as being able to select units from the space map. Being a fan of 2 I thought that this was ok since I had always seen fighters as being OP in the original. I once beat the game with NOTHING BUT fighters and bombers.\n\nThe deal breaker for me came when I started the third mission. I had built 6 salvage corvettes in anticipation of "stealing" the coming frigates and using them against the enemy as I had 15 years ago. To my horror, as each frigate was captured, nothing came back out. I was like "where the hell are my frigates?!". Then I noticed that my RUs had grown substantially. I quit the game right then and started reading more into the forums and saw that this was now part of the game. Then I started looking in the Workshop to see if anyone had made a mod to fix this, and sadly there was no fix.\n\nSalvaging was one of my favorite parts of HW1. I don’t understand why someone would take a classic that was so well received and decide to cut it up as much as GB did, and describe it as being true to the original. Remasters are a common thing in the music industry. Old master tracks are taken back to the studio and are mixed down again on new hardware to bring the sound quality up to par with current music quality and to fix any “noise” that may have been in the original to clean it up. Imagine if you went to the store and bought the remastered version of your favorite band's album, only to find that someone else is playing guitar, and your favorite songs from the original are missing even though the album cover makes no mention of it?\n\nIts a beautiful game with great sound and gameplay, but a remaster of the original it’s not. Maybe one day GB will get their ♥♥♥♥ together and put the game back like I should have been in the first place. Watch the video that Bobamelius has posted in his review carefully if you are thinking of getting HWRM. Hell, watch it two or three times and know what you are buying. Thanks to Steam's new refund policy I'm on to the next game!\n","June 12, 2015","false","51.8"," 163 of 229 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","163","229","8","6"

We all know Gearbox made a visually stunning remaster. What needs to be said now is what Gearbox did to make the remaster a disappointment. While the following things may sound petty, they fundamentally change how the game is played and the emotional tenor of the story:\n\n-removing formations\n-removing stances\n-removing fuel for strike craft\n-reworking repair mechanics (repairing is now not feasible in combat, it's more meant for between battles)\n-making diffculty scaling much more aggressive\n-replacing the ballistic simulation for random number generation combat\n\nHomeworld was always a story of disempowerment. Of overcoming long odds at the brink of genocide. You were perenially starved for resources, and forced to be extremely careful when shepherding your tiny little fleet. Put your craft into evasive mode and they'll live longer. Put them into aggressive mode and they'll kill faster. Use your support craft to keep expensive ships alive from mission to mission. Use the almost Napoleonic wall formation to concentrate firepower, but don't try complex maneuvers with it. The level of care you had to put into your fleet assets, great and small, contributed a lot to the overall feel of the game.\n\nNow, stances have been removed. Formations have no effect, and fall apart the moment your ships enter combat. Fuel for strike craft has been removed. Support ships are now so unwieldy and take so long to engage that they are only useful outside of combat. Individually these changes wouldn't be so bad, but taken together they rob Homeworld's story of it's gravitas, and it's gameplay of almost all its depth.\n\nIt's hard to care about your fleet because your ships are now throwaway items, and honestly there isn't much for you to do with them other than throw them at the enemy fleet and designate targets. What was once a game of tactics and risk management has been reduced to a laser light show. Pretty, but ultimately there isn't much for you to do but sit back and watch.\n\nIf you want a pretty game with all the familiar sights and sounds from the Homeworld we played back in 1999, then this fits the bill. If you want a game that captures either the spirit or the tactical depth of the original, then sadly you should look somewhere else.","March 5, 2015","false","8.2"," 236 of 343 people (69%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","69","236","343","15","17"

A happier time. A time when PDAs were cool, people wore really high jeans, and when Homeworld was released.\n\nThat's right. Take yourself back to September of 1999. I was 7.\n\nThis was a time when strategy games were designed to be pursued and beaten over the course of weeks or months, a time when game designers weren't afraid to kick you in the balls and tell you that you were terrible at their game, and a time when thousands of Homeworld players ripped their hair out after spending hours harvesting resources only to have their fleet obliterated in one short battle.\n\nAs a 7-year-old, I did not possess the mental faculties to fully understand the majestic space banana or its purpose as the salvation of a species. I was completely unable to tactically order my fleets through the three dimensional battlefield.  As such, I had no hope of navigating the campaign, but what I could do was build hundreds of space fighters, frigates, capital ships, and carriers, and watch in awe as an epic battle between two armadas unfolded before my very eyes in all its polygonal glory. Many happy hours were spent watching interceptors swerve around capital ships while my ion frigates bombarded them from afar.\n\nOh that magic nostalgia feeling. How welcome it is. Homeworld remastered has taken the elegant design of the original game (something I'm now more equipped to appreciate) and made it more palatable with gorgeous visuals and streamlined interfaces while keeping the incredible atmosphere, mystery, and ♥♥♥-poundingly difficult strategy that we all know and love.

I've never been a huge multiplayer player in HW1, but I'm a huge single player fan.

The remaster didn't kill any of the experience for me. Sure, I prefer a lot of the stuff from the vanilla HW, and would love to see it return, but I realize, not all of it is possible by patching the game. And I'm ok with it.

That is to say Gearbox has done a great job of updating the graphics so that the game looks as it should through my rose tinted glasses of fond memories :)\n\nThey stripped out some mechanics that were a real pain in the original, specifically fuel for fighters.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nStripping out some of those features had unintended consequences. For example, strike craft used to automatically fly home to refuel from time to time and would automatically be repaired and re-armed. Now since they don't have fuel they don't return to base on their own and die very easily left to their own devices.\n\nGearbox removed the 'aggressive' and 'evasive' posture from the original which used to be very handy for keeping your ships alive longer. In the original game you could re-position your forces, withdraw, or wait for reinforcements without taking crippling losses, but now these situations lead to crippling losses.\n\nFormations don't seem to be working right... you can put your ships in formation but they break that formation if so much as an enemy fighter shows up.\n\nAutomatic harvesting was added but works inconsistently. This was a Homeworld 2 feature meant to be a time saver so you could hyperspace out when the mission was done instead of waiting for 40 minutes for your harvesters to finish gathering resources. It's broken though so it seems to harvest random amounts and not everything on the map.\n\nAnother homeworld 2 feature they seem to have dabbled with is dynamic difficulty, which I personally hate. It basically punishes you for playing smart on prior missions and removes most of the incentive to do a good job rather than just scrape by. They should have left it out or put in a difficulty level selection.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nFrequent crashes to desktop even with updated drivers and directX. There are some bugs in the graphical portion.\n\nMyriad scripting errors including...\n\nSome missions can't be completed about 1/3 of the time. For example the mission diamond shoals has a nasty bug where after you clear the minefield the bentusi may or may not show up making the mission un-finish-able. As if this wasn't bad enough the bug also exists in the automatically made quicksave at the start of the mission, so if you get stung by this error you have to reload in the previous mission.\n\nIn the previous mission there's a scripted event where fleet command tells you about enemy defender ships and how you should research your own... in my game the research option didn't show up, so I literally cannot build this type of ship for the rest of the game.\n\nOn later missions similar bugs appear where you finish all the objectives but just can't finish the mission.\n\nSome AI seems to have been lobotomized in transition. The garden of kadesh used to be very tough, but now most of the enemy ships don't do anything...\n\n","June 12, 2015","false","4.0"," 111 of 152 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","111","152","3","0"

Yes. Can I, personally, recommend this? No, sorry. You licked my lollipop, rewrapped it, and then sold it back to me; what did you expect.\n\nFull disclosure: I own the original disc versions of HW1, HWC, and HW2, and have been a big fan of at least the first two.\n\nI played the crap out of Homeworld 1 and Cataclysm for years, both the campaigns and multiplayer. I rediscovered them all over again several times, when unpacking boxes or reinstalling a new PC. They are at the top of my all-time favourite games.\n\nHW2: I think I finished the campaign once, and not in one go. It just felt like a step back from the previous ones, for several reasons. Still, it entertained me for a good while and in some way stilled my hunger for a continuation of the HW1/HWC line.\n\nWas I excited about a remaster? Absolutely; I like shiny new graphics and better sounds, and I looked forward to having the games install and work 'out of the box' on current day OS. But for me, that was literally all they needed to do. Because functionally, HW1/HWC already worked exactly as they were.\n\nFor me, they could not have done this remaster any more wrong if they'd tried:\n\n* They picked the wrong engine. If it was at all true that they could not do a remaster of both with each their own engine, I would've picked HW1 over HW2 every day and twice on sunday, From my perspective, it would've made their job easier: just dumb down the HW2 races/campaign to ignore the superior HW1 formations and strafing and ballistics, et voilá, HW2 on HW1 engine. Besides, this argument reeks: they went to the trouble of completely redoing/reinventing the HW1 campaign and ships and balance on a HW2 engine... and that was somehow less effort than simply keeping those parts of the existing source code unchanged? Hogwash.\n\n* They picked the wrong UI. Yes, it took a few moments and maybe a peek at the manual to figure out how to call up the HW1 UI, but the almost entire absence of it made Space(tm) feel Real(tm). I agree that the research/build/launch dialogs would have benefited from an overlay implementation, but functionally they worked much better than HW2.\n\n* They picked the wrong camera movement. In HW1, when rotating the camera with right mouse click, the pivot point is the ship or object you focused on. This feels utterly natural, because that is what focus means: maintain your view on your point of interest while rotating to get an overview of all that surrounds it. In HW2, the camera instead pivots on itself. Aside from breaking immersion (wait a minute, am I part of this story, or am I filming it?), it does not maintain focus on what you told it to. Homeworld is not an FPS!\n\n* They killed the AI in so many ways. Strikegroups break formation the moment they start moving, or never form up the way it was intended in the first place (sphere guard, anyone?), broken pathing makes ships get stuck in places, ships forget halfway what they were ordered to do and need to be reissued so they don't either stop in the middle of nowhere or decide to do some suicide move on their own.\n\n* The remastered graphics and sounds, while pretty and certainly a significant step up from the originals, end up being underwhelming when compared to community mods like Complex which have been available for years.\n\n\nAnd as if messing up the Remastered versions wasn't enough:\n\n* They messed with the 'Classics'. Yes, they included a 'Classic' version that supposedly kept the original experience intact for those who may not like all the changes in Remastered. Which I would've been happy with, except... they kept the bugs/shortcomings intact (no widescreen/high resolution support unless hacked through registry), but they messed with things that should and could have been left alone (load/save no longer compatible with original savegames; LAN multiplayer removed; D3D/sw rendering removed).\n\nWhy? Especially that last one: it was already becoming difficult to make the originals work on current hardware and OS... and they go and remove compatibility options that existed in the originals! What exactly is the point of including HW2C then? It's not as pretty as HW2R, *and* it's now almost as bad about backwards compatibility. Pointless. If you need a lighter version to run on somewhat lesser hardware, just run HW2R with all graphics options turned to minimum. (except now, since they removed the other pre-existing rendering options, it's OpenGL 3.3 or nothing. Sucks to be you if you don't have updated compatible drivers).\n\n\nI played a few missions into HW1R before I got too irritated and went back to HW1C. Two missions short of the end of that campaign, they then published a patch for the Remastered version that somehow managed to break load/save in HW1C, making it freeze and crash on loading savegames created just days/hours before.  So I ended up playing halfway through the campaign on my original disc versions before even feeling like trying again.\n\nDid I miss the remastered resources while playing HW1C / HW1 original? Quite honestly, not in the least. They are a shiny bonus, indisputably, but simply have no bearing on the masterpiece that was and still is HW1.\n\nIn the end, I just feel duped for letting my nostalgia win and buying into the pre-order. This collection does not deliver: it removed what was good and added new gripes, in exchange of some shiny graphics and rerecorded sounds. On top of things, where my original dics versions came with the soundtracks included, now they want additional cash just for the soundtracks (which are not even complete btw, something about licensing quarrels).\n\n\nI noticed some people keep arguing that it's 'only' been days/weeks since release, that we cannot expect everything to work right yet, that we should allow them to get feedback and patch things. I regard this a non-argument.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, with a production from scratch, that argument already makes me grit my teeth. Software/gaming has to be the only industry where consumers not just accept, but even *defend* incomplete and bugged-to-hell product releases. This should not be acceptable, and if consumer rights were anywhere near any other industry, we'd all be eligible for a refund.\n\nBUT THIS IS NOT A NEW RELEASE!! They had full access to the original sources. Again: they started with full access to the original source code. They even had the original developers assist them! And even with all that, their release is broken through bugs or intention. They do not get to claim 'needing time to fix inevitable issues' when those issues are in most cases clearly caused by meddling with code that did not need to be touched to begin with.\n\nWhether some people may like HW1/HW2 Remastered the way they are is frankly irrelevant to me. I'm sure there's plenty of people that feel Mona Lisa's smile could use a little retouching. It still does not make it right to put a marker to the master piece. If the original developers felt like they didn't get to make their 'definitive' version of Homeworld before, they could've saved that for Homeworld 3, or more likely, a future DLC for Homeworld Remastered.\n\nEnd verdict: A lot of money for shiny graphics and rerecorded sounds packaged with broken functionality, which makes at least this vet go back to the originals.\n\nP.S.: for the ones asking about Steam showing my play time increasing - that is me trying out the dozens of mods already coming out trying to restore what Classic/Remastered changed from the originals. Just let that sink in: the community, with limited tools and gimped access to game data, making right what the developers couldn't do with full access to everything.","March 10, 2015","false","73.4"," 240 of 360 people (67%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","67","240","360","25","38"

AND the fact that I get both the Classic Versions AND the Remastered Versions of both HW1 & HW2 in one?! Why the hell ANY FAN of this game in the past would turn this game away is just beyond my ♥♥♥♥!\n\nThe fact that we can now fight each other in Multiplayer with all 4 races from both the 1st and 2nd Homeworld Games is just absolutely fantastic. That was something I always wanted to do in the past, and now I can do so without mods! How could I possibly say "No" to this game?!\n\nHowever, there are some things to note. A lot of people have been complaining about some of the balance changes specifically regarding Frigates and Capital Ships. Primarily the fact that their HP has been DRASTICALLY nerfed since the originals. And unfortunately, I completely agree. I find this nerf to be very unnecessary and kinda makes capital ships and frigates to be a lot less useful as they used to be. Thankfully, however, there is a fix for this in the workshop.\nThere is a mod called "Remastered Re-Balanced" that is available to get in the Steam Workshop that fixes nearly Every Single Problem I have with the Rebalancing Changes that Gearbox made. If you wanna play this game and fix all the problems that are present with the Remastered Versions with Frigates and Captial Ships, along with many other things as well, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND getting that mod. It will make your game 10 times better. You have my assurance on that one.\n\nNow with that said, some people are gonna be confused as to why Homeworld: Cataclysm was not included in the Remastered Collection. The reason behind this is because the Original Source Code of Homeworld Cataclysm is currently Missing. The original game developers of Cataclysm are long gone now. But Gearbox has said if anyone has any leads to where that Source Code may be, to report it to them immediately. But honesttly, it could also be said that it might just be easier to re-do the whole game from scratch at this point. But regardless, there's already a mod in the Workshop right now that allows you to play as the Somtaaw in HW2 Remastered. So that's definitely a start. But I still would have loved to play as The Beast again. Hopefully someone will make a mod of that too if Gearbox doesn't remaster Cataclysm.\n\nBut the bottom line here is this:\nThis Game is a MASTERPIECE. If you love Sci-Fi RTS Games and if you love things like Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, Mobile Suit Gundam, etc.... This game will MOST DEFINITELY be something to pick up.\n\n\n\n.......What, are you still reading this? GO! Buy this game right now! Stop reading and do it! It's worth every single penny in your wallet that you spend on it! It's a Legendary Spart RTS, for Christ Sake! GO!

If you've never played the original Homeworld, the remastered version is the game for you.  If you have, however, you'll come to realize that Homeworld 2 was a step back in terms of strategy and micromanagement of your fleet.  The formations in the original Homeworld, for example, allowed ships to move in an ACTUAL formation.  In Homeworld 2, these formations break apart as soon as you move in any direction besides forward.  Another thing is ship intelligence.  In the original Homeworld, heavy/multigun corvettes tended to strafe around the target, with their fronts facing the target.  This allowed maximum damage since no gun was obstructed by another.  In Homeworld 2, the "strafe" of corvettes is just a circular movment around the target, no fronts facing at all.  This meant that damage output is reduced, since the guns on the opposite sides do nothing.  Oh, and difficulty scaling.  Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ difficuly scaling (Sea of lost souls mission on remastered...like no..just kill yourself).  These three things are the most disappointing aspects of the remastered, in my opinion.  There are a bunch of others I didn't cover but I'm sure somebody has in the reviews of this collection.\n\nAll in all, this collection is really just a nostalgic trip down memory lane.  Graphics are top notch and so is the UI.  The original versions of the games are also included (which is freaking awesome).\n\nGet this collection even if you have or haven't played this game.

Homeworld remains one of the greatest PC games ever made. The uniqueness and originality of Relic's game is still unmatched and it required very little touch-up work to remain breathtakingly beautiful.\n\nOn the negative side: Homeworld Remastered has many bugs which you will discover rapidly. I certainly did, in my first few minutes of play. The tutorials do not work; the voice instruction speeds by without waiting for you to hit 'ok' to continue, and hitting 'ok' will in fact skip a section of voice. The tutorial in HW1R is in fact for HW2, not HW1; it includes HW2's ships. Achievements do not work; they only unlock when you leave the game, and even then it seems to be a fifty-fifty tossup whether you get ones that you earned in your last play session. The game is highly unstable; I had to uninstall and reinstall it multiple times due to the game entering a state of crashing whenever you did anything at the launcher, and I'm still not sure what's causing the instability. If you have any sort of desktop overlay software running, for example MSI Overdrive, AMD Raptr, Stardock's Windowblinds and Deskscapes, or even apparently the steam overlay(!) you will suffer graphical glitches including transparent ships, broken UI effects and broken HDR effects.\n\nI'm keeping the game because I like having a version of HW classic that works on my machine. I wish the remastered edition worked equally as well. Hopefully in the future patches will fix this, at which point I will change my opinion to positive.","June 12, 2015","false","4.5"," 70 of 101 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","70","101","0","6"

The game has been beautifully remastered. The graphics are unimaginably improved from the original 1999 release and runs smoothly even on the highest graphics settings. Ive heard though some people have been getting black screens on startup. It is the first release of the remastered collection so some problems like that are expected.\n\nNow I have to get a bit Nit-Picky\n\nIf you are thinking this is truely Homeworld1 remastered, think again. Many parts of the gameplay have been changed from how they were in the original. For instance fighters no longer require fuel, research costs money, ship count limits have become stricter, etc. These changes are welcomed by some and detested by some.\n\nThe remastered version also uses Homeworld2's UI. It is cleaner and more modern than that used by HW1 but many argue that it provides a lot of meaningless information and takes away from the more simplistic feel of the original.\n\nThere are many more bugs in the game than I expected. Formations for strikecraft are completely useless as no matter what tactics you assign to your fighter squadrons they always break formation when engaging enemies. A lot of the original formations and tactics functionality has been destroyed. The AI pathfinding is pretty bizare.\n\nI formally sent my findings regarding these bugs to gearbox and they tried to assure me via E-mail that they are working hard on the issues mentioned and are trying to pop out a patch within the month. Not sure it will actually happen but I am happy about gearbox's enthusiam for improving their product.\n\nDespite the bugs and sometimes unwelcome changes I still reccomend the collection to anyone. I advise older fans of the game like me to do more research into the changes in the remastered before being completely commited. That being said the collection still includes legal no-cd versions of both original games and is alone worth the money. The remastered versions and revitalized multiplayer are welcome bonuses.","February 28, 2015","true","21.5"," 43 of 57 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","43","57","0","4"

I found a game called Homeworld. Allthough I was unable to play the game due to it not being downloadable and the region I am in. So I played other games and kept Homeworld in the back of my mind.\n\nLast week when i noticed it was coming to steam I jumped all over it. After playing Nexas Jupiter Incedent and the Sins series, I was left with a want of more. I wanted Sins openness of the skirmishes and the relaistic feel and look of Nexas.\n\nMy first hands on with HW was great. I love the viuals and its feels relistic too. The radio chatter is very good as well. The only issue for me is how the campaign is mission based (I would like a big galaxy to build my empire and live amoungst the others) so I tried skirmish. The maps are too small and really result in quick deathmathes in skirmishes. All the while I am still loving the game I just needed it to offer more freedom.\n\nSo I went looking for the perfect mod. I found Complex mod. Its exactly what I wass looking for and in my opinion makes the game what it should be and to me the best space game out there. Complex has a skirmish map that is 60000 km. Its basiclly a galaxy for you to skirimsh on. But its so big you have to use hyper space to travel long distances making it hard to be found and easy to disapear.\n\nIf you like space, rts games, and you feel u havnt found that game yet. This game migh just do for you what it has done for me.\n\nI suggest using complex mod. It can only be used with classis HW2 for now, but you will not regret it. Remastered is great but with no mods to help me immerse myself into the galaxy, I will stick with HW2 classic for now.\n\nMy Verdict:\n\nVisuals 9/10\nSound 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nReplay Value 9/10\nMods 10/10\n\n9.5/10 without mods\n10/10 with mods\n\nThanks for reading.","March 1, 2015","true","86.6"," 57 of 81 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","57","81","0","0"

As such, most of this is...\n\nCons:\nMost gameplay elements from Homeworld 1 have been completely stripped away to shoehorn it into Homeworld 2's engine: Ships do not stick to formation during attack runs; missile destroyers output a constant stream of missiles instead of a short high-dps alpha strike; Support frigates are essentially useless - they no longer repair larger ships, and with the removal of fuel requirements, strikecraft no longer dock and repair automatically at them; you can no longer exceed fleet limits with salvage in HW1- probably one of the most-liked defining 'bugs' of the game; multiplayer requires a 3rd-party DRM/sign-up to play; there is no way to disable mouse acceleration/smoothing or change mouse sensitivity; on multi-monitor setups panning is frustrating because the mouse isn't captured to the screen; UI elements come in four sizes: Big, really big, humongous, and jesus christ it's huge; multiplayer is in an unfinished beta state.\n\nI bought this game specifically for Homeworld 1 multiplayer - the original is no longer playable because it relied on a 3rd-party system called Gamespy. This remastered version of the game now ALSO relies on a 3rd-party system/DRM check called Shift, so who even knows how long multiplayer will be available. Certainly not nearly a decade like the original Homeworld 2.\n\nThe rub is this:\nIf you are like me, and you wanted to play Homeworld 1 like it was, in singleplayer or multiplayer; skip it. This is Homeworld 2 with Homeworld 1 ships in it, repackaged and resold. Modders have already done this with Homeworld 2. None of Homeworld 1's game mechanics made it into this "remaster".\n\nIf you are only interested in Homeworld 1 or 2 with an updated coat of paint, and don't care for Homeworld 1's game mechanics, then it's worth a buy after a price drop. (As of writing, the game is nearly $40).\n\nFrankly, this game is an insult to Homeworld 1 fans. I can't say I'm surprised that the dev team took the easy way and just dropped HW1 assets into HW2 without doing anything to actually make them work - we're talking Gearbox here. I should've known better than to put money down with them at the helm.\n\n-----\nThat said, most Homeworld fans have only played the second game, so in terms of mass appeal, this game still works. A lot of people are excited about their favourite Homeworld 2 mods - Complex, etc. being ported, and these people will likely be quite happy with the game. If you're a Homeworld 1 fan though, you got shafted.","February 25, 2015","false","13.0"," 174 of 286 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","174","286","8","6"

And this is terrible, since fighters and corvettes work different in both games. Now in Homeworld1 I can't order my corvettes to stay in formation and unleash a wall of destruction upon their targets, instead they are flying around targets, and utilize half their guns at one time to hit the target, instead of all-gun barrage. I can't order my interceptors to stay in X formation and become a serious threat to single targets, instead they disperse and get destroyed by ridiculously accuracy-boosted assault frigates.

While the game has had a significant face-lift bringing the graphic detail of the units and surrounding space to current resolutions. The major drawback is that they didn't really remaster many of the controls or flesh out some much-needed tactical options like "don't deliberately crash into asteroids" or "hey, guys everyone come here… except you, go chase that guy and die!". A lot of the UI feels a sloppy instead of being tightly bolted down and intuitive and much of what you didn't like about the original is still there in large parts. In a few cases it's made worse with widely variable strafing that will make you question whether your frigate captains are actually cats high on catnip. The graphics are fantastic, but the game is largely unchanged and not improved upon where it was sorely needed. As an unnecessary bonus, I can make the menu UI take up 90% of the screen.","March 2, 2015","true","30.8"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","33","44","0","2"

It seems that they belong to the "only multiplayer matters; wreck singleplayer at will" mindset; as a result, while skirmish and multiplayer works quite well, the HW1 single player campaign is badly messed up by their methods for combining HW1 and HW2 into a single multiplayer environment.\n\nFrom the start you're plagued with insufficient resources to build enough ships. You're almost guaranteed to fail the second mission, unless you know the trick: while Heavy Corvettes have been badly screwed up, salvage corvettes now steal anything bigger than a fighter. So you go from, "Wtf? 3 Interceptors just wiped out 5 Heavy Corvettes?" to "Wow, if I have interceptors and salvage corvettes, I can steal EVERYTHING."\n\nSo the game goes in a flash from stupidly, head-bangingly messed up to OP'd and too easy, and has been transformed into a pirate game.

The games hold up extremely well, even though the games are 16 and 12 years old. The devs reworked everything from the ground up as opposed to improving some textures like in most HD remakes. I finished the first campaign and played a few skirmish games and haven't encountered any bugs. The multiplayer is still in beta at this time since they are letting all the factions across both games play against each other, and things aren't balanced yet. There is a new UI and controls, mostly revamping the HW1 controls to make them more like HW2, and getting rid of refeuling for strikecraft in HW1. Ignore people that are complaining about this because it makes HW1 10x more playable. On the down side the formations from HW1, that were crucial to using strike craft don't work in the remastered version. Hopefully this will be fixed in a patch, but if you want a faithful HW1 experience the set includes both HW1 and 2 in their original untouched forms. Also I believe the campaign has gotten easier. I can't verify if this is because the game is simply easier or because I have played so much of it over the years.HW has a slower pace, so if you prefer 5 minute multiplayer matches HW might not be fore you. The story is very good, a rarity for a RTS, also the soundtrack and art is also amazing. The HW franchise was so ahead of its time that it is still innovative more than a decade on. No space based RTS has ever come close to besting it. The modding community has been active for the past 2 years for HW2 specifically, so you can expect a lot of mods comming out shortly. I wouldn't be surpirsed if HW: Remastered won many RTS of the year awards, like it did when it came out years ago.

There was time to plan meaningful maneuvers, and the game has a certain grace many other RTSes lack as a result.  It's a game you'd play while enjoying a fine Scotch.\n\nWith Homeworld 2, the unfortunate designer behind that game decided to throw all that out and just make Starcraft.  Rock-paper-scissors balance to the extremes, huge fleets that could be wiped out in seconds, a game won more by sheer numbers than strategy.  It lost much of its grace and, for me, was a massive disappointment.\n\nHomeworld Remastered puts the first game in the second's engine, and it is unfortunately rebalanced to be more like the second.  No longer will you carry a carefully managed growing fleet between missions.  Instead every mission you'll just be pumping out and losing masses of units.  No time for strategy, just crank out units until you have more than the enemy.\n\nIt's an incredible shame because the graphics are quite nice, however, the original game remains mechanically superior in every way.  Given this, it's ridiculous that they couldn't do the bare minimum of work to modernize the original game.  I.e. It's always been possible to configure HW1 to run in widescreen resolutions via a registry edit - not too hard for a savvy user, but still annoying.  Would it really have been that hard for them to at least update the game to support modern resolutions through the in-game menu?","April 1","false","7.1"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","25","35","0","0"

And for good reason, it has stood the test of time with the greats like the starcraft/warcraft series, age of empire series, and command & conquer series\n\nFirst some changes that I like...\nFuel for fighters (except for the fact that ai fighters never had the fuel restrictions)\nand thats it\n\nThe "Reboot (because it is not a remasted edition in my eyes) Edition" is a complete farce because...\n\n--There are no more tactical fleet setups\n- no need for interceptors now that you can build bombers\n- no need for assault frigates, you have access to drone frigates\n- no need for frigates at all cause you can build destroyers\n\nThe original game had this, if you had a fleet of assault frigates you were gonna die to a swarm of fighters. why was this changed? It is intuitavly a tactical desicion thats missing\n\n--Formations no longer matter\nAgain so many have said this before but so many new players do not realize why they were so integral to the game. or understand why people complain about them\n\n-a wall formation would attempt to hold that formation as they attack while retreating\n-an x or claw formation would hold that formation while strafing\n-a sphere formation would attempt to guard the strongest ships at their center while attacking\n\nAs it is now every formation devolves into chaos at the first sign of enemy contact\n\nAlso\nThe 3d management of the map no longer matters (or exists)\n\nAs stated in even the first mission of Hw 1 you can do more damage on capital ships from below, above, or behind... Without the cohesive formations we had before this is a non-factor now because once they engage its a free for all\n\nCampaign Difficulty Scaling\n\nThis was something else way ahead of its time, instead of a difficulty slider the campaign progressed based on how good you were doing... the original did this well by placing a few more corvettes or frigates in at innopportune times.\nThe new version just slams em in there.\n"oh you played smart and made 5 interceptors on mission 1?"\n"im gonna destroy your world and put in 20 light corvettes before the mission starts"\nor\n"you had just a mothership? oh you must be a noob, there will be no fighters to defend the carrier on day 2 ever i dont care how many you produce there will never be defenses for me cause you are such a noob"\n\nTest this one for yourself\n\nIt is my hope that every new player to the franchise finds this post helpful as to why those veterans of the franchise fine this game so frustrating and disapointing.\n\nI know a lot of balance changes were made for the players of hw1 and hw2 multiplayer but that should never have been done, let the players choose which game they want to play multiplayer and balance accordingly dont intermingle that bull.","March 1, 2015","false","51.2"," 87 of 148 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","87","148","8","0"

Additionally the package includes the classic version of both games. Although Homeworld and Homeworld 2 are both very similar real-time strategy games, they both play and feel very different.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient stone plate showing an engraved course through the galaxy, triggers your people on a journey through space to find your original home world. As expected this journey comes with many obstacles and as commander of fleet it is your task to overcome them. In other words, you have to fight. Think of Battlestar Galactica and you get the idea.\n\nThe concept of the game is really cool and takes you on an intense science fiction journey that feels very unique. Every hyper-jump brings you to a new level in the game. Your remaining fleet arrives centred around your mother-ship. The mother-ship is capable of constructing all kind of different ships. Frigates, cruisers, corvettes, fighters or destroyers, you name it. Additionally you can research new technologies to upgrade your equipment. In order to build new ships you need to collect resources. Resources can be found in asteroid fields and shipwrecks.\n\nAs for Homeworld 1 most levels are slow paced. Most of the time you are not attacked unless you engage the enemy. This allows you to take your time, which is a wonderful thing. You can drink a cup of tea or relax with a glass of whisky, harvest nearby resources, explore your surroundings and plan your strategy. In this way Homeworld 1 almost feels like a game of chess.\n\nHomeworld 2 is the complete opposite. In Homeworld 2 you are constantly put under pressure by never-ending scripting events that force you to permanently fight for survival. Additionally the amount of enemies seems endless at times because the developers implemented a variable AI that automatically adjusts to your fleet size and makes sure it's stronger than yours. The relaxing atmosphere from Homeworld 1 is diminished to a few isolated occasions in Homeworld 2, which makes both games two very different experiences.\n\nBoth games are generally considered to be hard games. And while I really had to struggle with some levels in Homeworld 1 I was always able to manage them by re-trying one way or the other. This is not necessarily the case for Homeworld 2. The achievement statistic on Steams shop page shows that many players gave up on Homeworld 2. This impression is mirrored in the forums. Homeworld 2 is an extremely difficult game and can be very frustrating at times.\n\nPros: (both games)\n- beautiful graphics, still not like games from today but considering the age of the games the developers did a great job\n- tutorials\n- good keyboard interface\n- very good music\n- good voice acting, well designed ship communications\n- option to manually save at any time, very important!\n- addictive, after failing to complete a level I went to bed and woke up at three o'clock at night, re-tried and made it :-)\n- interesting story\n- very good cutscenes with regard to contents\n\nPros: (Homeworld 1)\n- relaxing, great atmosphere\n- difficulty is well balanced, rather easy in the beginning and pretty hard in the end (but still not as hard as every single level in Homeworld 2)\n- freedom to self-initiate the hyper-jump to the next level\n\nPros: (Homeworld 2)\n- resource collectors and repair ships are now combined in one unit\n- more ship upgrade options\n\n- Cons: (both games)\n- games come without manual. Thankfully players provided links to the manuals in the forums that left me with four documents of 173 pages, nice\n- if you end up finishing a level with a remaining fleet that is unfit to beat the next level you need to replay the last level to make sure your remaining fleet is prepared for the upcoming challenge\n- one achievement asks you to play the tutorial of the classic game. Unfortunately this is not possible because the classic version keeps crashing. Forums are full of players with this problem. Adding this kind of achievement was a really dumb move from the devs.\n\n- Cons: (Homeworld 1)\n- last level seemed a little to hard\n\n- Cons: (Homeworld 2)\n- stressful most of the time\n- can be frustrating at times\n- too difficult\n- if your last main objective has been completed the game automatically hyper-jumps into the next level. This can be a huge problem if your fleet is diminished after a lengthy fight and you jump right into the next fight. In order to prepare your fleet before jumping you have to wait before completing the final main objective\n- salvage corvettes make no more sense because they have become far to expensive to justify the risk\n- maximum number of ships in a group is restricted. In Homeworld 1 you can exceed the maximum number by capturing enemy ships.\n- stuttering cutscenes\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed both games. They offer a very unique atmosphere. I don't know any other game with a similar mood. Homeworld 1 deserves a 100% recommendation while Homeworld 2 deserves a recommendation for the hard core fans but probably not for everybody.","May 7","true","46.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","1"

It's absolutely stunning, texture detail beautiful. For Homeworld 1, this comparison is outsdanding, but for Homeworld 2 the improvements aren't as radical due to the game still being in the same engine. That's not to say that both aren't improved, but it's much more significant for the original.\n\nSome of the audio has been re-recorded and while it sounds alright there are portions where old (albeit not as compressed) samples are used. This makes it sound jarring since the same settings aren't used between both recording as well as the actor's ages have dramatically changed since the original releases. For Homeworld 1, it's nice to not hear as much compression on things, giving better clarity.\n\nThe biggest problem with Homeworld 1's remaster is that old tactics aren't working. Formations are fundementally broken, shedding the fact that these fights are in space and momentum is a thing, instead going for a jet-fighter approach. The problem is that makes guard orders useless as you might assign a sphere formation around a target with guard orders, but as soon as enemies get within range, your ships break off and take forever to get shots on target.\n\nThe good news is that having the Classic version is great, but while the Classic version does run, it does have problems with multi-monitor systems.","February 28, 2015","true","6.3"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","25","37","0","0"

No. Some of the mechanics in HW1 in particular have been removed, and make certain missions that were monstrously difficult (at least when I was young) rather easy - like Gardens of Kadesh. The removal of strike craft fuel and the change in formation tactics makes it a very different level. There are also some bugs here and there like you'd expect from any new release. None of them I encountered were game-breaking.\n\nWhat surprised me is that nostalgia didn't cloud my recollection of this series. These games are truly incredible, and unlike any other game you'll experience. They require patience and deliberation that many games now have done away with, but it is every bit as rewarding as I recall. A millenia-spanning story, gorgeous visuals done the justice they deserve, and demanding, yet oddly relaxing gameplay married to one of the most unique UI's in all of gaming. Thank you Gearbox. I had considered this series lost in IP limbo until the THQ auction, and now a new generation can appreciate a flawed, astounding masterpiece along with its excellent sequel.\n\nTLDR: If you haven't played Homeworld and you like the RTS genre, buy it.

On one hand, I am a long-time fan of the Homeworld series of games. From the moment I'd played the original HW demo prior to the game's release, I was in love with the game. So much that over the years I've wound up with several copies of it so I could play with friends who didn't have their own at the time.\n\nFast forward past Homeworld: Cataclysm (since it's not in this collection), to Homeworld 2. I was still quite happy with the game, although I was not so impressed with the new game engine. Also, I was quite confused with some of the continuity errors introduced into the units. Why were capital ships no longer capable of jumping themselves, with the exception of ships that could build the hyperspace module? In HW 1, all frigates and up were jump-capable without support. Why were formations and tactics effectively non-existant? They played such a huge role in carrying out a successful combat action in the original. The list goes on.\n\nSo, here we are today, with the Homeworld Remastered Collection. As a lover of the series, I'm thrilled with its existence. From a collector's standpoint, this is a wonderful addition to the Homeworld Universe. It preserves the story and music from the original versions, and does indeed do a very nice job of updating the appearance of the setting.\n\nNow, the gripes...\n\nFirst off, they made subtle modifications to the classic version of Homeworld included in the collection. There is a queue-limit, restricting how many active build queues per mothership and carrier. Want to queue a whole mixed corvette wing at once? Nope, you can only build 2 types at once, regardless of how many of each. This continues on through to capitals ships. Also, they removed all capablity for multiplayer. There isn't even a LAN option. If LAN was still an option, through some network trickery people could still play multiplayer, even if there was no ability to just find and hop into a game like before the multiplayer lobby finally was shut down.\n\nRegarding the multiplayer side of things in general, I've only tried one game over the beta system (well, beta as of this writing, anyway), and I was unimpressed. About 15 minutes in, just as my teammate and I finished fending off an initial assault from the other players (6 went in via lobby, 4 of us wound up in game), the game just up&closes on me. No error, no crash message, nothing. Just back to my desktop.\n\nNow, onto my gripes with the "Remastered" version of Homeworld 1. In short, it's just a mod for the original Homeworld 2 engine (as "improved" for the remastered version of HW2). Unit caps, insanely-decreased hangar capacity on the mothership, a queue that can only build 2 or 3 different things at a time per production ship, RUs required for research (and no parallel researching anymore, just one tech at a time no matter how many sections you build for the research ship), and otherwise the same failings of the Homeworld 2 engine that the original HW2 suffered from. Namely the joke they called tactics and formations. And the same, clunky&screen cluttering interface (I loved the simplicity of the original HW's interface, it let me spend more time dealing with events in the gameplay, rather than trying to wrestle with which panel or convoluted "shortcut" I needed).\n\nAs it stands now (and any patches/updates aside, will ultimately probably remain so), I really can't recommend the game collection. I really only bought it for the inclusion of "Homeworld Classic," and while mostly happy with that part of the collection, I still have some complaints about the changes made to the game.\n\nOnly get this if you have a similar love of the franchise as I do, otherwise you should save your money and look for something else to scratch your space RTS itch.","March 11, 2015","false","24.0"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","0"

It plays very smoothly and I am having loads of fun in both the campaign and multiplayer. Definitely recommend anyone to give this game a go, especially if you like space opera and a strong story coupled with good RTS gameplay.\n\nHowever, it does have some bugs. For example, the speech audio sometimes randomly mutes itself during the campaign, which results in me needing to save and reload the game to get the speech audio back on. Another bug both me and a friend encountered was with the garden of Kadesh mission: When you attempt to enter hyperspace and fail and you have your units docked, it will force them to launch  and you cannot dock them again. The swarmers then wreck my salvage corvetts.\n\nAlso, it would be nice if the game were more 'unified'. In other words, I want to be able to access HW1 campaign, HW2 campaign, and the multiplayer without needing to close the game and open the launcher again. Those should all be options in the menu, not separate 'games' you need to launch.\n\nDespite that, I tend to overlook bugs and UX issues on the first day, as long as developers get them fixed in good time. So for now, I shall keep my review as overall positive.

I also dont agree with everything but you have to ask yourself the basic question "Is it fun?"\n\n\nAs someone whos played this game since its first release and still have the original disks, I bought this for 2 reasons. First being Steams support (Which could add a much bigger fanbase, and easier way to setup mods) and that I simply felt the need to assist this series by buying it.\n\nThey were never perfect but they were inspiring in their time... Just like now, its not perfect but why get so upset?

If you have never played and are thinking of buying it, start with HW 2.\n\nI never played the original Homeworld, but I am a big fan of Homeworld 2. It still is one of my absolute favorite games. As you can imagne, I was rather thrilled. I still am thrilled as I play through HW 1. I have read several complaints that HW 1 Remastered has become too HW 2. How do i feel about this? Meh, never played the original. Only played 2. So I think its great. I loved homeworld 2 and have no problem with the remastered game.\n\nMultiplayer/vs cpu is a different story. Its beta so there is a bit of grace there. Some maps have next to no resources. Must have been HW 1 maps, Thats my biggest complaint. On the right maps it is a ton of fun. Love having relics as the center of some epic space battles. My inner 12 year old is happy. Can't wait for some sick new mods.

If you do purchase this, be aware that HW1:R plays very little like the original game which it's fortunately packaged with; Most of this stems from the fact that it's on HW2's engine for whatever reason (Thus it uses the HW2-style hit/miss system instead of actual projectiles as in HW1C). It's basically a trade-off between having the tactical depth of HW1, or the prettiness of HW1:R.\n\n\nHW2:R's definitely fine since it's on the HW2 engine too, and the classics are the classics.\n\nBottom line is if modern graphics aren't necessary for you to enjoy a game, play Homeworld 1 Classic then HW2 remastered","December 18, 2015","false","16.8"," 72 of 125 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","72","125","5","0"

I wish I'd read the reviews before buying. It's baffling that they haven't ironed out such major bugs in such a long time.\n\nBottom Line:\nI can't recommend this game to new comers with all of the broken elements that made the original so good. You will be left wondering what all the fuss is about with such a mediocre game.\nI definitely can't recommend this game to veterans who've already tasted the goodness of the original. You will go 'Wow' when you see the graphics on level 1, and then you'll be mounting frustration as you discover one broken feature after the other.\n\nDetails:\n- Formations: Don't work. Ships break formation as soon as they engage enemies which defeats the purpose entirely. Battles are basically a free for all. This occurs in hw2 as well.\n- Tactics: Don't work. There is no discernible difference between the 3 tactics. The buttons are just eye/ear candy.\n- Tactical map: Homeworld 1 allowed you to specify a 'move to' point, then hold the shift key to lock that point while panning with rmb to adjust elevation. This is no longer possible, and you have to specify both the 'move to' location and the elevation from a single angle. Not possible, not impressed. Also applies to hw2.\n- Salvaging: It's nice that they've made it possible to salvage those standard and missle corvettes in the early missions (without painful scuttle tactics).  It's NOT nice that the 6 assault frigates from mission 3 simply disappear when captured (and are down to 4 for some reason).\n- Resourcing: Nerfed to 500 RU's per load (down from 600) for no apparent reason. Takes an eternity to collect resources. Also there's a whole lot more resources available in each level, severely hurting the fine tuned balance of the original game. But I guess that was an easier fix than trying to fix the balance.\n- Balance: Downright terrible. Battles that should be over in a flash take forever and with unacceptible losses. An army of 21 interceptors, 7 heavy corvettes and 4 assault frigates should suffer no losses when facing 5 interceptors + 2 corvettes. Neither should they take more than 5 minutes. But that's not homeworld "remastered".\n- Interface: I, for one, preferred the original build manager to the homeworld 2 multi page build manager since it's easier building everything from a single page.\n\nIf it ain't broke, don't make a half-a!$@d attempt at 'remastering' the game.","February 22","false","25.7"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","1"

I didn’t pay full price to beta test your code!  Frequent crashes.  Also game breaking bugs.  For example, if you have to reload a mission from an auto save, mission events will fail to trigger, preventing you from completing it.  Serious bugs in the AI behavior too.  Critical to success in Homeworld is capturing enemy ships.   Imagine my frustration when my own ships continue to shoot enemy vessels after I’ve captured them, often destroying both the captured ship and my own salvage corvettes in the process.

Formations and simulated projectile bullets are gone, both foundational mechanics.\n\nWhereas HW1 achieved it's balance by making ships and weapons actually function according to their role, HWC:RM achieves its balance via HW2's rock/paper/scissors balance, by arbitrarily weighting certain ships to function less effectively against ships they aren't meant to be useful against. Actual simulated projectiles and formations were never made to function in HWC:RM.\n\nIf they had just upgraded textures and models and called it a day, they would have shown this game more respect.

I remember myself playing with friends when Homeworld2 came out, the amount of incredible games we had, and still have. That was the best experience I had in strategy video games thus far.\n\nAs much as I love strategy games, I fell in love for this title the first time I played it. I will probably always consider it as my favourite one, and that's probably the most valuable reason I started developing mods on it, not just because I wanted to create something related to my favourite science fiction universes, but because this game brought us so many possibilities that I had to do it.\n\nI seriously believe Gearbox gave Homeworld the respect it deserves, like other people think. This Remastered version is definitely what we can consider as "Remastered"... in opposition to other studios who tend to promote remastered games just because they changed the textures or the screen resolution. It's not a Remastered version, it's.. a Renovation. Now highlighting high definition score, great voices, Full-HD animated cutscenes and one of the latest version of OpenGL, Homeworld Remastered makes the whole game really epic, with a well-told story.\n\nMy unique complain is that they decided to remove audios from other languages (such as French, Spanish, Italian...) while they still have them and that the original records are already in HD. They said that "they don't have them anymore", so they would have needed to remake all of them with foreign recording studios, and I don't believe Gearbox wanted to spend money on this, as they're not a publisher, and don't have the same amount of ressources.\n\nPros of this Remastered Version:✓ Brillant and stunning visuals.\n✓ A better campaign (improved cutscenes).\n✓ A great multiplayer mode.\n✓ Far better Interface, and god we needed it.\n✓ A great User Interface, which proves Homeworld rhymes with Modernity.\n✓ Awesome multiplayer games in perspective.\n✓ New tracks and remastered awe-inspiring score.\n✓ Better movements and improved AI.\n✓ Steam multiplayer platform, a good point to play with your friends.\n✓ Mod tools, although not finished.\n\nCons of this Remastered Version:✖ Audio strictly limited to English. A shame because foreign languages had really great voice overs.\n✖ Some missions could have been improved (strange movements).\n✖ Formations and BC should be improved as well.\n✖ Steam exclusive. Even the CD version requires Steam, which is something I consider as "bull****".\n\nThere are cons, of course, but let us all remember than this Remastered version is a way for Homeworld fans to support the future of the franchise.

Bear in mind that this review talks about the remastered games ONLY.\n\nI cannot overstate how much I looked forward to something like this, since Homeworld never had a digital release (good luck getting those old CDs to run).\n\nThe remaster is done well, but not perfectly. My biggest gripe being ship squads. In multiplayer, the Homeworld 1 races simply don't stand a chance in the fighter/corvetter categories. Of course that could change with future patches (as I'm sure it will).\n\nCampaign wise, the Homeworld 2 campaign feels nigh-on identical to how it was before. The Homeworld 1 campaign though definitely felt different. It seemed a bit easier, maybe because of the rock-paper-scissors combat system associated with the Homeworld 2 engine. Either way, it was fun and a great trip down memory lane... except it looked a hellova lot better!\n\nBut there are some issues, almost all being Homeworld 1 related. Formations need work, simple as that. If I put my ships into a sphere I expect them to hug around a guarded ship, not sit next to it in a ball. Fuel is gone, but TBH, to me (!) that was a positive change overall. The UI is neat and better to me than the old one. This one (like Homeworld 2's original UI) allows you to monitor the action while issueing build and research orders.\n\nMost of the other changes are minor, such as Kadeshi Multibeam frigates not doing a barrel roll when firing or research ships not spinning anymore. All of that could be patched in later though, or modded.\n\nIf you can live with the above differences and consider the amazing visual upgrade, then this is absolutely a good buy!\n\nHomeworld is an RTS franchise you OWE yourself to at least try.","March 6, 2015","true","76.6"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

One of them was Homeworld.\nSadly, I missed out on playing this gem. However thanks to the folks at Gearbox Software, we now can play it in full beautiful HD. With redone graphics, cleaned up audio and more. Homeworld Remastered brings back this 1999 classic in style. The story and music are fantastic.\nThe RTS side of Homeworld is a whole different beast though. The usual high paced, high action style of games that we get these days is slightly different in Homeworld. Its a much more relaxed experience. Leaving you plenty of room to decide your next move. Sometimes this leads to unnecessarily long missions. It does enable you though to come up with a master strategy. Like a general on a battle field watching from above. In all Homeworld Remastered does the game justice and then some.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/0w-RSBmcyOw\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","April 12, 2015","true","3.1"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

It's a real-time strategy space game that is basically the best one to this date with no game to overcome it, in most peoples eyes.\n\nThis is going to be a thoughts on the game, my thoughts, as a person who never played the originals, and a friend who did play them and now playing the remake. Also, neither that friend or I have finished the game, just to note.\n\nBoth of us thought that the graphics are, for how old this game is, compared to the classics, it's beautifully remade.The ship models are a lot more pleasing and awesome, same with the background (space), and the UI is adjustable which is neat, but for me that UI could have been better.\n\nThe story, for my friend has always been great, and to me it is just great. The presentation is fantastic, which include the story, the cut scenes, and the battles, all of which are awesome and emphasizes that space is scary and there's a lot of powerful forces out there, showing that to you directly opposing your power.\n\nThe only complaint so far for the game is that me and my friend thought that moving the camera around can be a pain, not hard, just annoying, and most of the other issues for the game are coming from the fact this is a remastered game, of an old game, that didn't get a makeup of modern technicalities and controls that we get in most new games nowadays, which isn't necessarily a negative thing, but it would have been great if it were tweaked to have them.\n\nSo overall the game is great, for new players and for the fans, and for the price it has, for two remade games in one, with the mixed multiplayer, it's a great purchase, and a cleaned up superb old/new game/s.\n\nShameless link[ksalue.com]","March 13, 2015","true","6.1"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","22","34","2","0"

I've kept at it constantly through the years. The Remastered edition does contain Homeworld and Homeworld 2, they are as good as ever, and this is reason enough for a thumbs up.\n\nThe Remastered edition adds a lot of visual improvements, and some gameplay modifications as well. The awesome Homeworld story is brought into the Homeworld 2 engine - some players might choose this opportunity to experience it, since you can now issue orders while the game is paused, and thus deal with the more hectic moments of space combat.\nApart from more detailed textures, 3D models, lightning system, here are some pros and cons at a glance:\n\nPROS:\n- the gameplay tried to remain faithful to the original\n- game runs well\n- good sound quality\n- everything said in cinematics has a subtitle, including the launch game-engine cinematic\n- good first day support (got a game update immediately after my first crashed, which got fixed)\n- you can pit Kushan against Hiigaran, or any of the 4 factions of the two games in skirmish\n- it is fun\n\nCONS:\n- though technically impressive, the visual aspect of the game needs some more polishing and fitting together\n- some HW1 ships don't work well yet, like Hive Frigates\n- HW1 Salvage Corvette numbers are now drastically limited; doing the campaign junkyard style seems doubtful\n\nNitpicking:\n- The starting cinematic ends with the view centered on the Resource Collector; however, due to the orientation of the camera, the backdrop is outer space, rather than Kharak, as was in the original game. I feel this disrupts the narratively important visual repetition of Kharak (multiple times in the starting cinematic, then contrasted in mission 3), and I would like the developer to 'fix' the narrative element back.\n\nBottom line: good, fun games, done in the spirit of the old and improved upon.

Its lost none of the appeal however, but kept the bugs you had long forgotten!\n\nReturns are the bad formations, when your forces are slow to move and allocate firepower, that allow the AI's smaller forces deal more damage to you. Firing at salvaged ships. Building fighters that do nothing.\n\nHowever, you get to relive the story mode, which gives you love for the faceless race you represent. You travel the known galaxy in your attempt to see your old Homeworld. You get to feel the immense power of having a Heavy Cruiser.\n\nIt really is about reliving your past with this game, is it worth the money you spent to get the game? probably not, but thats not the point of this game. You write the story as your people return home!\n\nIn all, I'm enjoying the game, its nice to see a game where just building a massive force doesn't mean victory. Brute force means nothing if your taking damage from a Super Nova. Or when your larger ships become enemies versus a ghost ship. Then you get to try to fight enemies on your terms, using your tactics...which mostly involve salvage corvettes....\n\nI would say get the game, its past of your past, and with Steam Workshop, the endless mods should add hours of gameplay.\n\nPro's\nImpressive and heartwarming storyline\nA 3D enviroment\n\nCon's\nDodgy formations which can give the enemy the advantage\nStrange ship discissions\nHarvasting system is very strange and just plain annoying, as they spend ages getting place to place. and when you hyperspace, you are given ALL the RU's on the map, making the harvasting of little point (the hyperspace tip is fantastic for the super nova mission, where you can lose all harvasters)","March 16, 2015","true","31.9"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

So far, things have been a huge disappointment. The following only applies to HW1 as I have not attempted to play HW2:\n\n+ The graphics have indeed been modernized and fleet combat is spectacular to watch\n- Every single ship has had their resource cost and battle prowess completely changed\n- The AI of strike craft has been completely changed,  making fighters nearly useless in every type of battle\n- Damage dealt by larger craft has been greatly increased, shortening combat and making tactical movement orders unnecessary\n- Enemy fleet scaling has been completely changed, causing some missions to be stacked ludicrously against you and punishing you for playing well\n\n\nThe net result is that battles play out completely different. In HW1 Classic you had a framework for what to expect in combat: fighters would beat capital ships, capital ships would beat corvettes, and corvettes would beat fighters. Several craft would break these rules, but you always had the option through smart gameplay to even the odds - formations, tactics, and tactical movement could swing unfavorable fights in your favor. Now, in the Remastered version, all of that is pointless. Spend all your resources building as many of the biggest ships you can, and just drag a box around the enemy fleet to issue an attack order. Whichever side has the biggest fleet wins in a matter of seconds.\n\nNo thanks.\n\n+ The classic HW1 game is included if you don't want to deal with any of this nonsense.

Between the bugs and the changes the game flounders near the area of unplayable. For examples of changes, fundamental tactical abilities like telling your fighters to be "evasive" has simply been ripped out of the game. Whether or not this was to foment HWI vs HWII multiplayer is as irrelevant as it is uncertain, it renders figher groups so much less meaningful or useful. Fighters instead seem to behave in a sort of constant half aassed evasive which means that their aggressive behavior has also been scuttled.\n\nFor examples of bugs, from mission to mission my groups would fail to properly select. If I hightlighted, say, all the ships in group one then they might all show they were in group one, but if I actually hit one, only a few respond to the hail. I have to reselect and reassaign them all to "rebuilld" between missions. But this is nothing compared to ships simply REFUSING TO OBEY ORDERS. I have tried playing The Wastelands three times now and in each instance a point was reached where some group of ships simply refused to move or engage no matter what they were instructed. I was especially impressed by my salvage frigates staring dumbly at me as I repeatedly tried to get them to capture a destroyer or, indeed, any ship as they slowly got picked off one by one.\n\nI have never before felt compelled to write a negative review for Steam. It's one thing to simply make a bad game, that happens all the time. But this is a case of taking a masterpiece and destroying it. And I've been offered the chance to waste $35 dollars for the priviledge of watching one of my favorite games of old trashed in this manner.\n\nSimply releasing the games for $5 apiece and rebuilding the multiplayer environment would have been the right move. As it stands, I regret this purchase without reservation and cannot recommend it, at least not until the myriad gameplay issues have been resolved. Even then, the graphis upgrades hardly justify $35. In my opinion, if you make this purcahse you are probably getting ripped off.","March 7, 2015","false","6.7"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","25","41","2","0"

I was a super huge fan of the entire thing, even the never mentioned cataclysm. To say I was excited to see this game remastered was an understatement.\n\nFor those that are not familiar with homeworld: It's a fantastic space strategy simulation game. You use your massive motherships as space factories and face off against other ships/factions. The scale of combat expands quickly from smaller fightercraft all the way up to massive capital ship battles. It features a harvesting economy, salvage, ship theft & invasion, and a lot of research and development to keep your fleet operating and developing in a fashion of gameplay that you enjoy. The HIGHLIGHT of this game is that it's fully 3D. You can make attacks and travel along the Z axis freely.\n\nAs a returning player, the remastered game has exceeded all my expectations.\n1) The new graphics engine upgrades are gorgeous, giving you a much more believable/enjoyable visual experience.\n2) Multiplayer: Has been masterfully reworked so that the kushan, higaaran, taidan & vagyr all fight in the same maps. Each one has it's own distinct (yet familiar) style of gameplay, and benefits.\n3) With Steam support, the mod packs of this game are exceptionally easy to use! You can quickly "subscribe" to mods, and flick them on & off at a whim!\n\nI HIGHLY suggest this to anyone who is either a returning player wishing to re-kindle some nostalgea, or to new players who wish to experience one of the best space tactical games out there to-date.\n\nP.S. For those who throught homeworld was great buy easy, try the complex 9.1 mod! It upgrades the game in almost every way!","March 2, 2015","true","85.6"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

It's a perfect storm of perfection - perfect music, perfect crackling, crisp audio comm from your pilots, perfect sound effects.\n\nThe graphics in this remake are stunning, just as the original game was stunning back in 1999. Seeing the re-meshed, re-textured ships for the first time again as they fly out of the Mothership's bays is like greeting old friends after years away. I may have actually shed a tear of delight when I saw the good ol' bug-shaped Salvage Corvette, ready to steal slow moving Ion Cannon Frigates at my command.\n\nIf you like RTS games, there is no question that you should get this game. If you've never played Homeworld, you're in for a treat.\n\n(my only downside is that Gearbox seems to have been a bit overzealous in bringing Homeworld2 engine-based strategy into Homeworld. There are plenty of threads about this elsewhere. I'd prefer if they patch the game to make the original game remaster as close to, well, the original game, as possible).","February 26, 2015","true","15.5"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","17","26","2","0"

Homeworld Remastered, however, is an absolute exception. Gearbox seemed to have made it their goal to stay as true to the original as possible, while still carrying it over to 2015. Very successfully so, I might add!\n\nQuick overview:\nHomeworld's core game mechanics have been entirely preserved for Homeworld Remastered, down the smallest detail. It is delightful to see how extremely well Homeworld's rather unique approach to 3D real time strategy has aged.\nGraphics have been revamped while absolutely keeping in line with the game's distinctive art style. It's beyond anything I expected.\nNB: The original Homeworld 1 user interface has been forfeited in favour of Homeworld 2's much leaner and less cluttered UI. Smart move, really.\nSound and music, both in terms of recording quality and ingame sound engine, had major overhauls. Very noticeable. After all, they got none other than Paul Ruskay himself, who scored Homeworld's original soundtrack.\n\nThis "remastered" version was clearly done by people who appreciated the original game for what it represented back in 1999 (and many years to follow). They gave it a loving, respectful, much desired and much needed facelift to bring it to modern systems.\nThe result is nothing short of stunning. Players new to the series are absolutely recommended to take a closer look at the revival of an RTS cult classic; Homeworld veterans will immediately feel at home and - as in my case - nostalgic as hell.\n\n10/10, easily.","February 26, 2015","true","34.2"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","19","30","0","0"

Strikecraft, tactics and formations feel incredibly neutered and pointless in the remastered game. All it does is just confuse a fight more times than it helps, unlike the original where it was an important part of small unit tactics. Still, the story and pacing are mostly the same and it feels right.\n\nHomeworld 2 remastered... Where do I start? The story they give you is strange and vaguely nonsensical that wrecks some of the plot points from the first one for absolutely no reason that is apparent to me. It lacks the relaxed pace of the first game with crisis' piling up in your lap before you have a chance to deal with previous ones. Your opponents, the Vaygr, not only vastly outnumber you in each mission, but you quickly notice the quality of their craft also outstrip your own in most instances, this leaves every single engagement an attempt to overwhelm them and the fact that the mission automatically ends (also unlike the first one) means you have no chance to rebuild or reinforce your fleet before heading to the next mission.\n\nThe game looks pretty, but I feel that was Gearboxes ONLY concern when they remastered this game.","March 9, 2015","false","24.3"," 31 of 53 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","31","53","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/244160/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This was one of the very first space RTS games I have ever played back in my early teens. With the remastered edition, graphics are slightly updated and everything (especially UI) is given a better polish. For it's age (and update), it can still hold value for space fans.\n\nI haven't completed the first Homeworld but have the second (and am still sort of unfamiliar with the story). Basically, you play as this race called the Hiigarans. The game starts with the Hiigarans attempting to finish constructing their mothership but are quickly interrupted by attacking Vaygr enemies. From what I understood from the first game, there are 3 ancient power cores in the universe that if all three are collected by the wrong people, "end times" can ensue.\n\nThe gameplay follows a somewhat unique sequence. There is no base to build. There are no supply depots. There are no factories. There is only the mothership! The mothership is capable of building resource collectors, battle units from interceptor to capitol ship size and mobile resource centers. It is the headquarters that will provide everything necessary and will take your leftover units to the next level. Capitol ships and space stations are also units that can create more units. The issue here is that certain units require certain modules to build. A capitol ship cannot build frigates unless a frigate module has been built. Same concept applies with the space station. The challenge here is trying to balance out the fleet while being conservative with resources. The RTS factor to the game is unique in the sense that most of the crafts you build come in squadrons (except for the larger units like frigates). The space in which you can tell the units to move is on a 3D plane (the Z axis positioning can be modified by holding shift and the right mouse button). This adds some substance to the game as you can ambush your opponent in 3D! Having the right setup and formation can really bolster defense. Choosing units isn't too much of a hassle. If you find that your selecting repair units as well as military units, there is a special setting within the options to prioritize selection of military units. This is a good way to keep your peon units out of fights. There can be a lot going on at times and it can be hard to keep track of units. Pressing space will allow the player to zoom out and see the ENTIRE battlefield. This is a good way to manage your units. To make the camera go up and down for a better view, simply press insert or delete.\n\nThere are a few categories of units : strike craft, utility class, capital and frigate. Strike crafts usually come in groups (of 3 to 5) and consist of interceptors, bombers and corvettes. Bombers are more or less meant to strike larger ships and structures. Corvettes are quite slower than interceptors but pack more of a punch in their armor and weapons. Frigate classes have the ability to heal themselves but quite slowly. There are two types of frigates, marine and flak. Flak is meant to deal some heavy damage to structures and larger ships while marine frigates are meant to invade and seize control of structures or even opposing ships. Capital ships consists of carriers (which can build ships) and two battle focused units : destroyers and battle-cruisers. The mothership is the only ship capable of creating such behemoths. Destroyers are quite obvious and are meant to be like boulders rolling from afar but battle-cruisers are definitely devastators. They are able to have 5 strike crafts docked with them and give an additional 2 module slots. These guys are definitely the bad boys of the game.\n\nResources are harvested by specialty units called resource collectors. Resource collectors need to be told where to go in order to start their operation. They may stop in their tracks when there are no more resources left in an area and will most likely have to be told to move on to somewhere else. A mobile resource center can be created to cover more area and allow your resource collectors to submit their resources there instead of going all the way back to the mothership. Resource collectors are also able to repair units and structures but require additional research to unlock this ability. Research upgrades are available for a lot of units to improve their defense, mobility or offense. New unit types also have to be unlocked through research. Additionally, a few units will have special abilities available to unlock (such as corvettes laying out mines).\n\nThe visuals are pretty good. Definitely an upgrade from the original. The sounds are good and provide a decent atmosphere. The explosions sound varied as well as the weapons. The dialogue is as intriguing as the story line. Honestly, going from the old graphics to this is really enjoyable. I feel though you could have done just a bit more to make it that much more appealing to the eyes.\n\nOverall, a good game. The ability to fight in three dimensions coupled with it's unique approach to creating units makes the game poke it's head from the crowd. I found the price to be a bit steep and bought this game off a humble bundle. I think if it's for sale under $15 and you're a real space fan, you'll like it. If you're looking for ground breaking space RTS/battle simulator, this isn't it.\n\n\nRATING : 7.35/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nShip size varies greatly in this game\n\nYou can target sub-systems\n\nWhat the view looks like after pressing space\n\nEven though I'm a little overzealous in saying that the graphics could have been better, it's still pretty good\n\nWelcoming a destroyer to this world\n\nThe camera is quite flexible","April 19","true","5.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

As that was the main one I was looking forward to. It makes a great first impression till you start to realize that the hotkeys are now more complicated then they were in the past. So it feels like you are trying to dance with the keyboard. Having units autotarget friendlies and enemies is a tedieous task. The worst example is with repair vessels. Before you could tell them to fix any damaged ships you selected. Now they only focus on a single ship till you tell them to change. Sphere formations guarding a vunerable ship was a great startegy in the past. Not anymore. If you tell a ship to guard another. It would be distracted by something as a single probe and forget about its target you told to guard. Because of this I have the odd feeling that is why they decreased the number of enemy ships you have to fight on some missions. Because they must have been like  "Oh crap we made this game harder then the orignial to play. Maybe we should give them a tiny bit of slack if we want them to micromanaged every single ship. Also you know how you could easily select formation of ships in the orignal as well? not anymore. Now you select every single ship of that type on screen when you double click. And not just the formation you want to seperatly move.\n\nThat is all I found so far before I gave up and replayed the orignal to make sure my memory of how it controlled and played was the same. Sure enough the orignal plays as great as it always has but this remastered edition feels like 1 step forward and 2 steps back.\n\nWait a month or two before buying and maybe gearbox might patch some of the old gameplay features back in. If not we will have to rely on the mod community to help fix the remastered versions. So far they been doing a good job but to fix everything is going to take awhile. If they ever make a homeworld 3 I will not buy it because gearbox tricked me into thinking it would be fun. They made it look pretty but not fun. If you don't beleive me and having troubles with the remastered version. Go give the orignal version a try and you will see how much better it controls.\n\nOnly nice thing with this collection is the inclusion of the orignal 2 games to make up for the fact they dropped the ball in various areas.","March 12, 2015","false","40.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Homeworld 1 and 2 probably form the basis for the late THQ's success in the RTS genre; an excellent story driven campaign, X,Y,Z axis space combat, an epic sense of scale in relation to said combat and one of the best soundtracks to any game, not to mention the stylish cut scenes that convey the story to the player. However the remastered collection has reworked both titles (HW1 and HW2) in an improved homeworld 2 engine and thus delivers what we all wanted; HW1 in high definition jaw dropping glory. Also players can now enjoy a combined multiplayer experience with the factions from both games available to play against one another; so if you ever wondered who was the more hard core out of the Tiadan and the Vagyr you can now find out! Last and by no means least the steam workshop adds mods from many diverse sci fi franchises such as star wars, star trek, BSG, mass effect, wing commander etc etc. Therefore in conclusion I am rather grateful that nothing crazy like Homeworld 3 was attempted as the original two games have been unsurpassed for over a decade - until now.","June 9, 2015","true","96.1"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

From the (incredible) main campaigns to the excellent mods for them. So Remastered comes and polishes them up (and ports HW1 to the HW2 engine) which seems like the perfect of perfects. Except its not. Except it is.\n\nHW1 mechanics are flawed. Badly. Sometimes hilariously. The port of the game over to the HW2 engine is not as smooth as I hoped it would be. They nerfed the salvette everything strategy, but the HW2 AI is kind of laughable in HW1's tactical situations anyway, plus the addition of default "jump with all map resources" from HW2 takes out the need for fleet tooling and resource op micromanagement which was kind of a staple for me in the first game.\n\nBut it does (largely) function like it should. Homeworld 1 still feels like Homeworld 1. And it. is. glorious.\n\nBut where remastered really shines is with Homeworld 2. Designed for the engine already the gameplay and visuals are just absolutely flooring if you've played the game back in the day. It's easily the best looking space RTS. Even beating out Sins. Gearbox nailed the graphics and sound for both packages and the game is gorgeous and plays very well on my system, even in large engagements.\n\nThere's rough areas, MP is broken, it took a while for me to even get the game to launch, and HW1's mechanics are iffy at parts. However this is still the Homeworld I remember, redone in highest quality that could command AAA prices. I have no personal ties to Cataclysm though, so I can't comment on that too much.

Includes Homeworld and Homeworld 2, both in classic and remastered versions, that work on modern systems.\n\nIt's not easy game at first and it will take you some trial and error to complete the campaign. All ships have their strengths and weaknesses, some are better at dealing damage yet can't take much damage themselves, others are faster and more agile so they can overwhelm the larger ships if they have the numbers. Ships have either a projectile attack, missiles or energy weapon attacks. Some may have combination of all three like few of the larger capital ships.\n\nThere are many different starships in game that are divided into fighters, corvettes, frigates and capital ships. Some ships you will use for specific tasks, not just attacking but repairing, gather resources, cloaking allies, capturing enemy ships, disabling them, shielding allies from damage and much more.\n\nIn battle, ships can miss their shots, so 10 on 10 fighter battle can have different outcome depending on how lucky your shots are. And in large battles it's all about tactics and knowing your enemy weaknesses. Apart from solo campaign there's skirmish and multiplayer for some custom matches with friends.\n\nHomeworld 2 bring all that was great in Homeworld and adds more enemies, ships, modification modules, new research options for ships as well as new campaign. It's hard to review a "bundle" of sorts, because it's 4 games in one package, even though they are similar, the remastered versions have a lot of new features as well as improved visuals and game user interface.\n\n[Tutorial lady]: If you liked this review, click OK to continue.\n\n[ OK ]\n\n;8)","May 11","true","19.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Probably won't update in the future.\n\nThe whole package is great, especially for me since I'd never played the originals. It's important to note for Classic players, though, that there are a few changes to ship behavior and mission structure in HW1R(remastered). Aggressive/Evasive tactics are out, literally removed, and some of the missions appear to have been nerfed for some reason, the Kadesh in particular. The game also hosts a dynamic difficulty setting based on your fleet size, though the specifics of its behavior evade me. Strike group behavior is also altered, making behaviors like setting a Defender squadron to Sphere Formation and guard your target behave differently from Classic. The way damage and accuracy are rolled when ships fire are also different (iirc, it's based far more on dice rolling now).\n\nWhy is it like that? Well, HW1R runs in the HW2 engine.\n\nThat being said, I enjoyed HW1R a lot. The story is very vague and built on a lot of mysticism and prophetic themes. The game itself was enjoyable, although I wish that the AI on ships were far more intelligent. You do have to babysit your units (in HW2, too).\nHW2's a lot better as a gameplay experience though, although its story is a bit less interesting. I felt like a greater number of my ships were valuable throughout the course of the game, vs HW1, where the majority of the units you can build become obsolete very quickly.\nHW1 had a huge pacing problem because there was no form of time-compression to harvest resources, leading to post-mission lulls lasting over 30 minutes at a time where all you're doing is waiting for utility ships to mine up the money.\nHW2 solved the problem by crediting you with the resources when a mission was completed, and its overall campaign pacing is much more intense and demanding, definitely welcome, than HW1.\n\nI wish Cataclysm was in the remaster pack, but apparently Gearbox couldn't secure the source code for the game.\n\nLastly, I haven't played multiplayer.","March 4, 2015","true","29.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'm not trying to compete with those, just expressing my personal feelings.\n\nFor those that haven't played HW1, just two words: go ahead. This won't disappoint, and you won't even notice the things us ♥♥♥♥♥♥s are unhappy about. For the likes of me, however, here's what to expect.\n\nFirst off, this is not Homeworld 1. Close, much closer than expected, but still no. All those tiny details will make you feel something isn't quite right, no matter how well or poorly you remember the original. The UI, of course, is probably the worst offender, feeling too modern, too... I just don't know the right words. I guess the UI aesthetics have changed greatly over time, and I am sad to see Gearbox going the HW2 route when it came to styling (hopefully, it's not as clunky as HW2 was, but the overall UI art is on the same track). But this is a minor issue, and once you get over it, you will notice it is quite playable. Make no mistake, the old one wasn't perfect either, it was just much more "in theme".\n\nNext thing you notice (unless, you crash on mission load as I did numerous times, in that case make sure you aren't overgenerous selecting texture quality), it looks gorgeous (albeit, a bit too "sleek" when compared to the first game. That is just a feeling, and it comes from the game defaulting to HW2 colour scheme, nothing else. Once you select original HW1 colours you're back with the old feel of "newbies to space". It is a great thing, really.\n\nThey did choose to port HW1 into HW2 engine, which made the game lose some of its original features, like simulated projectiles, and it fails miserably at holding formations, plus there are differences in resources available, ship costs, oh, and research now costs too. That all said, I am glad to say I didn't pick most of these things till I've been told about them. And, what's most important to me, the original feeling of being alone out there, a small island of life in the middle of cold indifferent space, it all has translated well into the remake.\n\nFurthermore, most of these changes weren't there to "make the game better", rather because the new engine wasn't capable of supporting these things (although, research costs seem like a strange thing, it's not that difficult to set cost to 0, while timers are all there already). And, while it may be a minor thing to some, fighters SHOULD cost 55, not 100.And assault frigates were at 625, unless I'm mistaken.\n\nOk, enough, I'm just being too picky. This is a fine remake, none the less. It actually tries hard to be as close to the original as possible (although, heaven knows, we'd love to see nothing but new textures here). It is far more honest to the original than X-COM was to its grandfather, X-COM: Enemy Unknown, the latter I'd call a major disappointment - you don't make an excellent game better by screwing with it. This one isn't screwed nearly as much.\n\nIn the end, is it worth playing? It sure is for me - I did try to replay the original again, but that game has aged visually far too much. There are two space games for me that define the 90's. MOO II and HW1. Sadly, 3D does age faster. Playing this doesn't make me cringe as bad, as trying the original would. And yes, it is an enjoyment. Maybe there is this uncanny valley for remakes as well, when the original and the remake are just too close to be called a different game, yet are still not 100% the same, and this would fall into it. But, again, HW:Rem is almost where the original is. X-COM was right in the middle of that abyss.\n\nBe a bit more open-minded about it, and you'll love it. Just don't forget you can't enter the same water twice.","March 8, 2015","true","9.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I was too young at the time to really decide what I wanted to play, and what I did play was mostly Starcraft: Brood War (Still in my top games of all time) or rummage through the bucket of Lego in my corner.  So when the news that Homeworld was getting a remaster… I didn’t really celebrate at all and I certainly did not pre-order out the door like I do for way too many games.  Though as the ball kept turning and the time of it’s release drew nearer and nearer I grew infatuated with Homeworld, it’s lore and story that drew me instantly into it, and the sheer scale and effort being put into a game that was cracking on by now.  So this Monday, which is Monday the 2nd of March (I am writing this review on the 7th, in the early hours) I bought it as soon as I could, and here is the result.\n\nHomeworld is now what I consider the best story told in gaming.\nOr at least up there with the greats, of course.\nThe way it was told to me, and how it slowly started to show me this lore that spanned back millions of years in the games universe, the different races and characters I met along the way all felt amazing and diverse, each one beautifully voice acted and all done with space ships on a screen.  There’s no portraits, we aren’t given a face, it’s voices we go on in this experience, and holy hell it knocks it out of the park with that regard.\nIt’s game play (While frustrating at times) is brilliant fun to toy with, there’s nothing more satisfying then launching a full Missile Destroyer attack on the unsuspecting foe below as your attack bombers soar in to deal the final blow, it’s god damned addicting and the fun just comes from finding the ways to out manoeuvre your enemies in the slyest of ways.\nAnd finally it’s the music, and how it complements each scene perfectly to the point I was left in awe at what was beset upon my eyes, to the point where this game brought me to tears with the myriad of feelings it produced.  Emotion is key with this tittle, and for the first time in a good long while I was feeling it while playing a game, the twinge of my heart as my favourite Frigate bit the dust, or the cut scenes I will not spoil.\nHomeworld is an experience for everyone, RTS and non RTS fan alike need to play this game and make it through to the end for the most satisfying ending in gaming.  This game gets my rating of ‘Bury it with me so I can take it to hell’","March 7, 2015","true","28.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I endured many losses, and more victories playing friends online. I once managed to steal an entire enemy players capital ship fleet with my own fleet of salvage corvettes and a cloaking frigate.

They didn't get that what made Homeworld great wasn't the beauty of the game (though it was spectacular visually), but rather the way everything functioned.\n\nIf you never played the original, you won't know what you are missing. You will probably enjoy the game just fine.  If you did, don't bother, this game will just make you sad. It will kill off part of your youth.\n\nP.S.

Indeed you improved greatly the graphics, but in exchange you broke the AI. Formation, for example, only work when the ships are standing, but at the first shot the ships start to doing whatever they want, and this will gonna ruin any tactic that you had planned. And there is the Repair Corvette, whose dream is to be a fighter at all cost, even you giving the guard command repeatedly.

It is impossible for anyone who played HW1 to not notice that these things are broken and any claim that they're working as intended, or that it doesn't negatively effect gameplay is patently false.\n\nListen, I'm not a purist but the developers had to of known this wasn't working correctly. Why they couldn't have been up front with people and say that there were certain things they couldn't port and let us decide whether or not we wanted to make the trade offs for the better graphics? Probably because they now have my 30 dollars and don't really give a crap.

Being a big fan of the RTS genre, when I heard about this game I immediately wanted to try it out, but alas, it was unavailable. So when I saw "Homeworld Remastered" on Steam's front page a few weeks ago it went straight to my wishlist, and I ended up buying it the day before release.\n\nI was concerned that I might have impulsively spent $30 on something that wasn't really worth it, but now I have no idea why.\n\nHaving played around 4 hours of this game over the two days since release, I've only gotten more endeared to the game and how epic it feels. Building a huge fleet of frigates, destroyers, and battlecruisers and then proceeding to wipe out some poor AI... Awesome.\n\nSome Quick Pros and Cons\nPROS:\n-- Phenomenal feel, moving ships around in 3D space doesn't feel confusing or difficult. While I have yet to employ it significantly, I'm sure it will make things quite interesting.\n-- AI is, for the most part, pretty smart. While it makes some dumb moves from time to time it doesn't give up unless all is lost.\n-- Oh my word, the visuals are incredible! Next time you have a large group of fighters engaging the enemy, select one of them, focus and zoom in. Large-scale, small-scale, everything looks beautiful, even on my puny GT 630.\n\nCONS:\n-- There's some minor bugs, like when moving ships I'll occasionally lose my mouse cursor for a second or two. Every so often the sound skips and repeats 1-2 second snippets of a clip.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n-- Gameplay moves a bit slower. It requires patience to build up a sizable attack force and deploy it to wipe out the enemy, but once that combat starts you really grasp the benefit of taking the time to work.\n\nI may expand on this review as I spend more time playing the game, but if you're still doubting whether you want to buy this, let me eliminate any doubt. The Homeworld Remastered Collection is an awesome piece of work. For $35, you get an incredible RTS, its sequel, and the remastered versions of both. Hopefully Gearbox will provide a demo at some point, but if you're a fan of the RTS genre, purchasing this shouldn't be a question.","February 26, 2015","true","8.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The new graphics are fantastic (when they aren't glitching out) but the game takes a step backwards in almost every other regard.\n\nFuel consumption is gone, which while convenient, almost entirely negates the necessity of support frigates and carriers. Fighter screens now break formation at the first sign of enemy contact, and tactical stances are seemingly nonexistent.\n\nSome aesthetic flourishes from the original have been removed, things only a vet would notice. Research stations no longer rotate idly. The game automatically collects all resources between missions, which bugs the heck out of me. One of my favorite atmospheric touches in the original was the time spent quietly and patiently gathering minerals after a fight. The sluggishness of this process gave you time to reflect on the story, made you admire the beautiful outer space vistas and felt like something a real life space commander would have to endure. It was cool. Now the game just slurps everything up after it's too late to make any use of it.\n\nThe song "Homeworld" by Yes has also been removed from the credits, due to legal reasons. Give me a break.\n\nWhat bothers me the most, however, is the complete removal of title cards for in-game speech. A nifty rectangular box with a character portrait used to pop up whenever someone talked to you. Now it's just a boring line of floating text.\n\nSome of the in-game triggers no longer function. In the last mission, Captain Elson never showed up with his relief fleet and I was left to attack the enemy flagship on my own.\n\nAnd before I forget: Every other time I played the game I'd be greeted with flickering textures or see-through ships. No matter how many graphical options I switched on or off, raised or lowered, nothing could be done. It was distracting. Unacceptable for a release priding itself on its updated graphics.\n\nLastly, the game just feels dumbed-down and generally easier.\n\nBasically, Gearbox just "upgraded" every design aspect of Homeworld 1 to that of Homeworld 2, a game which, despite the graphical overhall, inspired ship designs and stellar soundtrack, always failed to capture my imagination. The lack of manual Hyperspace is ultimately what killed it for me.\n\nPerhaps the most grievous sin in this "remaster" is the absense of the best game in the Homeworld series: Cataclysm. Yes, I understand they've "lost" the source code. How hard would it be to rip a copy off the disc and include it in the download? If you haven't played Cataclysm, you are missing out. It is one of the best real-time strategy games ever made, and probably the only title in the genre to fall under the unique label, "horror-RTS".\n\nIf you have never played a Homeworld game then this is a must buy, as classic versions of both 1 & 2 are included. If you were already a fan, like me, skip it or wait for a proper patch.","May 30","false","19.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

Sadly, the same cannot be said for its predecessor which undoubtedly will irk some diehard fans, including myself. Luckily, even with these changes both games are still a testament to the series’ quality whilst serving as a reminder that RTS titles can still provide deep, engaging experiences and having the originals included as a bonus further seals the deal."\n\nFull Review Here: http://www.tech-gaming.com/homeworld-remastered/","April 23, 2015","true","24.4"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","12","20","2","0"

It seems like gearbox has broken gameplay mechanics entirely in the remaster of HW1 because of the porting of engine to HW2 engine. Here are just a few of the issues:\n\n\n-The formations are wonky and don't work. You need formations to strike enemy ships effectively. In these games they just use their own flight patterns after they get close to enemy and don't stay in formation.\n-Game is not using balistic system of the original and instead uses rng, so there are too much hard counters to everything. It is not physics based.\n-Support frigates are useless unless you get them to follow around and make sure they are healing targets.\n-Capturing mechanics broken, it is too easy.\n-salvage corvettes easily capture enemy corvettes because evasion mechanics disabled(they are not part of the rng system)\n-Salvage ships not showing their beam animation\n-Why is queues limited to 2?\n-Collision system is broke, stuff like resource collecters and other ship crash into astroids or other objects and then attempt to push through them instead of moving back.\n-Some shortcuts do work but its inconsistent, like some keys open certain menus but don't close them when pressed again, while others close when pressed again. Its weird.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSeems I was wrong with some of the UI mechanics. You can highlight and then choose what ships to select, or you can double click a selected ship and it will highlight all similar ships nearby. You can also select military only ships to be highlighted.\n\nThis is a very good UI mechanic in the game, just wish they would explain in the tutorials.","February 26, 2015","false","32.6"," 132 of 253 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","132","253","5","7"

I love the games, and I was very happy when I heard about and purchased the re-released, updated version of HW1 & 2.\n\nHowever good they are, they are not without their fault, these faults only exist in the remastered versions however.\n\nThe graphics are very pretty indeed, a lot of time has clearly gone into redoing it all, I would say that it's a bit of a system hog, I've got a very good, top of the range gaming laptop and the fps dips horrendously if everything is maxed during a firefight - however it's still in Beta and I've no problem dropping my settings a little, and I'll gladly update this review once the game is no longer in the beta stage.\n\nStoryline hasn't changed, it could easily be made into a series or movie, that's how good it is.  Nor has the sound fx or music been amended, this isn't a bad thing as both capture the situations perfectly.  There are still a few bugs here, but again, it's Beta.\n\nThe single player campaigns are the same, 16 missions for each game, plus the beta multiplayer.  The whole game is still beta though really, lets not fool ourselves here.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the first is (was) more difficult and required more patience, finesse etc.  That feeling has gone and now the game feels somewhat dumbed down, the UI is simpler, easier, it's not something I approve of as previously in HW1 you were able to assign your ships different tactics, more power to engines or weapons at the cost of the other, or the middle ground.  On top of this you were also able to assign formations, these have gone, what remains is something that's an insult to previous games here.  I don't know why they didn't keep it because it brings in whole new dimensions, particulalry in multi player.  It is however the Beta and so perhaps they will re introduce them.  Whilst these things were only present in HW1, the sequal and the muiltiplayer would be vastly improved if included.  Yet are not, why Gearbox, WHY?\n\nThere are still balacing issues with the ships, for example in multiplayer you have the choice of either being Taiidan or Kushan from HW1, or Vagyr or Hiigarian from HW2.  There are pros and cons to each, but the latter 2 are more superior in the long run, and are easier for new players to get to grips with the game.  Whilst these ship balancing problems are by no means game breaking they are a little ridiculous.  For example the laser corvettes from the vagyr are specifically designed to destory frigates and capital ships, and they do this very well...the problem is that it's a little too well.  Whilst there are ships designed to destroy them, you can't help but feel there still many issues that need to be addressed.\n\nThe game may also crash if you click your mouse during the multplayer loading screen, post lobby.  I suppose that one is game breaking.  Just don't click and you'll be fine :)\nI'm sure Gearbox will fix the issues as they have made numerous improvements so far.  It's merely a question of when, not if.\n\nTo summerise, this is still a fantasic game the graphics are "ooohhh aaaaa" pretty, the ships are very detailed.  Graphics, sound fx, story, all very good.\n\nI'd happily give the original versions of hw1 & hw2 a 9/10....but these are not the originals.  Even if there were no bugs I'd still only give this game a solid 7.5/10.\n\nWhy?  The redesigned UI, I don't like it, they have thrown out a really important part of the game :(\n\nShould you buy this game?  Oh yes, but remember that there are numerous bugs that will likely ♥♥♥♥ you off, and the UI is still dumbed down to the point that my cat could quite easily give you a half decent game.\n\nOnce the game is no longer in Beta I will rereview.\n\nCheers.","March 30, 2015","true","152.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

There's been a long standing criticism that the game's "rock, paper, scissors" gameplay, where everything has a counter. It appears some people are pretty irritated about that. Well, here's the thing: that's warfare. Look at modern militaries today. Everything has a counter. Infantry carry shoulder fired missile systems to destroy vehicles and hard points to remove those threats. Tanks carry both AP and HE rounds to deal with infantry and vehicles. Aircraft can be shot down like nothing by guided missile and surface to air missile systems. Everything has a counter. The game's system for units is actually the more realistic one, believe it or not. So, I don't understand the gripes about it. Just make sure you've got solid recon and you're fine. It's important to note though that even modern militaries have combined arms forces, so don't think that just because you've got the counter to something that you won't get your ♥♥♥ kicked. A well rounded, combined arms force, regardless of its composition, is still a big part of your overall fleet strategy. The next thing I want to address is a big gripe I've seen about fighter strategies. With the hindrance given to fighters in the remastered edition, interceptors no longer play a large role in the battle. They're weaker, and that's also realistic. One thing that should be understood is that air superiority and interceptor aircraft are made for a single purpose: to fight other aircraft. Unless a large ship has no support, there's really no reason why you should be using interceptors to attack a large vessel. The fact of the matter is that you're not going to make a dent in the hull of a ship with a massive superstructure, and a hull designed to both take weapons fire and the force of gravity, in the vacuum of space where a hull breach vents an entire compartment, and possibly an explosive decompression. It just isn't logical to believe that you can make that happen. Historically, the Japanese in world war 2 would run suicide kamikaze attack against a large ship, because that's really the only way a fighter can cause a severe amount of damage against something that big, unless it's carrying bombs. The same goes for any unit in the game, where every unit has a purpose, be it specialized attacks against certain kinds of unit or support for the important vessels in your fleet. But, I digress.\n\nIf you're looking for a deeply strategic and tactical space simulation with an excellent storyline and back story (seriously, it's fantastic!), then you've come to the right place. With mods being ported over to the Remastered collection, you won't have to wait long for your replay ability value to skyrocket. It's even better that, as I write this review, the game is discounted for the winter sales. You should already have this game in your steam library. As far as I'm concerned, it's blown games like Sins of a Solar Empire off the planet.","December 28, 2015","true","14.3"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","2"

(????)\n\n-Captured ships change or dont change colour(??)and it seems some change stats too. for example black ion cannon frigates after hyperspacing they change colour and stats.(woo)\n\n-Some captured ships (or most) cannot be retired before hyperspacing to next level.(so you have to scuttle them if you dont want horde of crap thrown at you on the next level)\n\n-some scripted scenes decided not to show up(???)\n\n-after cancelling hyperspace jump you cannot access sensors manager.\n\n-junkyard dog is bugged out totally(for example destroy the hyperspace gate where it is going to jump it will roll around aimlessly around non-existing gate)+ you cannot attack it when it has captured any of your capital ships except with fighters and corvettes.\n\n-invisible harvestable metal scrap\n\n-Autolaunch during beginning of every level(?)\n\n- research ship sometimes gets weird and goes to pieces in the middle of the level (like half of it docks with mothership and other half dont)\n\n-Docking issues with strikecraft during movement with carriers for example\n\n-NO TAIDAAN CAMPAIGN why?\n\nI really feel like devs could had done much better work with this franchise improving gameplay mechanics and overall enjoyment/replayability level of the game.To me this feels like they just tried to port hw1 to hw2 engine slap new UI over it and voila + the visuals ofc, but i gotta say game looks beautiful and sounds too but i feel i have much less now than with the original.\n\nNo taidaan campaign was a big blow to me because i enjoyed the idea of playing both races and still no timewarp, even cataclysm had it. this is not a difficult game thanks to the HW2 style fleetsize based enemy force size manager.gameplay wise i dont think devs did anything to improve or add to the game, i wish i could`ve capture raider carrier but no or to find easter eggs i havent found before or to have something expanded to me what was not propably in the original game.\n\nthis should have been called homeworld 2 remastered + homeworld 1 mod.\n\nremastered should be superior compared against original, this is not the deal here.\n\nDevs propably are not going to fix these issues.\nnote to devs:do not try to do a remaster if you cant do it correctly.","March 12, 2015","false","33.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

However! There are a few bugs or irritations (namely 2 during my playthrough) that should be prioritized for a fix above all else if I'm to call it the "closest to perfect" remaster and that is to recalibrate the formations so that they actually have a meaning in the game. There have been so many instances (practically the whole game) where formations didn't decide the flow of battle. The units just scattered in combat and thus left a lot of undeserved casualties.\nThe second thing to fix is the AI for the harvesters. In the original you could send them out to do their business and wouldn't need to worry about them unless being attacked. But after finishing the first nebula mission and sending them to harvest the rest of the area, they went out, took care of one vein and then just went stationary like there wasn't any resources left (but of course there still were). So I had to manually send them to another vein and have them continue.\nThese need to be fixed if it is to be remembered fully to the original. Many things have been done great but there are still a few things that just ruin the game for me.\n\nOverall it is of course a beautiful remaster of the game and the graphics are set on. Just needs a bit of fixing but since it just released I can definitely give the developers some time.","February 27, 2015","true","20.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Well:\n\n-One or two tech hiccups, in particular a CTD graphics bug which, for me at least, was solved by turning off shadows, not a huge sacrifice, especially in space, but a little annoying.\n\n-I have heard of other bugs, though have experienced none of them myself, but so far my game time is limited to the campaign and skirmish.\n\n-You also have to create a third-party account for multiplayer - painless and quick, but you have been warned.\n\nConclusion? All in all 100% solid gold angel-moon cheese! A certain buy for any long term fan of the series, and VERY highly recommended for any fan of RTSs in general wanting a breath of old (but ironically, very fresh) air!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mister_4_Eyes/recommended/244160/","Mister_4_Eyes","Mister 4 Eyes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mister_4_Eyes/","82 products in account","This collection is amazing. First about the collection itself, the collection has a whole bunch of content that at the time of writing I haven't even got to yet. Not only do they have the original homeworld 1 and 2, but also the re-mastered version which clearly had a lot of love put into them.\n\nNow, I know some people will call this blasphemous, but I haven't played the original versions, and I'll give a review for each game in the collection. There may be changes in the originals and remasters like the UI and apparently some unit balancing issues? Again, the changes seem small and don't seem to impact the gameplay for the casual or moderate homeworld fan.\nAnyway, onto the review, I'll go in order of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 had to be cut short due to me running out of characters. [grumble grumble]\n\n\nHomeworld was an amazing experience to go through, and gave me a feeling a game hasn't given me in awhile. This is a sense of mystery and the feeling of being a small speck in the midst of outer space. An insignificant spec, just managing to survive. But as you go along, the largest foe opposing you who seem like an unstoppable force that will wipe you out in the blink of an eye. But you just bite at the small, weak appendages of this large creature until you (hopefully) become large enough to stand a chance.\n\nBut as the game goes along, and you realise you're hatred of this foe is not alone, you end up becoming stronger, as you gain more and more victories, and you become something greater than what you started, you don't feel weak against your foe, you end up feeling like you can just make it.\n\nNow, for the gameplay of the game, the gameplay is very strategic, much more strategic than what I was expecting. You can't just throw your mighty battleships at the enemy and expect to win, because since you may of destroyed their first offensive, you're heavily crippled, and it just so happens that there are, admittedly smaller, but far scarier foes awaiting just outside the range of your sensors, and they are hungry. I find myself later in the game attempting to break off their fleet in chasing something small, but leading them where my ships lay, and I have the advantage by planning the whole thing in advance. Your experience might be different but I had a blast.\n\nNow for some memorable moments from my playthrough of the game, some spoilers.\n\nThe first moment I can think of is the first attack on the foe (completely forgot their name, some federation). When we warp in, my battle relay guy(?) notifies me that the hostile fleet is right ahead. Here, I'm a bit scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because I saw what they can do, and even though its weakened, they still have a substantial fleet. He gave the order to exterminate the fleet. At this moment of time, I still see that fleat as an unstoppable force, and they had battlecruisers and I didn't. Did I mention I was scared? Anyway, I mass produced these vehicle extraction units (forgot the name) which basically steals ships in hopes of capturing one of the ships. However, it turned out that I overestimated the foe (which is what I always do, it's better to overestimate and crush your foe with overwhelming force them to not be prepared for a superior force) and I ended up destroying most of their ships, except for one. I then got this evil grin on my face as this carrier was trying to escape from me, I ordered my ships to shoot out the engines, and I sent in the extractors. I ended up stealing their carrier as a trophy, a claim of "I annihilated your force and now I'm using your ship against you" sort of fashion. That ship eventually became invaluable to the fleet, acting as a medical station for the smaller ships and as a transport bay for them as well. Protection from attack.\n\nThe second moment I'll share is this moment when you enter a nebula and there is deadly radiation flooding the area. You had to plan your moves carefully to not have your ship's be dissolved in the radiation (a bit unrealistic but it's a videogame so I'll let it slide) I'm moving through this cloud and I spot a minelayer. This is the first one I encountered one, I quickly destroy it and think to myself, "Job well done, no mines! Onwards to glory!" but a little bit later, I found the mine field it set up, it crippled some of my most powerful ships, and when I'm getting my repair frigates ready, I spot 2 destroyers peek out from the nebula. At this point in time, I had about 3 destroyers, the carrier (the one I stole earlier) and a fleet of frigates. "Piece of cake" I thought to myself. Bad mistake, because with them, they had missile frigates that were staying JUST out of sight, but firing on my ships nonetheless. And whatever the hell that destroyer was made from, my whole fleet of 25 ish ships was completely and utterly obliterated by 5 ships and a few mines. Then I started planning out my path for the target, and I had an escort, and everything, finding small bands of these ships and crushing them under suprise.\n\nThe third, and final moment I can share is the junkyard. During this level, you enter a creepy junkyard, with a bunch of gun platforms dotting the place, protecting...something...still don't know what it was. No biggy I thought, but something didn't feel right, so I sent my capital ships in with caution, and to obliterate the gun platform obviously. But after I sent them out, I started doing some micromanaging at base, when I heard "one of your ships have gone missing". "What do you mean, 'one of your ships have gone missing'? How the hell can you lose a capital ship?" I'm thinking to myself. then I look over, and I see the missing ship warp back into view, but it was hostile. I had no idea what was going on until I saw this one small-ish ship coming in, only known as the Junkyard Dog, and it was barreling straight for one of the capital ships. The it just snatches it and warped out at a becon. I was stunned, but also very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ so I restarted the level. After about 3 ish restarts, I got very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at this dog and after my attempts of sending small ships through the junkyard failed miserably, I got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and made ships that could freeze it. I had like 5 of them, so the dog couldn't escape. I had my whole fleet waiting nervously for any signs of the dog. And when my guard was low, it came within 1 km from one of my ships! I know, 1 kilometer seems far, but remember, these ships are several kilometers in length so that was WAY too close for comfort. I froze it and with all the might of my fleet, and about 10 minutes of continuous fire from all ships, I finally killed the dog. I was never so happy to kill a dog until now.\n\n\nAfter all the praise I gave for homeworld, you would think I would give homeworld 2 as much praise, but to be honest, it was a bit disappointing. I feel the collection is worth it for homeworld alone. So just buy it, and if you want to play homeworld 2, just do it. It's still enjoyable in a morbid way.\n\nSadly, steam won't let me finish the review, because I have a lot of worlds for homeworld 2 that's not exactly flattering. But again, just buy it and see it for yourself. You have nothing to lose (Except for possibly your time) so just do whatever you feel is best.","May 26","true","27.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've certainly missed capturing enemy frigates and destroyers with salvagers haha.\n\nDefinitely a game I would recommend: A great sci-fi RTS that challenges the player and brings an awesome level of space conflict and resource acquirement.","March 8, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

We just get 1 great remake with stunning graphic instead of two (and a good reason to complete the second part of the game for the ones who was disappointed in it after glorius original).

This is a no-no of the highest order in an RTS. The good news is that this is not an RTS that really relies heavily on your APM. but mouse accuracy is pretty high up there, especially if you are zoomed out to control the battlefield.\n- Going to black screen somewhat randomly during the campaign is hard to fathom - but based on it's behaviour with a dual monitor set up, I wouldn't be surprised if they are related.\n- Speaking of dual monitor, it has some very odd behaviour related to the mouse to pan and dual screen set up. I generally don't mouse pan the camera due to a Starcraft background, but it is a bit disconcerting to nudge the screen in one situation, then have the mouse leap off the game completely in another situation with no clear reason why.\n- Finally, and much like mouse input lag, a fairly unforgivable issue for an RTS player - inexplicable freezing. This is a very intermittant, seems not to impact the Frame rate which can get up to 260 if you let it, and stutters the game. The game doesn't ask all that much of the system resources that I could tell. GTX 970 with a processor that chilled right around 30% with some other software doing it's stuff... so I really can't explain the freezing.\n\nOn a non-bug topic, I find the tutorial to be woefully weak, leaving out some really pretty key fundamentals of the game - like the importance of some of the utility ships.\n\nSo not perfect, and needs to pretty significant patching and updating to get some of these fairly regrettable bugs handled.\n\nThat all out the way...\n\nThe remastering of this game is a rare case where the term remastered actually applies. The audio (which is original) has been significantly cleaned up, and the graphical overhaul is... remarkable.\n\nAdditionally, some advancements between 1 and 2 were retroactively added to 1, including some of the significant UI improvements. Some old-time players will feel this is a detriment to the game, but I think first time players of the game will certainly appreciate the changes.\n\nThe campaign is very good - but I have not played through enough of the campaign to offer thoughts on any changes they have made the story, so I assume there aren't too many, so I feel safe saying... the campaign is very good.\n\nThe game difficulty varies, during the campaign, between easy enough, and well... not easy at all. You will find the instructions for some of the objectives are a touch vague (see the point earlier about the tutorial deficiencies and say ... salvaging a larger ship), but the pace of the game is not such that you can't figure out most everything on the fly.\n\nThere is, as I recall, some level of dynamic difficulty added - so that you can't build up a powerful fleet before the mission starts.\n\nThe game is lacking it's multiplayer in any real way right now - though its in beta for a steam implementation.\n\nAll in all, a pretty stunning "remaster" of what is still a top notch RTS  that I do recommend, but offer a few caveats.\n\n1) If you are a big fan of the homeworld series, be ready for changes in the remaster you may not entirely appreciate - but you do get a digital version of the originals so that's probably worth the cash right there.\n2) If you don't want to deal with the bugs, wait for some patches before you buy\n3) It is a remaster - so some old school game design elements are clearly in force, if you are looking for a slick reimagining of the RTS genre with a sci fi theme and new UI and design innovations, check out Grey Goo instead.\n\ntwitch.tv/sanlumiere","March 1, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gearbox didn't want to reimagine the game or reinvent it, they got the old developers back together and remade the game in all its glory. Hell if you don't want to play the remastered versions you even get the old classic versions  that have been updated to work on modern OS's.\n\nThe new interface is a huge improvement and the game itself has been refined to work smoothly and painlessly. The multiplayer is still in beta but to be honest, if you buy this for the multiplayer you are going to be dissapointed, the core feature of the Homeworld series has always been about the story, the story of the Hiigarans.\n\nThis game isn't just a remaster, this is the revival of a series, and it is very clear the developers didn't just want to create something the fans would love, but something they would also love, this game is a love letter to the fans to say thanks for the support.\n\nAlso the mods are pretty great.","March 1, 2015","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Onto what you all want to hear however, how does it play? Well then lets break this beast down.\n\nAge:\nWell lets face facts, homeworld one came out in the summer of 1999, and its sequel came out in the fall of 2003, so having said that, I bought both of these bad boys when they came out. I was so very young, and I was into all sorts of RTS games at the time. Command and Conquer, Starcraft, Warcraft, Red Alert, and Tiberian Sun, so I loved all RTS. To that point, this game destroyed all of them.\n\nGameplay:\nWell since Gearbox was so very forward thinking, this game comes with a pretty awesome multiplayer, however its still in beta, and there are still some persistant glitches here and there. The campaign on the other hand is a differnet matter, long gone is the ability to choose between the Kushaan and the Tidann when starting the campaigns, you can only play the Kushaan (the mother ship race that is pictured on the box). While this is not a big thing, I was more of a fan of the Tidann mothership as well as the look of their fighters, however this is a small gripe. This game suffers from most RTS problems about missions, the curse of variety. What I mean by that is the pure fact that not ever mission is going to be, "Warp in, look around, fight baddies, then warp to the next mission." Some missions have you doing different things, and some of these things tend to slow the pacing down just a little bit. This is the only complaint, this game has brought me to tears many times as a child, the music, the atomsphere, everything is just spot on.\n\nGraphics:\nThe first game looked amazing back in the day, this time around it just looks eye bleeding amazing, I could not ask for anything more. Also the cutscenes are still pretty awesome, and now that they are redone with some glorious 1080p resolution, they look even better. Think of the cutscenes like reading and animated comic book, if that sounds confusing then you will understand when you play the game.\n\nControls:\nThese controls are a little different than your standard RTS game, since you can move in three planes it makes controlling a bit different. Using the mouse works well, but to move freely you need to use the keyboard as well. It does take a little time to get the hang of things, but a pro vs a novice will only be able to look and move things faster in the end, it will not make or break gameplay.\n\nOverall: 10/10\nIf you are a fan of RTS games then this thing should be in your cart before you finish reading my review, its such fun to play, and not to mention the pacing of multiplayer is both laid back and pure tense action. Get it, love it, and just enjoy the sin out of it.","March 7, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Given this is a space game you actually get a tactical advantage from attacking enemy ships from the top of bottom, so it added literally another dimension to the RTS genre.\n\nAnother great feature of the game is you dont build a base, but maintained a fleet (think Battlestar Galactica), that fleet stays with you throughout the game. You have the mother ship that acts as production facility and when that is lost, its game over, all other ships can just be produced and captured. It adds a lot to the story.\n\nAnd the story that was told is great, for those of you who have never played it, i wont spoil it, but the story itself is kind of standard, but because you are with traveling with your fleet, you feel more connected to the story!\n\nAnd the best part is, that was how i remember it, and it all still holds true!! and now it looks great also.\n\nSo i do recommend this game if you are into RTS games or really atmospheric games!","February 28, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only has this game sent me back to my own youth but its also rekindled an unhealthy relationship with the game series that I spent most of my teens playing, mainly when I should have been doing my homework!\n\nHomeworld Remastered beings homeworld 1 and homeworld 2 into today with vastly improved graphics and a remastered audio track. The look and feel of the game is very similar to homeworld 2 as both the remastered games use an upgraded version of the HW2 game engine but with upgrades to improve the look.\nNeither game however have lost anything but only gained. Infact homeworld 1 now plays with the options you had in homeworld 2.\n\nHomeworld 1 remastered even let you build in single units rather than small groups of fighters as you do in 2.\n\nThe campaigns are better than ever with the storyline not changed, the increasingly difficult missions of HW1 gets transfered over in homeworld remastered nicely.\nThe player vs CPU, or skirmish mode has a stange feel to it, but has been upgraded to feature some new modes including tasks such as harvest x resources for a bonus; and crates. However the best feature allows you to pit HW1 factions against HW2. Although in BETA at the time of writing this review, the multiplayer mode shows some promise.\n\nI do feel that the pitting of sides from HW1 and HW2 against eachother is a nice feature, it does need some ironing out. So far the HW2 sides seem to have the edge on the HW1 sides. It would be nice to see some new features other than game modes. Maybe some more maps, special units for skirmish, maybe even a turanic raiders or kadeshi faction to play in skirmish/multiplayer.\n\nNot only do you get the remastered games, the classic versions are also here too for that ultimate look back.\n\nI do have to admit though, it was nice to play the entire game in a few days and it took me back a fair few years. I can highly recommend. If you loved the classic games back in the day, then remastered is for you.","March 2, 2015","true","54.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At one point I had nearly 70,000! In the original HW1 you really had to scavenge resources and salvage enemies whenever possible just to beat the game. Now resources are so abundant that later levels can be beat just by kamikazing your strike craft into enemies and building more (lol).\n\nAlso, the ship AI often acts kind of autastic, and they never stay in formation.\n\nStill recommend though, 2 really good games (and multiplayer which people are actually playing) in one.

I have all of these games and the missing cataclysm game. I bought this off the shelf originally before it became GOTY in 1999. I played this until the game disk broke in a move 5 years ago. It’s my all-time favorite game.  I have been a fan since the first time I played the single player campaign.\nWhat makes this special? Why should I buy this RTS? If you like RTS games, and enjoy a challenge this is the game for you.\n\nThis stands alone in the RTS world for many reasons. The 3D combat is truly 3D unlike other 3d perspective RTS games.  Persistence of units in the single player campaign is another major change to other RTS games that I have never seen. If you lose a unit in one mission it is gone forever. If you build a new ship of any kind it will follow you to the next mission as long as you can keep it alive. I have never seen this in any other RTS game like this. The economy side is a little simplistic but I personally don’t think it detracts from the game.  This is a 16 year old and 11 year old game, but it’s one of the best games I’ve ever played. Well worth the cost.\n\nThe atmosphere is second to none in the original. I enjoy the story in both, but the story is a little weak in the second game. The re-master is beautiful.

Everything from level of detail on ships, to gameplay, to mod support, and optimization are excellent.\n\nNow, I have a terrible gaming setup, a ATI Radeon 4350 graphics card with a AMD Phenom x4 910 processor. For those of you who don't speak computer hardware, this is a low end PC from back in like 2008. A piece of junk. Homeworld 2 ran great on it, and much to my surprise, so does the remastered edition. I have yet to see any serious frame issues despite playing it on a PC that is almost worth more as scrap metal than as a trade in. Granted, this is with most of the graphical settings turned low or off, but this just goes to show that you don't even need a decent computer to run the game.\n\nBut for those of you who haven't played Homeworld, here’s a little about the remastered edition of the game:\n\nIts space RTS involving 4 races with up to 8 players. Each faction gets 4 different classes of units: Fighters, Corvettes, Frigates and Capital Ships with quite a few other utility class units. There are 2 Races from Homeworld 2, and 2 from the original Homeworld. There are significant differences between both generations, which is kind of interesting, especially when you consider the fact that both games are so fundamentally different, that they basically are incompatible with each other without serious modifications. Because of this, the devs, being so considerate of the loyal fan base, even decided to throw in the original "untouched" versions of both Homeworld 1 AND Homeworld 2, which is absolutely amazing when you consider the fact that Homeworld 1 is so old that you can't even run it on most systems.\n\nAll in all, if you are a Homeworld fan, this buy is a no brainer. If you aren't a Homeworld fan, you're getting 2 fully retextured, rebalanced, beautiful and tactical RTS games with their original untouched (and now playable on your PC) versions.

Now I'm wishing I had.  Being that I never played the original, I don't have some of the complaints that the veterans do with the changes made due to importing HW1 into the HW2 engine.  I understand why they did it and it doesn't bother me.  It shouldn't bother you either.  The game is a blast to play, the storytelling is amazing and it really looks and sounds beautiful.  Yes, there are bugs at the moment (release week) but Gearbox has said on their forums they are collecting feedback for future patches to address many of the issues the veterans have (if possible within the constraints of the engine) and should have the first bug patch ready less than a week after launch.  So long as Gearbox lives up to that, everyone should be happy.  Is it worth $35?  If you like space RTS games (of which there are pitiful few available) then yes.  If you liked Sins of a Solar Empire but wanted a campaign for it, then this is what you've always dreamed of.

Homeworld played like many other RTS games at the time: you'll command your star fleet, harvest resources, research technologies to build more ships, and attack other enemy fleets. However, in Homeworld, the game took place entirely in three-dimensional space, resulting in units not just moving horizontally, but also vertically, adding an extra tactical layer to the combat. Watching the combat between large groups of spaceships flying around each other was a sight to behold back then and now it looks even more amazing in the Remastered Collection. Gearbox has updated the visuals to modern standards and ships now have an incredible amount of detail. Even with the enhanced graphics, the game still manages to not be too demanding on hardware and it runs smoothly without any major stability issues. The user interface has also been updated for both games and it feels cleaner and more usable now. They even remastered the audio and the cutscenes with voice overs and music sounding much clearer and the animations looking more high-definition. The entire package isn't without its faults, however.\n\nThe remastered version of Homeworld 1 feels like it was ported over to the enhanced Homeworld 2 engine without properly adjusting and balancing the campaign for it. Ships won't stay in formation when attacking (might be just a bug for now), researching technologies costs resource units now, some prices for constructing ships have changed,  ship AI behavior seems to glitch out at times, and other minor differences. Worst of all, the remastered campaign seems to have borrowed the auto-balancing difficulty from the Homeworld 2 campaign. This might result in frustratingly difficult situations in some missions if you did too well in the last mission. Still, none of this is game-breaking and some might still enjoy the game and only have a few problems with it (especially those who have never played the game in the first place). All of this is sure to annoy veteran Homeworld players and hopefully Gearbox can fix some of it soon. At least the package inculdes the original "Classic" version of Homeworld 1 which is still very playable and fun by today's standards, even with the dated visuals.\n\nHomeworld 2 Remastered seems to be pretty well intact, but that's not really a surprise given the fact that it's running on an enhanced version of the same engine. You can play the "classic" version of Homeworld 2 if you want, but considering the remastered version is the exact same game with better graphics and presentation, there's not much of a reason to go back now (except for some Skirmish mode differences).  It's pretty much there for preservation and it's still a nice thing to have in the package.\n\nWhich Brings me to the multiplayer mode. It's a good thing the multiplayer still has a "BETA" label attached to it because it does feel a bit unfinished. The multiplayer suite for the Remastered Collection is a mixture of the multiplayer modes from Homeworld 1 and 2. You can pit the two Homeworld 1 factions against the two Homeworld 2 factions now, but this results in some balance issues. The HW1 factions are underpowered compared to the HW2 factions right now and the game feels more like HW2 multiplayer with HW1 factions patched in rather than a true mix of the two games. For right now, just use HW2 factions until Gearbox decides to fix the balance issues.\n\nDespite some blemishes in the Homeworld 1 Remastered campaign and the multiplayer mode, I'd still recommend the Remastered Collection simply because there's nothing quite like Homeworld on the market right now and it's the first time the series has been on a digital platform. The gameplay still holds up very well to this day and the storylines for both games are still just as good as they once were. I'd even say this package is worth it just for Homeworld 1 Classic and Homeworld 2 Remastered alone. If you've never experienced either game and you have an interest in story-driven RTS games or massive space battles in general, you owe it to yourself to play Homeworld.","February 27, 2015","true","39.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But for now:\n\ntl;dr: If you enjoy RTS games, games set in space, or amazing science fiction storylines (especially space operas), buy this. Buy it so hard. You will thank me.\n\nHomeworld as a series has always been both thematically and mechanically beautiful-- I remember being in a trance watching the gameplay at a friend's house in 1999. From the agile and sleek scout ship to the mile-high Pride of Hiigara, no detail was spared. Combat was believably realistic and yet maintained a magical feeling of watching a high-tech waltz of destruction. Massive capital ships ran broadsides against each other while strike fighters battled in furballs. Flak exploded, plasma lanced, and ions beams sliced through space leaving a hot afterlight in your vision. It was everything I'd dreamed about for space battles, and Homeworld delivered above and beyond.\n\nThe story is nothing short of masterful. Narration both actively and passively help to build a universe where you truly feel for the people you are guiding. You feel their motivation, their need to complete their mission, and it is hard to pull yourself away from the game-- an active effort is required.\n\nThe Remastered collection is superb. Clearly, heart, soul, blood and tears went into the production, and it shows. You know how your mind's eye for the first games that you played always sharpened and enhanced as time went on? The story and graphics that you saw in your thoughts, instead of what was on screen? Remastered takes it from your head and puts it on screen. It looks, feels, and plays that well. This is what "HD Remakes" should consider the master model, the bar to reach for. But man, they're going to have a really, REALLY tough time grasping it at the height Gearbox/Blackbird hung it at.\n\nThere are a few gripes, albeit extremely minor-- the new UI is a bit goofy, and balance in the extremely clearly Beta multiplayer is totally nonexistent. But these are vices that are both fixable and forgivable, especially in the light of what I personally feel is one of the best games to be published, ever.\n\nHomeworld is a bona fide classic. Homeworld 2, although slightly weaker in storyline, is a great follow-up. The Remastered pack is without a doubt a top tier, GOTY candidate work. If any of these words even remotely stuck with you, buy the game. Gearbox and Blackbird deserve every cent they get.","February 27, 2015","true","40.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Overall, this Remaster does get my thumbs up BUT in its current state there are still PLENTY of problems that need to be addressed (and therefore mentioned). I would also ask that you ignore my “play time” because sadly on my older laptop I have not been able to get Homeworld working properly, but my brother has (for the entire night in a span of about 10 hours) generously let me play on his account.\n\nNow, let’s begin…\n\nThe Homeworld Experience for the new:\n\nHomeworld is a 3D RTS type game that is done in real time and on xyz grids that allow full 3D gameplay (in comparison to 2D xy grid games such as Starcraft or Command and Conquer). If you are a fan of RTS games, be it the two games I have mentioned or Sins of a Solar Empire, you should definitely try this game. In this game, you start off with your “mother ship” and resource collectors, and your goal is to mine resources and research new ship types, and then build those ships to make fleets and then blow up your opponent. During this process, your enemy(s) will be doing the same thing, and there are even possible side objectives or challenges that can be undertaken to gain more resources to help further your cause. In the original games, there were already hundreds of different strategies utilized in multiplayer, but with these new side objectives and challenges it allows for even further diversity.\n\nFactions are also extremely interesting to note: you have the factions from both original games, Homeworld 1 and 2, merged together in the same multiplayer experience. They are, to my surprise, actually quite balanced in gameplay. The game has really brought out the “rock paper scissors” aspect of what this game was originally about, but now with all 4 of the factions present there is a lot to take in and know what counters what, it can be a bit of a learning curve to memorize it all. This, in turn, adds to the diversity of strategy and player style you will see done by the AI and (especially) other human players.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the campaigns. Two 16 mission journeys that put you through breath taking scenarios, all about a race of Humanoids that must make the journey back to their ancient home (Homeworld 1) and then defend it (Homeworld 2). Each campaign mission isn’t your standard “here you are, go blow up that person” and offer varieties of gameplay, such as in Homeworld 1 there is a mission where you can only use strike craft to complete your objective, or you have three minutes to destroy a massive ship that will ram right into your mothership if it is not taken out. Homeworld 2 offers the same mission diversity, and even gives you unique ships to fight and use throughout the campaign.  On top of that, the research method through both campaigns makes ships limited to specific types as you unlock more and more by progressing through the campaign, which allows players to get used to every single ship type and see their strengths and weaknesses, making the campaign not only fun and interesting, but all in all can be boiled down to a giant tutorial of how every single thing in Homeworld works.\n\nOn a final note, if you ever get bored with the remastered game, I highly recommend playing Homeworld 1 Classic, it features the original UI and game mechanics such as no unit cap in games that can be very fun to experiment with.\n\nSeriously, if you Love RTS or space games and have not picked this title up yet, I seriously recommend you do so. It isn’t perfect, but I assure you that you are not only getting what your money ‘s worth but also are going to really enjoy it!\n\nFrom the eyes of a Homeworld 1 Vet:\n\nThis section of the review focuses on the negative aspects and what has “survived” from the homeworld 1 game.\n\nI think the biggest thing that irks me about the remastered Homeworld 1 is that they moved it to the Homeworld 2 user interface and model. In doing so they had to can a lot of Homeworld 1’s key features that made it stand out from its 2nd game, and now everyone I have talked to who preferred 1 over 2 has agreed with me that Homeworld 1 remastered just seems to be a decently gone mod for Homeworld 2.\n\nThe following is a list of features that are not in the remastered from Homeworld 1:\n\n-Refueling: your strike craft can go anywhere infinitely without being tethered to anything, allowing them to operate in the game independently and much more of a threat to areas such as your resource operation.\n\n-Harvesting:  in the first game, your harvesters flew around the asteroid and made them shrink as they collected resources (as well as dust clouds could be harvested). Here in remastered, they must dock with the asteroid to extract resources because of HW2’s\n\n-Repair: ships have to dock with other ships to repair them. While this isn’t a change for strike craft, frigates, capital ships, and resource collectors could be repaired at a range in Homeworld 1\n\n-The unit cap can’t be turned off in Multiplayer. This takes out a big chunk of what made some of the craziest HW battles that crazy (we’re talking hundreds of strike craft per person duking it out for superiority in a 6 person game)\n\nAlso, formations are a little annoying, and if you don’t believe me, I want you to go onto Homeworld 1 classic, build 9 ships, and put them into wall formation. You’ll get a nice 3x3 2d wall of the ships in a nice and orderly fashion. Do the same in HW1 remastered and you’ll get this weird cross thing with random gaps, and adding more ships to it just seems to make the cross bigger. Tactics are also screwed up with formations, and ships in specific tactics won’t always behave the same in formations the same ways that you might remember it from the Classic game. There is a new learning curve here (or bugs) that do need some attention whether you like it or not. Ships also have a tendency to partially break formation while moving (especially sphere), and on a small side note, sphere formationing ships and telling them to guard something won’t automatically make them form a sphere around the guarded ship. Again, this creates a small learning curve for the vets.\n\nAnd we will complain about it, but it’s Homeworld, and we will still play it and eventually get used to it.\n\n\n(more on the way)","February 26, 2015","true","36.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The controls are the clumsiest ever, the whole game is buggy as hell (hey, try to reassign movent control keys..), and in the campaign I really did not get any feeling of a tactical gameplay. Since formations are broken, since the movement of squads and their behavior is neither well-controllable nor has any intelligent automatism, the whole tactic decisions come down to "the-more-the-better". In a battle you are often required to do sort of micromanagement with your fleet of fast-flying, hardly clickable ships, to tell them one-by one that they have to repair another ship, or have to do a special attack etc. Maybe I missed something, didn't play too long, but support-frigates that don't give any support/repair to the dozens of small crafts flying around them, without clicking each single one in action? Formations, the lowest, most basic tactical setting, simply do not work? And Gearbox talked themselves out of doing anything about that? I doubt I will buy any further Gearbox game next future..

They ported the HW2 engine onto the HW1 which seems to have messed with certain HW1 game mechanics.  However, Gearbox is addressing these issues.\n\nI have had a lot of fun playing the multiplayer.  It pits the HW1 races against the HW2 races, but because of the engine porting, there are definite balance issues if you play as a HW1 race.  To avoid this, I just play as HW2 for now, which as a die-hard HW fan, is still pretty amazing.\n\nGearbox is invested in this series, so we should expect continued support and updates from them. They released a critical fix update just a week after release.  There are definite improvements that need to be made and since the development team is looking at this series with such dedication and love, I can only see good things coming.\n\nAnother bright spot, lots and lots of mod support.  This is where the series will also shine.  Considering there was very little mod support for the originals and such great mods were released anyway, one can only imagine the amazing work the modding community will put out.\n\nIt's a niche game still and not many will like the RTS style, but I like that about it. In my option, it attracts a certain higher caliber of gamer.","March 12, 2015","true","988.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chuiu/recommended/244160/","chuiu","chuiu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chuiu/","562 products in account","Overall this remaster is great and definitely worth buying if you like RTS games.  I rank it my 2nd favorite RTS of all time behind the original Starcraft and its expansion.  Heres my review of it:\n\nThe good:\nThe art is amazing.  The remastered textures, sounds, music, and models are all more than I had hoped for.  The new visual effects make the game as impressive today as it was when it was first released (the HW1 graphics were amazing for when it came out in 99).  Playing through the story is as fun and enjoyable as I remember it being.  I'll be spending a lot more time playing this for the next few weeks.  I like how my capital ships stay grouped up and in formation after hyperspacing from one mission to the next, that saves a lot of time setting them up.\n\nI haven't gotten around to Homeworld 2's campaign yet, but I doubt I'll be disappointed there.  That game is still easy to pick up and play today as it was 10 years ago.  So the graphical update to it will do little but make everything better.\n\nThe Bad:\nWhile the remaster is great there are many changes from HW1->HWRM.  There are a lot of core changes to gameplay when the game was translated over to the new engine, many of which affected the strength of support craft, fighters, and corvettes in negative ways.  Such as:\n* Fighter/corvette formations having no effect on their behavior in a fight.  Corvettes don't face their targets when circling, meaning certain types of corvettes only use half of their guns in a fight.  This hurts Kushan the most because of the way their guns are laid out.\n* Guard works completely differently making it impossible to form defensive corvette walls and fighter balls.\n* Support craft healing abilities require them to be right next to the craft they are healing, as opposed to a comfortable distance away.  Making them both slower to heal because they have to maneuver into position and less effective because they cannot respond as quickly.  It also means two support frigates cannot heal each other.  They just circle around each other trying to sniff each others butts, like a pair of dogs.\n* Ships have wierd accuracy issues.  Many times their shots are no where near their targets, even when their target is stationary.\n* You can only build 2 units at a time.  In the original you could build 2-3 of each unit type simultaneously for a total 10+ units being built at one time (3 fighters, and 2 of each of the other types).  And that isn't even counting a carrier.\n* Research now costs RU and having multiple research vessels does not let you research multiple technologies at once.  Previously research was free and you could designate either a single or multiple research vessels to either research multiple things at once or one or two things very quickly.\n* Resource collectors will sometimes completely ignore patches of resources and claim that the map is dry.\n* Everything is less reponsive.  I think this is due to the engine, but I every click and command was crisp and responsive from the original.  In the new engine everything just feels more floaty.  Kinda like Starcraft 1 -> Starcraft 2 responsiveness.  I don't know why this is so hard to achieve in newer games but its something I've noticed.\n\nBecause of that, the game plays about 60-70% accurate to the original.\n\nThe Ugly:\nOf the new remastered graphics I'm very impressed with the missile effects ... when zoomed in.  When zoomed out they aren't there, and you can barely tell where the missiles are by the small missile pods.  In the original you could clearly see missile trails even when fully zoomed out.  And the ending credits are missing the music from Yes, but I heard that was due to a licensing issue.  If you want to see the original credits in their glory just visit youtube.  I have crashed once, and when getting back in game it completely screwed up my hotkeys in a mission where I really needed them to work from the start.  And finally, you need a "Shift" account to play multiplayer.  Its completely pointless to make one because they then force you to link it to your steam account before you can play.  Why couldn't you just use my steam account to begin with?\n\nI definitely recommend this game, but if you don't mind old graphics for HW1 you will find the original actually plays much better than the remaster.  As for HW2 its probably a direct upgrade, since this is just a modified HW2 engine the game is running on.","February 25, 2015","true","30.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(Thus Multiplayer BETA)\nAnd if all else fails, there will certainly be mods. HW2 has a very active and ingenious modding community and the remaster has been tendered to offer good mod support.\n\nSo please don't take this warning as a turnoff, because otherwise, you would be missing out on a great RTS game like no other.

Sure, it looks pretty but beneath it's rotten to the core.\n\nI played the original Homeworld and understand how dated the original UI is. However, I would expect an improvement in a remaster. This is quite simply a giant mess.\n\nThe UI is clunky and sometimes only lists certain ships you need in sub-menus. There is no master list for all production so you constantly have to shuffle through your build orders.\n\nOverall the UI is ugly, poorly implemented and does a bad job of differentiating ship classes. It's a chore.....\n\nAI is far inferior to the originals. Mobile refineries often don't work, Tactics have been totally removed.\n\nThere's plenty of glitches, odd AI behavior and random crashes 6 months in as well...\n\nDo yourself a favor and get the originals or play Sins of a Solar Empire.

I played it about 6-7 yrs ago from 1-2 and Cataclysm. At the time I was like why I never heard of this such great game before then was wishing a sequel. I enjoyed an old classic game back then. Now it's back again as remastered. Now it is far greater and better graphics but funny 'coz I forgot how to play this game when I first tried it as I have skipped the turorial. I find it hard to play as I dont understand it anymore for first time again that made me decide to quit right away. But last night I have tried to play it again by going through the tutorial so I can remember how did I enjoyed this game back then. Was 9:30PM when I started playing through and guess what, the next time I looked at the clock it's already 5:35 AM in the morning @.@ that's how did I enjoyed playing this game without noticing the time.\n\nPROS:+ Engaging Story and voice narrative\n+ Music is really captivating\n+ Detailed gameplay\n+ Strategic in play\n+ Lots of ship varieties - it's a big space fleet you're gonna create and command. I'm ENDER!\n+ Great graphics\n+ Camera focus - I just like seeing the battle upclose or following the specific group engage into battle/sction\n+ 3D, you can go make your ships go up, down and angled. Not just a tabletop!\n+ Four games in this bundle remastered collection(including the classic.)\n+ w/ Mod support\n+ w/ Achievements\n\n\nCONS:- Controls can sometimes be frustrating specially when moving units going down/up y-axis or I'm just terrible with it.\n- Slow pace, moving from point to point can be slow other than hyper jumping some of your ships\n- Damn no trading cards! Zzzz..\n- I notice some bugs to be honest but ain't game breaking.\n\nNOTES & TIPS:- Go through the tutorial first if you don't understand how to play it at first. I know some of us just wanna get right into the action like I did but it sometimes end up terrible until you just say f** this game I'm going play cod or csgo. lol\n\nMY RATING9 / 10 - Highly Recommend if you like this type of game!","February 17","true","14.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The audiovisual presentation of Homeworld : Remastered immerses you in the vastness of space, and manages to make each stage in the empty void feel varied and colorful.\n\nGameplay wise, you've got a fairly difficult single player campaign that forces you to learn the ins and outs of the various spaceships so you can counter your enemies in a rock paper scissors like fashion.  It's nothing groundbreaking, but it is balanced quite well, and generally feels logical and fair.\n\nThe story this game tells is also genuinely interesting, and unique.  I have yet to finish the single player campaign but I am already curious to see where things are going and what the truth is about the various factions I have encountered thus far.\n\nSo .. yeah.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes playing beautiful looking RTS,  and likes a good story.   I'm not going to compare it to the original homeworld because I never actually played HW1 ( only HW2 ).

I had never heard of it until a coworker mentioned that he used to play it a long time ago. I saw that this Remastered version was on sale and that it has some seriously rave reviews and a huge (and aged) fanbase. Its definitely a great looking game and while the gameplay does take a little bit to get used to its really fun. My only problem so far is that is has crashed twice and I've only had it one day. I do have the Halo and Mass Effect workshop mods installed which I read can cause it to crash, and while I haven't played with those mods just yet, that may be the reason. I have not tried the multiplayer yet, thought I should mention that.

Since there is no terrain here, strategies are diverse, entrapping the enemy fleet in a crescent shaped formation was never more satisfactory.\n\nCombining the original beautiful story with immense graphics after 16 years, Homeworld Remastered Collection is definitely a must buy for both the old gamers who will re-enjoy everyhing in a more eye-appeasing manner but also for the people who have never heard of it, for this is the game coming from the best times of PC strategy gaming, where story and gameplay elements were put forward than hollow graphics. Good point is, now you can have both!\n\nOnly downside of this collection is that it does not contain another classic; Homeworld Cataclysm. I would really like to go through the story of mere miners of Kuun-Lan against the vile Beast, but seems like the source code of the game was lost when Barking Dog Studios hit the dust.\n\nOverall, this collection is a must buy for all RTS lovers and "dinosaur" players who have lived to see when this game rose for the first time.\n\n"The Mothership standing by"","February 26, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delaruuk/recommended/244160/","Delaruuk","Delaruuk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delaruuk/","70 products in account","One of the best remaster's Gearbox has made. It's beatiful graphics are breathless especially coming from a 15 year old game which back then had 16-Bit pologon graphics form to make 3D models. It's audio remade into something that you would hear nowadays on most AAA games. The soundtrack is well remade and nostalgic for veterans like me and most of the other dedicated fans and players of this franchise. The story is well told and it's lore interesting and it's antagonists really likable to go up against.\nThere are bugs like any other game and some odd design choices which can put off some gamers. It's diffiult to control at first but you'll get the hang of it after a few plays. The A.I. is pretty smart and clever and will be a challenge for players especially in campaign. The strategies and tips used from the classics unfortunatle are obsolete in the remastered so the missions are to be unexpected as we still don't understand how the game can be played in the players favor: where in the classics there was an exploit which used right would give the player great advantage over the A.I. in the campaign. A lot of the veterans complain saying its rather dissappointing and buggy and not worked out. I beg to differ. It's a really good rts game even if its buggy at it's release and realistically speaking almost every game thats released has bugs and complications upon release but it's not so bad as other games released recently by big name companies. In due time hoipefully things will get patched up and mods worked on and created to where this game is even MORE enjoyable.\n\nPros\n-Amazing graphics\n-Great audio remake\n-Aamazing OST\n-Story\n-A.I.\n-Interesting factions to play\n-Mods\n-Community\n\nCons-\n-Formations broken\n-Damges done to certain crafts especially frigates bug out and become shooting dummies\n-Tactics broken\n-Some minor visual glitches here and there from time to time\n-Crashes after hours of continous gameplay\n-Pop cap(Is that really necessary to have especially since modern machines are powerful enough to hold massive fleets.)\n-Multiplayer in Beta\n\nOverall this is a wonderful masterpiece from an underrated game. Highly recommend this to anyone interested in space battles,rts's,tactics etc. or anyone starting out with rts games. For those new to the franchise or never heard of it. They also included the classic first to games to play on as well to compare and try out as well and it's also for the veterans who lost their copy(like me :( ) as getting ahold of a physical copy of this game is like a needle in a haystack nowadays so why hassle your time in finding a physical copy of the older two games when it's included in this digital bundle.\n\n9/10\n\nP.S.-It's a shame that Cataclysm can't be remastered(source code is missing and is unable to be found) as that was a good game as well that was part of the Homeworld franchise and that too is difficult to get ahold of a physical copy.","March 2, 2015","true","82.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most remasters, absolutely. This remaster, however, shows an incredible amount of care given to the resurrection of a timeless classic, an IP that still has a great deal of potential.\n\nIn order to make such an incredibly faithful remastering, key artists from the original art team were hired to breath new life into the graphics and the original composer was brought in to touch up the soundtrack. As such, everything has been retouched with an incredible amount of care and respect.\n\nTrue, some mechanics have been changed across both games (the first one most of all). Purists will be disappointed to be missing out on some mechanics, such as strikecreaft fuel, and some missions will be changed somewhat as a result. However, I believe that those omissions that were made in the remastered editions were for the better, in order to create more consistent games over all. I haven't tried them yet, but if you really want the original experience all over again, the Classic versions are bundled along with the rest.\n\nConsidering all of these things in addition to subtle improvements to the HUD in both games, full modding support, the addition of a steam-supported multiplayer, and even fleshed out options menus, I can say that Homeworld has been reborn and that it can very easily compete with many modern RTS games in terms of immersion, challenge, and depth. With any luck, this will be the jump start that the IP needs as a whole.\n\n... and now back to my fleet of salvage ships!","March 15, 2015","true","14.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Let's get that out of the way. Does it make the game "broken"? No, but there ARE issues to be addressed by Gearbox.\nI won't go into the graphics, story etc. as many reviews have covered this. Let me instead look at the game's 'difficulty' for the new RTS gamer.\n\nIf you do not strategise and plan in 3D, which was revolutionary at the time (and still is, to my mind) you're going to have a hard time. When I played the original on release in my early thirties I DID find some of the mssions HARD, but then I wasn't used to this type of RTS. The delight was in solving the strategy for myself and finally 'getting it'!\nI hadn't come across this since "X-Wing", which really was a mix of simulator anbd puzzle solving (take out X bombers to pretect Hospital Ship - if you don't in a certain order you fail).\n\nSo, it all comes down to planning and working out exactly what you need for each mission. "Tank Rushing" just will not work, and those with the biggest and baddest fleet, that takes sometimes far too much time and resources, will see you fail time and again (except in skirmish - which we didn't have back then).\n\nThis game(s) requires thought, and aside from it's beauty (the original still looks marvellous), the strategy required is compelling. You'll hit your keyboard and close the game down in frustration sometimes, but your mind will keep churning over strategies until you come back and try again (and you will).\n\n"Brilliant and innovative" barely describes this title even today.","February 26, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's beatiful graphics are breathless especially coming from a 15 year old game which back then had 16-Bit pologon graphics form to make 3D models. It's audio remade into something that you would hear nowadays on most AAA games. The soundtrack is well remade and nostalgic for veterans like me and most of the other dedicated fans and players of this franchise. The story is well told and it's lore interesting and it's antagonists really likable to go up against.\nThere are bugs like any other game and some odd design choices which can put off some gamers. It's diffiult to control at first but you'll get the hang of it after a few plays. The A.I. is pretty smart and clever and will be a challenge for players especially in campaign. The strategies and tips used from the classics unfortunatle are obsolete in the remastered so the missions are to be unexpected as we still don't understand how the game can be played in the players favor: where in the classics there was an exploit which used right would give the player great advantage over the A.I. in the campaign. A lot of the veterans complain saying its rather dissappointing and buggy and not worked out. I beg to differ. It's a really good rts game even if its buggy at it's release and realistically speaking almost every game thats released has bugs and complications upon release but it's not so bad as other games released recently by big name companies. In due time hoipefully things will get patched up and mods worked on and created to where this game is even MORE enjoyable.\n\nPros\n-Amazing graphics\n-Great audio remake\n-Aamazing OST\n-Story\n-A.I.\n-Interesting factions to play\n-Mods\n-Community\n\nCons-\n-Formations broken\n-Damges done to certain crafts especially frigates bug out and become shooting dummies\n-Tactics broken\n-Some minor visual glitches here and there from time to time\n-Crashes after hours of continous gameplay\n-Pop cap(Is that really necessary to have especially since modern machines are powerful enough to hold massive fleets.)\n-Multiplayer in Beta\n\nOverall this is a wonderful masterpiece from an underrated game. Highly recommend this to anyone interested in space battles,rts's,tactics etc. or anyone starting out with rts games. For those new to the franchise or never heard of it. They also included the classic first to games to play on as well to compare and try out as well and it's also for the veterans who lost their copy(like me :( ) as getting ahold of a physical copy of this game is like a needle in a haystack nowadays so why hassle your time in finding a physical copy of the older two games when it's included in this digital bundle.\n\n9/10\n\nP.S.-It's a shame that Cataclysm can't be remastered(source code is missing and is unable to be found) as that was a good game as well that was part of the Homeworld franchise and that too is difficult to get ahold of a physical copy.","March 2, 2015","true","82.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShrapnelSteve/recommended/244160/","ShrapnelSteve","[B-LG] Billy Zane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShrapnelSteve/","197 products in account","Since the vast majority of negative reviews here are misleading and either nitpick or make vague and uninformative complaints about failed launches, I figured I would give you guys a more comprehensive first impression of Homeworld Remastered. Before I start though, know that I haven't played the original Homeworlds and am new to the series. Also, the in-depth review will come a bit later, given that I've only played for a couple of hours.\n\nHere's a quick summary of the game's pro's and con's.\n\nPros:\n+ Satisfyingly simple yet beautiful visuals\n\n+ Ease of use [I was reticent about how easy it would be to control fleets given the scope of the game and my inability to micro efficiently but the controls are spot on].\n\n+ Audio---I can't stress this enough. Gearbox got the original developpers to contribute their original audio files—UNCOMPRESSED—for the remastered game. If you have headphones that are half decent or, ideally, have dolby 7.1, you're in for a treat. Also, the zoom level will give you access to different levels of audio. Zoomed out? You have the audio of high ranked officers and frigates. Zoomed in? You hear the dogfighting grunt screaming for his life as he's blown up.\n\n+ Story: The narrative does a good job at not holding your hand too much. It drew me right in during the first few missions, and combined with the audio and headache free controls, nothing is really in the way of you experiencing the story without any hassles.\n\n+Depth. Again, I can't stress this enough. Try to imagine a complicated hierarchy of ships and tiers, combine that with coordinated strikeforces which utilize altitude and formations, combined with a great two tier command system of macro and micro commands, and you get a fantastically intricate rts which flirts with becoming overwhelming but never quite gets there.\n\nCons:\n- While the graphics are satisfying, there are certain elements that seem a little oldschool. While I know this was done to maintain the nostalgiac visuals of the original, you get some weird combination of amazing textures on the mothership with odd and clunky parts.\n\n- The learning curve. If you're not into strategy games or are looking for something to easily jump into, this might not be the game for you. It's not a simple point and click. Like I mentioned, you have a 3d plane of combat, so you have to worry about attacks from above and below, as well as front, back and side. Also, if you weren't really into space themed games, distinguishing a corvette from a frigate from a carrier will take some memorization.\n\n\nHonestly, forget these chumps who are using steam reviews as a support or troubleshooting forum. They don't post specs, probally haven't even attempted to take the most basic steps in fixing these problems, and are just firing off "Not Recommended" left and right. While I acknowledge that my experience, however seamless, won't be the same for others, I think that a certain level of patience is in order given that it's launch day. I've seen AAA titles have much more horrific launches than this gem of a game.\n\nA B-List gamers review.

Before the remastered version was even heard of i was still happily playing it with friends. But i always had a thought in the back of my head that this game needed so much work just to be even playable on my rig. So so many crashes, so many bugs that made the game impossible to play, so many times i'd stop playing too out of frustration to then come back later after realizing their is no other game out there quite like homeworld 2.\n\nTo finally be able to play HW2 without error, without issues arising every time i load a single player map, or unable to connect to a friend to compete against due to incompatibility issues. Its  finally all over. i now have to simply press a few buttons and am away with the ships in a far away galaxy.\n\nThe remarstered game is everything that i personally hoped for. These bugs that people are complaining about i personally haven't seen and even if i did i wouldnt care because at the end of the day a game 15+ years old finally getting the love and dedication it deserves trounces all that. I could never play the first homeworld and right now i've just completed the first games campaign and it was amazing.\n\nif you never touched the game before you'll love it. Its a hefty price for a great game, but entirely justified. They truely remastered the franchise and i hope that any company in the future hoping to relaunch a franchise will look up to gearboxes great example.\n\nGearbox managed to keep everything the Fans loved, fixed everything we hated and added everything we wanted.\n\nBravo to the team who did this!!","February 26, 2015","true","33.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Since there is no terrain here, strategies are diverse, entrapping the enemy fleet in a crescent shaped formation was never more satisfactory.\n\nCombining the original beautiful story with immense graphics after 16 years, Homeworld Remastered Collection is definitely a must buy for both the old gamers who will re-enjoy everyhing in a more eye-appeasing manner but also for the people who have never heard of it, for this is the game coming from the best times of PC strategy gaming, where story and gameplay elements were put forward than hollow graphics. Good point is, now you can have both!\n\nOnly downside of this collection is that it does not contain another classic; Homeworld Cataclysm. I would really like to go through the story of mere miners of Kuun-Lan against the vile Beast, but seems like the source code of the game was lost when Barking Dog Studios hit the dust.\n\nOverall, this collection is a must buy for all RTS lovers and "dinosaur" players who have lived to see when this game rose for the first time.\n\n"The Mothership standing by"","February 26, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It used to be considered one of best RTS's ever made set in space combat. After it was remastered it still is one of best RTS's ever created. I have never played original games, bought the game during recent steam sale. Money well spent. The game is just amazing. Homeworld 1 Remastered feels like one is playing Battlestar Galactica (2003-2009). On the other hand Homeworld 2 Remastered is more of war story while keeping up mysticism of 1st game.\nFirst thing I can tell you now the game is not easy, You need to learn its controls and how it works otherwise you will keep loosing. When you learn ropes of the game its extremely pleasant to play and most importantly enemy will still outnumber you, i.e. in 2nd game the enemy will have 10 battlecruisers while you have a cap allowing you to build 2 bc's. Quite unfair considering their firepower but frigates are perfect cannon fodder for that :P\n\nStory of two games is just amazing, both cause you feel rush and despair. Graphics in comparison to original game imporved really well fitting modern standards (including 4k if u can handle it). The soundtrack is purely amazing and is used in appropriate moments to affect us as players when necessary. Adagio for Strings choral by Samuel Barber is actually one of most beautiful songs ever created in our history. Yes, its used in best moments in the Homeworld 1 Remastered! Other soundtrack is also amazing but this very specific song is purest masterpiece of all,\n\nGameplay. It's great. Cant say anything more. Combat is balanced, fights are challanging and its easy to loose if you're not using the thing in ur head at all. This is defiently not casual game where you hop in and immediately become a god in it (like designers of modern games do nowadays with games is just wrong!) Nothing beats sight of full scale fleet vs fleet combat. Bloody yet stunning.\n\nHomeworld Remastered Collection is great offer. You get 4 games (2 original + 2 remastered games) and if you are considering to buy it, do not hesitate. You will not regret spending your money on the game (sale or normally).

I was relieved to find out that Homeworld holds up to the test of time and in this remastered version it looks better than ever.\n\nThe one thing I remembered about Homeworld was the atmosphere which is enhanced ten fold thanks to the remastering. Nothing compares to sending in a large armada full of fighters, corvettes, ion frigates and destroyers against another force of equal measure and watching the battle play out. Fighters whip around in the void dodging fire and letting loose upon the opposition. Destroyers fire heavy volleys of missles and projectiles which crash into the enemy's ranks. Ships flame out and tumble into an explosion when destroyed or in the case of capital ships they spin around and emit a huge fireball complete with debris. When the battle seems lost you can order your remaining fighters to kamikaze in a last ditch attempt to save the mothership. The backdrops are incredibly beautiful and stunning to look at. This remastered edition makes the game look like I remember it looking.\n\nNow with all that being said there is a bit of jank. Scripting has a tendancy to break. Movement commands get a little fuddled sometimes. I have had a handful of weird audio bugs as well. The zooming in and out via the mousewheel is a bit weird considering the setting being in 3d space you would think you could just keep zooming out to move the field of view up but you can't. A small amount of other issues have me scratching my head sometimes.\n\nTaking all that into consideration Homeworld has always had a special place in my heart. This remastered edition has me skipping and jumping for joy down memory lane as I relive all those massive space battles I remembered having. If you have any reverance for these games buy this edition right now. If this is new to you I encourage giving it a shot. If you aren't hooked before the first two hours of play you can always get a refund through Steam but I am pretty confident if you like space, explosions and strategy you will find a place in your heart for Homeworld as well.","June 21, 2015","true","7.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

It's the liittle thing that totally change the wayy it plays and thus the overall experience. Formations are UTTERLY useless, fighters degrade into a cluster ♥♥♥♥ sworm of bees instead of attacking in formation. There are no longer any "stances" which determine how ships fight while IN a fight. They only inform what they do while not fighting. Which is totally useless. I'd say buy it if it's on sale. You can find plenty of information on how many things have changed in the porting of the first Homeworld into the Homeworld 2 engine, which was regarded by most fans as inferior. While I appreciate the revival of the series and did have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun with the game these little things still irk me. Let alone the 2 original games that come with the title STILL do not work for me.

In Homeworld and Homeworld 2, resource management is key, every resource you collect on one mission gets transferred to your next, so it is a good idea to use it wisely, often relying on salvage ships to steal enemy ships over building your own. Space combat is done on a fully 3D plane, where ships can easily move in all 3 axis, which at the time was revolutionary.\n\nGearbox did an amazing job in remastering this great gem, the graphics is amazing, while keeping the story and the music intact the game is truly perfect now. They made some UI and control changes but in the end it results in a smoother gameplay.\n\nThere are a few minor bugs such as a sound issue with ship engines when too many of them are moving at once, and the tutorial being slightly broken (you get asked to press okay to continue to the next segment but the tutorial continues on as if you already pressed it), however these are minor gripes and does nothing to ruin this wonderful title.\n\nMy ratings are as follows:\nGraphics 8\nMusic 10\nStory 10\nGameplay 9\n","June 16, 2015","true","20.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Launching the "Classic" version today – only possible thanks to Gearbox recompiling the original code to run on modern operating systems – isn't quite as impressive as it was back in the day. How fortunate then, that they have done a stellar (pardon the pun) job with the Remastered versions of the two main games in the series.\n\nThe graphics are top notch, with some incredibly detailed textures, impressive explosions and beautiful galactic backdrops. Both games now run in the same engine, however I would highly recommend playing Homeworld Remastered before Homeworld 2 Remastered if you're aiming to experience both, since the latter has even better graphics and many more polygons. The new and improved interface (used in both Remastered versions) also gets slightly more cluttered in the sequel, so you might appreciate the easier learning curve of beginning with the first game.\n\nManeuvering a battlefield that goes in all directions can be a bit confusing at times, even when you've memorized all the controls. Occasionally you may find yourself fully zoomed in on an asteroid when all you wanted to do was to check up on your harvesters. If this happens, remember that you can use the Pause button to freeze the action until you find your orientation again. By all means, remember to use the Pause button even when you're not doing close inspections of rocks since it can (and will) seriously help with giving orders in the midst of hundreds of spaceships trying to destroy eachother. Also, a paused battle looks absolutely stunning with all the missiles, ion beams and explosions quietly suspended in space.\n\nStorywise there are a lot of things going on, with both campaigns more or less revolving around the Kushan (player faction) homeworld, Hiigara. While there is a cutscene between every mission that give brief explanations of past and current events, and frequent mentions of (and interactions with) other factions during the campaign, one generally feels a bit disconnected from the universe. The Kushan certainly seem familiar with the the friendly and technologically advanced Bentusi from the start, but who are they anyway? What do they look like, and where do they come from? What do they want? Naturally, those who are interested will find out more on the internet, but players shouldn't expect the games to pique that interest.\n\nWhile certainly not without it's (minor) flaws, if you're into space, strategy and/or Adagio for Strings, the Homeworld series is well worth your time and money. Not just because it started a new genre, but more importantly because it is undoubtedly still the king of said genre.","June 16, 2015","true","35.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is exactly as expected, so I have no complaints there at all.\n\nHowever, this is not the case with the remastered version of HW1 at all. What we got was a rather ill conceived and poorly implemented port of the HW1 game into the HW2 engine. The only reasons for this that I can see, are so they can put races from both games into the same multiplayer matches. ( Something nobody asked for, and which has now broken the HW1 remastered version. )\n\nSo in conclusion, I am going to recommend this game on the merits of the HW2 remaster, but stress that if HW1 was your favourite of the two then you are going to be sorely disappointed.","April 11, 2015","true","39.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I recently finished the Homeworld & Homeworld 2 remastered campaign and it was absolutely brilliant. Imagine your greatest gaming moments returned to life with better graphics and smoother gameplay.\n\nThe nostalgia may play a big part in why I like this game, but I'll try my best to tell you the about the remastered version and the differences between the remastered versions and classic versions.\n\n\n\n+ The three dimensional movement & combat is astonishing to look at and easy to control.\n+ The story is great and really gives the game an amazing atmosphere around it while you play it.\n+ The updated Homeworld 2 UI (which is used in both remastered version of the game) is easy to understand and use.\n+ They captured the emptiness of space perfectly and it really sets the mood while you are playing the game.\n+ The multiplayer has also been updated. You are able to play as Taiidan, Vaygr, Kushan and Hiigaran on restored maps with new bonuses and game modes that I've had loads of fun with after the campaign.\n+ The game is slower paced than games like Starcraft, which means, you don't have to have super fast micro managing skills to be able to play well).\n+ The game is easy to mod and uses steam workshop.\n\n-+ The fuel system has been removed from the remastered versions (This was a system that could be seen as annoying or just another gameplay element depending on what the player thinks. The reason that the gameplay element was removed was probably because of the annoyance of having your ships becoming completely static in the middle of combat.)\n\n- The Homeworld & Homeworld 2 races are a bit unbalanced against eachother in multiplayer (Keep in mind that the multiplayer is still development).\n- The Resource collecting can be a bit buggy sometimes. For example: when recource collecters want to collect debris from shipwrecks.\n- Some cool and useful attack patterns and strategies have been changed since the both remastered versions are runing on an updated Homeworld 2 engine.\n\n\nOverall, this game is truly a RTS masterpiece and is, AT LEAST, a must try for those who enjoy RTS.\n","July 27, 2015","true","50.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Im about 12-13 of 15 missions into the first game and it is brilliant. Its not like those games where theyre good but you want it to end and so ya look up how many missions there are. Nope not why i know.\n\nMega fun, highly rewarding when you capture enemy ships and one of the funnest games ive played in a while. The levels seem quite unique with interesting concepts you encounter.\n\nI bought the game on sale for £10 though i do not think i would feel hard done by if i paid £26.99 asking price.\n\nI have yet to play skirmish/multiplayer mode though for me the single player is where its at.\n\nOk CYA!\n\nUPDATE: Finished HW1 and it is a brilliant story. Almost finished HW2 and in the beginning you may find the new ships (doing what other ships did previously in a silightly different way annoying) though they become good though you will be unlikely to be bothered to capture anything in HW2 unless stated by the story. This is mainly because the AI (your ships) will fire upon ships you are trying to capture and so destroy them before you have a chance. Also capturing is slow in HW2.\nThe storyline of HW2 is good as with the first game though HW1 had more depth though HW2 is still enjoyable though more about exploration rather than survival.\n\nYou will probrably get between 25 to 30 hours out of the single player of this game (which is very enjoyable and has time fly, if you like the space genre.).\n\nThe 4x aspect of the game gives extra gameplay choices though is not overly necessary to be used against AI as most missions are fairly linear in terms of design.\n\n--------------------------------------*SPOILERS*------------------------------------------\n\nAlso HW2 seems to have faster dying ships than HW1, it may just be me, though in HW2 frigates are easily destroyed and is more foucused on destroyers and bigger where as in HW1 i had frigates as the back bone to my fleet throughout most of the game with much less frequent casualties.\n\nAnother gameplay aspect change is autocollection at the end of HW2 missions all resources on map are collected though this makes the resource collectors seem a bit useless unless in emergencies as they are subject to attack and you can get the resources anyway at the end of the mission. Also fighters are sold in squadrons rahter than single units which is fine though gives less flexibility as before you could have 70 fighters/bombers and in HW2 you can have 14 squadrons. Because of this you are less able to have multiple attack groups of fighters.\n\nOverall very good games, though there are a few differences between 1 & 2 remastered which become apparent when starting homeworld 2.","June 27, 2015","true","28.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Including a showstopper.\n\nThe most obvious thing is the fact that setting up formations for strike craft, just doesnt work. Once they engage a target, they scatter to the winds and do whatever they want. Supposedly the devs were going to fix that, but that was 6 months ago from the date of this review (will change review upon fixing)\n\nThe showstopper bug, the game breaker for me... is in mission 14 of HW1 "Bridge of Sighs". You have to destroy 3 jump gates, battle through an incredible amount of enemies and take out a field generator.\nWell, I did that, and the objective never went to completed. So I figure.. maybe I'm missing something. And I commence destroying EVERY SINGLE ion frigate in the entire area. It takes a long, long time to accomplish. Still no objective completion. So now I'm stuck... on the second to last mission in the entire game, and no fixes.\n\nI can't rightfully recommend this game, not yet. Even though I ADORED the originals.

But this remaster doesn't do it justice. Not only is it buggier than a Stalker launch, but it has gone unfixed for months. As you know from other critical analysis videos, HWR lacks proper squad and tactics mechanics, resulting in poorly balanced ships, frustrating RNG mechanics, and fewer strategic options. What I wasn't aware of are the following:\n\nMission scripts break every other mission. Unwinnable states, no completion trigger, in game cutscenes perform oddly when queued waypoints or battles are occuring in the background. AI isn't allowed to hyperspace in while a cutscene plays, so you can complete objectives before they ever finish.\n\nFleet difficulty scaling results in rather comical scenarios. At the Ghost Ship, there was a massive cluster of 30  assault frigates already, simply because my fleet size was out of control. With some baiting, I easily added those to my collection too... and the snowball effect is starting to lag my later missions, especially movement lines are rendered and overlaid. Every time the mission begins, your ships are lined up to the left of your mothership. Now my ships are so numerous they span twice the map's distance... beginning from the edge of the map! You begin the later missions under immediate attack by 100+ ships, while 80% of your own fleet spawns so far away, it would take 10 minutes for them to reach your mothership, making these missions unwinnable unless I reloaded a previous mission and retired the majority of my fleet.\n\nMulti-target (boxed) salvage and repair commands are not working. There is a salvage hotkey which actually does nothing in HWR, and repair results in the repair ship flipping between targets until it succumbs to paralysis. HW was great because it emphasized that you were akin to Karan Sjet. You had control over a massive number of units without the logistical nightmare, and micro was not necessary, as units would automatically target units they were best at, and sort out who they'd repair first and manage themselves at best efficiency. I have never given as many single target orders in all my HW playthroughs as I have in half a HWR campaign. It's tedious, and I certainly don't feel like I have a neural connection to my fleet.\n\nThere is a new mission timer that shows how long you've spent on a mission. Except it resets to 0 every time you load a save. This is immediately noticable... Did Gearbox even test their new features?\n\nAntialiasing impedes certain map elements (dust veins) from rendering visibly, critical to a certain mission.\n\nAutosaves actually occur a minute after the start of a mission, which means if the mission/trigger states are broken, they stay broken in the autosave. Use mission restart, NOT the autosave.\n\nIt's been months. Where are the patches?","July 5, 2015","false","15.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In the original I never had to worry about them, they would mine out the map. Here I have to babysit them constantly and spam the Harvest command every 2 minutes or they will get stuck. Also if you blow up an enemy capital ship they leave behind debris that can be collected, and that routine is COMPLETELY broken, all collectors will queue up to pick up the same chuck of metal and then they will do nothing even if you use the Harvest command. You also can't return those to a resource controller, you have to take them back to the mothership which may be 5 minutes away, during which time you are basically not mining anything because all collectors are stuck. Wow.\n\nFormations do nothing, they only work out of combat. When you are fighting, ships just break formation and go all over the place, so you can't micromanage or focus fire anything, you just CTRL-click and pray.\n\nThe AI is broken. When you are under attack by a fleet, every enemy ship is prioritizing your salvage corvettes. If you dock them, they just kind of don't know what to do anymore, they just fly around taking occasional pot shots at your fighters until they get blown up. Your resource collectors never get harassed, I had them mining right next to an enemy fleet and nobody bothered them, instead they went for my salvage corvettes who were 20 km away.\n\nAudio is messed up, engine sounds will occasionally stop working or burst into static and kill your ears.\n\nAdaptive difficulty is a mess and very easy to abuse. If you leave the Kadesh missions with 25k RU's hoarded up and only build what you need when you need it, the campaign is a faceroll from that point on. You don't even need to capture anything ever, in fact it would be best to retire your salvage corvettes, thus breaking the enemy AI and having them fly around like headless chickens.\n\nMultiplayer is unstable and in beta.\n\nJust....ugh. The game needs like a year of patching, I'm not even sure if it's fixable at this point. Or if they will bother. DON'T buy this yet.

I hope it's not going to stop and Gearbox fixes the game issues.\n\nSummary:\nPros:\nHomeworld 1 Classic runs, which is great.\nHomeworld 2 as Remastered is great too.\nHomeworld 1 Remastered eliminates a HW1 limitation: enemy ships target the first ship on sight and do not change target until it destroyed or docked. (and yes, that is all)\n\nCons:\nHomeworld Cataclysm - where I you? I still miss you and don't give a darn about "canon".\nHomeworld 1 Remasterd is Homeworld 0.8. Too many things on the scewed up/missing list.\nStarting with the formation, pathfinding, tactics mess, ending with that Remastered misses the iconic words: "All ships autolaunching."\nGerarbox changed HW1 mid-mission animations in HW1:R. Not about making engine exhausts more glaring, but changing scene and the text.\nOccasional crashes, 6+ GB memory usage on HW1 Remastered on Mission 14.\n\nThe long one (TL;DR):\nHomeworld 1 Remastered screws:\n- Mission timings, craft speeds, game speed, map sizes as a whole. Game is too fast and far too easy. Starting with time needed for the resource collector to fill up it's internal storage bay. I do not feel even the craft speeds proper...\n- I had difficulties to use special actions on multiple unit at once in HW1 remastered.\n- Gearbox altered the between mission animations, sound track, sound effects, noises. And some of the changes simply make no sense, like the Guidestone.\n- Maximum zoom in and hear the difference of the Taidan fighter craft sound.\n- This needs checking: but for me it seems that some sounds and effects come from the Cataclysm to the HW1:R.\n- HW1:R lacks formation & tactics as a whole as other reviewers said. So if Gearbox decided cripple Homeworld 1, why did not they add time compression?\n- HW1:R UI is an utter disappointment for me. Homeworld Classics runs 1600*900 resolution and UI is far nicer.\nThis is personal: some ships are nicer in the HW1 Classics than the Remastered. And this is valid for some parts of the space.\n\nHW2:\nWould not say too much about it. For me HW2 Classic was an utter disappointment in gameplay, story and found it "too epic". Too many things unexplained in the storyline and I'm fed up with referencing recent navy technology to spaceships (torpedo frigate - master degree in lack creativity). And meanwhile there was the Homeworld Cataclysm...\nPlease check the videos on Youtube about HW Cataclysm. See story depth, the grimm and bloody fight against the Beast and I'm pretty sure that you will also find HW2 weightless.\n(Not to mention that most of the Cataclysm videos are shot on normal difficulty and using 8-10% of the game's strategic and tactical offering.)\n","March 7, 2015","false","15.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The controls are all the same as before, the general system of doing things is the same and that's awesome. My main problem with this is something that was in the originals as well. In the matches, your opponent can infinitely go up or down. with a movement system that they have, that makes pursueing them a hassle.\n\nThe actual combat is very satisfying, however. when a missile impacts your battlecruiser, there's an actual hole where it hit. so as the battles progress, your ships that have been around for a long time look increasingly battered and bruised. That's a very nice touch.\n\nAt the end of it, I would definitely recommend this.\n\n-----------------\nOh, I almost forgot.

That was about all I could take.\n\nI loved Homeworld, Cataclysm and Homeworld 2. I own them all so I thought getting the remaster would be a nice idea...especially with the summer sale and the contents of my Steam Wallet making it cost me less than a tenner.\n\nBut I deeply regret the decision already. The game sucked me in with it's improved visuals and effects but the good stuff pretty much stopped there.\n\nThe UI is horrible, the amount of times I focused on a unit to have the mouse drag me off it was incredibly annoying. I know Homeworld 2 had this feature but it belonged there, not in Homeworld 1. But the real icing on the turd sandwich that this game is, is the AI with formations. It's absolutely abysmal. Putting a squad of Heavy Corvettes in a Wall formation to take down incoming fighters quickly was a surefire strategy in the original game. At least for the early missions.\n\nSo I built up my Corvettes and attempted to put them in a wall formation, they went into a Diamond formation no matter what number of them I used. But the real kicker was when combat started, even mucking about with Tactics to change the AI behaviour still made them split off into bunches of two and threes and let the enemy fighters past. They would then attempt to chase said fighters even though they are slower.\n\nI swear I had 12 Heavy Corvettes defending the Salvage Corvette in the second mission and it almost died to a small squad of Turanic fighters that the AI in my Corvettes refused to kill.\n\nI think it's a given that I'm going to refund this utter turd.

Including a showstopper.\n\nThe most obvious thing is the fact that setting up formations for strike craft, just doesnt work. Once they engage a target, they scatter to the winds and do whatever they want. Supposedly the devs were going to fix that, but that was 6 months ago from the date of this review (will change review upon fixing)\n\nThe showstopper bug, the game breaker for me... is in mission 14 of HW1 "Bridge of Sighs". You have to destroy 3 jump gates, battle through an incredible amount of enemies and take out a field generator.\nWell, I did that, and the objective never went to completed. So I figure.. maybe I'm missing something. And I commence destroying EVERY SINGLE ion frigate in the entire area. It takes a long, long time to accomplish. Still no objective completion. So now I'm stuck... on the second to last mission in the entire game, and no fixes.\n\nI can't rightfully recommend this game, not yet. Even though I ADORED the originals.

But this remaster doesn't do it justice. Not only is it buggier than a Stalker launch, but it has gone unfixed for months. As you know from other critical analysis videos, HWR lacks proper squad and tactics mechanics, resulting in poorly balanced ships, frustrating RNG mechanics, and fewer strategic options. What I wasn't aware of are the following:\n\nMission scripts break every other mission. Unwinnable states, no completion trigger, in game cutscenes perform oddly when queued waypoints or battles are occuring in the background. AI isn't allowed to hyperspace in while a cutscene plays, so you can complete objectives before they ever finish.\n\nFleet difficulty scaling results in rather comical scenarios. At the Ghost Ship, there was a massive cluster of 30  assault frigates already, simply because my fleet size was out of control. With some baiting, I easily added those to my collection too... and the snowball effect is starting to lag my later missions, especially movement lines are rendered and overlaid. Every time the mission begins, your ships are lined up to the left of your mothership. Now my ships are so numerous they span twice the map's distance... beginning from the edge of the map! You begin the later missions under immediate attack by 100+ ships, while 80% of your own fleet spawns so far away, it would take 10 minutes for them to reach your mothership, making these missions unwinnable unless I reloaded a previous mission and retired the majority of my fleet.\n\nMulti-target (boxed) salvage and repair commands are not working. There is a salvage hotkey which actually does nothing in HWR, and repair results in the repair ship flipping between targets until it succumbs to paralysis. HW was great because it emphasized that you were akin to Karan Sjet. You had control over a massive number of units without the logistical nightmare, and micro was not necessary, as units would automatically target units they were best at, and sort out who they'd repair first and manage themselves at best efficiency. I have never given as many single target orders in all my HW playthroughs as I have in half a HWR campaign. It's tedious, and I certainly don't feel like I have a neural connection to my fleet.\n\nThere is a new mission timer that shows how long you've spent on a mission. Except it resets to 0 every time you load a save. This is immediately noticable... Did Gearbox even test their new features?\n\nAntialiasing impedes certain map elements (dust veins) from rendering visibly, critical to a certain mission.\n\nAutosaves actually occur a minute after the start of a mission, which means if the mission/trigger states are broken, they stay broken in the autosave. Use mission restart, NOT the autosave.\n\nIt's been months. Where are the patches?","July 5, 2015","false","15.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In the original I never had to worry about them, they would mine out the map. Here I have to babysit them constantly and spam the Harvest command every 2 minutes or they will get stuck. Also if you blow up an enemy capital ship they leave behind debris that can be collected, and that routine is COMPLETELY broken, all collectors will queue up to pick up the same chuck of metal and then they will do nothing even if you use the Harvest command. You also can't return those to a resource controller, you have to take them back to the mothership which may be 5 minutes away, during which time you are basically not mining anything because all collectors are stuck. Wow.\n\nFormations do nothing, they only work out of combat. When you are fighting, ships just break formation and go all over the place, so you can't micromanage or focus fire anything, you just CTRL-click and pray.\n\nThe AI is broken. When you are under attack by a fleet, every enemy ship is prioritizing your salvage corvettes. If you dock them, they just kind of don't know what to do anymore, they just fly around taking occasional pot shots at your fighters until they get blown up. Your resource collectors never get harassed, I had them mining right next to an enemy fleet and nobody bothered them, instead they went for my salvage corvettes who were 20 km away.\n\nAudio is messed up, engine sounds will occasionally stop working or burst into static and kill your ears.\n\nAdaptive difficulty is a mess and very easy to abuse. If you leave the Kadesh missions with 25k RU's hoarded up and only build what you need when you need it, the campaign is a faceroll from that point on. You don't even need to capture anything ever, in fact it would be best to retire your salvage corvettes, thus breaking the enemy AI and having them fly around like headless chickens.\n\nMultiplayer is unstable and in beta.\n\nJust....ugh.

I got too disappointed with the quality of the game as a whole to continue playing. It is Gearbox trying to mash Homeworld 1 into Homeworld 2's engine and failed, and feels rushed.\n\nIn long:\nHomeworld RM is a HUGE upgrade in visuals and quality (stupid sexy Taiidan Heavy Cruiser)\nSounds are cleaned up and sounds so much clearer and textures are great in HD (again Taidan Heavy Cruiser, I can't get over it!). UI was also updated and now a little bit more user friendly, no longer do you need to go to a WHOLE other screen for research, construction and hanger.\n\nHowever, it is not without its bugs, and there are lots of bugs and poor design decisions.\n\nFormations and Stances do not work as intended (I.E. Sphere formation do not surround targets, strike craft just break formations rendering formations useless.

Until the game is more polished up and bugs ironed out, I just can't recommend this remaster in its current state. I still perfer to play the CD versions because it is much more stable.

Unfortunetly, I have crashed a dozen times, had weird graphical glitches that resolved themselves with lowering graphical settings and restarting the client repeatedly and the story line missions are buggy as all get out.  MAKE SURE TO SAVE BEFORE JUMPING TO THE NEXT SYSTEM.  And saving between major events helps too.  If you restart a mission for whatever reason, or it crashed, using the auto-generated saves the mission often won't flag completion, you'll miss research and you will be very frustrated.\n\nAll in all, the graphics are beautiful, controls intuitive, and the game nostolgic.  With all the bugs, this REMASTERing feels more like a visually pretty but unstable beta product.  They may fix the problems over time, but, I am quite dissappointed that my '99 experience of HW was more stable then this remake.\n\n*EDIT* On Mission 12 of HW1:RMI have reached a Can Not Continue bug where the mission objectives are not completing and the cloaked ships are not spawning.  HW1:RM is much too easy and not giving the same replability of Classic.  Lacking controls, UI, tactics and difficulty. Very disillusioned.\nHW2:RM feels much more integrated and even prettier then it was originally.\nI would suggest waiting for Steam Summer Sale and get HW:RM for 50%.

I was relieved to find out that Homeworld holds up to the test of time and in this remastered version it looks better than ever.\n\nThe one thing I remembered about Homeworld was the atmosphere which is enhanced ten fold thanks to the remastering. Nothing compares to sending in a large armada full of fighters, corvettes, ion frigates and destroyers against another force of equal measure and watching the battle play out. Fighters whip around in the void dodging fire and letting loose upon the opposition. Destroyers fire heavy volleys of missles and projectiles which crash into the enemy's ranks. Ships flame out and tumble into an explosion when destroyed or in the case of capital ships they spin around and emit a huge fireball complete with debris. When the battle seems lost you can order your remaining fighters to kamikaze in a last ditch attempt to save the mothership. The backdrops are incredibly beautiful and stunning to look at. This remastered edition makes the game look like I remember it looking.\n\nNow with all that being said there is a bit of jank. Scripting has a tendancy to break. Movement commands get a little fuddled sometimes. I have had a handful of weird audio bugs as well. The zooming in and out via the mousewheel is a bit weird considering the setting being in 3d space you would think you could just keep zooming out to move the field of view up but you can't. A small amount of other issues have me scratching my head sometimes.\n\nTaking all that into consideration Homeworld has always had a special place in my heart. This remastered edition has me skipping and jumping for joy down memory lane as I relive all those massive space battles I remembered having. If you have any reverance for these games buy this edition right now. If this is new to you I encourage giving it a shot. If you aren't hooked before the first two hours of play you can always get a refund through Steam but I am pretty confident if you like space, explosions and strategy you will find a place in your heart for Homeworld as well.","June 21, 2015","true","7.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

In Homeworld and Homeworld 2, resource management is key, every resource you collect on one mission gets transferred to your next, so it is a good idea to use it wisely, often relying on salvage ships to steal enemy ships over building your own.

It used to be considered one of best RTS's ever made set in space combat. After it was remastered it still is one of best RTS's ever created. I have never played original games, bought the game during recent steam sale. Money well spent. The game is just amazing. Homeworld 1 Remastered feels like one is playing Battlestar Galactica (2003-2009). On the other hand Homeworld 2 Remastered is more of war story while keeping up mysticism of 1st game.\nFirst thing I can tell you now the game is not easy, You need to learn its controls and how it works otherwise you will keep loosing. When you learn ropes of the game its extremely pleasant to play and most importantly enemy will still outnumber you, i.e. in 2nd game the enemy will have 10 battlecruisers while you have a cap allowing you to build 2 bc's. Quite unfair considering their firepower but frigates are perfect cannon fodder for that :P\n\nStory of two games is just amazing, both cause you feel rush and despair. Graphics in comparison to original game imporved really well fitting modern standards (including 4k if u can handle it). The soundtrack is purely amazing and is used in appropriate moments to affect us as players when necessary. Adagio for Strings choral by Samuel Barber is actually one of most beautiful songs ever created in our history. Yes, its used in best moments in the Homeworld 1 Remastered! Other soundtrack is also amazing but this very specific song is purest masterpiece of all,\n\nGameplay. It's great. Cant say anything more. Combat is balanced, fights are challanging and its easy to loose if you're not using the thing in ur head at all. This is defiently not casual game where you hop in and immediately become a god in it (like designers of modern games do nowadays with games is just wrong!) Nothing beats sight of full scale fleet vs fleet combat. Bloody yet stunning.\n\nHomeworld Remastered Collection is great offer. You get 4 games (2 original + 2 remastered games) and if you are considering to buy it, do not hesitate. You will not regret spending your money on the game (sale or normally). Right now I feel like a thief for buying on summer sale. This game is worth way more than I've paid for it.\nI feel like I want to keep returning to the game to play it over and over. It is that good, great replayability value and satisfaction from it.\n\nTo sum things up:\n\n+ Nicely improved graphics that fits modern standards\n+ Masterpiece soundtrack (and im quite hard to impress with music)\n+ Great Gameplay and replayability value\n+ Great story that actually makes you feel desperate, in rush\n+ Want more!\n+ Not casual...\n\n- ... which for some console peasants will be a bad thing.\n- some bugs\n- not well explained graphic settings in the video settings","July 12, 2015","true","33.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

Ten hours of playtime later, my refund request has been denied and my local content has been deleted. I really really wanted to enjoy HWRC, but I can't. There are a LOT of bugs. I never played the original Homeworld 2, but apparently in converting HW1 to the HW2 engine, lots of unit behavior changed (or just went away), and unit balance is totally different. Strike craft are nearly useless now. You can't select-box-repair with a support frigate. Formations are more of a suggestion than an order. But the number one show-stopper for me is that resource harvesters will just ... stop. For no reason. I'll be on the other side of the map, micromanaging something, and notice that there is NO $$$ coming in. I'll focus back on my mothership and 5 out of 6 harvesters will just be stuck in space.

We would play Everquest, Counterstrike, and a number of other games into the wee hours of the morning. There was one game there that stood out to me; that game was Homeworld.\n\nHomeworld is an amazing game. A journey through both an amazing, emotional story and wonderful gameplay. The score is driving, the visuals are breathtaking, and the whole experience is awesome.\n\nIf you played this game at original release, then I'm sure you remember the first time loading it up, hearing Samuel Barber's Angus Dei and seeing the Mothership. I know you can recall the emotion felt when the fleet returns to Kharak only to find it burning under an enemy assault. Countless memories flood forth from the mere mention of this cult jewel. Why it wasn't more popular at the time, I will never know.\n\nA friend and I would play this title over Gameranger. We did for a good many years, actually. We would always joke about them doing an updated version of the game (if not a HW 3)...well, those jokes have become a reality. An awesome reality.\n\nIf you're a fan of the original, or curious about this game...I say go for it. It is worth every penny.\n\nIf you are new to the game, I envy you....you're about to take an amazing journey on your way home.","February 25, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Launching the "Classic" version today – only possible thanks to Gearbox recompiling the original code to run on modern operating systems – isn't quite as impressive as it was back in the day. How fortunate then, that they have done a stellar (pardon the pun) job with the Remastered versions of the two main games in the series.\n\nThe graphics are top notch, with some incredibly detailed textures, impressive explosions and beautiful galactic backdrops. Both games now run in the same engine, however I would highly recommend playing Homeworld Remastered before Homeworld 2 Remastered if you're aiming to experience both, since the latter has even better graphics and many more polygons. The new and improved interface (used in both Remastered versions) also gets slightly more cluttered in the sequel, so you might appreciate the easier learning curve of beginning with the first game.\n\nManeuvering a battlefield that goes in all directions can be a bit confusing at times, even when you've memorized all the controls. Occasionally you may find yourself fully zoomed in on an asteroid when all you wanted to do was to check up on your harvesters. If this happens, remember that you can use the Pause button to freeze the action until you find your orientation again. By all means, remember to use the Pause button even when you're not doing close inspections of rocks since it can (and will) seriously help with giving orders in the midst of hundreds of spaceships trying to destroy eachother. Also, a paused battle looks absolutely stunning with all the missiles, ion beams and explosions quietly suspended in space.\n\nStorywise there are a lot of things going on, with both campaigns more or less revolving around the Kushan (player faction) homeworld, Hiigara. While there is a cutscene between every mission that give brief explanations of past and current events, and frequent mentions of (and interactions with) other factions during the campaign, one generally feels a bit disconnected from the universe. The Kushan certainly seem familiar with the the friendly and technologically advanced Bentusi from the start, but who are they anyway? What do they look like, and where do they come from? What do they want? Naturally, those who are interested will find out more on the internet, but players shouldn't expect the games to pique that interest.\n\nWhile certainly not without it's (minor) flaws, if you're into space, strategy and/or Adagio for Strings, the Homeworld series is well worth your time and money. Not just because it started a new genre, but more importantly because it is undoubtedly still the king of said genre.","June 16, 2015","true","35.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Even the cut-scenes have been updated and even look better. Everything has been completely updated including the sounds.\n\nSome things were added to the game, such as fleet grouping controls.\nFor example:\nSelecting 10 vessels and groupling them as fleet 1 then selecting 5 of those vessles and making them group 2, all vessels in the fleet remain group one as well as the 5 that are also group 2.\nThis was something that wasn't included in the original Homeworld when it first came out...at least as far as I can remember...lol...it has been 15 years.\n\nGearbox also updated the play screen with fleet info, mission recall data, and que update that was included in (the lost homeworld game) Cataclysm as well as Homeworld 2. So some helpful bits have been added to make the game what it should have been 15 years ago, but Gearbox hasn't altered the game away from what it was, which was awesome in its own state.\n\nEven the tutorials are still helpful in playing the game. Even if you've never heard of the game and decided to buy it, playing a tutorial in homeworld will definitely give you all the info needed for basic game play. This also trickles into Homeworld 2 as they have the same controls ;-).\n\nAs far as I can tell, everything that was part of the original is included in the remastered version. Since I haven't played through completely, I can't tell if the original song The Ladder- by YES was included as the end song. Its a little over 9 minutes long I think LOL, so you can't miss it.\n\nAll in all, the game remains one the THE BEST RTS games in the genre. Definitely a must have...especially since the original PC game has a very good chance of not working on the newer and faster PC's, not to mention with the updated graphics cards.\n\nI've only seen a handful of games that have been remastered, but only a couple of this age.

A race brought to the very brink of destruction through the violation of a treaty signed millenia ago, left marooned in space clinging to a technology salvaged from ancient ancestors and a single guiding star. Home.\n\nThis sets the stage for one of the greatest space strategy games of all time, Homeworld. A game that has rarely been aspired to since, and a game filled with ideas that even to this day are rarely even touched upon. Only now a few daring indie developers dare brave the complexities that represent true three dimensional space combat and even then they have yet to come even close to what Homeworld achieved. It was lightning in a bottle, a cult classic synthesised from a pace that was stately enough to appreciate the sheer majesty that the game inspired with its' sweeping scale, a soundtrack that was borne of classical tones and distant melancholy, and a story that took you on a true campaign, where your units would carry over from mission to mission, along with your resource pool.\n\nThese are all concepts that in most current campaigns are oft ignored, set aside for flashy Michael Bay style set pieces and much shallower, more simplistic stories. Homeworld told stories of shades of grey, of culture, of alien races with diverse backgrounds and lore, of imperialism, of a nebula home to a technologically advanced enclave that sought refuge and peace within the sanctity of drifting ghostlike threads.\n\nHomeworld Remastered is a restoration of that premise, Gearbox have carefully and considerately taken the Homeworld 2 interface (the better one) and the source assets, placed them in a more modern, more capable and more mod friendly engine, and then carefully brought the game up to current generation standards, with lighting, depth of field, better framerates, higher resolutions, better texturing, cleaned up the sound work, the whole lot. The result quite literally is Homeworld as viewed through the "rose tinted glasses of memory", it's how we always imagined it was in our heads, even if our then much less meaty PC's couldn't QUITE give us the experience that we wished for.\n\nThe change is stark when placed side by side, it's hard to imagine when you fire up remastered thinking that the ships -didn't- look that impressive before, but when you play the original you then are reminded with a shock that yes, they were kinda blocky and yes, the textures were kinda flat back in the day. That's all gone now, the ships really -do- look like their concept art, they really do move with the kind of majesty and detail that we all imagined they did, the mothership is just crammed with detail, and everywhere you look, there's something that just looks *better* than it did before. The sound too, is crisper, with all the sound assets being cleaned up and provided at a higher fidelity, with the music being remastered at a higher bitrate, again, no changes that alter the fabric of the game, but a subtle re-weaving that change the feel into the game we always remembered it as.\n\nYou do get a lot of game for your money too, for the asking cost you'll get both Homeworld 1 and 2 remastered, along with their original source games in case you feel like a trip down nostalgia lane and want to do some side by side comparisons (I suggest you do), you also get the multiplayer which brings all four factions into multiplayer together, which is sure to open up some interesting games once they get the code all sorted out and out of "beta" (for whatever that term means these days), and you'll get what is quite easily still the greatest space opera strategy ever to grace the PC.\n\nGearbox did good. Everyone was holding their breath because I could imagine the kind of fury that would have been issued forth had they scuffed this, but no. They did good, this has made me a happy tiger, Homeworld is a game that deserved to be brought back, it deserved this remastering, and what you get is quite comfortably the "definitive" version of Homeworld.

If you're looking for some fun multiplayer action you'll love this game but if you want to revisit the classic Homeworld campaign I cannot recommend it unless there's a serious effort by the devs to address the many problems in the launch version. Read below for detailed comments.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- Absolutely gorgeous graphics. Everything looks very nice and with some minor tweaking plays smoothly even on my     not-so-good laptop.\n\n- The original artstyle in the cinematics has been faithfully recreated and, again, it all looks very nice.\n\n- Excellent, engaging story in HW1:R, same as the 1999 classic.\n\n- Good voice acting and music bring the experience to life.\n\n- Multiplayer is, despite some balance issues between the HW1 and HW2 races, simply a blast to play.\n\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- The game uses a modified HW2 engine which does not seem to work very well with the HW1 campaign/units. I'm not sure how many of the problems listed below are due to engine limitations and how many can be patched in, if someone more knowlegeable about HW modding can chip in on this I'll edit the review accordingly.\n\n- Strike craft formations/tactics simply do not work for the HW1 units. Strike craft will assume a formation when ordered to but after combat is joined they will attack seemingly random targets on their own flight paths regardless of tactics settings used, making concentrating fire to specific targets impossible and leading to a lot of losses.\n\n- The HW1 remastered campaign in general lacks polish. Missing/bugged mission triggers, wonky AI behaviour (resource collectors in particular will randomly stop harvesting after dropping off their loads), ship engine sound effects persisting after zooming in and then out on some units, sensor manager sometimes just deciding to stop working altogether, repair corvettes apparently not working at all and simply atrocious difficulty scaling.  Expect to reload a lot to get through some missions.\n\n- The dynamic difficulty scaling seems way out of whack for the campaign. The HW1 campaign now uses the (almost universally despised) dynamic difficulty scaling system originally introduced by HW2. In a nutshell, the enemies you'll face are generated depending on your fleet composition at the start of a mission. Some people like this idea, some don't. Regardless of how one feels about it, the system clearly has not been playtested enough as the seeming lack of hard caps on enemy numbers will lead to some unwinnable fights for players who like to build up their fleet. For example, capturing a good number of enemy corvettes in mission 2 will cause an overwhelming number of enemies to spawn in the following mission, leading to a game over before the introductory cutscenes are even finished.\n\nCONCLUSION: I'm really torn on this but I'll have to go with a no recommendation until the flawed port of the HW1 campaign and strike craft mechanics are addressed. If you're a returning HW1 veteran definately hold off on this until the game is (hopefully) patched and/or modded to make the experience closer to the original. On the other hand those new to the series will no doubt appreciate the engaging story of the campaign. The fun multiplayer can also help a lot so consider what you want of the game and take this review as it is.\n\n","February 26, 2015","false","2.0"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

While the originals were epic in their own right, the remastered version changes interface, the graphics (including new features like "battle scars"), and several bug fixes. Plus, it doesn't change the story (at least  didn't notice any changes). another thing, is that it adds the ability to play both the first gen units AND the second gen units, in the same match. So those players that do the whole "oh, X Gen was better than X Gen". you can literally, fight them with those units to settle the score. Another thing is that thier are plenty of mods that change the way the game looks. that way, if you don't like the interface or the way an icon/emblem/ect looks, you can change it.","October 22, 2015","true","63.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The dust clouds in the Supernova station mission are invisible. Good luck finding a path that will lead you to victory.\n2.

As it stands right now they made HW2 okay but completely ruined HW1 in every way shape and form.\n\nFormations in the REAL Homeworld don't work properly, they don't stay in proper formation. Capital ships can't maneuver worth beans, Destroyers are no longer the ultimate utility ship of the fleet anymore. They were designed in HW1 to keep pace with and LEAD the frigate lines. Now they're slow, lumbering beasts that just ♥♥♥♥ me off.\n\nFrigates are now made of wet paper bags and fighters are slow and unmaneuverable, meaning point defenses and even heavier weapons could destroy them. Corvettes are now pointless to build. Basically you just build fighters bombers and super-capitals only and they are all that is worth building.\n\nThe GUI is NOTHING like the original Homeworld which let you have a very clean experience which didn't block anything out. If you didn't need to see the GUI at that moment, it wasn't there. One of the things that made Homeworld loveable was that it assumed you were intelligent.\n\nSingleplayer's adaptive difficulty from HW1 is now gone from what I can tell and it is pathetically easy for an experienced HW Vet. I had little trouble in the first few missions, which was dissappointing to say the least.\n\nFuel consumption no longer exists for fighters which means that when I eventually reach the Garden of Kadesh I can expect to be utterly massacred by the Kadeshi. This makes the Support Frigate a useless item. Honestly, why have them anymore at all?! The whole ballance is gone by removing fuel consumption, barring the other things they've utterly mucked up.\n\nI'm happy that they thought it worth the effort to do a remastered edition but they sacrificed the original Homeworld ENTIRELY in order to satisfy the Homeworld 2 players. The thing is... There is a LOT more Homeworld 1 fans that stayed true and bought this than there were Homeworld 2 fans (at least if my group of friends is any indication).\n\nGearbox... Hear us! Fix your rather glaring mistakes! Homeworld 1 should have been the priority... Especially since THAT is the one that won Game of the Year in 1999. And lets be honest... It had some pretty TALL competition back then for that title. It didn't just win Strategy Game of the Year, it won overall Game of the Year....\n\nFrankly I want a refund because this wasn't true to the Homeworld legacy at all... As far as I am concerned the basic models for the ships are the same and then cut-scenes are the same. The rest is garbage.\n\n","February 26, 2015","false","3.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

I had to restart the level. (This was like 4 minutes into the game, seriously Gearbox have you never heard of BETA TESTING !!!)\n\n- 2nd Resource collector I built dissappeared on level 1 after I sent it to harvest some resources. THERE ARE NO ENEMIES ON THAT LEVEL !!!\n\n- When the game asks you to stop a Turnanic Carrier from escaping, I destroyed it promptly and it said MISSION FAILED and the Hyperspace button appeared to complete the mission but I could only use the restart the mission button....\n\n- Encounter with Bentusi to trade. Bentusi ship and Mothership have a Star Trek esque standoff right in front of each other. This blocks your Mothership from undocking Capital class vessels from its 'side door', so had the mobile resource unit I just built stuck for about 10 minutes.\n\n- Support ships fail to dock with resource collectors resulting in a very bizzare dance of the 2 ships which left both ships blown up on the Radiation field level.\n\n- Black Camera AGAIN !!!! when you're on the edge of the Homeworld system to destroy a hyperspace inhibitor. Yet another Mission restart.\n\nI haven't even completed the game yet but I believe that this prompt review/WARNING was warranted.\n\nThis severe lack of bug testing tells me that the game was hurried into release, whereas all other assets point to what should be an amazing remake.

Destroyed enemy carrier at end of mission 4, game went to mission failed, yet computer was telling me I completed it and the hyperspace button was showing behind the mission failed window. Did entire mission again and it worked.\n4. Stopped playing at this point, as I didn't want to waste time playing and hitting another mission advancement bug.

I will post a review of HW2:R seperately.\n\nI will start off by saying I only leave reviews in cases of extreme, has to be so good or so bad to illicit a review. This game is definitely not the latter. I have played many RTS games through my life and very few were able to tell such a tale as well  as this one has. The journey was enthralling and gripping and has so many interesting events along the way. The combat is great and while the scenery leaves room for improvemnet it is hardly missed when your fleet engages the enemy and capital ships trade blows while fighters and corvettes dance through a three dimensional space. I enjoyed every mission many of which had different obstacles and goals to keep you interested and sometimes force you to use very different approaches, spamming a ton of two units wont get you far like many RTS out there. A must buy for anyone who enjoys RTS or space games, seriously get it.\n\n\n11/10 would make the journey again.","February 4","true","37.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"

I played Empire Earth, Age of Empires, Sins of a Solar Empire, the original Starcraft and, last but not least, Homeworld 1 & 2 and Cataclysm. I adore these types of games. I live, breathe these types of games, but recently there has been such a drought of RTS games, except the phenomenal Grey Goo. But here, here we have it; the pinnicale of the past; one of the greatest games remastered and available on a digital platform. I can only exclaim, YES.\n\nNow, that my rant is over. I wanna name a few of my favorite aspects of Homeworld. Firstly, the music is to die for. It's glorious, epic, space ambient music with new age singing overlapping. As a huge fan of music, but mostly of metal, I can say this OST rivals many classics. The visuals are another strong point, there's something to be said about a game that can make spaceships docking into a hull fun to look at and experience, and the awesome "focus" feature which allows you to zoom in to see battles close up. The style/aesthetic is another fantastic point, sci-fi RTS games are rare but this one is easily one of the best. Most of all, though, I love the story. The story is a breathtaking space opera of epic proportions, it offers questions and makes an imagination run wild, it makes you sad and unkempt, but picks you right back up more hopeful than ever. It's a rollercoaster.\n\nThis version isn't complete yet, though, since bugs are rather rampant. I hope Gearbox takes heed and fixes 'em but be warned, this game still has some problems/glitches. I will omit this paragraph as soon as these are fixed.\n\nThat said, BRB, gonna relive my childhood.","February 25, 2015","true","10.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Dynamic difficulty. What is that?\n\nYou have ships of total power 5, the next encounter has enemy ships of 7 power. You have total power 7? The encounter will be of power 9. You have 10 power? You go against enemy power 13. And so on. You always deal with a supreme force. A fleet equal to yours and somewhat better to counter the human brain superiority against CPU AI.\n\nThe main supportive idea behind that is that you cannot focus on build a massive fleet and win by numbers. You have to use 'real strategy' and 'real tactics' to win. At least that is what they majority of fans are saying.\n\nWell i disagree. And the reason is simple. Firstly, i beat the game and without any save-load-try again stuff. Not a big deal, most players can do, if not they need some retries and that is all. Really, since when load and retry is a deep strategy and tactic?!?!\n\nOn top of that, why build a lot of ships? The game does not count your stored resources for adjusting difficulty. You go with few ships, face few ships, build a few more and keep going. If that is strategy and tactic i am Napoleon.\n\nNot to mention the salvage corvette thing. Two corvette class ships can disable and salvage a frigate (and larger classes) but 2 combet class corvettes cannot take down a frigate. The salvage class ships would make sence if they salvage disabled or heavy damaged ships. This looks like a cheat to me and not a tactic.\n\nTo make a long story short, do not build many ships, have 2-4-6 and so on salvage corvs, build few ships after the encounter has spawned and you are good for the entire game. Do not use your resources to build ships in advance before you hyperspace. 'To be prepared' obviously is not this game's motto. 'Play dead' is more like it.\n\nNice experience from a view, i do not rememeber any other RTS punishing the hard prepared folks.","January 31","false","9.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","3"

Both the remastered and original versions are included. The graphics are indeed very good but then it goes downhill...\n\nThe audio (music) is very similar but some of the voices have been altered - I prefer the originals. On my original PC this pushed the limits performance-wise so I was pleased when I could now push everything up to 11 - and it all worked well (only occasional crashes).\n\nBut what has utterly ruined it is the interface. It's clunky, some of the key combinations dont work when they are supposed to, the key bindings have changed from the original game - and some of them cant be re-assigned.\n\nCoupled with the lack of *Military (the default) ship formation for setting up squadrons, this makes it sooo hard to play and keep track of everything. I gave up after a couple of hours and got my money back (thanks to the Steam refund policy).\n\nI'f you've never played Homeworld you may like it and you would accept it as it is, not knowing any better.

That was about 13 years ago, and even after playing every single spaceship-related game I could get my hands on, I never found anything which went into quite as much depth with story, lore and gameplay as Homeworld.\n\nNow believe me I was just as hyped as the next person when Homeworld: Remastered was announced - in fact my dad would tell you I nearly brought the ceiling down with my enthusiasm, especially when I discovered that it was Gearbox, well-known for producing the Borderlands series (which I am also a HUGE fan of) was in charge of spearheading the project and bringing it to us. When it came out I didn't really see much of the shtick it got for myself, but after taking more time to play it since I have unearthed its little issues that the original game lacks. The good thing about this though is that you get the original games bundled with the remastered versions, so if the Remastered versions' issues become a bit much for you, you can easily revert to them to take a break. Now I'll give a breakdown of my own personal pros and cons, make of them what you will!\n\n\nPROS -\n\n- The game is, of course, remastered - graphically speaking, the game is stunning - the lighting is perfection, the backgrounds of matches are perfect, and the various ships look beautiful with their new models - the frigates even have moving turrets, which I think was lacking in the original game. There is not a single flaw in the graphical side of the remastering, at least in my opinion.\n\n- The campaigns for both games have remained pretty much untouched - but a new GUI allows for easier interaction with the game world and better control over what comes into your mothership and what leaves it.\n\n- The ship upgrade system located under the research section allows players to upgrade the stats of their various ships, including damage, defense, health and occasionally speed. They can also be used to teach some ships new abilities. In the campaign mode you are limited to when you get these upgrades however as many of them tie into the story in various ways.\n\n- The addition of mod support, although often shaky at times, does allow for the addition of custom races, ship logos, maps and I think even gameplay modes. Some of these mods can even be used in online play, which I think is fantastic.\n\n- While the original Homeworld soundtrack has been left untouched and rightly so, the Homeworld 2 soundtrack recieved a remastering which has drastically improved the sound of its music, which was in the original game something of a partial failure (Some of the songs sounded shoddy or rushed for example but these issues have been fixed in the remastered soundtrack).\n\n- The lore is extensive and beautiful for this game, but many people are often unaware of this without having access to the original Homeworld manual, which was a hand-me-down from my dad which I still read regularly. The details contained within the manual are available on the Homeworld wikia for those who are curious about learning the extensive background of this universe, as much of it isn't actually mentioned in-game or at least not in a way that some people would really understand or remember.\n\nCONS -\n\n- The original game didn't have any bugs or glitches that I can remember. This one has a great deal of them, however - simple things like unresponsive ships, the occasional crash and other silly things you could perhaps expect from a game, but still annoying due to how flawless the original felt.\n\n- Mods often deselect themselves and don't load after being used in-game for only one match. Sometimes mods don't work at all or crash the game, which is appearntly a very common occurrence.\n\n- The patches do help but often don't fix the really important issues, such as common issues with multiplayer and mods.\n\n- Some gameplay aspects that people really enjoyed were for some reason removed, such as the ability to Salvage (why they even bothered leaving the poor little Salvage Corvette in the game is beyond me, considering that in the main storyline of Homeworld 1 they are practically useless after the 3rd chapter now and just sit there collecting dust until destroyed by enemies) and also the need to refuel ships. While I actually think of this as a good thing, there have been complaints about it and I can imagine that for some people it must have taken some of the survivability element away from them.\n\n- Although I have no solid proof at this time, I've heard that there are serious issues with multiplayer on occasion. Multiplayer also allows you to play as any of the races from the two games, which in some cases could be a little unfair as the races from Homeworld 2 have packs of Interceptors rather than one Interceptor per construction (just an example, I know there are others too), as well as having better ships overall.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is worth its sale price, but maybe is only worth its true retail price to the hardcore fans who will appreciate it and can ignore its flaws indefinitely.\n\nAlso another tip: If you are one of the owners of the original CD of the game which came with the soundtrack on CD, you don't need to buy the Homeworld 1 Remastered Soundtrack. It's literally the same music. If your CD is still around or in good condition, use that instead and save your money :P However the Homeworld 2 Remastered Soundtrack is different from the original as stated above and is very much worth the money in my opinion.","November 25, 2015","true","14.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Multiplayer also allows you to play as any of the races from the two games, which in some cases could be a little unfair as the races from Homeworld 2 have packs of Interceptors rather than one Interceptor per construction (just an example, I know there are others too), as well as having better ships overall.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is worth its sale price, but maybe is only worth its true retail price to the hardcore fans who will appreciate it and can ignore its flaws indefinitely.\n\nAlso another tip: If you are one of the owners of the original CD of the game which came with the soundtrack on CD, you don't need to buy the Homeworld 1 Remastered Soundtrack. It's literally the same music. If your CD is still around or in good condition, use that instead and save your money :P However the Homeworld 2 Remastered Soundtrack is different from the original as stated above and is very much worth the money in my opinion.","November 25, 2015","true","14.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Somehow, this series completely passed me by.\n\nAfter two solid hours of playing the remastered version of the first game, I am in love. The UI and controls are intuitive and smart, and the game systems are rock solid. To anyone in my situation contemplating whether or not this is worth the money, I'd say go for it.\n\nWhat truly makes this stand out to me is that it feels like a space opera. The story has grabbed me right from the get-go, and the immersion is like nothing I've ever experienced before. What really does it, in my view, is that with each new mission/objective, you keep your fleet and resources throughout the campaign. I don't know of another RTS game which does this anywhere near as well.\n\nThe game feels like a journey home, and reminds me of the (later) 2006 series, Battlestar Galactica. It's fantastically written, the soundtrack is incredible and the world feels gigantic.\n\nProbably the best <£30 game I have bought in years.\n\nVery, very highly recommended.","February 26, 2015","true","27.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamermanshut/recommended/244160/","gamermanshut","Permanent Marker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamermanshut/","225 products in account","Homeworld is a very niche game. If you like space battles and want to see the absolute best there is on offer from any game to be frank, you'd want this game.\n\nThe actual game itself here is a bit of a rough diamond. The gameplay involves a spherical map where you can move your ships in basically any direction up or down as well as in the horizontal plane, which in theory would open up tactics and such. In practice, its mostly a minor annoyance, for all it is technically impressive. It is tactically useless, for the most part. You could the vast scope of the map, particularly its height to hide, but hiding is never practical to be honest - unless you're gimping yourself against the AI and carefully setting it up,  you're not making a battlestar galactica style comeback if you get smashed early on.\n\nThe gameplay boils down to who has the best fleet and the best target acquisition.  You select everything, and send it into the fray all at the same time and then click the enemy to death. The aesthetics are really down to your taste but personally I hate the design of the HW2 ships pretty much across the board while the Kushan in HW1 are in the same boat as looking awful (fighters look like flying ice cream tubs)  the Taidann look far more convincing and the only ships I really enjoy looking at. The NPC races in the campaign look pretty atmospheric and fitting as well.\n\nThe HW1 campaign is in the vein of traditional RTS games, where there are some missions with some absurd challenge that you need to try multiple times, which is a double edged sword but I think generally it works. It makes the game more interesting and about learning rather than turtling and then sending the biggest possible fleet at something. If you want the best experience, I'd never reload a save, (but you will spend hours waiting for resources to collect or fleets to build) and the reason for this is that with the gimmicky missions there's generally a key lesson that you'll learn or figure out on the first go, so the second attempt is really easy. In one mission, you'll find your small craft will almost always get wiped out due to overwhelming firepower. The solution is to just dock them in your carrier/mothership.\n\nUnits carry over between missions. In the original game, this meant that if you spent hours waiting to collect all resources before moving on, you'd have a significant advantage in the next mission. In remastered, you get all resources all over the map at the start of the next mission. There's a clear reason why Gearbox has made this change but it makes the last few levels ♥♥♥♥ easy.\n\nThe last 2-3 missions stop being unique like this and essentially become move and attack fests where you move your death fleet across the map and slowly destroy everything. The enemy fleets don't scale well to your own superfleet that is carried between missions and just about the most challenging large fleet action is in one later mission  where you effectively have to leave a small force of  capital ships behind to defend your mothership from flankers while you win the mission.\n\nHW2's campaign is better designed such that a few of these problems are less significant or non-existent. The difficulty is more consistent throughout unlike in the first game where the difficulty is far worse at the beginning of the campaign. The story elements in both games aren't anything overwhelmingly special but are pretty decent and get the job done.\n\nIn terms of the remastered elements, Gearbox didn't totally screw it up, but they did do a pretty ♥♥♥♥ poor job. If, like me, you have a fairly new AMD card with the latest drivers, you can't play either of the classic games as they will instantly CTD on launch. This issue has been around for several months and hasn't been fixed, and likely won't ever be fixed.  One graphical issue I've seen involves ships becoming completely see-through. This has been around since release and hasn't been fixed definitively, though there is a solution - its as overwhelming basic as changing the properties on the HW shortcut, so its pretty pathetic that its still around. In terms of campaign bugs, some missions or objectives fail to complete and particularly the infamous asteroid mission has artificial difficulty stemming from the stupidity of the pathfinding AI literally flying into rocks, and the long pause between being able to target split up asteroids.\n\nOne of the main reasons you may want to get it is because of the brilliant mods made for classic that are being ported to remastered (though extremely slowly - none of the major ones have yet made the transition) that literally serve to make Homeworld a platform for simulating any space warfare universe imaginable. There's Freespace 2, Halo, BSG, Star Wars, Star Trek, even Wing Commander amongst other things.\n\n\nI'd say the game is still worth getting on sale, even despite all these faults. There is a net gain in enjoyment from playing this game, though be warned if you have an AMD card.\n\nI'd give the game about a 7/10 on a scale where 5 is *the* average game, and not an "average game".\n\n\n\n\n","October 8, 2015","false","19.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But unfortunately Gearbox rehash does not do it justice.\n\nThe graphics are nice but all in all not much of an improvement to be honest not with the current technology (Congrats on improving some textures including the odd explosion).\n\nThe other thing that really gets me is that they have butchered a great useable interface with something that seems unfinished. Which is functionality lacking drastically, seemingly clunky and cumbersome.\n\nNot just functionality though it seems entire original functions are missing, for instance one example (of many) a simple toggling ship overlays in map overview which very useful in the original not only helped manage your fleet but also added aesthetic, I really coudl go on but I don't want to waste my life here.\n\nGrouping seem hit and miss to having a tendency to disappear on saves in single player, formations don't stick docking procedures don't stay docked.\n\nFor a graphics overhaul they could have at least got it right.\n\nEven a little imagination with achievements could have gone along way.\n\nShame to say although the nostalgia trip was a nice one to go down, it feels yet again gearbox have released another game that is not even scraping half-arsed anymore and broken.\n\nI think the only thing that may hold this game a float and any reason I may come back to it, is the workshop for multiplayer with my friends.","December 9, 2015","false","28.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamermanshut/recommended/244160/","gamermanshut","Permanent Marker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamermanshut/","225 products in account","Homeworld is a very niche game. If you like space battles and want to see the absolute best there is on offer from any game to be frank, you'd want this game.\n\nThe actual game itself here is a bit of a rough diamond. The gameplay involves a spherical map where you can move your ships in basically any direction up or down as well as in the horizontal plane, which in theory would open up tactics and such. In practice, its mostly a minor annoyance, for all it is technically impressive. It is tactically useless, for the most part. You could the vast scope of the map, particularly its height to hide, but hiding is never practical to be honest - unless you're gimping yourself against the AI and carefully setting it up,  you're not making a battlestar galactica style comeback if you get smashed early on.\n\nThe gameplay boils down to who has the best fleet and the best target acquisition.  You select everything, and send it into the fray all at the same time and then click the enemy to death. The aesthetics are really down to your taste but personally I hate the design of the HW2 ships pretty much across the board while the Kushan in HW1 are in the same boat as looking awful (fighters look like flying ice cream tubs)  the Taidann look far more convincing and the only ships I really enjoy looking at. The NPC races in the campaign look pretty atmospheric and fitting as well.\n\nThe HW1 campaign is in the vein of traditional RTS games, where there are some missions with some absurd challenge that you need to try multiple times, which is a double edged sword but I think generally it works. It makes the game more interesting and about learning rather than turtling and then sending the biggest possible fleet at something. If you want the best experience, I'd never reload a save, (but you will spend hours waiting for resources to collect or fleets to build) and the reason for this is that with the gimmicky missions there's generally a key lesson that you'll learn or figure out on the first go, so the second attempt is really easy. In one mission, you'll find your small craft will almost always get wiped out due to overwhelming firepower. The solution is to just dock them in your carrier/mothership.\n\nUnits carry over between missions. In the original game, this meant that if you spent hours waiting to collect all resources before moving on, you'd have a significant advantage in the next mission. In remastered, you get all resources all over the map at the start of the next mission. There's a clear reason why Gearbox has made this change but it makes the last few levels ♥♥♥♥ easy.\n\nThe last 2-3 missions stop being unique like this and essentially become move and attack fests where you move your death fleet across the map and slowly destroy everything. The enemy fleets don't scale well to your own superfleet that is carried between missions and just about the most challenging large fleet action is in one later mission  where you effectively have to leave a small force of  capital ships behind to defend your mothership from flankers while you win the mission.\n\nHW2's campaign is better designed such that a few of these problems are less significant or non-existent. The difficulty is more consistent throughout unlike in the first game where the difficulty is far worse at the beginning of the campaign. The story elements in both games aren't anything overwhelmingly special but are pretty decent and get the job done.\n\nIn terms of the remastered elements, Gearbox didn't totally screw it up, but they did do a pretty ♥♥♥♥ poor job. If, like me, you have a fairly new AMD card with the latest drivers, you can't play either of the classic games as they will instantly CTD on launch. This issue has been around for several months and hasn't been fixed, and likely won't ever be fixed.  One graphical issue I've seen involves ships becoming completely see-through. This has been around since release and hasn't been fixed definitively, though there is a solution - its as overwhelming basic as changing the properties on the HW shortcut, so its pretty pathetic that its still around. In terms of campaign bugs, some missions or objectives fail to complete and particularly the infamous asteroid mission has artificial difficulty stemming from the stupidity of the pathfinding AI literally flying into rocks, and the long pause between being able to target split up asteroids.\n\nOne of the main reasons you may want to get it is because of the brilliant mods made for classic that are being ported to remastered (though extremely slowly - none of the major ones have yet made the transition) that literally serve to make Homeworld a platform for simulating any space warfare universe imaginable. There's Freespace 2, Halo, BSG, Star Wars, Star Trek, even Wing Commander amongst other things.\n\n\nI'd say the game is still worth getting on sale, even despite all these faults. There is a net gain in enjoyment from playing this game, though be warned if you have an AMD card.\n\nI'd give the game about a 7/10 on a scale where 5 is *the* average game, and not an "average game".\n\n\n\n\n","October 8, 2015","false","19.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But unfortunately Gearbox rehash does not do it justice.\n\nThe graphics are nice but all in all not much of an improvement to be honest not with the current technology (Congrats on improving some textures including the odd explosion).\n\nThe other thing that really gets me is that they have butchered a great useable interface with something that seems unfinished. Which is functionality lacking drastically, seemingly clunky and cumbersome.\n\nNot just functionality though it seems entire original functions are missing, for instance one example (of many) a simple toggling ship overlays in map overview which very useful in the original not only helped manage your fleet but also added aesthetic, I really coudl go on but I don't want to waste my life here.\n\nGrouping seem hit and miss to having a tendency to disappear on saves in single player, formations don't stick docking procedures don't stay docked.\n\nFor a graphics overhaul they could have at least got it right.\n\nEven a little imagination with achievements could have gone along way.\n\nShame to say although the nostalgia trip was a nice one to go down, it feels yet again gearbox have released another game that is not even scraping half-arsed anymore and broken.\n\nI think the only thing that may hold this game a float and any reason I may come back to it, is the workshop for multiplayer with my friends.","December 9, 2015","false","28.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Now, it's like Gearbox went, took the old games and cranked the awesome factor up to 11.  Having all four of the old factions fighting on one map at once???  Nothing but supreme carnage and mayhem.  I LOVE IT.\n\nAlso, Taidan mothership's voice is AMAZEBALLS.  The combination of Satan and Alduin being broadcast through a evil robot.\n\nSo would i recommend this game???

For I remember playing the Classic Homeworld when it first came out and seeing it redone was just plain awesome. The new graphics and such are great. Seeing the old Mothership 01 redone was great. Seeing the old Classic ships redone was great. While I have yet to finish the Campaigns of either of the games I do admit I am looking forword to playing them in the near future for it shall be a treat.\n\nThat said, there are some issues that I have with the game:\nNo Time Compression therefore those long after mission resource gathering bits are quite boring.\nI actually liked the old Classic Manager Screens but that is not really a large issue and I can get use to it in time I am just a fan of the old screens.\nScuttle can be used with one click of the hotkey or the UI Button on screen. I have lost a couple ships this way by missclicking which included the Mothership which was quite a shock for I was in the middle of a battle and suddenly I scuttled the Mothership. I want the old double-click scuttle back so this doesn't happen.\nThe Campaign After-Mission Hyperspace UI Button is in the freaking middle of the screen. I would like to have it somewhere else in the UI so I can do final after-mission stuff like finishing harvesting and construction or researh before I head on to the next mission.\nNo Raider Attack Mission, which if I rememeber right was supposed to be included with the Remastered Campaign but apparently I don't see it.\nAnyhow, this game is great coming back from the grave and I shall see about going on to finish the Campaigns in the day ahead. Thanks gearbox for bringing back these great games. Now get to work on Homeworld 3 or the Shipbreakers game.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAlright I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥! I just realized a couple things while playing the game which really made me get a bit upset. First of all in HW1 Remastered you cannot fully capture ships. You can grab them with your Salvage Corvettes and take them back to the Mothership. HOWEVER, they do not come back out under your control. Instead it looks like you get RUs in exchange. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! The one major fun part of the original HW1 game was going out and capturing enemy ships before using them against your enemies. Now you changed it! What...the...Heck!\n\nGah! If that isn't enough the damn Formations are wacked up. I tried to put my Fighters and Corvettes into a Sphere Formation to Guard a Salvage Corvette in Mission Two like I normally do when I am playing the original game. However the escortings craft don't even do a sphere around the darn Corvette like they are supposed too! I almost lost my Salvage Corvette because the damn escorts were too busy dogfighting enemy craft then protecting my poor Salvage Corvette. Then there is the Repair Corvette which in the original game you could have it guarding a couple ships where it can heal its charges in the thick of battle. However this can only be used on one ship. What in the world is going on here! Gah!!\n\nThanks alot Gearbox!!","February 25, 2015","true","20.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I spent a lot of time in the campaign, and in botmatches.  I even tried playing with the modding for a bit.  It was amazing.\nAnd now we have this.\nComing from only having played Homeworld Remastered, not 2, or the Classics, or the multiplayer, I can say it is... exactly how it was.\nIt even played performance-wise the same way!  I have a 550 Ti, and this this thing managed to pull a reliable 30 fps through 80% of the game, but there was a bit of dip in combat, so it was just like old times on my crappy Celeron PC back in the ages.\n\nNow, the remastered version uses the Homeworld 2 engine, so if you only ever played Homeworld 1, you might be a little bit confused.  I think the changes to the engine are a nice touch.  I spent quite a lot of time admiring that all the ships look exactly the same, but just... better.  The small details are REALLY nice, and I haven't even begun to touch them yet.  I have to work tomorrow. ...maybe...\nFor instance, when the Turanic Raiders are encountered, focus on one of corvettes' missiles. You'll see.\n\nAnyway, there's any number of tangents I can go on, but basically, this game lives up to the hype machine that was created for it.  I only got to mission 5, and I already don't reget buying this as a pre-order.  I wouldn't regret buying it again for a different computer at full price.  If you loved either Homeworld game, but especially both of them, buy this.\nIt will not be a game you regret buying.\nI look forward to fragging some of you in multiplayer.  :)\n\n\nCons:  Still no Cataclysm.","February 26, 2015","true","123.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Multitasking and designating your squads to defend carriers as well sending other squads to deal with the enemy carriers while you continuously harvest more resources and research. There is so much going on.\n\nThe ui is slightly different, personally I liked the old UI but this new UI all it takes is getting used to.\n\nThe PVP part of the game is where I think it will really make or break the game for the future. Personally I like the hyperdrive element brings in so many strategies like a decoy attack to the front of an enemy base while your team mate hyperdrives behind the enemy base and nukes.\n\nThis game is awesome, if your in to RTS even as a solo player I would defo recommended it, the skirmishes against the CPU can be quite fun as well if you don’t like PVP.\n","February 26, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Gearbox have a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ track record in my book so I was sceptical.\n\nWell the game looks and feels great and is an absolute nostalgic blast. Once you hear the Ion beams and the delightfully nonchalant battle chatter (a welcome distraction from the try-too-hard cliché military gruff stuff we are used to nowadays) you feel right at home. Controls still hold up, though I would've wished a middle mouse button camera panning. It's a nice throwback to when RTS wasn't about unit spam or superhuman micro capabilities.\n\nThe visuals are neat. Seing HW1 in this fidelity is a treat, HW2 also looks nicer but the leap isn't that big comparatively. Ship damage is still just pre-rendered 2d sprites but even those got increased resolutions. FOV is also cool but really gimmicky. Overall performance is decent, could be better though seeing as this isn't exactly cream of the crop visually despite all enhancements. This is still a 15 year old engine at its heart.\n\nNegatives are that the AI wasn't improved and is still kind of dumb. They'll get stomped even if they keep up with your economy. Also the UI scaling doesn't affect the ever obnoxiously large sidebar.\n\nOverall a recommended buy, for the ability to play this on current systems alone.","February 25, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My biggest problem with Remastered is that in Homeworld 1 you can no longer choose to play as either Kushan or Taiidani nor can you alter the paint scheme. The former can be excused, with ample applications of salvette, but the latter is a bit aggravating as a veteran of the original.\n2. The cutscenes, both between missions and in-game, in Homeworld 1 seem a bit faster than the original versions... it's nitpicky but it kind of feels off to me slightly.\n3. The streamlining of Homeworld 1 in terms of screens (no more separate build or research screeen from the normal one) though welcomed in certain regards also makes it a bit painful to macromanage everything. In the original the gameplay would pause when you were in the other two screens ergo it is a bit missed somewhat.\n\n","February 26, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That is not necessarily bad - or good - but is something you should be aware of.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, there's some region limiting that can be worked around, but you don't get more epic space battles than multiplayer Homeworld. Nothing even compares.\n\nI note that a lot mention bugs. I haven't run into any, for what it's worth.","February 26, 2015","true","91.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My biggest problem with Remastered is that in Homeworld 1 you can no longer choose to play as either Kushan or Taiidani nor can you alter the paint scheme. The former can be excused, with ample applications of salvette, but the latter is a bit aggravating as a veteran of the original.\n2. The cutscenes, both between missions and in-game, in Homeworld 1 seem a bit faster than the original versions... it's nitpicky but it kind of feels off to me slightly.\n3. The streamlining of Homeworld 1 in terms of screens (no more separate build or research screeen from the normal one) though welcomed in certain regards also makes it a bit painful to macromanage everything. In the original the gameplay would pause when you were in the other two screens ergo it is a bit missed somewhat.\n\n","February 26, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is a wonderful remaster that has brought this timeless classic back into modern gaming. It has a wonderful campaign that is a moving space opera that urges you to keep playing. Do keep in mind that as of this review, the multiplayer is in BETA. I would buy this for the campaign rather than the multiplayer, but it is indeed worth the price.\n\nHowever if you played Homeworld 1 and you're buying this for a remastered version of the original, they have changed some things (HW2 UI, no fuel management, scaled enemies based on your force in the campaign, no Yes song in the ending) but it is still an extremely enjoyable experience. Even if you don't like the remaster, you still get the originals in this collection to play to your hearts content. The originals packed in this collection are exactly the same as the ones you would buy in the box 15 years ago.\n\nThank you Gearbox from the bottom of my heart for making this happen.","March 1, 2015","true","12.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game looks beautiful and the intro missions really encourage you to continue on your quest. The balance of this game is off, leaning towards a mass of ion cannon frigates, destroyers and heavy cruisers. Hard counters are not hard enough, specially when facing a mass of fighters in one of the missions or several ion cannon frigates in another mission. It boils down to "can i outgun you before you destroy me?" with ion cannon frigates. The automatic balance worked very strangely during my run, giving me two very easy final missions. The AI can be wonky ni your favor or against you, some units may stay put, some will follow a single probe to infinity and beyond or sometime you may be relentlessly attacked, also movement in this game and the next takes time and theres no time compression. All in all if you played old time RTS like command and conquer (the first one) you should be fine with the interface and controls.\n\nStory and sound\nThe story has a good start a sluggish middle chapter and a fantastic resolution even thou the final battle itself is not that epic, i was enthralled at the start almost quit playing at mission 10 when a game breaking bug ocurred but pushed on to Mission 11 where stuff happens and it was one wild ride to the end. The voice acting is monotonous as it was on the first original game, i feel some of the "feels" were lost when no emotions are shown by the different voice actors with the exception of the mothership which is a "machine". Finally the soundtrack that really grabbed me in the entire game was the Homeworld version of Adagio for Strings that really enhances the scenes it is played on.\n\nConclusion for Homeworld 1 Remastered\nBear with the mechanics, enjoy the story, bask in the glow of ion cannons! Also someone needs to slow down those support frigates....\n\nHomeworld 2 Remastered\n\nThe game\nIf you played the first then the second uses the exact same mechanics but balances out some of the problems of the first game, small crafts comes in squadrons and fighters and bombers remain viable to the end game (mostly fighters). Ion cannon frigates are now for the most past useless-ish unless you can hide them properly behind destroyers and battleships. Formations are still broken, you need to macro manage your ship classes to prevent your corvettes or frigates form making contact with the enemy before your bigger ships which would result in the complete anhilation of your smaller craft. 3D movement is still wonky and the AI can be..how can i put this?...dense, for example in one of the missions you are tasked with destroying a ship, in the map theres another ship reinforcing or producing more units but these units stayed put until i destroyed the objetive and won the mission, so i felt no pressue. I did enjoy the tactical aspect more as i had to carefully position my ships to pull and counter the attacks during several missions. Small cradt counters work better now and capital ships can take move hits unlike Homeworld 1 were a few ion cannon frigates would melt a heavy cruiser or destroyer in seconds. In the end the balanced reamained in the capital ships and fighters craft to defend them.\n\nStory and sound\nThe story is much better told and presented, the soundtrack introduced songs with different rhythms like the one during the "boss" fights. The voice acting remains monotonous but the cast is more diverse this time around, still some of the "feels" are lost due to the voices.\n\nConclusion for Homeworld 2 Remastered\nBear with the interface (again), enjoy the story, enjoy the music, enjoy using tactics to engage some enemies.","July 22, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That said, this game is amazing!\n\nStunning models and graphics, great story and cut-scenes, and easy to learn controls are just the tip of the iceberg.  The skirmish mode lets you play with huge fleets in large scale wars which is a blast. The great mods being uploaded to the Steam Workshop only enhance that experience.\n\nWhile some people, probably most of the veteran players, dislike that both games in the collection (HW1 and HW2) are built in the HW2 engine, as a newcomer to Homeworld, I felt it made the whole experience more intuitive.  The transition between the two games was easy as it all felt the same. Two seperate engines might has disrupted the flow as players who just got accustomed to HW1's engine would now have to figure out the small changes made in HW2 and force a change in their mindset.\n\nAll in all, an amazing, amazing game. I highly recommend!\n\nCan't wait for Homeworld 3! :)","September 3, 2015","true","51.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The game looks beautiful and the intro missions really encourage you to continue on your quest. The balance of this game is off, leaning towards a mass of ion cannon frigates, destroyers and heavy cruisers. Hard counters are not hard enough, specially when facing a mass of fighters in one of the missions or several ion cannon frigates in another mission. It boils down to "can i outgun you before you destroy me?" with ion cannon frigates. The automatic balance worked very strangely during my run, giving me two very easy final missions. The AI can be wonky ni your favor or against you, some units may stay put, some will follow a single probe to infinity and beyond or sometime you may be relentlessly attacked, also movement in this game and the next takes time and theres no time compression. All in all if you played old time RTS like command and conquer (the first one) you should be fine with the interface and controls.\n\nStory and sound\nThe story has a good start a sluggish middle chapter and a fantastic resolution even thou the final battle itself is not that epic, i was enthralled at the start almost quit playing at mission 10 when a game breaking bug ocurred but pushed on to Mission 11 where stuff happens and it was one wild ride to the end. The voice acting is monotonous as it was on the first original game, i feel some of the "feels" were lost when no emotions are shown by the different voice actors with the exception of the mothership which is a "machine". Finally the soundtrack that really grabbed me in the entire game was the Homeworld version of Adagio for Strings that really enhances the scenes it is played on.\n\nConclusion for Homeworld 1 Remastered\nBear with the mechanics, enjoy the story, bask in the glow of ion cannons! Also someone needs to slow down those support frigates....\n\nHomeworld 2 Remastered\n\nThe game\nIf you played the first then the second uses the exact same mechanics but balances out some of the problems of the first game, small crafts comes in squadrons and fighters and bombers remain viable to the end game (mostly fighters). Ion cannon frigates are now for the most past useless-ish unless you can hide them properly behind destroyers and battleships. Formations are still broken, you need to macro manage your ship classes to prevent your corvettes or frigates form making contact with the enemy before your bigger ships which would result in the complete anhilation of your smaller craft. 3D movement is still wonky and the AI can be..how can i put this?...dense, for example in one of the missions you are tasked with destroying a ship, in the map theres another ship reinforcing or producing more units but these units stayed put until i destroyed the objetive and won the mission, so i felt no pressue. I did enjoy the tactical aspect more as i had to carefully position my ships to pull and counter the attacks during several missions. Small cradt counters work better now and capital ships can take move hits unlike Homeworld 1 were a few ion cannon frigates would melt a heavy cruiser or destroyer in seconds. In the end the balanced reamained in the capital ships and fighters craft to defend them.\n\nStory and sound\nThe story is much better told and presented, the soundtrack introduced songs with different rhythms like the one during the "boss" fights. The voice acting remains monotonous but the cast is more diverse this time around, still some of the "feels" are lost due to the voices.\n\nConclusion for Homeworld 2 Remastered\nBear with the interface (again), enjoy the story, enjoy the music, enjoy using tactics to engage some enemies.","July 22, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Though given this is remastered and had the entire HW1 engine using the HW2 one, which is less ballistic  as described here:\n\nhttp://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/errors-so-far-and-why-balance-was-changed-from-a-modder-pov/98177\n\nThe depth has been removed and has not been restored to the excellent state that relic made in the first place.  I would play the original for hours in skirmish back in the day, getting cornered between several computer players and the  feel of the game was exquisite and precise, from the formations to the balancing of units...  HW1 allowed cruisers to be taken down by a good sized swarm of smaller ships.  A classic and game making mechanic, i.e. the guy who makes all the cruisers is easy pwned by an adaptive player with less 'noob' sense(not to go for the biggest and most powerful unit) there was every bit of skill to be had from measuring your forces and changing various ships out for others...\nI think it was this, mechanic that has since been replaced in HW RM, where formations dont work as they used to and as the article above mentions, ships are treated diffferently.\n\nIn saying why I marked this game as NOT RECOMMENDED, I mean that Gearbox, got it wrong, they took a classic game that is now ancient but I bet workable(*someone* could have fixed somethings in it(well maybe not Multiplayer desync..)).  They then sealed its coffin and said to it "I will make a new, more up-to-date form for you...  it's memory will be preserved..." Then they thought, " well this engine will do, no formations, , it works differently, is not the same and will bring a lesser playing expereince, but hey the newer HW2 engine looks better and is pretty so who cares?!\n\nHomeWorld 2 was always a lesser game to me , unless you consider the amazing mod called complex(http://www.homeworld2complex.com/), but this is different. I spent hours playing HW1, hours I did not and could not have spent on HW2.\n\nSo as this is labeled as a 'Homeworld remastered' game, i.e. a game where gearbox took a timeless classic, sanded down the surface until it's like any other bland RTS (oh unless your talking about the visuals  :P)... I want the original back!  I want to use my support frigates to repair my courvettes(this mechanic no longer works as the path finding is broken from what I have seen), I want to use formations (no way to create a solid corvette 'wall' any more) to dodge attacks and mean anything at all!  Or maybe that is what game project management is like nowadays... To please everyone 'vaguely' and fill boxes... Anything more is an extra... Its only a shame a God died only to be replaced by a mediocre Mortal...\n\nIt should be worth noting that I never liked anything Gearbox made much, they only seem to churn out run of the mill games, Borderlands was mediocre at best, towed up by people who like to play together, which is enough for soem to like a game any way, or for the loot, which is just regular grinding to me; Boring : pick up weapon, wow thats nice, pick up another .. the whole process become tedious... then loot drops...  It turns into a game of administration rather than a decent shooter.\n\nThen one of their originals, Half-life Opposing force , mearly a mod of an already successful game; Gearbox are very good at making mediocre games... And no! Bums on seats does not justify them being as big as they are today.  Why is relic dead?  How did Gearbox do it?\n\nI endeavour to play this more out of confirmation of the above, but nothing more, I want the original back!","May 24","false","19.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

Tons of fun to be had with this game.\n\nHaving that been said there are a few issues I think need to be said for those who played both games back when they originally came out. First off, the tactics that were replaced in HW1 kinda kill some of the gameplay. Fighters and ships dont hold formation when attacking as they did in the original game. As soon as they engage on an enemy they all just seem to fly around all willy nilly, fighters especially.\n\nSecond, the game glitched and gave me way too many resources on the third mission in and made the rest of the game too easy after that. I didn't have to plan attacks or harvest wrecks to scrape up precious resouces. Nope, just build wrecklessly and send constant waves at the enemy.\n\nThe biggest let down, in my opinion, is once I beat the game I was not rewarded with that sweet jam by YES. Seriously, that made me sad not to hear that. Honestly, nothing could take us far enough, emotion, far enough... You get the picture. But despite all of that, It's still a great game that everyone that loves RTS and space operas should enjoy.

I played the original when it came out, and pre-ordered here. I can't say that without these features that this game isn't HomeWorld.  The story, the voice acting, the music, the gameplay, it's still all top notch.   This is what really made Homeworld.\n\nSo I have to naysay the naysayers.   You still get the originals if you need to be that purist.  Maybe they'll patch it, but the game was very releasable at the point it is today.  It's still a fun game that can invoke emotion in you.\n\nFor folks who have never played...\n\nHomeworld was created during a time 3D on a computer was still in its infancy.  There was a lot of games made at the time that were duds, and a few greats like Homeworld.    The game did well enough to warrant 2 sequels and a port to Mac.\n\nYou play the part of a exiled race who discovers warp technology.  As soon as you fire up your engines, those that exiled you come and destroy the only home you had, the desert world they left you stranded on 4000 years earlier.   As the fleet, you are responsible for the last remaining survivors of your planet.  There is no turning back.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you research new ships, each with unique abilities.  Levels are laid out in a way where you have to put every newly learned ability to use, almost like a Puzzle.\n\nIf you've ever watched The Angry Video Game Nerd talk about how perfect Mega Man X is for teaching you how to play, through gameplay, Homeworlds puzzles are a bit like that.\n\nOne peice of advice I can give... Save.. Save often.  It sucks to have spent an hour trying to get through a level, only to die right before the end.\n","March 11, 2015","true","30.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Death and destruction is part of the galaxy, folks, and you will see plenty of it.\n\nAudio- Your neighbors will insist that the Apocolypse has arrived, centered in your living room.  Even at the lowest volume, if you have downstairs neighbors then they will be pounding on their ceiling for you to turn it down.  The explosions rattled my teeth and killed my pet skunk.  Not before he sprayed his gunk everywhere, though.\n\nBattlefield size- The best game that I ever played that comes close to this is Sins of a Solar Empire.  If you've played that, imagine each battlefield to be as large as an ultra large galaxy map in its entirety.  Battlefields are in true 4D space, and combat happens from up, down, sideways, behind you, diagonally, etc.  TRUE 4D.  The only way it could be better would be if you could actually feel the heat from the explosions, but then your couch would be melted and you would be dead.  I suppose we should stick with 4D.\n\nCons: Length.  Too short.  I spent (as many hours as it showed I played) and didn't even come close to finishing it, but I knew how many missions there were.  I made it to (check my achievement history) before I couldn't play anymore, and it is the high point of my last half year.  Knowing that the end of the game was coming mad me sad, and I wanted to cry.  Then why did I say it's too short?  Because it will come to an end, eventually.\n\nI wholeheartedly endorse this game, and this is the largest review that I've ever written for any game in my library.  That means a lot.\n\n\n************************\n\nThat ends her review, and I agree.  I watched her play, and was mesmerized by the storyline and the action.  I never played the game before, so it was all new to me.  This game is not going to be a waste of your time or money, I promise.","February 25, 2015","true","69.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I completed the campaign for Homeworld at least 3 times, HW2 twice, and Cataclysm (somewhat non-canon, but still good) a few times as well. I've only reached the fifth mission in this HW1 Remastered campaign, but it appears Gearbox did the series proud.\n\nIt's beautiful without compromising the original art, the updated interface is mostly an improvement (I'm not crazy about the different hotkeys) and the sound updates are amazing. There are nuances to the sounds that I never picked up in all the time I used to play the game.\n\nOne change that had me absolutely giddy is that it's now (much more) possible for salvage frigates to capture Turanic Raider ships. I always wanted a fleet of Missile Corvettes, and now it's possible to nab them all!\n\nOverall, I'm blown away by this remaster. I'm overjoyed at how well it's done. If you never played the Homeworld games and you're an RTS or space fan, do yourself a favor and play this game, now.\n\nEdit: There are some serious issues with the game that I hope will be fixed soon. These are:\n\n1) Harvesting resources in HW1R is buggy, and requires babysitting and constantly reassigning the harvesters. They will stop harvesting, even when there are additional resources 30 seconds away.\n\n2) Strike Craft Formations and Tactics are useless and broken: Moving HW1 content to the HW2 engine clearly broke these, and they are critical to making strike craft useful. As they are right now, you will constantly lose all your strike craft due to the unit AI's inability to utilize tactics and formations. It forces you to just boat captured Assault Frigate swarms and other Frigate/Capital ships instead. This is a major and disappointing issue, and possibly the worst of the list.\n\n3) The projectile system was dropped in favor of the "dice roll" system of HW2. This was one of the coolest parts of HW1, and was amazing to watch in action. Projectiles were actually fired and could hit targets on the other side of the target by accident. This led to strike craft being much more useful, as they could dodge rounds coming towards them, allowing them to overwhelm large capital ships. Now, Heavy Cruisers, Destroyers and Assault Frigates wipe out dozens of fighters without breaking a sweat. The best anti-everything weapon is just a mass of capital ships, in all circumstances. Forget attack bombers and defenders. The only reason to builds scouts and interceptors is as a cheap meat shield or disposable scouting element.\n\n4) Time to Kill is INSANE. INSANE. Take two heavy cruisers or destroyers, and have them start shooting at each other. They die in like 30 seconds. It used to take twice that long, turning capital ship fights into epic slugging matches. Now, it's all just one giant, stupid deathball.\n\n5) Scaled difficulty is broken: Just collect a few dozen ships, and by mission 10, you'll see what I mean. If you're familiar with the original HW, you'll see that they have more than quadrupled the number of enemy ships guarding the ghost ship. It's hilarious and game breaking.\n\nI really hope they fix these issues, as HW is one of my favorite franchises, ever. It pains me to say this, but HW1R is not worth playing until most of the bugs get fixed. I haven't played HW2R enough to see, but I'm sure it's fine as it's in the same engine. If you want to play HW1, stick to the classic version. I pray it doesn't have the same issues.","February 26, 2015","true","24.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After a decade, it is so refreshing to play one of the greatest games ever made with a fresh coat of paint.

The dialogue was wonderfully redone, staying true to the originals whilst adding some depth and emotion. The game isn't a breeze to beat, but it's not a 4X either. It's just enough challenge to make you claw back for more!\n\nThe only potential things I would have done differently:\n\nBring squadrons to the original, it's tough to micromanage so many ships with only 10 groups\nAdd more ship types (such as from the complex mods) to give greater depth, especially in HW2\nHaving the 4 races be playable is great, but it'd be nice to have a mode with playable Keepers and Progenitors too\n\nThere is embedded mod support in the main menu so I imagine once modders get their eager hands on the code and start releasing stuff it'll be a lot easier to incorporate them into the game.

Being a person that has little patience or time to complete games, I would normally use trainers to get through various sequences of a game to finish it as quickly as possible while absorbing the story. Not this one. It always had a certain 'spark' that kept me on the right path to follow it through to the very end. Few have done this for me.\n\nIn my opinion, it deserved remastering and hats off to them - they stayed true to the original and gave it an incredible polish. The story, music, in-game interface, narration, graphics and attention to detail are as close to perfect that I can imagine.\n\nMy only regret is not being able to purchase the collectors edition.","February 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Homeworld's back.  I never thought I'd see this day.  I don't know how many hours I put into the originals.\n\nSo far, not many bugs on release other than a couple crashes.  If you crash, lower the texture quality a notch.  Even at 2048 texture size, it's beautiful\n\nTo top it off, this is NOT one of those games that looks better through nostalgia glasses.  Between all the engine improvements, HD textures, etc, it's BETTER.\n\nI remember playing HW1 when I was a kid and getting destroyed.  15 years later, with an adult mind, it feels like a different game.  I know how to manage resources better, I know the strengths and weaknesses of ships better, and try to organize my fleet instead of throwing units against the enemy hoping to get a kill.\n\nEVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE RTS, GIVE THIS GAME A TRY.  It looks like another overcomplicated space RTS, but it's really not.  It's complicated in its own ways, but very easy to learn the basic tactics and rock-paper-scissor mechanics between all the different ships.\n\nThis isn't like other RTSs.  It's very easy to pick up and play, hard to master against real players, but the selling point is the beautiful campaigns of HW1 and 2.  Not to mention the massive battles, with fighters zipping everywhere with their glowing contrails, and massive capital ships hammering at each other with cannons and ion beems.\n\nGood lord, it's been a long time.  It's more beautiful than I remember; with the Remastered engine, it's more than just a polished up HW2 engine.  Check out any comparison videos.\n\nThis game has gotten *BETTER* with time.

The multiplayer (against bots for the moment) is also fun, being able to use any of the 4 major races across both games is really intreasting and gives alot more replayability.\nIts not all good news tho as this games does have bugs, so far iv noticed certain ships clipping through each other, ships not dissappearing after hyperdrive, the overview map not working at times, and crashes to name a few. However i still recommend this game as it is, with gearbox supporting modding for this game and a huge modding community already around, as well as possibility of (decent!) DLC and bug fixes, its a bright intergalactic future for Homeworld.","February 25, 2015","true","41.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Formations no longer work at all in most cases either.\n\noverall its a great remake, but it has lots of small errors that lead to some annoyance\n","February 25, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They did an amazing job restoring the original granddaddy of space RTS.  It's stunningly gorgeous, and holds true to the original vision while bringing the entire game engine in to the modern era.","February 25, 2015","true","27.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am hoping they work out the bugs like capturing a carrier that happens to have fighters docked.  After capture they come out but aren't targetable however they can attack your ships.  There is also some issues in the garden with crashing randomly.\n\nHowever this was one of my favorite games all those years ago and I am glad to see it making a come back.  Hopefully the support for this will lead to a homeworld 3 with a galactic map and some additional races like the beast etc.","February 25, 2015","true","60.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I simply love the game.  Started playing this and it's the best game reborn.  This is not a 100% clone.  There are new elements in the game if my memory serves me right.  The missions and the storyline are more or less the same so far, cinematics are new.  The sountrack is the same, which is actually a very good thing.  The soundtrack alone deserves a medal.  Visuals are extremely updated.  Spoiler alert:  I don't remember some of the ships that Bentusi trades nor do I remember that Bentusi EVER gave me an option to buy tech in the originals.  I'm not far along with the "Remastered" and already see differences to the Classics.\n\nHomeworld title is one of the most aclaimed in the industry.  16 years later there are still thousands asking for the next installment.  There are multiple forums and blogs dedicated to HW still in full force and active.   If you are new to the Homeworld and love strategy, you simply have to play it!  If you have played it without enjoyment, this won't skew your view and may seem repetitive, but if you loved the Classics, you'll appreciate the "Remastered" in its full glory.","February 25, 2015","true","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Good polish but cant give it a 10/10 with the different controls and button layouts that are nowhere near the original but still a good remaster and a thumbs up over here.","February 26, 2015","true","17.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
