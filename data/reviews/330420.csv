When I first came across this title, it was with the demo release several months ago. I was excited for the game, and bought it straight away when it came out. The art style still looks impressive, however some movements from the secondary characters are remanicent of those ads you find on facebook, chossing distorting the image in lue of jaw movement or breathing. The lack of animation in some places does make the game seem unfinished or buggy, an example being a mini game between a professional boxer. When first playing this game the sound quality of the voice overs may also seem scratchy and alittle poorly recorded. However the sound quality is not bad, and after awhile i forgot there was an issue. In my opinion the story is good and in places the game looks great. If you are patient and can look past the games short comings, I think it would be worth it. If you are a fan of the comic series or are just looking for an easy adventure game, I suggest givving this one a shot.

The artwork is excellent and reminiscent of the graphic novels. The story certainly captures the flavor of the Graphic Novels.The music and sound effects are good as well. The voice acting... leaves something to be desired.\n\nThere are certain points where things simply make no sense, and I had to resort to randomly clicking things and eventually bungled my way through. Some of the puzzles were frustrating in that you couldn't jump back into them immediately after a failure, but has to sit through a preceding conversation or animation. Other times, there was an opportunity for a puzzle which was bizarrely skipped.\n\nI had hoped also for a more active role by Gargoyle and Pazuul, but they are relegated to something of a supporting role with almost as little to do as they did in the demo. The puzzles are somewhat spare in this... I was hoping for more.\n\nMy biggest complaint is in that the game is so short. It consists of only a single case and game play only last about 8 hours.\n\nAll those negatives though don;t really cause me to NOT recommend the game. Its fun, I enjoyed myself. And ultimately, thats all that matters.","March 5","true","8.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lakewaterontap/recommended/330420/","lakewaterontap","lake.kubilius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lakewaterontap/","396 products in account","A graphically-beautiful game, with many well designed puzzles.  Excellent style, and an amusing story.  Wonderful soundtrack.  As point & click adventure games go, there's a lot of good stuff here.\n\nThere are a few solid negatives though.  First, P&C purists will be loath to learn that the game features three mandatory mini-games resembling nothing so much as the old Nintendo "Punchout."  I've been known to pitch a fit about finding that sort of thing in adventure games myself (the ending to GK3 is still unforgivable), but I'm letting this one go with only a warning.  The reason I'm so forgiving is simple: beating them is pretty easy.  (At least, assuming you're solving the puzzle correctly.)\n\nSecond, the (acceptable) puzzles are often surprisingly challenging (good), but usually just for being a bit vague or a bit pixel-hunt-y (bad).  Many adventure games these days avoid problems with the latter by having a hotspot finder.  This game does not have one.  As such, you can get STUCK.\n\nThird, if you get stuck, the game offers an in-game hint system.  But this is actually a fairly serious issue itself.  For one, it's buggy.  It doesn't always seem to grasp what you're trying to solve, and occasionally doesn't offer any help at all.  If it IS able to help, the hints it gives are NOT SUBTLE AT ALL.  For cases where all I really needed was a hotspot hint, it would answer with something like, "Vader is totally Luke's dad.  You'll find that out after you use the Jedi mind trick on those Stormtroopers."  Technically helpful, but prone to ruining six other puzzles you don't even know exist yet.\n\nFourth, given the amount of time you can spend wandering around if you're resisting the urge to look at the hint system, the game could REALLY use a "double click to warp" feature.  Usually, you're in smallish areas where this isn't unforgivable, but... it gets old fast.\n\nThough the text of this review dwells on the negatives, I want to stress that there's a lot of great stuff here.  It was in no way a bad game, and if you're curious enough to have read this far, I completely expect that you'll enjoy it.  In fact, if I were to add a fifth point, it would be that I wanted MORE hotspots to fool around with.  It establishes its universe well, and you'll enjoy being a part of it.  Go for it!\n","March 16","true","8.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

While it's worth playing I would only play it if I had nothing else in the "adventure game" category to play.  It is actually the reason why I bought it and played it.\n\nThe game has a lot going for it but it lacks a few things which bring it down the rungs against newer indie point and clicks and the classics from the old Sierra/Lucas arts days.\n\nIts easy to see that this game wasn't originally meant to be in English as some of the phrasing and speech acting doesn't flow so well or has the wrong intonation for the particular phrase.  It feels like most of the actors just read lines for sound samples.  That isn't a dealbreaker however but just something to keep in mind, there are other adventure games that may not look so pretty but the voice acting is better.  I have a feeling it might be to do with the translation and the odd dialogue progression sometimes, ala LA Noire, that the whole thing feels a bit confused and rushed.  It makes sense it just doesn't flow quite right.\n\nThe artwork is perhaps one of the best features about this game, bringing back the old hand drawn feel of some of the later adventure games such as the original Broken Sword but in such rich detail and clarity.  The problem is there is a bit too much of it with no ability to interact with anything even if it's only just for humorous intent.  Some of the detail just doesn't make sense for where it is and just gives a feeling of cluttering the scene.  Also some wonderful scenes are only just briefly shown  when they could've made up another scene for puzzles and info, it feels a bit of a waste.\n\nThe animation is great in some areas of the game but oddly sparse in others, there's also the feeling of being a little lazy in some of the animation with certain things moving slightly  just for the sake of  moving when they could either be still or be a bit more animated such as people swaying.  This gives the feeling of there trying to be more "action" than there really is.\n\nOne of the great things of this game is the easter eggs and details relating other classic movies and adventure games, the bad thing is in some scenes  there is a bit too much of it and not enough original content creating a bit of a feeling of riding on the legacy of older games and movies.\n\nIt is very short, it really feels like half or even a quarter of a game due to the plot being crammed into the scenario.\nThere are a lot of really fresh things in the game in terms of plot, dialogue and humor, some great injections of fresh thinking even if sometimes it doesn't work e.g.  The "Jacket inventory" which is a great idea but unfortunately blocks some things if you're not far enough to the right.\n\nIt's worth giving it a go but if you're a fan of adventure games perhaps when it's on special.","April 27","false","3.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Knowing that it would help OKAM Studio further development of the F/OSS Godot Engine, I hopped onboard, figuring that the game itself would be a bonus and a nice diversion if/when it was released.\n\nLooking back, I find myself doubly glad that I supported this project in spite of the bittersweet ending the journey has had.\n\n\nIn the "making of" segment included at the end of the first graphic novel is a mention that The Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle provided Dog Mendonça & Pizzaboy creator Filipe Melo with inspiration for some of the humour seen in the graphic novels. These influences are also present within the game on multiple levels, ranging from superficial similarities to Curse of Monkey Island's cartoon aesthetic to more deeper approaches to puzzle design and pacing that feel in line with sensibilities found in early LucasArts adventures.\n\nThe game opens with Eurico (Pizzaboy) and Dog tied up, hanging above a vat of boiling wax during the final act of the adventure, giving some context for the relationship between the two core character while also setting the tone and stakes before skipping backward in time to allow players to control the events that lead up to that predicament.\n\nA fishy new case leads Dog to be captured and Eurico is left to investigate both Dog Mendonça's disappearance and the case on his own with the dubious assistance of Dog's associate Pazuul, a demon trapped in a young girl's body, and the head of a gargoyle named Edgar.\n\n\nStructurally, The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça & Pizzaboy provides narrative linearity by gating non-linear puzzle chains. Early on in the game, Eurico is tasked with performing a particular rite that requires a certain set of ingredients and tools that the player is free to acquire in any order, but are all required for the story to progress further. As is common with adventure games, the broad strokes of the plot are provided by high level objectives, but the moment-to-moment storytelling emerges in response to the player's actions and attitudes expressed through their dialogue choices and approaches to problem solving.\n\nI found myself enjoying the game's pacing and approaches towards unveiling mystery. Dog Mendonça & Pizzaboy manages to maintain the air of being a fun romp, while making sure that the player's awareness of the overarching plot just beyond reach in a way that keeps things compelling. Though it isn't a long game by the genre's standards (my first playthrough took around 6 hours and I was taking my time), it feels like it comes in at a good length for the story it's telling.\n\nThe presentation of the occult world rarely feels gratuitous or pantomime, but I can't help but feel that the game could have benefited from exploring the boundaries between it and the human world a little more. I felt like I was relying more on familiarity with these core concepts of the franchise's universe gained from the novels than from what was exposed within the game itself. I feel that it might be easy for newcomers to assume that the world of Dog Mendonça & Pizzaboy doesn't also encompass the normal everyday human world we know from our own lives. I'm not certain that this would necessarily detract from the game, but to me, it feels like a core aspect of the franchise that gives some extra context to the events of the game.\n\nAnother aspect that I suspect may be a little jarring for some players is the quality of the English localisation. I feel uncomfortable judging the game on this without experiencing the Spanish or Portuguese versions (one of which I assume is the language that the game's dialogue was originally written in), but I don't speak either of those languages well enough to be able to play the game. The translation of the graphic novels feels stronger, but it's possible that it stands just out more in the game where actors are performing lines that don't quite feel natural. I am definitely be curious to hear how the German localisation (the only other language with recorded voice) compares.\n\nThere are a number of interface conveniences that tend to be common which I fond myself missing when playing and re-playing the game. While dialogue lines can be skipped with Space, there is no way to skip cutscenes. There's no double click fast-travel option, which I generally avoid making use of but still find the absence of super irritating.\n\nSo far as I've been able to discover, there are no options for configuring the game's resolution, and the game window is not resizeable when set to windowed mode - this may be an important issue for low-res laptop screens. The game also mutes on loss of focus, which caused me to miss sections of voiced dialogue when writing down notes.\n\n\nIn a move that goes beyond classic point and click adventure gameplay, the Dog Mendonça & Pizzaboy game includes a number of timing oriented fight sequences. While these sorts of arcade-ish elements are certainly not unheard of in the genre and can be used to effectively control tension and provide a counterpoint to core gameplay (fists path combat in Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis springs to mind as a good example), the few point and click adventures which have experimented with them have tended toward making them optional (such as ship-to-ship combat in The Curse of Monkey Island).\n\nDog Mendonça & Pizzaboy's fight sequences are fairly forgiving and can't imagine them making the game less accessible to very many players. They do provide some nice shifts in tone, but mechanically, they feel a little flat. Unlike the tactical gunplay of Gemini Rue where some slight enemy variations gives opportunity for multiple strategies to feel viable, or Quest for Glory's combat where player stats play a role in effectiveness, mastering Eurico's fighting abilities consists of recognising when to dodge and to immediately follow with a hit.\n\n\nThough the influences that both the game and graphic novel incarnations of Dog Mendonça & Pizzaboy draw upon are fairly obvious to anybody who has awareness and cares to look, the franchise still manages to carry a solid and endearing identity of its own. To me, The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça & Pizzaboy feels like a respectful homage to 80s and 80s cinema and adventure games. Beyond the celebration of culture that resonates with me, there is an engaging world filled with interesting characters that I can't help but want to spend more time with.\n\n\nContinued on Cheese Talks[cheesetalks.net]","March 15","true","14.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Add that to the fact that Eurico, the main character, walks alowly and that there's no in-game map, and you get a lot of walking around. Luckily the game is divided into rather small chunks of 3-4 screens each, so it's not such an issue, but still, it's a weird oversight.\nIn addition, when the mouse is over a hotspot, there is no overlay effect, and the only indication is a text description. If the background color is too similiar to that of the text, it's easy to miss it.\n\nInteractivity:\nThis was, for me, the biggest let down in the game, and it's a real shame. The background art is so amazing and elaborate, that it's almost borderline criminal to not let the player interact with it at all. There are literally only 2 non essential hotspots in the entire game. Now don't get me wrong, I hate it when a game overdoes this and the screen clutters up with dozens of hotspots upon pressing the hot spot reveal key, but this is the opposite extreme. Most of the screens have only one or two hotspots. There were so many times I wanted to click on something and hear what Eurico has to say about it, but alas, I couldn't.\n\nVoice overs:\nThe overall quality of the voices (english) is fine. Some actors are good, others are just ok, but the one you hear for most of the game - Eurico, is easily one of the weakest. His voice is reminiscent of that of Dominic Armato, the actor who voices Guybrush Threepwood, but his delivery falls short on almost every line. By the end of the game I got used to him, but it was a distraction.\n\nOn the other hand the graphics, puzzles, plot and occasionally the humor are top notch and were a blast.\nI totally recommend playing this game.","March 9","true","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game keeps the feel and pace of the comic but in an adventure game format. Text boxes are used even though there is fine voicework! I particuarly like the light pencil marks in the text boxes; it provides a great tie in to the comic box adventures. That said, you don't need to have read the comic books to play the game; it stands up just fine on its own.\n\nDog Mendonca is the last surviving Werewolf. He and all the remaining monsters now live in Lisbon, Portugal (see the first comic book); Dog is a private investigator who keeps the monster world and human world from colliding too much! He is helped by Pazuul (a 5000 year old chain smoking demon who looks like a 9 year old girl), gargoyle (who got tired of hanging out on church roofs) and Pizzaboy, his unpaid intern. The four of them run around Lisbon in a blue and white VW bug keeping an uneasy peace.\n\nThe game starts out with a nice nod to Monkey Island 2 and a quick tutorial that sets up the characters and shows you how to use the interface. But quick enough, the team gets hired by a young lady investigating a gypsy curse and some strange going ons. Quick enough, Dog is captured, Pizzaboy springs him but then Dog vanishes and Pizzaboy suddenly finds himself hip deep in monsters, ghosts, cult film artists and amusement park employees. In short, Pizzaboy is in for a long night as he tries to find Dog and solve the mystery.\n\nThe game is not too long and the puzzles are not very difficult. I played it off and on in three evenings. Pizzaboy keeps good notes and his notepad provides some nice hints. You can't go wrong playing the game. Several of the interactive spots only really work when you can progress. The game has you working on a couple of puzzles at once so there is some fun in trying to understand which item you collect works on a particular puzzle. There are no dead ends (just dead characters and even those can often still deliver a good line in the game) and no circular traps or insane logic to solve puzzles. There is some pixel hunting but the highlight areas are large and I found them quick enough. I do want to note this is not a game for the youngest players; there are enough occult references and some language to keep the younger set away.\n\nIn summary, a fun little game, some fine humor and a nice entertainment for yourself for a few evenings. Pizzaboy knows how to deliver!","March 22","true","5.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

At least should be a bit with all those pretty rooms.\nVery easy puzzles, very comon sense, too intuitive nothing abstract that makes u think a bit out side the box.\nOnly 3 save slots !!! meh\n\n\nI played adveture games since the 90's so take my word for it.\n\nGood attempt but not good enough Pizza boy, better deliver those pizzas.","March 5","false","2.2"," 11 of 31 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","11","31","0","0"

In an age where Wadjet Eye Games continues to release exceptional projects, you can do much, much better than Dog Mendoca and Pizza Boy.","March 5","false","0.7"," 7 of 25 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","7","25","0","2"
