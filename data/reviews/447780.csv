Game looks and sounds beautiful, and the mouse controls work perfectly. A lot of the UI seems to have been adapted from the iOS versions rather than the original, but it works fine and they even redrew the tutorial prompts showing a mouse.\n\nSo, given that the game has been converted well, I highly recommend it, as the original was one of my favorite games at the time. I think it's aged well, and remains a relaxing and beautiful indie game. Might feel a bit short if you buy each game separately, but the two-game bundle is a good value.","March 24","true","2.3"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","36","37","2","4"

It ran beautifully on my mid-level PC with no hiccups whatsoever. And the mouse makes it arguably nicer to control than the Wii Remote.\n\nThe game is beautiful, charming, and sweet. The music is lovely. The game is short; the playtime you see on my profile is a full runthrough (albeit I still need to find a few more hidden collectables). So if you've got a couple hours to spare, you can't go wrong with this.","March 24","true","1.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","1"

It has ported across very nicely, the graphics are crisp, the tutorials and menus have been given an overhaul and the audio (being as good as all Frontier's efforts) didn't need touching.\n\nWell worth it for a game that really thought outside the box and got it right.","March 25","true","3.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I don't think I will replay it.\n\nMy main problem with this game is the lack of options. I would love this game, if you could turn the music off or even just down. I was tempted to turn the sound off on my pc. The music is loud and beautiful. I just don't need it.\n\nAnother problem I had was I often found I could not manipulate only one object at a time. I would put my cursor over the object I wanted to move and my character wold be affected. Sometimes the gesture comands would not work.","March 26","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

(needs confirm)\nSimple enemy AI\nShort game\nLostWinds is an interesting title to say the least. It has a fun story that's simple and recognizable, but gets the job done and adds a little extra to make it unique. It's pacing is a little slow at times, but you'll get things moving along more quickly as you learn how to play. The game is really easy for a good while but when the difficulty ramps up, you notice it very quickly. It has decent challenges and can keep you busy for a while.\n\nThe style is very Metroidvania-Lite and you'll finish it quickly if you run through it. I completed the story in 2.3 hours but didn't get all the collectibles. As a package deal, you can get both games for $15, so then is this game worth $7.50? Sure, but save it for a flight or a road trip.\n\nI give it 6.5/10.","March 24","true","2.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","12","20","3","2"
