That's about it really. The tutorial level is slow but then the real levels are real fast.\n\nPositives:\n+ Easy to learn, hard to master\n+ Price is low\n+ Abundance in Achievements\n+ Leaderboards to compete with other people\n\nNeutral:\n~ Music is looped and the loops are short\n\nNegatives:\n- Bad spelling\n- No colour-blind support (with the objects being red)\n- Loses fun factor after a bit\n\nThe game was fun but then I found it lost its fun factor after 10 minutes. I would give it a neutral rating if I could, a negative would be harsh to the developer just because of no neutral rating on Steam. The game is okay but far from anything special or amazing.\n\nFor the price being low and if you feel slightly interested I would say go for it, I couldn’t recommend it to gamers looking for a deep game though or gamers looking for anything more than just a ‘Happy Birds’ type game where you fail often.\n\nSaying that it did have the “Just one more try” effect on me. I attached a video to give you a better idea of the game. Thanks.\n","January 4","true","2.2"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","2"

You must dodge the procedural horizontally and vertically generated red bars. In the tutorial you see your little grey square, later in-game you don't. So you must handle your WASD controls gently because the deadly outer walls, too. Apropos tutorial: there's one missable achievement to play the first level before starting with the tutorial. If you didn't you must activate the reset button and all of your progress is lost.\nI hate point-of-no-return achievements like this. Conclusion: Linea is a simple dodge game with just average graphics and a nervy gameboy soundtrack. Looks like cheap mobilware to me.","April 29","false","2.1"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

You beat a level by surviving 60 seconds, which might sound easy, but it's not.\nUnlike a few other "falling" games, you can't freely roam around anywhere you want avoiding obstacles. You use the arrow keys (or WASD) to move in a direction, and as soon as you let go, you're centered.\n\nThere are 4 levels to play through, each increasingly difficult, and each with their own obstacles and music.\n\nSpeaking of the music, it's one of the best parts of the game in my opinion. I really love jamming to it, and thank goodness it doesn't restart every single time you die, or else you'd be listening to the same bit over and over again.\n\nAlthough the controls might take a bit of time to get used to, when you get the hang of it and finally complete a level, you feel really good about yourself.\n\nOverall, the game doesn't have an insane amount of variety to provide, and it's very simple, but I can see it as a fun little game to play every now and again. The replayability is decent considering the levels are more or less randomly generated, and the game is quite cheap. Most importantly, it's fun!","January 5","true","2.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshyyboiii/recommended/428900/","joshyyboiii","Joshyy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshyyboiii/","392 products in account","Linea, the Game is a minimalistic dodging action game akin to Super Hexagon. The premise of the gameplay comes from a series of red bars that move towards your screen, normally in one of the 4 directional positions (up, down, left, right). The object of the game is to dodge these red bars and survive for as long as possible. (60 seconds minimum to progress to the next level.) The gameplay is supplemented with minimialistic white and gray backgrounds, and fast-paced chiptune music.\n\nEach stage has its own music track, so repetitive plays on the same level can cause the music to grow stale. The patterns for which objects appear don't seem too varied, so they become easier to pick up as the stage is repeated.\n\nThe difficulty ramps up as you progress through stages; the first few levels are relatively drawn out, enabling an understanding of the mechanics of the game. Once the player reaches stages 3 and 4, the tempo and difficulty increases. There is also currently a DLC pack with 3 extra stages and a bonus coin collecting stage, also with increasing the difficulty from the last stage of the game.\n\nOverall, I was able to complete the game in one sitting. Replayability seems low, as the stages don't seem to increase in difficulty regardless of time. Those that are quite fond of these types of games are likely to have short play times as well, while newer members might find a challenge with the later stages. I was able to pick up both the game and DLC for 2 dollars, and received 1.5 hours of play time.\n\nWill recommend for the low price of the bundle coupled with the quality of the game.","May 16","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The core game is fast paced with minimal downtime, ensuring that you’re not doing much else but bashing your head against the game’s primary challenge. The minimal visual aesthetic is great to look at but also a punishing part of the core game, making it that much more difficult to visually distinguish everything on screen. Whilst it might not be my usual cup of tea I was surprised I played it for as long as I did, especially when I started craving after a few achievements.\n\nRead my full review here: https://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2016/01/15/linea-hesitation-will-be-your-end/","January 14","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Just no. I can't recommend this title at all, for the simple fact that the developer thought pricing it at €1.99 would even be reasonable. I've played mobile games on my Android that were better, in terms of content and play-ability and such games were either FREE, €0.99 or even €1.99. If I was the developer, I'd have priced the game at €0.99 maximum.\n\nSecondly, I've been collecting the achievements and considering some of them are left to be hidden, I figured that they'd be tied to getting certain scores or maybe something even cooler... wrong. You're telling me that because I DIDN'T skip the tutorial at the beginning, I can't actually get one of the secret 'achievements' unless I delete my save data? No chance. I'd rather delete you from my games library and refund ya.\n\n4 levels, 1 of them (the last one, oh noes) clearly just created to annoy the player, as opposed to fairly challenge them. If you're buying this game, wait until it drops to €0.50. It's not worth the price of admission at €0.99, unless you get lucky with the card drops.\n\nOverall: Stay away from this title. It ain't worth your time. I've literally played through whatever was there and any of the additional time on the game is me sitting at the menu, tabbed, waiting for my final card drop.","May 10","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you do not press anything, you will stay in the centre.\n\nYou have to avoid "red" things for 60 seconds to win (You also have to dodge grey objects too).\n\n\nBoktipset Från Helvetet, the first real level from Linea, the Game, consists of red bars that are always in 3's. The can be horizontal or vertical, with having a massive gap or very tight gaps that requires you to tap in a very shot, but rapid session. There are the odd 4 grey bars where all you have to do is press nothing.\n\n\nByrokrat Apparal, the second level from Linea, the Game, consists of red and grey boxes that can be located pretty much anywhere where you can move to, the grey boxes can usually take up the entire of one of the sides making it so camping in a corner harder, this level to me seems much more easier to get a higher time than Boktipset Från Helvetet.\n\n\nThe rest of the levels I have yet to play apart from the third level, Don't be a B, which I have played, but currently not passed.\n\nI like the ability to see the scores so there's a competitive somewhat feel to it, and being able to view the achievement list and it's states to see how harder achievement earn you a high score or what you have currently earned. The music it wonderful, but it is very reparative once you get into the higher triple digits.\n\nWhat is really hate are the grey lines on the side of the screen (Which pulsates depending on your in-game volume), after a while they make you feel weird (personally), make it so your vision moves, and can sometimes put me off the game, resulting in my loss.","March 25","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
