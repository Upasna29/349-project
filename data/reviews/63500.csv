I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nS&S is a curious blend of two genres I don't usually enjoy: 2D side scroller and RTS. However, five minutes into the game, I could see through the cutesy graphics and I found a game of surprising challenge and deep gameplay. S&S is now available for tablet play, but it's far more challenging than the average casual tablet game.\n\nWithout going into the game mechanics, I'll briefly say that the challenge of S&S is about recruiting the right balance of each unit type into your army to make your forces competitive in groups. Also, staying focused on the big picture while also assisting your units at the strategic level. The game plays at a very brisk pace, which makes it difficult to manage all aspects of your forces at once.\n\nThe levels are bite-sized; about 5-15 minutes each, perfect for a game that was born as a mobile app. But the levels become increasingly more complex. A couple of hours into S&S, and you'll find a staggering number of things that you have to manage simultaneously. You have to juggle more and more types of units and one-off attacks to reach victory in each new level.\n\nS&S also includes an online mode for playing competitively against friends.\n\nIf you like RTS games, give this a go. It's a pretty good game at a budget price.\n\nAs for me? Lesson learned: Play every game. I expected little, but Swords and Soldiers impressed me.","October 24, 2013","true","2.9"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","37","40","0","0"

It's simplicity I found was very... Enjoyable. It is incredibly fun, and feels very rewarding when you defeat the enemy. Even if you discover the best techinque for victory, the game will change slightly and force you to adapt your strategy little by little. The challenges that the enemies pose are also very fun to oust. The story and characters are hilarious, and they make the campaing a lot of fun to follow. Vikings chasing pirates around the world because they disrupted a barbaque, for example.

Most levels were easy enough but the hard ones were extremely difficult. There were only one or two of those, though.\n\nOverall I had a good amount of fun with the singleplayer.

It’s not as fancy as the sequel, but still has all of the charm that grabbed me when I played Swords & Soldiers II. The factions feel different from each other and each need their own tactics to be played well. Without anymore babbling on, let’s get into it!\n\nThe Swords & Soldiers series come off as basic and cartoony. It’s almost a little too basic to grab my attention if I had just seen a video. This is another example of why you shouldn’t base your opinion on a game solely on looks. (I’m going to have to get over that since it appears that I’ve said that a lot lately.) I know it’s getting harder and harder to do with how graphics are shaping up these days, but with all this good content out there with simple graphic schemes, it’s important to try a game out before one blows it off completely.\n\nSo without all the fancy-schmancy HD-ness of its sequel, Swords & Soldiers HD focuses on fun gameplay with some deep gameplay/tactical decisions. You’ve got to carefully manage how you work your available options because the slightest misstep could cost you the game. (That sounds overly dramatic, but it has happened to me.) Do you need to create more gold miners or get some research done to build some fighters to apply pressure onto your opponent. What type of unit do you research first? Want a slow heavy-hitter or a ranged (but low HP) user? Eventually you’ll have everything researched, but you may find it in your best interest to not do everything up front lest you find yourself with all the options in the book, but no money or defenses when the enemy comes a-knocking.\n\nAll of the factions feel completely different and I like that. As impressed as I was that the sequel not have reskinned armies with the same abilities, the same applies here. You’ll obviously have a few units that play similar, but with enough differences to make you wish that your unit could either poison others or rush into fights. It’s give-and-take all while each army has their appeal and that’s what’s so great: having options. Not only are the units available different, but how your basic game mechanics work are also different. Everyone has passive mana regen, but how you get more differs from faction to faction.\n\nThe Aztecs have to sacrifice units in order to gain more mana faster. Personally, they are the hardest to play. I just can’t seem to strike the balance between building my army/defense and figuring out how to get the 350 mana needed to pull off my super move. I’m also not used to sacrificing my own units. The Chinese run almost similar to the Vikings except they abandon defensive towers in favor of towers that help regen mana quicker. I get it, and I’ve actually won matches as both factions, but two out of three factions just don’t do it for me. I’m not sure if it’s the fact that the Vikings look like Dwarves or that they are simple in execution. The Vikings are pretty straight forward: economy, defense, damage. I know that tends to be my thing, but I do believe no single game has pigeon-holed me so well into one specific faction.\n\nScore: Gewd.\n\nSwords & Soldiers HD is a solid game. All three factions offer distinctively different ways to play the game and that’s very cool. The fact that I can’t very well play two of them is more on me than it is the game itself.  I know this is more of a multiplayer game for those competitive sorts, but the campaign does offer a good fun story packed with humor and is worth the purchase in and of itself. While the game is pretty good, it’s getting older now since the sequel is coming out and having played both, Swords & Soldiers II will probably be the favored son. I’d recommend picking Swords & Soldiers HD up when it’s on sale to play it as well as support a good developer.","April 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I enjoyed the storyline enough to play all the way through, and the challenges are fun for quick pick up and play sessions.","July 17, 2012","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I tried it out because I needed something to kill five or ten minutes here and there and, lo and behold, it's actually a fantastic little game.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough and the game never becomes too challenging (there is one level that gives me trouble), but it's quite a bit of quick fun.  It plays somewhat like an RTS (in that there are miners and you use those resources to create units), but also like a tower defense game (destroy their tower before you lose yours).  While this may seem like a limiting factor in how the game plays (my original impression), it actually creates for quite a bit of strategy.\n\nRecommended for anyone who needs a momentary distraction or looking for an interesting concept.","July 5, 2011","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can pick between the Vikings, the Aztecs or the Chinease. The goal is simple: destroy your opponent's base while keeping your own spotless. Each race has its own distinct play style (and racial steriotypes), although it seems like the Vikings are sadly the weakest of the three. The campaigns alone will last you a number of hours, and on top of that there's challenges and multiplayer.

But at its core the gameplay is simple and straightforward. Combat units automatically march towards the enemy base and will engage the first enemy they meet. You can gain magic skills that allow you to interact more directly in the combat.\n\nSo managing which units to build, which things to research, and which spells to use is how the game plays out.\n\nA fun game with quick little missions that can entertain strategy game fans.","May 11","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
