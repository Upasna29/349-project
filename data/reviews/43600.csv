"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spectacledgreer/recommended/43600/","spectacledgreer","Rachel Greer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spectacledgreer/","47 products in account","This is one of my favorite Nancy Drew games. It has a nice balance between sleuthing and puzzle solving, which is something that many of the newer games in this series are lacking. The plot isn't very complex, but it is interesting and had some unexpected twists. If you enjoy point and click mysteries, I think you will like this game a lot.","June 12, 2015","true","14.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

The puzzles were decent, and I actually wasn't expecting some of the twists.

There are puzzles, there's mystery, and there's bits and pieces of easter eggs spread through out the game.\n\nI appreciate how they stay true to the spirit of Nancy Drew - there's never a vulgar word, graphic content, and it never forgets who she is.\n\n♥ The graphics are better than the older titles.\n\nThere are some Nancy Drew games that feature more dated, clumsy graphics and a clunky inventory/clicking system. However Warnings at Waverly Academy is one of the updated games, thankfully without the awkward, clay like people animations and overly sized arrows.\n\n♥ I enjoyed the mini games.\n\nUsually when I play Nancy Drew games, I don't pay too much attention to the mini games, seeing as I'm more focused on solving a mystery or two. With Warnings at Waverly Academy, I actually enjoyed playing them, something I was pleased with! If you want to expand your play time, this is a great way to do so.\n\n✘ The puzzles.\n\nIf I have to do that science puzzle again, I will quit. Uninstall steam, done...\n\nIf you want challenging puzzles, this one has it, in full! They just weren't quite to my taste, blarg because the rewards for solving the puzzles weren't there.\n\n✘ The characters were blah.\n\nI don't think this is a failure as a Nancy Drew title, however I don't think it's the best it could be, not even close. In the The White Wolf of Icicle Creek all the AI drew me in - they were interesting, unique, and I still remember them years later. However with Waverly, they just didn't feel "real" to me, nor did I feel like their personalities showed through as best as they could with their dialogue and the ways she would interact with them.\n\n✘ The ending felt ....off.\n\nOne thing I appreciate about Nancy Drew games is the fact that the endings tie the game together, pulling in the obvious with the small, hidden hints that you may have missed story wise. There's usually a twist and a turn with a nice seasoning on top. This I found utterly lacking with Warnings at Waverly Academy.\n\nOverall if you're intent on playing every Nancy Drew game, this is worth playing. However if you are new to Nancy Drew games or only wish to play the best ones, avoid Waverly Academy.","May 27","false","6.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The puzzles are more logic, and the story is better (I actually found it a bit exciting, and the bad person makes way more sense in this game.). The pacing is also a lot better - you don't drive or sail around in large areas, but just click around in the academy; you can get everywhere pretty fast.\n\nThe achievements are also guesswork here (they'll popup at the end screen), so just make sure do to the requirements plenty of times if you're going for them.","January 16, 2011","true","19.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Not that it has multiplayer, just trick a bunch of goons into playing it, get on Teamspeak with them, and get really drunk.\n\nI can't imagine anyone actually hates their children enough to buy this game. I kinda wanna call child protective services on them.","November 24, 2011","true","10.5"," 0 of 17 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","17","0","1"

Some of the puzzles in this game were a bit convoluted, but overall the majority of the game was enjoyable. The atmosphere was much more comfortable than the Nancy Drew games I've watched or demoed (no ghostly jump scares for players who are easily startled), and the minigames were fun in their own right. I probably spent much more time playing games within the game than I needed to. Definitely contemplating a second playthrough.","August 31, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
