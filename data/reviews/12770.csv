"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allminator/recommended/12770/","Allminator","Prof. Sweetlove","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allminator/","611 products in account","Quick review of the game since I just completed it.\n\nOverall a 7/10 for me.\n\nI'll take a look at the gameplay/combat, graphics, story and miscellaneous things.\n\nGameplay/Combat: (8/10)\n\nSince it's a story driven game you will sometimes find yourself in cities going around talking to various people instead of just randomly bashing in the skull of everything you see.\nThe dialogues are well done, whilst the actors look like blinking statues most of the time. One thing that bothered me the most about this is that in some cases cutscenes look like normal dialogue and then you end up skipping the whole cutscene instead of the one line you already read.\n\nCombatwise it is a very fun game. You have 4 skilltrees to choose from, while you are able to fully spec about 2-3 of them depending on you enjoying the game or only doing the main missions.\n\nThe skilltrees are divided as follows:\nAres: Highly offensive berserker (focused on dealing damage and regenerating health)\nHermes: Offensive trickster (focused on dealing damage and dodging)\nApollo: Defensive melee tank (focused on blocking damage and regenerating health)\nAthena: Offensive "godpower"-juggler (focused on dealing damage and using skills)\n\nEach of the skilltrees provide quite a unique experience after starting the game, whilst you end up with 2-3 skilltrees filled at the end of the game.\n\nThe combat is intuitive, while the hitboxes of some enemies are constructed in a way that you mostly will push the enemy away rather than hitting them.\n\nBut the thing that bothered me the most about this were the invisible walls that are immediatly thrown at you as soon as you start a fight. Oh, you see a region more suited to fight these enemies? Nope, invisible wall.\nMost of them aren't placed that bad and you won't even find them except you really try to run away from the fight.\n\nKeep in mind: Best experience is with a gamepad/controller like with every hack and slash game out there.\n\nGraphics: (6/10)\n\nYes, I know what you will say know. Oh my god, are you judging the graphics by todays standards while the game was released in 2008? No I don't.\n\nBasically the games graphics for todays standards are poop. For the standards of 2008 they are ok and it is still enjoyable today.\nAlthough a big minus is that the only actual graphics setting that it has is the ability to change its resolution.\nIn the game you will also find a lot of things that will kill immersion. Like guards opening gates by touching them rather than pulling a lever or at least pushing some kind of button.\nThen the games regions are sometimes divided by gates that take a very long time to open. I don't know if it's an intentional "interactive" loading screen or just there to annoy the player.\nAlso some walls have very odd hitboxes, so you'll sometimes be caught on corners or can't get somewhere where you actually should be able to get to (nothing gamebreaking). Same thing applies to nearly every npc you'll encounter.\n\nStory: (7/10)\n\nI won't include any spoilers here, but some hints to what it is about. So don't read this part if you don't want to know anything about it.\n\nThe game is pretty straightforward when it comes to the story. As you probably can see from the screenshots it is inspired by the greek mythology, although not at all accurate.\nThere is one twist in it and it really is predictable.\nIt's your standard "perfect world - oh here's a villain - rescue your girl - be happy and marry her while you forget everyone that died for it".\n\nMiscellaneous stuff: (No rating here)\n\nHere just some stuff I noticed while playing.\nYou can add 2 followers to your group. You'll have 4 available in total.\nThere are no collectibles except for armor and weapons you'll eventually find while progressing in the story.\nYour dialogue choices don't matter.\nYou will get overpowered at some point. The difficulty curve is just ridiculous.\nGameplay adds up to about 8-12 hours. Maybe rushing through it can be even quicker.\n\nAll in all I'd recommend this game to everyone that likes a pretty standard hack and slash game with a pretty standard story inspired by the greek mythology. I certainly had my fun and I'd buy it again.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up so other people can see it too.","February 1, 2014","true","10.3"," 204 of 217 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","204","217","0","5"

The choice element does actually affect the gameplay SOMEWHAT, the plot's well written, the voice acting's reasonable, and there are various different ways you could approach the game without being able to complete it just by button mashing.

On the combat part of the game, because of this, your mileage may vary in contrast to mine.\n\nPerfect example of one good game, that is a victim of it's own ambitions, but at least for me, this time, it is a positive thing.\n\nSometimes you can use Metacritic as a external support for your own conclusions:\nCritic score:59\nUser score:7.2\n\nYou know why ??, because many of the players that reviewed the game on Metacritic and myself ,had the balls to hold up and finish the game, not like  those "critics" that gave the game a 59.\n\nLet aside the "twists" developers did on Greek mythology to build up the game, it excels on the story itself, voice acting and companions.\n\nThe message of humility, courage, wisdom, discipline and justice (Athena's virtues) spread all along the game's story, combined with other's Greek gods good and bad virtues, is just a great teaching for everyone.\n\nHell,close to the ending of the game, developers even let you go over Greek mythology on the creation of the world  and all living things.\n\nThrough all the game, I was amazed how the selfish and particular desire of Jason (to revive his dead wife) was coped , mixed and contrasted with all this mythology, where serving the others and acting for the greater good above our own desires is the goal.\n\nThe first 8 hours of the game, I must admit that there is too much of dialog and too little on action.\n\nThe dialog system is smart, every dialog option you take is tied to a different god,  so it's an alignment system. The way you think, the way you respond to dialogs, aligns you more with one of other Greek god(s).\n\nAll the deeds you achieve, via combat, quests, achievements or dialogs can be praised to a different god,thus, giving you access to different buffs and abilities trees.\n\nFirst 8 hours of the game, this buffs and abilities might no seem much of a change, but later on, it is.\n\nI specialized on Athena's (my favorite deity, of all there are) and the lighting - powers I got where an amazing spectacle on combat.\n\nCombat pretty much is an arena combat, you get on a closed area, and fight your way out.\n\nThere are puzzles to be solved both in combat situations, and in normal quest situations.\n\n3 different combat styles, really cool all of them. Sword, Mace and Spear.\n\nAmazing usage of the shield ,and the shield charge against enemies to open up defenses.\n\nThe combat in general is really good, but at the second half of the game , it just rocks the boat.\n\nGods powers on combat are just the ice on the cake.\n\nCompanions are pretty useless on combat (unless you buff them al lot via skill trees), but all of them have great personality, characterizations and dialogs. You choose 2 of them to go with you , on different places.\n\nSo first half of the game, gets you into the plot with a lot of dialog, backtracking,some lackluster quests an little combat...... This is where I think most of the people quit playing the game.\n\nSecond part of the game, just gets better and better until there is no effort in continuing playing the game.\n\nI must admit, that I managed to pass the first 6 hours because I like a lot Greek and Roman mythology, and I was thrilled with the game's plot, twists on the Jason story overall and with the general message on the game.\n\nThe scenarios are great and graphics are OK, besides some half ♥♥♥ job on some NPCs.\n\nThe fact there is no direct access to the map (you have to navigate menus to it) just makes me want to punch someone on the face.","November 5, 2014","true","11.6"," 68 of 71 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","68","71","3","8"

It's graphics are dated, and it is a bit glitchy at times. However this game despite its low grades and sub-par reviews is actually excellent in many more ways than it falls short. The story/plot will be the best part of this hidden gem, the way you interact with fellow heros and even NPC's have an actual affect on your story. Said decisions will determine how the path before you will turn either this way or that. Dialogue is actually very well written and combined with what I feel like is an excellent cast of voices that bring at times sorrow, anger, humor, and even hope. Another benefit is that armor and weapons do not appear in a menu that shows stats or numbers, Instead you find rare items throughout your journey that you can choose between to fit your combat style. The screen is streamlined, no health bars or armor condition only you and the game. Take too much damage and you die, however dodging blocking and using abilites and GOD POWERS aid you in a world ever growing with greater threats. Once you are critically injured the edges of the screen turn red  you will then move slower, also you block and attack less effectively. You will always carry three weapon types a spear, sword, mace and of course a shield. Traveling from different points is actually very original, I wont spoil the surprise completely but lets just say you also get a ship, I will say no more on that. When you upgrade your skills such as god powers and striking force or even blocking and healing, you do so by sacrificing you deeds at the altars of the gods. You will have four patrons but knowing which they are I will leave to you to find out. From top to bottom I feel this game is gold, maybe thats biased because I enjoy slash games much more that FPS. The best piece of advice I can give to fix crashing issues is to run the game then open task manager then go to details, then set CPU affinity for ROTA for only one core. It will be CPU 0 if you have multi core processor. You can tell that a low budget studio with great aspirations and strong work ethic put everything they had into this, so I humbly ask if you are considering this title than please purchase  and undertake the quest that challenged the limits of the gods themselves.","June 24, 2015","true","12.2"," 44 of 45 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","44","45","0","0"

You also gain the gods favour through dialogue choices, and this helps tie the roleplaying aspect to the combat - if you want to unlock the abilities of war god Ares, it helps to roleplay Jason as aggressive for example.\n\nBAD: The game is short and fairly linear; although the dialogue options affect your character development, there is not much choice in how the quests play out, apart from which order you attempt them in. The combat is also pretty simple and gets a bit repetitive by the end. Finally, if you know anything about the actual Greek myths, you may be disappointed with the games interpretation/butchering of them!\n\nUGLY: This game has a lot of bugs, i had CTD's (though there are fixes on the discussion page that helped) and problems with the audio; weird distortions and sometimes it would cut out temporarily (make sure subtitles are ON!)\n\nOverall i enjoyed it, i didn't mind the linearity or simple combat too much, and it has moments of real creativity. Its nothing groundbreaking, but if you can deal with the occasional CTD, for £5 I'd say its worth a shot","August 25, 2013","true","17.2"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","0"

I can't said that it was waste of time. After checking average note from revievers on Metacritic (only 59%) I wasn't expecting that this game is greate. I expected something terrible.

If this is true, why games like Wolf Among Us ora The Walking Dead are so popular? In this games we have only dialogues. Maybe this game was released too early.

A word of warning though, Rise of the Argonauts never really excels in either of the areas it has borrowed its style and mechanics from.\nFor example, the combat is nowhere near as fluid or satisfying as that you experience in God of War. The RPG elements and branching story mechanics is nowhere near as fleshed out as they are in KOTOR or Mass Effect.\n\nDon't let that discourage you though, because even though the game doesn't reach the heights of some of its inspiration, what's there is well enough for you to see the journey through to the end. Also the games' setting, theme, story and characters are great and will keep you plenty entertained from start to finish.\n\nOh and I hate even bringing this subject up but I know that for some of you, it really matters a lot. I'm talking about the fact that the game isn't exactly the newest and it does show. At least if you allow yourself to compare it to modern games.

It doesn't retell the stories of the characters we know from the Greek myths, but instead weaves a new tale that showcases those legends.  It's very much the Greek Mythos version of Jade Empire.\n\nYou begin the game as King Jason of Iolcus.  He sails the seas on the Argo, a large mechanical ship, and in the course of adventuring acquires new party and crew members (the Argonauts of the title).  Be aware:  the first 20-30 mins of the game is pretty bad, but once you speak to the gods, gain their boons and get to the Argo, the game gets progressively better.\n\nAs this is an action RPG, almost all of the combat takes place in real-time in set encounters as you travel.  It's very much a button-masher/clicker.  There are no random encounters, there is no strategizing, there is no pausing and giving orders to comrades in arms.  The fighting system isn't too complicated, but the experience and skill system sure is puzzling.\n\nYou don't acquire experience points from kills or quests completed, like is typical in RPGs, you instead acquire "aspects" by gaining titles that build on your legend (killing X number of enemies, killing in a particular style X number of times, certain dialogue options that appease a specific deity, slaying a particular enemy, etc.) with which you can "spend" at shrines by devoting them to one of four deities:  Apollo, Ares, Athena or Hermes.  They each have their own skill tree, and you can choose to devote yourself to just one god, a few, or all.  The game does a poor job of introducing the system and I was at least half way through the game before I realized that I was never going to be able to get the higher level skills in any one deity's skill-tree, because I spent too much on low level skills on all of them.  The game also has "God Powers", which was even more confusing - I still have no idea how to use them.\n\nThe item system is... almost non-existent.  You begin the game with a Shield, Armor, Mace, Sword and Spear.  You will always carry these items.  At certain points in the game you will gain upgrades to one or more of these items.  For instance, you'll get a new Mace that does more damage and/or adds a helpful effect to you or your allies during combat.  Curiously, the game will ask if you want to equip it to replace what you were using.  I have no idea why, the new weapons and armor are always better than the old.  It's very much 'Legend of Zelda' in terms of it's item-leveling.\n\nWhich, brings me to a potential sore spot for some:  there is no item or inventory system.  There is no going to merchants and buying healing potions, weapons or armor.  There is no vendor system, there is no inventory system, and there is no objectives or journal system.  There is no opening of chests or bashing of barrels to find loot.  There is no looting of corpses, no thieving system, no lock-picking, no spell system, and you will never fire a bow.\n\nBecause there is no journal or objectives system, you are left to your own wits in the game.  This is problematic, because even that is not enough if you're a completist who wants to finish all the "quests".  For instance, on Saria Island I couldn't read the first Herm (monument) when I got ashore.  It wasn't until later on the island that I attained a new party member who could read it.  I figured it could wait and I would read it on my way back to the boat.  I also gained a mission from the god Hermes to perform last rites on a number of deceased.  One of the dead's body was hanging for his crimes and I had to convince a particular NPC to release it, which is a dialogue puzzle I didn't complete before wrapping up a boss fight that propels the story and which made doing those two previously mentioned acts impossible, which meant two titles I could have used to appease the gods were gone too.  *sigh*  Be as thorough as you can, is my advice.\n\nWhile the game is linear and fails at most things RPG-related (no stat numbers to play with, no inventory, etc.), it does have a pretty solid story with lots of dialogue.  In fact, hilariously, some people hated this aspect of it, completely forgetting it's supposed to be an RPG.  Gamespot gave it a poor review, because the ignorant reviewer compared it to 'God of War' and complained there was not nearly enough combat.  That's like comparing apples with grapes and complaining you can't make raisins out of apples.  The dialogue, in fact, is the real high point of the game.  All the best stuff happens in the dialogue.  If you prefer games where mindless button-mashing is all you want, go play 'God of War'.\n\nThe graphics in this game are beautiful.  The environments are detailed and enjoyable to play in.  The character models are all highly detailed and each has it's particular and unique style.  The characters are, of course, ridiculously sculpted and look like they all came from the He-Man universe.  The graphics won't win any awards today (this game came out in 2008), but just about everything is pleasing to the eye.  The biggest issue I have with this port of the game is that there are no graphic options to scale in the game, except for resolution.  This is disappointing, and frankly lazy.  This runs on the Unreal Engine, which is highly and easily scalable, so there really is no excuse for this.\n\nThat reminds me, there is also no way to scale your mouse sensitivity.  The mouse is highly sensitive in this game and it took me an hour or so to get a grip on it.  You would be better off with a gamepad, but the controller support seems to be lacking.  It is said to support the Xbox 360 controller though.\n\nThe sound design is pretty spot on, and the voice-acting is top-notch.  My two favorite characters in the game are Pan and Achilles.  Pan is articulate and worldly.  Achilles is a narcissist and easily the funniest character in the game.  Be sure to take Achilles with you whenever you can, you won't regret it.\n\nThere were some bugs in the game:  It once ate my save files, it crashes every once in awhile for no apparent reason, I hit a dialogue glitch with Daedalus (thankfully it didn't break anything), and in one or two instances I completed a fight but had to exit and load up a checkpoint save because a scripting bug prevented me from continuing to the next area (I'm thinking of the end sequence of the game).  The game also sometimes feels wanting:  you gain crew members for the Argo that ultimately feel unused, unnecessary, or just background dressing.\n\nAnyway, at the end of the day I would definitely recommend this.  It's not a long game, by RPG standards (10-15 hours), but it is highly entertaining.\n\n\nIf you have framerate issues (you can also turn off vsynch in the same file):\n\nGo to My Documents/My Games/Rise of the Argonauts/LiquidGame/ConfigOpen the file LiquidEngine.ini (make a backup just to make sure) Change: OnlyStreamInTextures=FALSE into OnlyStreamInTextures=TRUE","October 24, 2014","true","19.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

It may not have the graphics of say Ryse son of Rome but it has twice the length of that game and more then half the price. It is a game that could have easily been better in many ways but it doesn't take away the fact that this is a great people. All the naysers are wrong, this game is great. Its not very hard and is plot heavy but the plot really follows the Greek mythology archtype. Where else will you get to fight along Greek Legends like Hercules or Achilles. For me, this game was perfect, cheep with great gameplay. Don't let the negative nancy's fool you. The game did crash a few times but I've had way worse.

I recommend this game with EXTREME reservations.\n\nPROS:\nIt has a good story, along with great voice acting and decent (if dated) graphics. Everything else is between bad and frustratingly bad, and I mean everything.\n\nCONS:\nThe camera controls, especially on the final boss, made me realize how far we've come since it was released in 2008.\nThe graphics are decent, but even my up to date PC had some stuttering issues when it loaded new areas.\nThere is zero replay value in this game, unless you REALLY want to max out another skill tree.\nWhen you are running around, forget being able to roll, pull a weapon or do anything to break the monotony of each sandaled footfall - THE ONLY THINGS YOU CAN DO ARE RUN AND INTERACT WITH SPECIFIC OBJECTS.\nThere is a LOT of running around in this game. So much running...and the map (at least using a 360 controller) is impossible to access without pausing the game and selecting the right option.\nThe menus are unwieldy and slow and you are forced to use them for everything.\nThere are no hidden items, no treasure chests.The only way to receive new equipment is to play through the dialogue selections correctly, wander into the right place, or simply progress the story.\nThe entire game is on rails. Need to hide out behind a rock? Nope, you can't leave the path.\nBecause you can't draw until there is a threat in front of you I frequently found myself surrounded by enemies before I was armed. That wasn't a problem because of my next point -\nWAY too easy. Anyone who wasn't a boss died by the truckload, leaving behind nothing because there are no items to pick up. The deaths were brutal and each weapon had at least two different ones but after the first chapter I'd seen them all.\nToo few types of enemies and again, I'd seen them all except the bosses by the end of the first level.\n\ntl:dr - Good story hack 'n slash with very little customization, replayability, or variety. Basically, if you want to see a slight twist on the story of the Argonauts you should check it out. If not, don't bother downloading all 12gb and thank me later.","February 2, 2014","true","15.2"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/12770/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","Rise of the Argonauts is a game that gets very little notice today. You play as Jason of Iolcus, king of ancient myth, whose wife Alceme is murdered by nefarious assassins. Instead of accepting her death, Jason sets out upon a journey across Greece in search of the one artifact that is reputedly able to reverse death: the Golden Fleece. Unique setting, fair graphics (Unreal 3), average voice-acting, good combat, and a fabulous soundtrack make this a niche classic.\n\nAfter the death of Alceme at the beginning, Jason must venture to several places, looking for clues to the location of the Golden Fleece. Three of these locations – Mycenae, Kythra, and Saria - can be visited in any order, so there is the possibility to take different squad-mates with you depending on where you visit first (you can take two for a party size of three). After everyone has been gathered, you have the location of the Golden Fleece, and proceed linearly to the end of the game. The areas and levels themselves are large, but not very open. Not that there would have been anything gained by a sandbox design; but the levels generally feel narrow and restricted, save for the wide open arenas where the fighting occurs.\n\nRise of the Argonauts takes a serious, dramatic approach to Jason's classic tale. If that sounds like there is a lot of dialog in Rise of the Argonauts, there is. Everyone has conversation – and frequently, after finishing one discussion, you'll proceed to the next checkpoint only to have another conversation. There are branching dialog trees, and a few differing outcomes. But one place where Rise of the Argonauts falls beneath the others is in the quality of the voice-acting. It is serviceable, but not much else.\n\nThe combat is swift and fun, and will leave you wishing for more. Jason keeps his shield, and can choose from a sword, spear, or mace. Slow-motion finishing moves abound. Enemies tend to be easy once you've mastered dodge and block. Each of the upgrade trees “honors” a different Greek god, and your combat develops in the manner your favored  god prefers. I choose Hermes for most of my upgrades, resulting in quick, active combat that favors the sword and allowed Jason to call down lightning strikes and great winds as he fought and dispatched enemies. Ares, Apollo and Athena each have their own styles, buffs and debuffs. Find the right balance, and combat can almost be too easy. Until you get to the boss battles, that is. Enjoy slicing and dicing the minor minions of the underworld while you can; there will come a time when you'll have to face  six minotaurs at once – while fighting a boss...\n\nUsually the soundtrack gets a passing mention of whether it is good or bad, but the music is one of the strongest parts of Rise of the Argonauts. Composer Tyler Bates channeled Troy and Gladiator and crafted a moving and intense score.\n\nThere is a lot of fun to be had with Rise of the Argonauts if a dialogue-driven hack 'n slash piques your interest (as it did mine). The use of Greek legend provides a great ambiance, and unique ways to upgrade and play give it some replay value, too. An easy game to recommend if you are looking for a change of pace.","January 22","true","19.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

Gameplay-wise, it's the unwanted child of Mass Effect and God-of-War, a jack of all trades - master of none cliche. 3 quaters through the game I edited the config file and set the damage multiplier to zero since there was nothing going on for me with the combat, and I wanted to push forward with the story.\n\nAs for the story, it's an interesting spin on the Jason and the Argonauts tale (love what they done with Medusa). I'd say the re-inventing of the mythological tale is this game's strong point. Overall I say buy it.

Rise of the Argonauts won't have you deeply invested in it's chatacters or storyline. In fact, it may be one of the things that puts you off, as this game changes Greek Mythology quiet a bit (a very small example is that Medusa has a brother in this game, not two sisters) and if you are familiar with the Greek tale of Jason and the Argonauts, you might be left disapointed with the changes in narrative.\n\nAnd yet, I found compeled to see this through to the end. The meaty combat is really what's going to keep you going through all the mediocre dialouge. It's pretty satisfying impaling an enemy with a spear, right before swinging you shield at their face and watching the decapitated head soar away, leavign a bloody spray behind. How did a shield decapitate a foe in full armor, you ask? Well, I say how in the world is there a relic that can restore people from death! It's Ancient Greece, stop taking things so seriously and just go kill more Ionians with that fancy sword of yours!\n\nAll in all, this is one of the few games I've played recently that I actually find "fun". Well worth it if you can pick it up on sale, and trust me: After the first island, the game picks up, I promise! Oh, and grab the mace from the guy who comes yelling at you in the village on the starting island.

In this version, Jason's bride Alceme is killed during their wedding, and Jason sets out to find the Golden Fleece in order to bring her back to life. The story is pretty straightforward, and being based on preexisting lore, you can immediately tell what will happen. But the writers manage to keep you invested with a number of interesting characters from Greek mythology whom Jason encounters along the way, and having all the elements you want from a Greek legend. You travel various colorful locations, meet and fight alongside heroes of legend, slay great beasts, and even take part in a philosophical debate(in my opinion, one of the best sections of the game).\n\nCombat is your standard action h'n's deal. Light attack, heavy attack, dodge, block, parry. You have three weapons, a sword, a mace and a spear, each with its own strengths, weaknesses and a distinct playstyle. You can switch them on the fly, and over the course of your journey you will find better weapons, even ones blessed by the gods themselves which have special properties. The combat is pretty good, but it is way too easy. Even on hard, the game is ridiculously easy, unless you refuse to level up, in which case it gets boring, not hard, because you lack the damage to kill enemies with more health while being able to dodge all of their attacks.\n\nNow, a bit on the RPG elements of the game, its by far best segment. This game has a really unique way of leveling up. Jason is favored by four gods: Ares, Apollo, Hermes and Athena. During conversations, all of your choices are favored by a certain god. Choosing one will grant you favor with that god, and once you accumulate enough favor, you earn an aspect point you can then invest in that god's skill tree. Also, the game keeps track of your deeds, which are a sort of achievements. You can devote these deeds to the gods in exchange for favor. It is a really unique take on XP, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. Also, the skills are varied and interesting, with each god granting you skills and powers which favor a certain playstyle reflective of his or her field of dominion.\n\nHaving discussed the three main aspect of the mix of genres this game covers, it's time to talk about how they work together, which is a bit...meh. The game's pacing and story/combat balance is really, really bad. There are lengthy sections where you do no combat at all, followed by either a short battle or a long, drawn out sequence of battles where enemies just keep on coming for you to oneshot. The story and combat don't really work together, they seem more like being thrown in together.\n\nThis is one of those cases where the whole is better than the sum of its parts. Though all of these elements have great ideas but more of an ok execution, and even work to mixed results together, the game as a whole is still really enjoyable. I had a blast with it, and the 12 hours I put in just flew by. Even with the easy combat, and bad pacing, I was never actually bored, and almost burned through it, without even noticing that I had played for that long, which is not something I can say for many other games.\n\nDespite its flaws, I would highly recommend the game, especially if you are a fan of Greek mythology. You may not get the greatest of stories, or challenging combat, but you can have a great time, which shows that with fresh ideas, even an ok game can be a great experience.","January 25","true","12.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

By doing all these things you get experience points that you can use to buy new perks for your weapons (sword, mace and spear) and shield.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly fun and satisfying, although it can get stale at times, especially when the camera decides it doesn't give a damn anymore.\nI'd say that's the major problem of the game, the camera can be silly at times and there's quite a lot of glitches/crashes (nothing game breaking, as far as I know), so save often.\n\nThe graphics still hold up pretty well for a 2009 game (better than a couple of 2014 games).\nThe plot is simple and short but it does its job well, it'll hold your attention and give you that "epic adventure feel" you're probably looking for.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for some RPG/Hack&Slash with an epic atmosphere and you don't mind a few glitches here and there, this is the game for you.\n\n6.5/10","December 9, 2014","true","16.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The game was filled with loveable things, small details, like where you got to listen to petitions in the throne room, or the fortune telling, outside the palace.\nA uniqe mix of characters, to travel with, and the moment where you wipe the smirk from Phaedons face, in his own playgroud is pure epic.\nThe spear was the best thing ever, backed by perks from Athena, not even Legend difficulty was a problem. Too bad, you never got to poke Hecate with it.\nOccasionally the game felt instable, and suffered from performance issues, but overall it was still a very enjoyable game.\n\n7.5/10","March 15","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dubhe14/recommended/12770/","dubhe14","Dubhe14","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dubhe14/","206 products in account","I really, really wanted to like this game.  It shows so much promise, but for every step forward, it takes 3 steps backwards.\n\nFirst, the game is a beautiful reimagining of the Greek myth of the Argonauts and the Golden Fleece.  The art direction is absolutely gorgeous - the environments are great, your armor and weapons look unique and interesting, and all the characters manage to look "larger than life" while still fitting into the game world.  The main characters, that is, because there are only 3 NPC models in this game.  At one point, I was mediating a dispute between three merchants, and they were all the same person.  It really breaks immersion to walk through a city full of clones.\n\nThe writing is really well done, and the conversation system (where you can pick responses that align with certain gods - like a witty response to appeal to Hermes or an aggressive response for Ares) works very well!  But NPCs converse by stiffly holding the same pose and moving only their mouth, or repeating the same hand motion over and over, which is often distracting, sometimes unsettling.\n\nThe combat just kinda sucks, really.  I like that you can switch between the Spear, Sword, and Mace, but they all play the same: just wail on your enemy until it dies.  There's not strategy, it's just button mashing.  It's also a real tragedy that there's a finite number of enemies in this game, and it's VERY POSSIBLE for your Argonaut allies to steal enough kills and prevent you from reaching max exp.  So you get these really well crafted characters, but just end up resenting them for stealing your kills.  Plus, the lack of a lock-on systems is BS, I can't count how many times I've whittled an enemy down to kill him with a thrown spear, only to have my character do a 180 and throw it at someone offscreen.  Then one of my allies kills the weakened enemy, because of course.\n\nThe cherry on the top is that this game is an abysmal port.  Apart from screen resolution, there's no visual settings at all, not even a LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH option.  Plus, frequent crashes to desktop, which are inexcusable in my opinion.\n\nIt's a little embarrasing.  This game could have been great - like, legitimately great, but they ♥♥♥♥ed it up so bad, I'm kind of amazed actually.  I wish I could recommend this game, but I can't.  Watch a youtube playthrough, though, because the story is pretty grand.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT:  Having played the game to completion, I'm now fully qualified to say this game is absolute trash.\n\nDespite all the good things I said about it in my original review, my feelings about the game as the end credits rolled were overwhelmingly negative.  The developer, Liquid Entertainment, should be ashamed of themselves that they took something with so much promise and potential and made it so irredemably terrible.  Whatever good qualities this game has are so thoroughly drenched in filth, it's really not worth a playthrough to experience them.\n\nDon't buy this.","April 22","false","18.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hojugab/recommended/12770/","hojugab","HoJu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hojugab/","127 products in account","I really enjoyed Rise of the Argonauts. Yes, it's quite easy and not very long, the plot is kind of stupid in places, the loading times disguised as cutscenes (I'm talking to you, gates to the Acropolis of Mycenae) become tedious because there's much running back and forth, and it's not the best looking game out there. Why did I like it then?\n\nWell, I'm a sucker for Greek mythology and I think this game gets the atmosphere right. Mostly. Don't get me wrong, the mythical characters, places and stories of old are misplaced, mixed and butchered without remorse, when not completely made up. If you want a more canonical depiction of Greek myths go play Apotheon (seriously, go play it, it's awesome!), this is more like a fanfiction or an alternate reality but still feels Greek and mythical enough.\n\nI especially like the god alignment system. Dialog options don't influence the plot but they do influence gameplay because your dialog choices are aligned with one of four deities (Athena, Apollo, Ares and Hermes). Winning their favour by choosing their dialogs or dedicating your deeds (ingame achievements) to them lets you level up in their respective skill trees and unlock different powers and buffs. To me it feels very satisfying to devote yourself to a god (Athena rules and anyone who disagrees will eat my spear), it really gets me immersed.\n\nThe dialogs and characters are mostly well written. Each of your companions (you can choose two of them to join you in each level, out of four that you recruit along the story) have different personalities, and they interact between them and with the enviroment in different ways (Pan is snarky and will go on about old legends and trivia, Achilles is obnoxious and will brag about being the best fighter ever, and so on)\n\nThe combat, although not very tricky, is fluid, fun and bloody, and can get quite spectacular once you start throwing god powers all over the place.\n\nAesthetically, it's good enough. Some of the enviroments look pretty and colorful, like Iolcus palace (I really liked the guards openning the doors for you, I know it's probably there just to hide a loading time but it made me feel like a king and I've seen too many magical self-openning doors in games to appreciate the detail), while others are much more dull and uninspired. The bronze in your armour is shiny and many of the armours and wepons themselves are not too overly fantastical in design, which I like.\n\nI haven't experienced crashes or major bugs that I remember, as many reviews say, and I played for several hours at a time. I guess I got lucky. I bough this game on a sale for dirt cheap (1.75 EUR) fearing that it would be awful or crash on me, but I was pleasantly surprised and, after completing it, I woudn't mind having paid more for it.","May 12","true","18.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Despite the fact that it's a shorter game I did manage to lose interest a couple of times 5-10 hours in which forced me to restart, so you could safely drop play time to 20 hours as a realistic expectation. Ultimately, the skill system was cluttered and didn't feel all that important as many of the special skills had two major shortcomings. First, none of them felt all that necessary for gameplay, and the mechanics to activate them (at least the active ones) didn't feel natural mapped to the old  d-pad. In my case none of these issues ended up stopping me from watching the credits roll eventually, but I can see why this one didn't catch on with the masses.","April 12, 2014","true","43.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pottypie/recommended/12770/","pottypie","Capt. Pottypie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pottypie/","315 products in account","The game has a good storyline, but the Greek mythology is very scrambled. Don't expect this to be like a Percy Jackson book in terms of accuracy.\nThere are 3 weapons - sword, mace and spear. The game lets you work out which ones work best where, and there are several (at least 4) different weapons for each slot, as well as armour as well.\nThe god powers are fun, but suffer from being really awkward to actually fire up in combat, since you have to push the button then hold it for a few seconds, and you can only have 4 on "quick"slots, so if you use more than 4, you have to constantly be swapping out.\nThe combat is good, better than Skyrim's 'click, block, repeat", but not Kingdom of Amalur standard. The combos are pretty basic when you learn the patterns, and the executions in the game are little more than slowed down hitting people, which is fine by me.\nThe upgrade system is quite different from other games, since you can dedicate deeds (♥♥♥♥ you've done, like "I mow this lawn in the name of Hermes!") to gain points to put into upgrades, with each upgrade tree upgrading one of the weapons, or your defense, and giving god powers.\nThe story is short but good, with a nice variety of combats and environments, and a (very small) bit of branching its all very fun. The ending, however, is very abrupt and rather dull, and has a rather rushed feel to it, like the devs were working into the night because the game needed to be put on disks the next day.\n\nOverall, there is some potential for replayability, and the game itself is solid but short. 8/10.\n\nEDIT: I noticed a few people saying you'll need to navigate without a map, which isn't true, as there is a map in the pause menu for all places. However, its not likely you need it except to remind yourself of your current quests, seeing as most areas are very linear.","September 15, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play the mythical hero Jason in search of the golden fleece, in an adventure filled with Greek mythology.  The story was entertaining and I enjoyed the recreation of ancient grease, it made the game seem more weighty than the typical fantasy fair, being grounded in earth history.  Gameplay wise it consists of lots of interesting conversations and side quests, as well as typical rock paper scissors combat.  There are several distinct play styles in combat which made for a nice change of pace.  There is plenty of choice in the conversations, but instead of the typically good vs bad vs neutral conversations trees this game basis the conversation topics on different gods.  Each of the 4 gods has a level up tree where you open up new abilities and bluffs, the deeds you complete and conversation choices you makes fills the appropriates God’s tree.  It’s a fresh and different take on conversation and quests and I really enjoyed this aspect of the game.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my time with Jason and his Argonauts.  Unfortunately I can’t recommend this game as during conversations it kept randomly crashing to desktop.  It started periodically at first, and then grew in rate to the point of crashing every few conversations, making the game basically unplayable.  I tried a few of the fixes I found in steam forums and online but none of it solved the crashing.  Overall Rise of the Argonauts is a really great hidden Gem RPG, but it’s very buggy to the point of being unplayable.  A search of the forums in steam will show I am far from the only one with this experience.\n","December 6, 2014","false","11.7"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","4"

Controls are clunky, animations are worse, and there are poorly acted cutscenes, breaking the rare fluidity of Jason cutting people in half, every two minutes. If you're a fan of Greek mythology, this won't do anymore for you than someone who isn't, because the story is post-Odyssey and makes no sense. Then again, I didn't even stick it out far enough to experience the critically lauded skill progression, but I feel like my time is better spent playing any number of other, infinitely better, fantasy RPGs or hack and slashes. If you like hack and slash combat in a historic or fantasy historic setting, try Spartan: Total Warrior instead or God of War.","February 7, 2014","false","0.2"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

Far from it. The Mythology is butchered beyond recognition, very little about this game from the story to the sets match the history or the tales. As if this wasn't bad enough, the combat is simplistic and extremely easy. Legendary seems casual, it's hard to die in this game aside from the need to figure out one or two bosses --- and even that is a relatively easy task. Lastly, it's a pretty bad port and poorly optimized. If anything in this game can kill you, it's that.\n\nOn a positive note, if you find this game seriously on sale ($2.99 or less), the story itself isn't bad (just not faithful to the legend) and as a casual diversion may be mildly entertaining. Under those circumstances I might recommend giving it a whirl, but if you have anything else worthwhile to play avoid it.","July 25, 2015","false","25.6"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

Seriously, only like 1/3 of the game was actual combat, while the rest was just walking around and talking to people, which gets tedious really quickly.\nNot that the combat was anything spectacular, just your standard hack'n'slash fare, only really, really easy. The enemies spend a lot of the time standing there and letting you attack them, i literally never used the block button. And if you do get down to low health, you can just walk away for a few seconds and your health regenerates. I didn't die until the final boss fight, and that's only because it took me a while to figure out how i was supposed to kill him.\nThe only real positive was the interesting character progression system, where you complete deeds (save a villager, kill X enemies, etc.) and then dedicate those deeds to one of four gods to gain favour with those gods, and gaining enough favour with a specific god grants you a skill point to spend on that god's skill tree, with each god representing a different combat style.\nThe story was OK, but the whole plot of the myth has been completely changed (instead of collecting the Fleece to restore his fathers kingdom, Jason only wants it to resurrect his dead wife) and all the characters are there, but they are completely different from their mythic counterparts, especially Medea, who instead of being a key part of the story, is just another Argonaut.\nAll in all it was a pretty average game, but being a big fan of Greek myth i found it mildly enjoyable, despite being annoyed by the changes from the myth. However, I can't recommend it given how most of the game is spent in boring conversations. If there had been more action, I would recommend it, but sadly, there isn't enough to keep the game interesting.\nI also encountered frequent crashes at seemingly random points, but I can't say for sure if it's the game or my computer. However given that i can play more recent and far more graphically demanding titles than this, it seems likely that it's the game that's at fault.","October 24, 2014","false","14.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Unlike him though, I am lucky to escape with my life. It is not even worth saying much about this game, other than Codemasters needs to quit trying to publish other games besides their awesome racing games because every time they do it ends up bad. Their extra studio they opened to make the Operation Flashpoint games closed down because those games sucked so bad, and hopefully the studio that produced this did too. This game was released in 2008 but feels like a game from 2002, and not a good one. Everything about it is bland: the graphics, sound, and especially the combat. God does it ever suck. I mean it works fine, it is just so overwhelmingly generic that it is laughable. You can dodge, shield block, do weapon combos, etc. But none of that is necessary because it is one of those games where realistically if all you do is pound mouse 1 and 2 during combat you will come out on top. But like I said you won't want to because the game is so generic it is like they made is as a joke or something.\nThis deserves even lower than the low meta score it has. It is so bad that its only purpose is to serve as another game owned toward getting my 250+ games badge.\nIf you want games similar to this that are actually good games, try Lord of the Rings War in the North and Game of Thrones. It cost me $1 to find out if this game blew or not, and I quickly found out that the best thing that can be said about it is a physical copy of the game can be used by a hobo to wipe his ♥♥♥ with, and a digital copy of this game is good for about 20 minutes of laughs before you uninstall it with a frown and a muttering of "thank God for the uninstall button".","February 2, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

When she was killed on their wedding day, he vowed to do anything to restore her life. Now, in order to accomplish this heroic feat Jason must seek out the Golden Fleece -- and with the help of Greek mythology's greatest heroes -- set sail on the most epic voyage of all.\n\nA grand scale Action/RPG, Rise of the Argonauts™ immerses players in a gladiatorial adventure set in the vibrant and powerful world of Ancient Greece brought to life. Taking the role of Jason, players will battle alongside Hercules, Achilles and other Argonauts as they engage in brutal combat against formidable beasts and enemies, in a vast world alive with wondrous inhabitants and stunning panoramas. The search for the Golden Fleece is not only one of exploration but of transformation -- from warrior king to exalted hero touched by the gods.","January 30, 2014","true","118.9"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","13","33","0","1"

I was expecting my shield bash move to break the enemies' defenses, but instead, it just bumped them back, which did little to no help since I'd stay in my bashing animation for about as long as they staggered. You apparently have to break their shields with your weapon before you can kill them, which is really lame.\nYou have three weapons, a sword, a spear, and a mace. Just use the special moves on the mace (ground pound) and sword (slice in half) and you're fine.\nOh, and the mini-map isn't even in-game. You have to pause and go over to it to look.

The only major issue is there is no graphic setting which won't matter to most but when you have a pc that just staggers a tad to keep up, knowing only a little graphic tweek could make it run perfectly, it is the most fustrating thing in the world! But if you get it cheap, got a good rig, its worth the cash. 7/10 full price, 8.5/10 on sale.","February 15, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is good, like you would expect from an action type of game. You get to fight with 3 different weapons: Spear, Hammer and short sword.

Additionally you can block attacks and bash enemies with your shield. Finally you can dodge attacks and use "god powers", which are unlocked through a skill tree.\n\nThe skill system seems to be the game's most unique aspect. You fulfill deeds, e.g. "Killed 10 enemies with a sword" or "Made 10 choices aligned with Athene". Each deed is worth a certain amount of XP and can be dedicated to one of four gods (aka skilltrees). With enough experience in one tree, passive skills as well as active "god powers" can be unlocked. Reskilling is not possible.\n\nPositive Points\nGraphics are good.\nDialogs and story is decent enough (but not historically correct).\nPerformance is no issue.\nLoading times are short.\nCombat is quite enjoyable.\nInteresting skill system.\n\nNegative Points\nNo real graphics options whatsoever. They are however available via ".ini"-files.\nThe game frequently (about once an hour) crashes/freezes in random situations.\nCombined with the checkpoint system (no quick save/load) this can be really annoying.\nAt various places barriers are placed which you have to wait for opening.\nThe game's menu is badly optimized for keyboard/mouse control.\n\nSummary\nI'm going to finish playing this game, but can only recommend it to players which are not annoyed by its negative aspects.","February 17, 2014","false","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of those rare games where the well written and told story motivates you. The characters are interesting. Jason of Iolcus, is the Commander Shepherd of this game, the character you plays with. He is a fair minded King eager to find a way to bring back his wife from the dead. The other characters are memorable and each has a unique trait you may like or dislike them. Each quest is memorable and finally you have to do more than picking up ten flowers, which is usually the basic quests for most AAA RPGs. The combat is simple, but entertaining with all three weapon types (Spear, Sword and Maul). And the skill system, along with Goddess Athena and the Gods, Ares, Hermes, Apollo, is very interesting. Finally a game which does not have the standard XP system, but it's something new. You have to offer your completed quest deeds to these Gods to evolve. And strange, but I really enjoyed the last boss fight (Some may find it easy, but I liked it.). Unfortunately the game has some bugs and loves to crash to desktop (If it does, presumably you have more core than one. In that case CTRL-ALT-DEL after you start the game, select the game's exe in the Task Manager and set the Affinity to one CPU. Then go back to the game and it won't CTD anymore.). But other than this little problem, it's a really great game, reminds me for my other favorite, Titan Quest, just in TPS. Rise of the Argonatus is highly recommended for those who love games based on the Greek Mythology.","February 12, 2014","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it really is a GREAT game. I'm bothered a lot about gameplay getting in the way of the story; that does NOT happen here. The gameplay is quick to pick up and fairly intuitive. There's very little HUD (practically none), and each encounter is carefully planned/placed and makes perfect sense. It never feels like grinding.\n\nStorywise, it's a very rich game. If you love Greek mythology you'll have a fun time with how Rise of the Argonauts plays with it. My one complaint is that the story is very "plain." There are a few chances to complicate the narrative that are just passed by (the oracle, for instance, clearly switches between the maid, matron, and crone in her speech. Or as the Moirai, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. In either case it was a fun opportunity to make the character a bit more three-dimensional) but by and large this same plainness is done SO WELL that it really works for the game.\n\nThe graphics are dated, but they work well for the game as a whole.\n\nI finished the game at just over 10 hours on normal difficulty. I wasn't a super-completionist (can't be bothered) but I can't imagine it being much longer even if I were.

Of all its positive traits, the highlight was by far the story and character development. It had one of the most involving and well written stories I've ever played in a game, aided by very good voice acting and brilliant dialogue. It succeeded in emotionally involving me in the story and caused me to want to continue playing to see where it takes me. The combat system was average but enjoyable. The controls were responsive and the graphics beautiful. I was really impressed with the aethstetics and atmosphere that the game created.\n\nIn this third person action game, you will traverse a mythologically inspired Greece in search of the Oricle of Delphi and then the Golden Fleece. You will meet characters from Greek mythology and finally take the battle to Tarterus itself to battle the Blacktongues. You will fight monsters, debate philiosphy, choose gods, and earn divine powers, all for love. I hope you enjoy this gem as much as I did.\n\nI need to address one issue. Many people, myself included, experienced lots of dialogue related crashes early in the game. It doesn't always happen, so if the game crashes to windows, try again and continue to try until you get past the beginning part without it crashing, (it may take two or three tries).

Unfortunately, the combat, while not too dull, leaves much to be desired for. The animations can be weird, dodges are not as exciting, blocking is op (almost indefinite 100% block). The boss fights are even less exciting than normal combat. In short, the first thing they show you isn't what makes this game good.\n\nThe real jewel of the game is the atmosphere, the level design, the quest/characters/story. Dialogue is well done and voiced by good voice actors.\n\nAtmosphere - Every level you are in offers a different feel, and while the graphics aren't great in today' standard they can be quite enjoyable.\nStory/characters - I really enjoyed the story. It can really keep you engaged and keeps you wondering what will happen next.\nDialogue - Voice acting is well done, but what really pleasantly surprised me is that the dialogue with NPC changes almost always after something important happens. Even the less important characters say something differently. What is even more remarkable, is that NPS comment differently depending in which order you accomplished some things. You can really sense they put extra effort in this.\n\nAll in all, game is fun, not the best out there, but I've no regrets having played it.","August 21, 2015","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I realised I haven't reviewed this.\n\nAmazing game, seriously just something about it was so mesmerising. I started one evening at a LAN, everyone went to bed and I ended up doing an all nighter and finished around mid morning. Just looking around at everything I could do. Nice story. And the action was just epic enough with a few slowmo's which didn't get annoying at all as you could control the camera and when to speed up.","July 24, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, this game is a true gem. With a cute little love story, a somewhat attractive barrel-chested greek guy going to great lengths for his dame, and some fun enough combat... Well, I thought this game was good. Sure, facial animations were a little stiff, but it still got the point across. This game has memorable, fantastic characters. I really love Pan, he's the most interesting character, who is michevious and knowledgable. This game does a lot of justice to one of my favorite mythologies, albeit with minor adjustments. If you want a cheap game with a decent storyline give this a try. It's got a great mix of RPG elements and combat that isn't ALWAYS easy, but isn't always impossible. I did notice an issue I had with this game crashing, but setting processor affinity to only one CPU eliminated it. Too much fun to be had! I only wish it were longer!","October 19, 2012","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
