"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geisto/recommended/375230/","Geisto","Geisto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geisto/","177 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOpening Disclaimer:Review Updated on 5/13/2016\nThis is quite obviously, an Early Access Title.\n\nEternal Crusade is Behaviour Interactive’s lovechild, with Namco Bandai as it’s publisher at the helm. Games Workshop is actually holding the reigns over everything on a tight fray, as this isn’t yet another one of those 40k games cranked out fast, for easy money. No sir. The amount of attention to detail, passion towards fidelity and all the neat quirks you’ll get to see will make even the most Lore-buff person smirk. Couple to that, the fact that the entire team working on it absolutely loves the setting and is no stranger to it, it’s easy to figure out we’re in for a treat from the get-go.\n\nSo, here are a few things you should probably expect from an Early Access Alpha title:\n•	A metric ton of new players trying their best to figure out how the game plays\n•	Performance Issues (Most of which are highly dependent of your Computer Setup, not the Unreal Engine itself being “unoptimized”, More on that later)\n•	Frame Drops, again tied to your PC’s hardware.\n•	Userbase making use of hilarious and/or annoying bugs\n•	Flavor of the Month builds (Sometimes a new weapon is added for testing, and it needs heavy tweaking before they get it to it’s right niche slot.)\n•	Incomplete Features, being gradually fixed / added and tested as the game progresses.\n•	A random Crash-to-desktop here and there, complete with a bug-splat report system which you can describe your issue in order for devs to notice and hotfix if they are able to reproduce your bug, step by step.\n\nIf these things don’t scare you, I’m sure you’ll be able to drum up enjoyment out of it. Let me take the time to answer the question of “Is it worth the money?”, because that’s what everyone wants to basically get out of these reviews.\n\nHaving played this game before it hit steam, in it’s primordial, pre-alpha stage, with missing assets and features, I can say it has come a very long way. The game has evolved into a beautiful Lobby-based shooter, aiming towards a righteous mix between the old Space Marine game and Planetside 2.\n\nIf you remember the Warhammer 40k Space Marine game, and had as much fun with it as I had in the Multiplayer scene, then you should know that the potential in Eternal Crusade far exceeds that. Not only through sheer virtue of a better engine, but variety! Which one of you hasn’t dreamt of playing an Ork or Eldar, pitted against Loyalist or Chaos Space Marines? You’ll get to do that in Eternal Crusade, fairly soon too.\n\nIf you’re not adverse to the “Testing phase” of a game, and if you can handle the odd bug here and there, balance issues that will occur inadvertently as content is laden across with each patch, then you’ll surely want to be part of this wonderful, ever-growing community and get in on the visceral action of what’s already turning out to be a fun, great game.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade is a Third Person, Sci-fi MMO Combat-Shooter. Most of the action is obviously PVP oriented, squad-based gameplay with friendly fire in full effect, my friend Eihger did a wonderful job outlining the basics of Tactics in this game here.[forum.eternalcrusade.com]\n\nAside from the basic, over-the-shoulder third person ranged combat, the game has dedicated a lot of attention and emphasis on providing the players with a glorious melee combat system which makes the game feel like a distant, more able-bodied cousin of Space Marine.\n\nThe Developers based the principles of melee combat around a simple, skill-based system of “Rock papers Scissors”, featuring an array of different attacks you can perform such as Fast, Heavy and Defensive strikes. Each with their own separate set of animations. The System is explained in depth here.[forum.eternalcrusade.com]\n\nThere are currently two factions readily available for play out of the advertised, playable 4 :\n\n•	Space Marines\n•	Chaos Space Marines\n•	Eldar [Still in Development]\n•	Orkz [Still in Development]\n\nEach faction has five sub-factions, or “clans” to choose from(Initially there were 4, now we’re up to 5, and they will keep adding on as time goes on.)\n\nThese Sub-factions not only offer you unique looks, through the virtue of representation and planned customization, but they will dole out a unique bonus to your progression tree or add a certain distinction to a specific class such as aesthetics, possibly a unique skill or ability. For example, The Blood Angel Apothecary is known as a “Sanguinary Priest” whilst the Space Wolves have a unique variation/blend called “Wolf Priest” which, is, essentially a Chaplain and Apothecary rolled into one.\n\nThere is a cash shop on the website called “The Rogue Trader Store” and it’s purely for Vanity Gear and cosmetics, not yet implemented for testing, this will no doubt stem into the game’s already planned character customization system which stems with deep inspiration from Space Marine. http://imgur.com/a/gUpDM\n\nPerformance Issues\nThe game just received a massive Performance Optimization patch on 12th of May.\n\nI have played this game on two different computers, with two different connections.\n\nMy first computer in Europe, Romania, http://i.imgur.com/95EitiL.png ran the game semi-fluid, with the graphic setting to “max” [Which isn’t much to say about at the moment as the slider has only 4 “bumps” you can choose from, which gradually increase or decrease a slew of effects] with FPS ratings ranging from low 25-55, depending on how much carnage was displayed on screen. It was a fairly enjoyable experience, aside from suffering a lag spike here and there due to my ISP being shoddy or the Eternal Crusade servers being located within NA.\n\n2nd computer, in Canada http://i.imgur.com/gjwG31k.png  , runs the game flawlessly, without a single hitch. I’ve got absolutely no complaints and can’t wait to see the Graphics settings tabs updated for further tweaking. If you’re a performance junkie like me, and like to tinker and tweak for optimum efficiency or visuals, you can go into the game’s .ini files and edit them manually via GameUserSettings.ini (located here:C:\Users\"YOUR_NAME_HERE"\AppData\Local\EternalCrusade\Saved\Config\WindowsClient)\n\nIn Closing or TL;DR\nThe development team behind the game is open and shares their thoughts with the community at large via forums, they answer questions and generally interact with the populace. They offer a livestream every Friday for general QA, and play alongside the community on the servers. There is even an achievement for managing to kill a developer in-game, I snatched mine live on stream about a month ago!\n\nWhat makes this game special, to me, at least, is the fact that they’re not pandering in order to attract sales with shoddy business practices like offering silly, vanity crap like pets or lore breaking content. The bug exploits and general game-breaking content get hotfixed instantly or as soon as humanly possible with the push out of a new patch.\n\nThe team actively takes suggestions from the community and implements them if they’re sound and make enough sense, like the 5th subfaction choice which was decided via vote.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for, sign up now with my code  EC-4R9LMSPIXVVW9[www.eternalcrusade.com] and get 4000 points in the Rogue Trader store for use, and an additional 20,000 if you buy the game + all the goodies it comes along with!\n\nI will continue to update this review with relevant information as the game progresses significantly, as there is a character limit imposed.","April 14","true","103.6"," 155 of 182 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","155","182","7","1"

Just because I feel this game is too early to really enjoyably play. Some optimization has rolled out, and it seems to be heading in the general right direction. But I say, support these devs when this game comes out, they're already fully funded, so you shouldn't feel the obligation to toss your money at them just yet. If you REALLY want to give them money, I would say hell yeah, don't let me stop you. But I'm just putting this as a warning, don't be surprised when the game runs like sludge and everything is horrible looking and there's bugs everywhere. Because that's what I'm trying to get across. I've spent 120 DOLLARS on this game as a captain's level founder and I've yet to even get a proper game session in because of how badly it runs. But I accept this as part of the unoptimized crud that comes with an alpha build. I feel this game is going to be good when it comes out, but right now, my personal recommendation is to wait. After all, this is my opinion, not yours, and EVERYONE has one.  So if you feel so strongly against my thoughts, feel free to ignore them and buy the game. But as always, caveat emptor!\n\n\nPROS\n\nIt's Warhammer 40k (If you're new to the franchise then, feel free to enlighten yourself, it's top tier stuff.)\n\nIt's building off of Relic's Space Marine's design\n\nIt's deviating away from the basic MMO format (despite me generally loving that format, I like new things) I.e. no floating exclamation mark quest givers, real objectives, real challenge. (That's the plan anyways, right now its just a team based shooter with no open world, that will start to flow in later)\n\nThe devs seem passionate about the franchise, all of their "Into the Warp" DevSpeak livestreams show their love of the universe.\n\nThe models seem generally faithful to the 40k design. (Some exceptions, Blood Angel visor eyes should be green and not red for example, but the game isn't finished)\n\nSYNC-KILL EXECUTIONS! ( There's been a lot of multiplayer games that either forgo flashy taunty kills to prevent instant kills, but these are done only after the enemy is in the bleed out state aka you've already riddled them with holes, effectively removing that unfair advantage. The 2010 AVP game had that fault, where stealth kills were spammed constantly. The gratuitous violence fits 40k )\n\n\nCons (Sort Of)\n\nAlmost everything about the game right now. It shows INSANE promise, and I want this to succeed. Right now it just falls flat, really flat. It's an inferior Space Marine. But this game has a future, the prior title does not. So keep a close eye on this title, I feel it can be amazing, but right now, it's hardly deserving of being called a game, it's an alpha, I'd be shocked that it wouldn't be anything other than horrid. I don't want to come off as cruel or insulting, because I think these devs are really passionate and worthy of respect. It's just the title is too far off to be fairly judged, so I'm going to sound unfair, because that's what it deserves, harsh critique so they take it to heart and make it amazing. So I can proudly delete all of this and give it the big shiny thumbs up!

The commander and the wounded trooper pull out combat knives and begin to fight against the Chaos troops with their chains swords. Our wounded guy pulls out a grenade and types "rnnn', taking the 3 troopers with him.\n\nChaos marines are now running over the hill, heavy bolters are chewing up the ground in front of us, our vision is permanently disoriented as bolts hit our feet. Our commander starts shooting and we are firing blindly up the hill as we advance.\n\n"Hold that hill" the 5 year old sounding french commander shrieks. We obey. Standing 3 apiece we dump our magazines up the hill. after what seems like 10 min of a zerg there is silence. each of us has 25-0 kills. We are down to our last magazines each, we walk over the ridge to meet 30 new chaos marines screaming like zombies, rushing up to greet us.\n\n"Today is a good day to die, my french friend" says the space marine to my right, in a Texas drawl. Switching to his bolter pistol and knife.\n\n"Ive waited for this game for 10 years" says my possibly autistic French squad leader.\n\nThey begin dumping their last magazines into the screaming hordes charging up to meet us. The Texan begins screaming. A full throated scream over VOIP which would make Arron Bundy cry a small tear.\n\nThe Frenchman starts screaming, like a man 30 years his age. Full throated screams over VOIP.\n\nAs our guns begin to chime empty, our own Assault marines crash on the ground in front of us, jump jets blasting sand in our faces, cutting down Chaos Marines with chain swords.\n\n"nice one" types my Texas battle brother. Check out our KDR.\n\nI check, 37-1.\n\nOur commander never made it to the next hill. 20 space marines run past our small outcrop, guns blazing down the hill.\n\n"this game rocks" says our French commander, respawning.\n\nI agree. Its late, and half the Delta VIP lounge at Pearson Airport things I'm going insane or drunk. Likely both.\n\nIt doesn't matter, Chaos still walks. And I only have 10 min to my flight. We reload and run after the horde of Space Marines to zerg the next objective.\n\n*******\n\nYes, it has bugs and its a horrible knockoff Planetside 2 Clone. But in small doses, the game shines. And who knows, maybe it will actually become a half decent game.\n\nJust dont expect 50+ FPS, or proper hit boxes, or even stable netcode. Its also really easy to glitch the maps. But it is really fun in a way only Battlefield Bad Company 2 or Squad can claim for intense & personal war moments.\n\n\n12/10.

Not even to WH40K fans.\n\nThe problem with this Early Access is that its too early. Way too early. Developers are struggling to get the absolute basics of this game off the ground. To give you a clue: I've been playtesting since closed alpha and they are still trying to get melee to work.\n\nNote that I am not complaining about bugs, glithes or bad performance - all of which are to be expected in Early Access. I am talking about the underlying design of the "core combat experience", one that seems to be stuck in 1999. It feels very tired and dated, like a re-skinning of some old team deathmatch game. There just isn't enough in here, not even to get a glimpse of how the game will play out.\n\nBesides the shooter aspect, the "open world" part of this game is mostly unknown. After the company backtracked from its original promise of massive Planetside2 battles across an open world, the plan is to have instanced team deathmatch battles backed by a persitent worldmap. The size of those battles is still undetermined. It will probably be more than 16vs16, but they don't seem to know the limits of their own technology. And we hear promises of "post launch" open world implementation, which sounds like a red flag to me.\n\nIt honestly feels like we are paying to work for the company, Devs are trying out stuff as we test them in a bland lobby shooter. I am afraid that this Early Access came so early that people will lose interest in this game due to disappointment, burnout or just boredom. And BY THE EMPEROR I want this game to work because I am a huge WH40K fan. And, despite my negative review, I believe in this game, just as I believe in THE EMPEROR who I pray will guide this game to success.\n\nTL/DR; If you want to pay a good chunk of change to work as an unpaid QA tester, go for it. This game could go either way and its too early to tell. If you want Early Access to a WH40K game, wait 3 to 6 months and then buy in.","March 12","false","100.3"," 279 of 384 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","279","384","10","17"

As a huge Warhammer fan this game is going to be something amazing. I’ve been following the development from day one and what they have in store for us once the game is fully released is going to be fantastic, a dream come true for me: a 40k MMO.\n\nPlease be aware that this game is still in an Alpha build as I’m writing this, which means you will come across bugs with the sound and visual aspects. The developers themselves do weekly patches to address these issues, they supply us with a weekly production updates via Twitch where we can see all the new features that will be coming, and they listen to people's concerns and make sure they answer the questions people put towards them about game features and the game's future. For us who have been following this game, we know that once the game is released it will receive FREE expansions periodically (every three months) that will give players new content and abilities. The first expansion planned will add Terminators into the game!\n\nThere is performance issues at this time but the Developers are aware and are fixng the issues!\n\nAt this early stage, the MMO aspect is slowly being put into the game. Please don't confuse this with an MMO such as World of Warcraft with quests lines etc, when I speak of the MMO aspect I'm talking about the Massive Multiplayer part. At this current stage we only have 16v16 player matches, but that is soon to change, and tests have already begun of upping the numbers and creating more massive epic battles, I was lucky enough to take part in one of these tests and the increased player count made the game an absolute pleasure, it turned it into what 40k truly is, an epic battlefield. The next map to be added is going to be a huge fortress that will feature 60 players (30vs30).\n\nThe character progression system has started to be put into the game, the first stage of this has already been added with the character loadout menu where you can customize your classes by selecting what guns and perks to give them. They’ve also introduced the first stages of character progressive XP, at the moment it’s capped at only to level 10 but it’s laid the foundation to be built on.\n\nI could go on about certain classes and give you feedback but I think it would be best to give you visual references so you can see what you’re getting at this stage of development. I have put together a small collection on some of the Space Marine classes here.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFznDVzkakEzzlqu5PxET46ZmVFJrh76L\n\nHere you will find videos from me just messing around in the game from my Twitch Streams. It shows the basic gameplay and some teamwork.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFznDVzkakExSuFd5TVJ2qOoMfbV0PbGo\n\nAlso keep you can keep track of all the posts from the Developers:\n\nhttp://www.battle-brothers.net/devtrack\n\nIf you think I’ve helped you and you’ve decided to buy the game from my review, you can use my referral code (4000 free extra Rogue Trader points for both you and me): EC-3VMHIXL6DLZ8J\n\nFor the Emperor!","February 3","true","459.9"," 142 of 184 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","142","184","5","29"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/recommended/375230/","Coeco","Coe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/","270 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWARNING: Developers making threats after I uploaded this review, threatening to "moderate" it while stating that everything is "my opinion" (ad hominem) even though video & photo evidence has been given for every discussed point. Lead designers for this game are also jumping ship left and right: http://massivelyop.com/2015/05/01/eternal-crusade-lead-level\n\n---------------\n\nWarhammer 40k: Eternal Crusade is a game with immense potential. But as of right now, It is a hogwash of a shooter experience. Why? Let me list, demonstrate and explain 3 different areas of problems as to why I feel this way:\n\n---------------\n\n1. The movement system has SERIOUS problems. As of right now, It is -literally- impossible for you to traverse jagged terrain that is even slightly above your current elevation, be it mountains, a cliff, a rock or otherwise. Example of this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPdoGQ3v6Ao\n\nYou will NOT be able to get over/ontop of that thing unless you catch some air walking up a ramped area first or if you're a specific class with flying capabilities. This is contributed to the fact that there is indeed no actual jump button in this game. You either do a combat roll with spacebar or fly temporarily using a jetpack that is only available to the assault & raptor class. Any other way of getting around/over things REQUIRES you to have either the "Vault" prompt that is only available over railings or the "Climb" prompt that is ONLY available at certain windows (and boxes) that is within arms reach (And even this is a disabled 'feature' for 2 of the classes). All of this is made much worse with the design decision for player corpses to create collision positive ragdolls. Just executed a guy in a remotely tight room and/or in a corridor? Have fun floating and warping around on his glitchy corpse in the air, waiting for it to despawn or pray to RNG jesus that your character can slide off him and roll away before you die.\n\n----------\n\n2. The shooting mechanics in this game are currently horrendously frustrating on a multitude of different levels. Take using scoped weapons for example. Instead of having your character use the actual scope of the gun, he will instead "zoom in". "He could have a camera system in the scope going to helmet" you could argue.. But the zooming is not even made from the character's head. It is made very high up from his right shoulder which means that every shot you take while "scoped in", you'll have to deal with this kind of trajectory: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/317872034468448160\n\nAnother example is the massive handicap that dealing with rails and other waist-high objects bring, your character will, regardless of circumstances, absolutely refuse to brace or lift his weapon above cover to shoot on what is the other side. This means that If you have the higher ground behind cover, you will NOT be able to shoot downwards, giving the guy with no cover a horrendously big advantage unless you jump down: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/317872034468451967\n\nDuring my hours of play, I've found that the gunplay for next to all weapons feel incredibly inconsistent. Sometimes it feels like I'm shooting through walls, sometimes It feels like my gun is being shot from below my left waist, sometimes it feels like the bullets aren't going straight, sometimes I've shot behind a guy's àss (his shadow) just to be credited with a headshot kill.. There is just a LOT of wonky stuff going on with the guns and the player's perspective (and hit detection) in this game. To show another example that you can test yourself incredibly easy, simply look straight down and shoot with an even moderately long weapon to get these disconnected results of the bullets shooting out of the side of your gun instead of out the barrel as the distance from the barrel to the ground in this picture is about an inch: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/317872034468462058\n\nWith some minor research and close studying of mechanics, I've found out that the bullets are actually shooting out of your hands instead of your weapon most of the time, video example of this here with a tank in action where the shells are not exiting through the barrel of the gun: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEZvh6eR6ZA\n\nThis overall wonkyness is made much worse from the lack of flexibility this game currently has. You cannot change your shoulder view, you cannot change your dominant weapon hand, you cannot disable the "Cover" system that urges your character to slam and glue himself onto any wall or piece of cover he gets close enough.. And the list just goes on and on.\n\n--------\n\n3. Balance & Game mechanics. As this section is mostly up for debate, I'm simply going to quickly and briefly explain them and hopefully you'll see where I'm coming from:\n\n\nA) Tanks. They are absurdly durable, fast and can do the most hilarious flipping and flying I've ever seen in my life when driving over obstacles or tipping over: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il1ciRSei1A\n\nUnfortunately, they can also effortlessly snipe people across the map and act like giant meatshields to block up important corridors and pathways (Sometimes even mission critical): http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/317872034468675217\n\n"Just destroy them" you say? Doesn't work because the debris of said tank will still be there, blocking entrance and It cannot be moved or interacted with whatsoever. They are also the go-to tools for the in-game cancer that is spawncamping: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/317872034467348091\n\n\nB) A sorcerer healing someone that's knocked down with their beam can outheal INSANE amounts of damage done to the guy downed. This can make people essentially immortal in drawn-out corridor fights because if they get KO'ed, they can just crawl back into cover, get up and go back in before getting yet again, knocked down. Rince and repeat: http://imgur.com/MpJSzyo\n\nC) Melee spam is horrendously prominent and overly viable right now as people who play the role of meleeing (Assaults/Raptors) have not only the most mobility but also the most HP, being able to soak up enormous amounts of bullets while doing nothing but spamming M1 that causes you to become stunlocked before also shredding you dead with 1-2 hits effortlessly without cooldown or even a stamina cost while using the currently broken beyond belief chainsword. 99.8% of all Assault/Raptor user gameplay currently looks a little something like this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR1IGBIafj8\n\nD) Zerging. People can spawn with as little as 1-2 seconds after being killed and once mixed with say, a camping spawnbeacon tank, it turns into an utter f*ckfest where you can kill the same row of people 20 times within a minute and It will not slow them down in the slightest. There are no cool-downs whatsoever besides a predetermined timer that revives everyone every 12 seconds or so. Completely unacceptable in a game that also has a revive/knockdown system with dedicated healing classes.\n\n-------\n\nAlong with all of the above, the game also has a horrendous FPS & latency performance while also only currently having servers in the US. Sure, It's alpha. Sure, It's early access.. But there's less than 4 months left until the official release of this title and as of right now, the game is currently a small, instanced 16v16 space marine deathmatch simulator that's struggling with crippling imbalance, bugs, performance and lag when we were promised an entire MMO.\n\nTo add further doubt, the guys making this game has also been extensively planning "after launch" content which is at this point in time yet another excuse to release an unfinished game onto Steam.\n\nTL;DR: Game is roughly around 2-3 years from being done but the release is stated to be within 4 months. Exercise extreme caution when considering to buy this.","February 22","false","12.3"," 762 of 1,142 people (67%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","67","762","1","55","185"

It even let the community decide what the 5th sub-faction for each faction will be.\nThe team interacts with the community all the time.

The level designer was watching two different live streams of mine and started fixing problems right there and then as I was showing them to him.\nThis game is not throwing WH40k content together to attract buyers. In fact, it refuses to add content that would break the WH40k lore.

For those that have followed it, they've sent turbulence and upheaval not unlike an average day on Cadia. It's now to come to the Steam community for Early Access. How does it stack up? Take note this review will change based on the evolution of the game.\n\nAs of February 14:\n\nAs much as I don't want to say this, I cannot recommend this game to the average Steam user. This ISN'T all the fault of the developers, however to the average Steam user that would not matter. To begin with, the Developers are reporting a UI bug tied to the Unreal 4 engine the game is built on that, they claim, is taking away an ENTIRE 20 FPS from normal gameplay. To continue, Unreal 4 has known issues with AMD Products, that's made especially clear with this game. Again, that's a matter with the engine, however that is something to consider.\n\nOtherwise, the game is currently CPU heavy, therefore even excellent graphics cards will have mixed results with the current build as is. I personally get 20 FPS on a good day. The game would need to need to have its average performance increase a bit before I'd find it acceptable. Of course if that UI issue mentioned was cleared up maybe we'd be in a different ball game.\n\nSo, what about the game itself? This game is built to be a MMO3PS. The size of the battles are supposed to increase in time, but the current build limits to 16v16 in a lobby shooter. There is no valuable progression installed yet and the advertisement of Four factions and 20 subfactions is currently a dream. There are currently 2 Factions: The Space Marines and the Chaos Space Marines, and 6 subfactions.  That'll naturally make people scream WHAT ABOUT THQ'S SPACE MARINE?! That's valid, however the game plays far differently then SM, Cover is a lot more important and many would argue you're generally a bit more fragile (Except Melee which I'll get to) as well as squad based teamwork. As many will find, organized groups will be able to absolutely wreck PUGs. As in, it won't even be fun. There is in game voice communication, however it is currently rudimentary and lacking. The team is trying to make a game where KDR isn't everything, but as you might see from the score screen, it's still there, which means even if you do ridiculously well in that tree, you might not be first place since Objectives and support mean so much more.\n\nGunplay is getting there, it's fairly solid. The biggest issue is a perceived Low TTK, however thre are a bunch of factors influencing that, including Lag and the unoptimised state of the game right now. I personally find it alright. Currently All Vehicles are set to be Anti-infantry including an AutoCannon equipped Predator Tank. There are already several ways to effectively engage vehicles from an infantry position. Most would consider Vehicles too easy to kill on the smallish maps that are currently housing engagements.\n\nMelee is of course where this game seeks to establish itself. The classics are already in, so if you want a Power Axe, Baddabing Badda Boom, good to go. The melee system works on a Rock Paper Scissors approach. Quick attacks will beat Power Attacks, Power Attacks beat the 'Defensive Bash' or a counter attack, and the Defensive bash stops Quick Attacks. To further deepen the system the 'heavier' the weapon the more effective it is when attacks connect eventually leading to a stagger upon frequent 'clashes.' It's a reasonably decent system, the main problem with melee is that as soon as you get off the skill floor, and learn these mechanics, the sky is the LIMIT. Obscene KDRs are possible mostly due to two buffs on Melee focused characters: A damage incoming decrease and a Life Steal. As soon as you keep connecting with something any less than three people focusing you will NOT take you down in current builds.\n\nOverall, even though there are three maps, there are people that can play the game for hours upon days, it's definitely fun if you can play it. However, I don't believe the vast majority of the Steam Base can currently do so, and while I love the game. I cannot in good faith recommend it. I can however mention that the Developers are firmly invested in the game. Every Friday on their twitch channel twitch.tv/40kcrusade they provide status reports on what they're working on and will answer questions from the community. I very much like that and I will continue to follow this game because I do believe in it, but I will not recommend it now.\n\ntl;dr Version - Good ideas, Decent gunplay, Good developer, do not get right now if using an AMD system, Two factions, low overall performance, cannot recommend.","January 26","false","118.8"," 130 of 185 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","130","185","3","13"

That being said this game is fun in its current iteration, at least I find it fun.  If you are interested in this game ask yourself a few questions.\n\nDo you like Warhammer 40k IP?\nDo you like the Space Marines game?\nAre you patient and willing to actually test the game?\nCan you handle imbalances in the game for the sake of testing purposes?\nDo you want to be part of a growing community and get in on the ground floor of what could turn out to be a great game?\n\nIf you answered yes to those than you should read this.\n\nhttps://www.eternalcrusade.com/news/480-State-Of-The-Crusade-IV\n\nThat is what they are wanting to do, and if they accomplish it, this will be a really awesome game.  Right now they have a lobby shooter that they are adding more and more to.\n\nWatch this.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW3Xn4-Vf4s\n\nAfter reading that and you are wanting to purchase the game you can use my referral code EC-543AUYORC9A7E to get yourself more RTP points (4k RTP points) for the store when it opens up. The devs so far have stated that it will be side grades and cosmetic items.\n\nAfter purchasing the game, you should view these links.\n\nhttp://forum.eternalcrusade.com/threads/temporary-fps-solution.50043/page-31#post-1039241\n\nThat thread will help you gain FPS and make the game much more enjoyable, it is currently not optimized so you will have to tweak an .ini file to get the most out of it.\n\nhttps://forum.eternalcrusade.com/threads/tips-and-tricks.47140/\n\nThis one is on the Founder's thread so you might not be able to view it but it has some great tips and hints.\n\nhttp://forum.eternalcrusade.com/threads/tips-i-want-the-newbies-to-know.51317/\n\nThis one is in the general section and anyone can view it, very helpful information in there.\n\nhttp://forum.eternalcrusade.com/threads/pinkys-alpha-melee-guide.50629/\n\nUpdated melee info!\n\nhttp://forum.eternalcrusade.com/threads/melee-combat-rules.52694/\n\nThis will help you get a grasp on melee in the game, believe me this will help you even as ranged.\n\nDon't be shy to ask questions to the community as well, most people are willing to answer questions.\n\nI recommend this game but only if you are willing to participate in TESTING the game.  If you don't have the patience than I would wait until they release it in a more complete form.\n\nEDIT:  I will be adding the new stuff they have added to the EA server here since I posted this review.\n\nSo far the biggest addition is the fortress map which is 30v30 and pretty epic in scale.  The defenders have a limited amount of spawns and have to defend for a certain amount of time.\n\nThey added a global map that shows progression of a faction based on wins, this is the beginning of them adding conquest.","March 10","true","81.6"," 84 of 120 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","84","120","0","0"

But I'm not reviewing this for myself.\nSo you should very, very carefully consider the points the reviews here make and the fact that this is VERY Early Access, meaning there will very likely be issues.\n\nBut for me, well..\n\nThe moment when you rush across an open battlefield with autocannon and bolter shells flying through the air, a few of the latter glancing off your armour as you reach your injured battle-brother to help him up, after which the two of you take a second to ready your bolters and catch your breath before charging towards near-certain death together..\n\n.. that's Warhammer 40'000.\n\n\nThe Emperor protects.","January 26","false","189.1"," 188 of 295 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","188","295","4","12"

Well, it's a 3rd person shooter set in the Warhammer 40.000 universe.\nchoose between 4 factions, of which are currently available, and massacre each other for objectives.\n\nSupposedly it will evolve into a form of MMORPG with a world map to fight over. lets see if that will happen :)\nand with the new update, at least the world map is there for looks, if not yet implemented into the game\n\nPros:\n- 40k setting is beautifully realized. the initial three maps are well designed and give plenty of opportunities for teamplay\n- looks good, runs relatively smoothely (there's a lag though) ... since the last update EC runs even smoother. the FPS drop has gone down significantly for my machine and the overall graphics have been improved.\nThe new update has improved massively on the performance! I can now ramp it up a little without loosing performance\n- fun weapons, all lore. Chainsword, Bolters, Meltagun and more.\n- squad and class based combat, this really makes a difference. lone wolves normally do not last long, your brothers are your lifeline.\n- it's tough as ♥♥♥♥ing nails. don't expect this to be an easy killing spree\n- rewarding to play in nearly any role\nTake objectives as a Tactical Marine, destroy vehicles as demolitionist, strike fear into the heart of your enemies by surging down on jetpacks with the Raptor/Assault class\n- loadout customization. many would yawn at that, but you get to earn gear and aestetics, some with a kick, some for the looks. but it's all pure 40k :)\n- character progression. earn XP, not by killing, but mostly through capturing, interuppting or assisting your team (seriously, you can easily get to the 2nd or 3rd place on a match with being a teamplayer ;)\n- community is so far nice and friendly\n- 4 Factions: Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines are currentlye playable\nEldar and Orcs are on their way to join battle\n- I feel that melee combat has improved quite a bit. it is more fluent and rewarding and a real option in tight situations\n- frequent updates rolling in. expect maps, new races and vehicles and stuffs and things!\n\n\nCons:\n- Devs are rather slow when contacted and I find it funny that a threat for a new update goes on absolutely unmoderated for weeks ... and while that is still an issue, they at least work themselves through the backlog (just be patient)\n- can get very frustrating if the teams are unbalanced or you play with egocentric K/D fanatics.\nUpdate!!\nthe servers seems quite populated right now. plenty of action yet it feels as if the   expertise in\nthe community has gone down rather than up\nMy tip: follow any player with a PG upfront :P\n\n- maps are too damn small and not many out yet. but fun meat grinders that will challenge your witts and bravery\nUpdate!!\nthe newest map offers the chance for 30vs30 matches, quite fun\n- Early Access, but it is taking a more and more definite shape over the last few months\n- no Tau :/ (yeah, I'll be waiting)\n- wonky,, wonky controls, I feel that gamepad users are left in the cold here. it offers the pad as input yet the controlls are less than optimal especially on the selection screen\n- the spawn points ... this has gotten slightly better, but with the last update it has become a pain to select spawn points with a 360 controller\n- the selection screen is one godawful piece of work ... you see chats, but are unable to interact in any fashion. the navigation is sloppy and some inputs don't work on the pad, yaaay\n- still no spectator mode, at least let us follow our own faction. especially when the spawns run.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIt's work in progress, sure, but it already packs quite a punch and shapes up to hit you several times afterwards.\nit definitely offers a good combat experience and should be observed, at least, by any 40k fan that wants to build his own character to slaughter in the Emperor's name.\nIf you are unsure about early access games, wait a little, see how it will turn out.\nI for myself got a lot of fun and fight for my buck and will continue to play ;)\nAnd over the last weeks there has been a steady improvement on the game, the tweaks are noticable and serve the evolution of the crusade.\n\n\nI will see you on Arkohna, brothers and Xeno scum","February 10","true","85.0"," 82 of 121 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","82","121","4","7"

I genuinely enjoy running around and fighting in this game. From the streams I'd seen of it, I didn't expect that, but I wanted to jump in before the founder programme ended, so impulse purchased.\n\nI am VERY excited to see where this game ends up, and they have BIG plans.\n\nWith that said... You need a BEAST of a computer. This is a hugely unoptimised game.\nBut we're all in the master race here with GTX980s, so let's assume that's not an issue! It's buggy. Don't expect some blizzard level of polish for an alpha test here. The UI isn't intuitive. They've just added in a new loadout scheme, which I very much hope they change as it's simply bad.\nI would argue that they went on to Steam too early.\n\nWith that said, if you have a computer that can handle it and you like warhammer then this is a MUST BUY game. Also, get this bad boy on your wishlists, because it is clearly going to be an amazing game. A bit of optimisation, and a tutorial, a few bug fixes, and this would be an amazing game in its own right.\nBut that's not all they're going to do! The gameplay is solid, and enjoyable. They'll be adding PvE, open world, MMO, everything. And that's around the good core they've got.\n\nGREAT GAME, BUY IT NOW, PLAY IT IN 6 MONTHS","January 26","true","13.8"," 88 of 134 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","88","134","5","0"

I love Warhammer 40K, I always have.\n\nIt is very poorly optimized in its current state, so I could not recommend it on that alone. I tried it multiple times through out the Founder play period, and my FPS couldn't get over 10 on ultra low settings in a low resolution mode. My PC is well beyond the recommended specifications, so I blame very poor optimizing at this point. It's hurtful to give a negative review on just that, but that's the truth of it. If you can't play the game, then why get it. I know there has been complaints on the website forums for some time now, and I don't recall seeing an official response on the matter.\n\nEdit 02/04/2016\nRecent patch improved optimization, but not by a lot lot. I went from 10-15, into the 20-30 range. It's "playable", but hardly so. This is on minimum graphics quality, and windowed 800x600 resolution.\nEnd Edit\n\nThey removed the free to play Ork version, which was a pretty big selling point if you ask me. It would allow players to play the game for free as Orks, which would give them a chance to test the game before buying. They have removed that, and it is now being sold as a buy to play game for $50.\n\nThe game is meant to be a large open world war, but it is not in its current state. It is just team deathmatches on maps right now. I only recall one map from the time I played around with it in the founder pre-alpha.\n\nGood things I can say is:\nIt feels like Warhammer 40K.\nWith the settings cranked up on Ultra (although unplayable for me), it looks wonderful graphically.\nWeapons and vehicles feel like Warhammer 40k weapons, as far as sounds and looks.\nDevelopment team is staying true to the Warhammer 40K lore.\nIt's very satisfying to use executions.\nA very teamwork driven game.\nSome negatives:\nThey backed off the Ork free to play model.\nRather high price tag for what you get, which is very few maps and 2 factions.\nRuns poorly (explained above).\nMovement feels clunky and jittery. I know Space Marines are bulky, but that isn't what I am referring to. Maybe it's the animations?\nHit detection and responsiveness feel awful.\nMelee combat feels clunky.\nGame balance is terrible. Expect a lot of Plasma Cannons Devastators/Havocs, and Assault Marine melee stunlock. Reminiscent of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine multiplayer.\nDefault control scheme for Keyboard & Mouse feels awkward, rebinding required.\nIn conclusion, final thoughts.\nIt is extremely barebones, poorly optimized, but a faithful Warhammer 40K third person shooter. Imagine Space Marine given a large scale treatment, just very empty at this point. I wouldn't expect much replayability right now.\n\nI would like to add, yes I know it is an "alpha", though I find that as a poor excuse. If a developer is ready to start charging $50 for their game, then they are ready to receive critique on it. So I ask you to not give me that "alpha/early access" junk in the comments.

Core idea of the game seems good, but what is shown so far is far from it, due to several things coming together.\n\nFirst is the gameplay balance itself, the attitude of the developers so far is that the "Ground Assault" class on the side of the loyalist Space Marines (LSM), usually called "Shieldbro" should be the "best duelist". It can withstand bolter fire, unlike its somewhat-counterpart on the side of Chaos Space Marines (CSM),  which creates a disparity and cripples the tactical possibilities of CSM.\n\nSecond, and probably at least in part caused by the first point, is the faction population imbalance. LSM have a lot more players, which results in long queues on LSM side and instant pops on CSM side. But of course, for one reason or the other, people don't want to switch and the situation only gets worse and worse. More populated side has a wider skill pool, and is a bigger magnet for organized players. I experienced a similar thing in WoW, playing on Horde EU.\n\nAs it stands, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. Extreme caveats for the potential buyers. If you like imbalanced PvP, either to be carried into easy wins after long queues, or, opposite, you are a masochist who likes to go against impossible odds, go for it. Otherwise, I advise waiting for the release.\n\nOld review:\n\nAs of the time of this writing (March 4th 2016), even in the alpha state, this game is an awesome multiplayer TPS (third person shooter). I usually don't like PvP in MMOs, but this is something else. Success depends entirely on the coordination with your team and skill, gear (at least so far) isn't a factor. Everyone has an equal chance to shine. It reminded me of Star Wars: Battlefront, except in WH40k universe.\n\nWhat I don't like so far is that the battles can get a bit messy. There is friendly fire and sometimes there isn't much distinction between a friend and a foe. Some combinations of color schemes/models can look very similar between factions. This is emphasized by the fact that the only two factions present are Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines. More distinctive marks on the opponents or a more distinctive look of the models would be welcome.\n\nSo far, the game looks promising. Announced PvE and more races/factions only contribute to the overall feeling.","May 5","false","131.3"," 62 of 100 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","62","100","3","43"

But it is not the game itself i paid for (maybe particulary), i paid for a promise and hope that there will be a fine Warhammer 40k mmo.

If you liked the third person shooter with nearly equal melee set in the 41st millennium emphasis you will probably enjoy this game. I became a early founder and spent a good deal of time slaying other  heretics and loyalist for months. The announcement of this title coming to early access has some perks but was also controversial for those in the community.  I will share some of the positive and negative points around this game as they have decided to enter early access here on steam.\n\nI will start by stating I think this game has some promise but at this moment in early access the game suffers from some big issues.\n\nFirstly, the game was initially sold as to be a much larger more MMO experience with assurances of being hundreds of people participating in battles along with "tactical combat." Unfortunately the game has stepped back from some of these features and been reduced to smaller maps with slower development. As it stands it is mostly a match making lobby shooter with a couple dozen players on opposing Space Marine vs Chaos classes. There is also a limited selection of vehicles like rhino transports, predator tanks... with possible units like siege tanks and far far later dreadnoughts (maybe). No speeders or bikes as of yet. Maps are somewhat larger than Space Marine, but probably smaller than say Battlefield. A big disappointment for me is the current lack of other factions: Eldar and Orks. Eldar have been briefly teased with in game footage and also some vids showing the motion capture work. Orks? Well very little to nothing. Forum polls also show space marines lead in popularity (surprise) over the other faction choices... so expect many many space marines running about (and can be seen with wait times and population in matches currently). Tyranids will be some sort of PVE experience and also a sort of equalizer for the clear population imbalance this game has.\n\nPerformance is the biggest hive tyrant in the room currently as through the near entirety of close founder access has been very poor. As in 25-35 FPS depending on system (some with high end systems will report poor performance). There has been some advancement and bug squashing to remedy this and there has been some positive gains in the 10-20 FPS bringing the game to a playable state. I personally get solid 35-60 fps varying by map and amount of players. I have a I7 3770k and 770 gtx SC for those wondering. The developers have promised some more future effort to polish up optimization and also hiring a new developer to work on improvements. But since the game is technically still alpha expect drastic reductions in FPS or bugs, obviously to be present.\n\nGameplay is fluctuating beast. One week you may find a class or loadout clearly OP. For example the stormbolter produced weeks of cheesy easy kills as people could be mowed down by this weapon. Another recent week we faced Nurgle marines who could easily slice through groups of players. Melee is constantly a tug of war mix of testing percentages vs. survival rates and TTK. Ultimately this game is supposed to be rock scissors papers but also emphasis on cooperative "tactical" gameplay with squads and factions. So I suppose for now don't get hung up on seeing people with 40 /5 K/D as a specific class. Shooting is just OK in the game (no FPS mode) and I find the melee to be rather poor. Battles as of now are mostly just capturing points like any other common shooter anyway. The balance issues are being tackled so you will see some silly things and things are in flux.\n\nThe graphics do not much impress unfortunately. I think this is both a limitation for trying to cram as many players into the unreal engine but also the fact this game will eventually be ported to consoles. So not really a PC masterrace sort of experience to be had here. They are working to get the latest builds of Unreal into the game as they come online, so I would expect continued advancement in the fidelity and effects of the game though.\n\nAudio and music is good enough. Weapons sound punchy and the music is fitting with typical space marine speech.\n\nIn some ways this reminds me of Mechwarrior Online and their access program. The devs however for eternal crusade are VERY communicative and engaged with the community.  They are listening, providing weekly streams with updates and also popping into alternative channels like twitch streams hosting the game. With luck things will continue to pick up over the coming months and we will see if they can hold to their updated promises.\n\nIn closing, I gave own honest insights into the game for potential new customers and also for the developers. New players: if you like 40k and more importantly space marine I think this game might be for you. Anyone outside of this sphere may find the game lacking and frustrating as it continues forward through development. Shooters are a crowded space and there are usually only so many people are willing to devote oneself to playing. For now, expect a very basic average lobby based shooter with some melee and two near identical factions.\n\nHopefully this limited situation does not persist for much longer and the game opens up with new factions, loadouts, rpg element,  map modes...","January 26","false","95.5"," 42 of 68 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","42","68","0","0"

Full disclosure, this is an Indie studio trying to eventually make a AAA game. You are not going to get near all the features that you want at this point in the game. This is in early, EARLY Alpha. This game is going to be worked on for AT LEAST the next 10 years. The developers love the IP. They are super transparent and listen to the community, and you can see the progess of the game LIVE every Friday on their Twitch episodes (http://www.twitch.tv/40kcrusade). They explain what they're working on, what they've changed, what is a priority (full keybindings soon) and all of their hopes and dreams.\n\nRight now in the game, your rig is going to need to be decent. If you check the forums, some awesome members have given guides how to tweek your game as to how to get some pretty decent FPS if you find it unplayable. It's all a matter of making some tweaks, as the graphic options in the game are basic default Unreal 4 engine settings, that don't do a whole lot...\n\nAs for the game itself, it's not yet the MMO you're looking for. It's a very early shooter, with minor Asymmetry balance. Random map rotations, and random attack/defense placings. Very barebones customization as far as loadouts are concerned, but much, MUCH more to come as customization (both in loadouts and visuals) are a top priority. You cannot yet really join with friends, other than a simple Steam option to jump into a friend's game, but even that is chancy. The studio is small and they are pushing as hard as they can to make the game you want, but it's going to take time.\n\nBalance is constantly shifting. Melee used to be useless, and now can seem slightly overpowered. But there is a counter to everything. Don't expect one loadout to accomplish every single task, and switch loadouts to bring what your side needs more of in the battlefield. Don't get tunnel vision. That said, some loadouts are more versatile than others, and some are very narrowly focused (don't expect to snipe infantry with the Lascannon. This isn't Space Marine. Lascannon is anti-tank, and that's bout it.)\n\nIf you are willing to help test out an early game and help make it the game we all have been waiting for, then please participate. Everything is constantly changing as patching is regular, so nothing you hate will necessarily remain in the game, as it is nowhere near close to a final, polished product. But I'm having a blast, and I'd love more of you to join so I can melt your faces.","January 27","true","283.5"," 31 of 48 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","31","48","0","0"

And I wasn't paid to do it!\n\nI've been an active part of the Eternal Crusade community for years now and seen just about all there is to know. The game has gone through some turbulence prior to early Alpha in regards to plans for how the game will be built but the pieces have slowly been coming together since the first release of the game. Because of the evolving nature of an early access title It's hard to talk about all the fine details that are going in and out of the game but i can provide some info on the latest developments.\n\nJust recently the max player count has doubled to 64 players and along with it came a fortress map. We've been getting quite a number of new weapons such as the multi-melta and power maul. New Eldar and Ork information/assets are being showed to us on a weekly basis. Eldar is scheduled to come out first then Orks.\n\nSo on to the question of whether you'd be enjoying early access or not. If you're a 40k fan who understands what an alpha and beta is then i would recommend to invest early. If neither apply to you then you'd be better off waiting.\n\nThe game is feature incomplete and not yet at the stage to be fully optimized or balanced. You'll need a decent machine to run the game well atm. There are currently some problems with AMD hardware.

Tons of balance issues to work out. Mostly, though, this is the worst use of UE4 I've seen. Mean Greens feels like a AAA title by comparison, and I guarantee that wasn't in development for 2.5 years. I've not seen an alpha feel this broken in a while, maybe ever. In gameplay terms, EC makes Space Marine look like UT4.\n\nAnd none of that even touches on the fact that this was supposed to be an MMO. But there are literally no MMO aspects yet. Just 16v16 right now. And I've never played an MMO alpha (rpg or otherwise) that has started out this incomplete. Half the factions, no pve, no xp or gear system. Just loadouts and shooting. In a poorly optimized engine. With some of the most sloppy melee and ranged combat. Escuseable for an MMO. Not so much for 32 player capture-and-hold.\n\nMaybe it'll get better. But I don't think there's reason to have hope. They've done nothing but scale back their goals, and still deliver a sub-par product. Even for an "mmo" alpha.\n\nThey're asking money for this garbage. Please don't give them more.","January 26","false","1.4"," 40 of 66 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","40","66","0","0"

Note just because I gave this a thumbs down doesn't mean I am dissing this game for ridiculous reasons. This isn't a final review since it is in alpha so don't flip out ok?\n\nPositives:\n\n1. Plays somewhat well and has variety in classes so far.\n\n2. Gameplay and hud is pretty ledgit and easy to figure out.\n\nNegatives that need fixed up:\n\n1. Chaos Ground Assault loadout only has 700 LP which is very unfair since you need atleast one melee weapon and just having the melta bomb there costing too many lp. Which you can't equip due to lack of points and also you need a melee weapon to even the bomb for it.This just makes this loadout completely useless and unnessecry to have for a choice. Since it's loadout is only a pistol and a melee weapon. Even with a grenade this loadout is a dumb down useless version of the jumpjet assault and the sorcerer loadout. (Either make it so it allows 1000 LP or don't include this as a loadout choice.)\n\n2. Lags once inawhile may need some fixing up to help improve the gameplay.\n\n3. Plus Heavy units should have a side arm like in the 40k Space Marine game otherwise they really have no alternative to fight if they run out of ammo or against a melee based unit.\n\nAgain this is not an official review just somethings I think need addressing. Plus I hope there are Terminators and Commanders in this! :D","January 28","false","17.3"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","24","37","0","0"

That said...\n\nThe game is a lobby third person shooter with a world map in development.\n\nMelee combat is huge and knowing how to use the melee mechanics is one of the more difficult but rewarding things. Nothing like being a plain old Bolter Space Marine and fighting off a Mark of Nurgle Assault Marine with power axe while you are artfully slashing them with your knife.\n\nEven then with the most mastery of those mechanics it is a big buggy but still manageable.\n\nShooting in the game is the standard affair for a third person shooter except you get crazy weaponry like melta guns, lascannons, plasma cannons, etc.\n\nThere is friendly fire so expect to die at least once per match to a caution to the wind plasma toting friendly who fires into combat recklessly to get their kill at the expense of your life.\n\nThey currently have a few maps, one of which is a cool fortress with a great setup where defenders have 300 lives and need to defend 2 objectives in 30 mins or before they lose 300 lives/tickets. The attackers have to breach the fortress gates OR sneak through tunnels to ninja cap the first objective before pushing onto the second objective in the inner fortress.\nThe rest of the maps are tug of war style or conquest style objective maps. All of these maps will be tied together for the larger war effort and each instance of a battle will count towards each factions control of those territories.\n\nRight now we only have Loyalist Space Marines (LSM) and Chaos Space Marines(CSM) with a few differences in looks and some different classes by playstyle. Example the LSM have apothecaries that can carry bolters or a pistol and chainsword that can also heal players or instantly pop up downed players with their special ability in close range. While on CSM side they have aspiring sorcerers who can heal from a distance with psyker powers at the expense of their heal being more of a heal over time vs instant refill. There are a few other class differences like that but not much yet.\n\nThey do have a cash shop for vanity gear IIRC but its not implemented in game yet for testing. Also the servers are in Montreal so if you are not on this side of the planet your lag may be really rough just FYI.\nThey have 3 vehicles types Rhino (10 man Armored personnel carrier), Predator (5 person Battle Tank), Vindicator (Breaching fortress walls).\n\nOverall if you pay the 39.99 and expect it to be pretty buggy as an alpha, don't expect open world, don't massive battles with hundreds/thousands of players and have some patience for balancing in progress with alot of strategies changing based around that then it really is a fun game as my 254 hours hint at least for me.\n\nI've had alot of epic moments with random players by rallying a squad and counter charging enemies in a big mess of melee, or frantic last stands in the fortress with the team trying to survive the waves of enemies breaking through, or crazy cat and mouse fights with air assaults, or the times a buddy of mine both play air assault marines and coordinate flank a huge group of enemies throw frags at the edge of their group so they cluster then slam into them from the sky and unleash chainsword hell on them ...so many good times and the game hasn't even launched yet :D\n\nIf you do want to give it a go and want a clan and like my insane response here then check out http://battle-brothers.net\nOh and if any of you do buy the game and want to get some added perks like rogue trader points then feel free to use my referral code so we all get some points to abuse the Warhammer 40k Rule of Cool in game :)\n\nReferral Code ---> EC-8HJOW3PWQFX91\n\nIf you guys have any questions let me know and my Steam name is [V-M] Krage as well I try to help new players as much as I can to make for a better community in my limited powers for good lol.","April 5","true","365.7"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","24","37","0","0"

If you get salty over things not being polished and perfect then wait. I barely played it 3 hours before someone was whining and moaning about "They've turned it into deathmatch". They haven't, it's a development stage. At the time of playing there's 3 maps doing 20v20.\n\nAnyway, in it's current state these are the important things:\n\n* FPS is awful, about 15. If you turn the settings down to halfway the FPS gets into a smooth state, thankfully. But half of the textures become play doh.\n\n* It reminds me of Planetside if it played like Space Marine.\n\n* The loadouts are varied and feel like they'll offer an awful lot of customisation in a finished state.\n\n* Plasma guns overheat and blow your balls off as they should.\n\n* Melee is overpowered as all hell and not in a fun way.\n\n* The Z-Axis is important, there's a lot of lifts and travelling up and down. The maps are very well designed and I hope that represents what the buildings will be like when the game goes from Deathmatch to MMOFPS. A lot of bottlenecks and doorways.\n\n* Good cover system, cling to a wall and shoot through the doorway. Feels good until grenades fly in.\n\n* Buggy, sometimes you spawn or get picked back up and start spinning around like you're at a crazy disco. I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself laughing, but there sure are just as many bugs as you'd expect. Although I will admit, it hasn't crashed once.\n\n\nAll in all, the early access alpha is giving me a very clear impression that when finished, this will be a damn good game and an easy 5 out of 7.\n\nI only wish it had fliers and Guard.","February 8","true","5.2"," 35 of 58 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","35","58","8","0"

What's on Founder's Servers is under NDA, and its for founders, not the regular player wondering if he should buy EA on Steam, though I am a founder and I have taken the progress on UAT in consideration, I'm not talking about it.\nI'll be focusing on 2 aspects here:\n1 - Playability in the current state.\n2 - Project progress.\nThis review is for actual Steam EA players:\n\nAbout Progress:\nI'm following twitch every friday and I'm on the founders community since they launched the founder's pack, guess I bought my captain's pack apr-2015 if I recall correctly.\nStill since I got access to this game (oct 2015) I have seen nothing of progress but some maps, weapons, voice acting, and ground assault (those were the most significant) delivered. Took them 9 months to get only that going.\nNow whats still missing from the checklist until they deliver the launch version??\nLets see: http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/375230/extras/Infographic_Steam_616px.jpg\nHumm, you see my point?\nSeriously, I hope with all my heart bE will deliver that version on 2016 (as promised), but by the pace shown so far, well, I would say they didn't get even 25% from the checklist done in these last 9 months and 2016 will end in less than 7 now...\nIt just doesn't seem likely.\nBut hey, have faith... I still have... some... a little...\nJust not enogh to thumbs up this and not feel I'm deceiving myself.\n\nAbout Playability and FPS:\nThe game itself is very fun, and way better than playing Space Marine multiplayer mode. However this ONLY apply if you have the "right" PC setting, which I don't have nor any one I know of.  The recent Unreal Engine 4.11 patch was my last hope regarding this issue, and nope... nothing changed, not 1 fps gain, actually it has got a lot worse for many of us.\nI bought this (EA) game for some friends as gift a while ago and no one played since no one can run it (even though they match system the requirements). FPS is just horrible playing on any pc but the ones the developers seems to use.\n\nMy guess:\nIts early access, but the progress is way too slow. Eldars were promised before christmas 2015 and maybe will get to play with them before christmas 2016. Orks... well, by the pace of the development maybe in 2017 summer or later. Let alone the rest of the promised things.\n\nConclusion:\nVery enjoyable to play but unplayable (for now), very ambicious and promising project but the development is veeery slow, almost stagnated.\n\nIts not smart to buy this game right now, wait and see how the development will progress.\nSincerily trying to not lose my faith on Behaviour.","May 18","false","100.0"," 37 of 62 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","37","62","0","26"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zar65/recommended/375230/","zar65","Renbot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zar65/","283 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis isn't a 'Yes' review so much as it is a 'Neutral' review.\n\nQuick TL;DR -  Do not buy this game if you want something remotely well optimized, or completed as of the date of this review.  Wait and see a couple of months.  Buy the game if you have a beefy PC, really want a 40k TPS fix, or just want to support the developers.\n\nThis game has a lot of promise, and is pretty fun even in the barebone state of Alpha gameplay that it finds itself in.  However, I would hold off on buying this game due to multiple reasons.    First, some quick positives.\n\n+Fun gameplay - think Battlefield/Battlefront meets 40k Space Marine\n+Really brutal fights, especially in melee\n+A ton of potential if the devs live up to their promises (which they seem to be smart about now and have tempered a lot of what was promised when the game was first released)\n+Devs that are very talkative, communicate well with the playerbase and are open to suggestions\n+Solid foundation of things to come\n\nNow for the negatives, which is ultimately why I  even flip-flop on saying if this game is worth buying.\n\n-Completely awful optimization.   This is one of their priorities but if you don't have a mid-high PC or better, you probably are not going to have a good time.  My PC isn't the best but it's certainly not low tier, and I feel like I'm playing in my old ♥♥♥ laptop when I play this game.    760 GTX, i5 4670k and 16 GB are quick specs for those interested.    This is also due in part to the game's engine, which is actually UE4, which is sort of new to my knowledge and has a lot of optimizations to work out.  However, the game is months from release, so hopefully it is ironed out soon.   If this is not fixed this could potentially be the game killer for a lot of people, as it was in another similar game Planetside 2.\n\n-Barebones.  It's Early Access, and at the moment the game has three maps and two factions, with limited weapon selection and no customization or any of the MMORPG elements implemented.   This is soon to change, with many things upcoming and two other factions on the horizon, with one (the Eldar) being 'soon', which is more than likely 4-6 weeks as of the time of this writing.     Do not buy this game thinking you're going to get a remotely complete package.\n\n-Balance issues.   This is actually relatively low on my list, but the game will need a lot of balanace tweaking and design changes if they want this game to be more competitive.   It's not awful at the moment, but once optimization is fixed the devs will hopefully begin to focus on making things interesting per class/faction.\n\n-Optimization.   This one cannot be stressed enough.  It's awful.\n\nSo overall - a game with enorumous potential that's already fun despite almost no content and awful framerate stuff.    Buy it only if a super serious dedicated 40k fan, or if you want to support the developers.","January 30","true","16.1"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","30","49","0","0"

At the moment you either play as marines or chaos rather than the variety of four armies. No perks for your characters yet, but you can see where they are going to put that in. Also there are only 3 maps, with very similar game types. Then again it is Alpha testing, and is pure chaotic fun. The game is less glitchy then most shooters out there in full mode.\n\nIf this really does sell on, it could be massive, more game modes, more armies added as dlc's (tau and nercothingys etc). I cant wait to see the tyranid part. They could even add to the current armies, terminators and dreadnoughts etc. Can really see huge potential.\n\nI lost my interest in gw stuff long ago, but this brings pure joy, havent enjoyed a shootout this good since cod mw2.

As a Planetside 2 fan i think a 40k MMO Shooter will be spectacular to behold, something i've long wanted thus i'm happy to support this project through it's development.\n\nBut is it any good now? I think so. It's worth bearing in mind it will be a while before it enters it's MMO phase, it has more in common with battlefield crossed with Space Marine at the moment. It's very similar to space marine in fact, the controls are almost the same so if you liked that game, and more specifically it's multiplayer, you'll probably like this.\n\nA lot of people are having issues performance but i havent (40-60fps even on max).

I really really want to like this game, for me I was hoping for a tighter more stable version of Space Marine Multiplayer crossed with open world Planetside 2.\n\nIt doesn't feel responsive enough to be on par with similar fps games, feels far too clunky, I understand that this is still Alpha, but you get a feel for games even in the early stages of development whether this is going to be a slick, responsive system.\n\nI know that for alot of people they probably won't care about this part, but it really doesn't have the Grim Dark feel to it, the level design is too blocky, to me it doesn't feel like a natural landscape, let alone battlefield of the 41st millenium. Sure there is Gothic style architecture, but it almost has a stylised comic book feel to it at present.\n\nThere are lots of things that just aren't quite right, but they still kind of have the potential to change, one thing that stands out to me though, (it will sound stupid)\n\nWhen sprinting, why does it look like that they are comical knuckle dragging orangutans, with the bounding strides, with the legs so far apart when doing so.\n\nBut anyway, in its current form, I don't recommend, but really really want that to change - If they feel that it is well enough along to be given Early access, I hope they update frequently otherwise I fear the worst.\n\n\n\n\n","January 28","false","6.4"," 33 of 58 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","33","58","0","3"

I don't know if it's just my system or something, but the graphics aren't *AMAZING*, and there is a bit of lag once in a while that can ruin your game - but it's early and has just arrived, so in my opinion hold off on spending $40 / $50.

While clipping into walls and players can be annoying the menuing is atrocious. Fire spamming from guns even tho a player is not shooting, kick and power attacks not opperating as they should, the list can go on.\n\nFractions... I can expect a ton of "Chaos just works better as a team" or "Learn to plays." Well I've played both sides, while most warhammer enthusists will stick with what they love most, in the spirit of actually improving this game I tried my best to put in equal hours into both sides. I can say without a doubt that my matches won as Chaos out did my matches won as SM. Could this have been because of skill sets between players? Probably, but the classes between the two had such glaring issues that I could say it's doubtful. So lets go over why that is maybe.\n\nClasses:\n\nTraitor/Tactical: Ranged attacker, and can cap. Only problem with Traitor as of right now is Plasma gun, the rate of fire to damage output of this gun is beyond acceptable. Either tone down the damage or reduce the fire rate.\n\nHavoc/Devastator: Anti-tank/supression, overall fine as it stands with the exception of glaring issue of the Plasma gun, again damage to fire rate is not ok. Also lascannon tho good feels as if the charge timer when tracking a target is a bit too long.\n\nRaptor/Jump Assault: Jump pack, kill back line. Some anti-tank in it tho i feel melee killing is more important for this class. Its hit or miss in terms of balance, melee works as it should sometimes other times it doesn't.\n\nSorc/Apothecary: Healers.... This is were the class imbalance begins. A ranged constant heal to a up close stand still and wait heal is a joke. Some say the apothecary has better range fire and damage, but as it currently is that amounts to jack ♥♥♥♥. The apothecary just doesn't  fill his role as healer/support with how his current heal stands.\n\nNurgle/Shield Assault: And now for the biggest upset... Nurgle. Damage output, heal, high damage resistance. These put this class at the head of the game. Oh yeah, and it can cap points... When I would play as this class i could go anywere from 30 to 40 kills and minimum deaths and I'm not even that fantastic or have a rocking computer to give me an edge. As shield assault your shield just does not give you that edge to be a true credit to your team, hell your team will end up killing you more as you try to defend them from incoming fire simply due to how team damage works.\n\nLast is Tanks. Defenders doooo not need assault tanks. At all! If they must have them then reduce the amount that are allowed and increase the cooldown in takes to spawn them.\n\nTo end this review I gotta say I had mass hope for this game, I loved Spacemarine multiplayer even with the issues it had. Sadly with how current balancing is and Chaos simply too strong in terms of just two classes I'm having trouble keeping intrest. Again people who read this and are all about Chaos and stomping SM remember, without those players who play that faction you won't have people to play against and this game will fail.","February 6","false","165.2"," 42 of 76 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","42","76","4","7"

As a lover of the lore of WH40k, I feel like a lot of the themes are true to the stories that have been released and the content that has been developed by GW. Currently, the game is in Alpha development, which means that it is a stylized testing ground for the balance between the equipment, abilities, and map tactics.

Absolutely! And alot of them actually! I am not going to say "HEY ITS ALPHA HUR DUR" (although it is :P) but I am going to say that this is a product in development that we get to 'test" and experience as it grows to become something we all want! A good 40k MMO.\n\nThe Dev team has been open to the founders community and very transparent with their developement process with newsletters, a weekly twitch show and an active appearance on the forums.\nPatches have been released every one or two weeks depending the scale of content added (sometimes 3 weeks but we got massive patches and engine updates with them).\n\nThe part of the game we can play right now (16 vs 16 Domination style maps) is a good experience when you play alone but a Great Tactical one when with a group of people. This is a tactical third person shooter mmorpg after all, so the "heart" of the game is in already. A bit on the downside it has a steep learning curve, meaning you WILL die alot in the beggining (I still remember when I joined with the second wave of founders spending the first 2 hours trying to figure out what the hell is going on, learning the map, testing the weapons to find out what suits me and ofc dying alot!!! Like, a hell lot! Once you get donw the basics it gets better and better! (since NDA has been lifted with E/A on steam I have posted some endgame screens on steam as proof ...cough*♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t*cough*bragging*cough* :D)\n\nOn a technical standpoint the game uses the latest UE4 and updates regularly... as a result there are some ups and downs on the framerate and stability but that is to be expected. I myself play on a i5 2500k 3.3 and an R7 360 OC 2Gb and the game runs on 40+ fps on 1080p custom settings. I have writen a large guide on ways to improve fps on the games forums, If the good people of early access cant get into the founders forums I will create a copy in the general section so everyone can read it! http://forum.eternalcrusade.com/threads/temporary-fps-solution.50043/  (Let me know if you can get in the founders forum)\n\nI dont think I have anything else to add right now... I didnt want to do a pros and cons right now since I believe this is not a finished/polished game  yet, but still I had some great time in my 150 hours of playing the game and will continue to do so.\n\nP.S. Find yourself a group of people (alot of clans/guilds recruiting. There is a recruitment section on the forums). Playing with other in a more tactical and organised manner makes the gaming experience 40000 times better ;)","January 26","true","188.3"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","24","42","2","0"

Devs are pumping out updates faster than I can review them. Reworked melee system, Diet Eldar, more weapons.\n\nAs of 1/26/2016 in its current state I can't recommend Eternal Crusade despite my own wishes to promote it, although I'm sure this will be a fantastic game on release, this is a review for the current situations and issues with the game, without talking about roadmap or in development features.\n\nEternal Crusade is an 16 v 16 third person shooter/hack and slash based on the Warhammer 40k universe using Unreal 4 engine. The current and only game modes as of its early access and this review release are conquest with a rotation of 3 maps. Players can play similar two factions, the Space Marines and Chaos Marines, which each have several classes which in turn also have limited customizable loadouts based on a point system, as well as 2 unique classes per faction. Eternal Crusade atm of this review features two vehicles, a Rhino transport APC that a squad can spawn out of and carries a resupply crate, and a Predator tank. Eternal Crusade also has an incomplete/flawed above average melee combat system, with a health bar and a regenerating armor (health buffer) bar.\n\nI'm sad to say but the current alpha state of the game is plagued by bugs, performance issues, gameplay/balance issues, and hit detection issues. The rule of thumb being you charge for it, you're ready for an honest review of all the problems, note that I'll try to be unbiased despite my love for the future of EC.\n\nFull review:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/375230/discussions/0/451851477890417514/\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/375230/discussions/0/405691491110169053/","January 26","false","64.1"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","28","50","0","0"

A good chunk of complaints (not all) are entirely based upon people not nowing how to properly play.\n\nA good chunk of people have no map awareness at all. on one map you attack a massive fortress. my character snuck ALL the way around got to the very top of the fortress and proceeded to snipe all of my enemies FROM THEIR OWN BASE. "But how does this relate to all those other complaints?" well so many people complain about melee being OP, however, melee is not nearly as op when against someone who actual watches their surroundings. too often you can take a somewhat circuitous route and then pop up right next to four enemy units. you kill them one by one and their allies don't even know the person next to them is dying.  Even beyond that a good chunk of people respond to a melee attacker by pulling out their combat knife and trying to fight. What you should do is this :SEE your enemy, STOP what you're doing, and  SHOOT the living daylights out of them. i've been in some very melee heavy games and you can tell who the experienced players are because a good chunk of them switch to flamethrowers and proceed to mow melee characters down by the dozens. LITERALLY DOZENS. While melee is very strong right now and should be tweaked i am tired of finding someone clearly looking down their scope without a care in the world, killing them with a chainsword, just to hear them go on all chat "HURR DURR I keep dying to melee nerf it plox"\n\nNow then i recommend it because i have mind numbing fun most times when i open the game. I have yet to have an issue of one side always winning because the consensus online is LSM are the best and yet i win upwards of 75% of the time on CSM.\n\nNow then everything should be taken with a big ol grain of salt because this game is currently in EXTREME developement. It is extremely bare bones with not too much customization available. However, their goals(which seem very achievable) already show how they will be taking the current low customization game into a MUCH higher customization game. as of right now they even have a massive equipment screen just most equipments are null due to not being fully implemented.\n\nThe really only bad thing i have with this game is it's computer requirements. I assume its because this game will be coming out in the future that they are gearing it towards the median PC when it comes out fully. as of right now you do need a powerful computer to run it on the highest settings with all visual effects. I saved up my money for a long time to get the computer I have now but i still remember when i only had my low end computer. DO NOT GET THIS GAME if your computer does not fit the recommended settings. otherwise you will most likely be put in a situation where you get constant lag to the point of the game being unplayable.\n\nAll in all i love this game and am really looking forward to its future developement.","May 24","true","33.8"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Combat is good, plenty of weight, balanced pretty well when you have a dry spell of content and they take focus on a balanced play patch, ranged is some of the best I've had the pleasure of playing, melee is improving and when it works it really does come together.\n\nThe community is genuinely one of the better ones I've had the pleasure with playing with and the devs are pretty responsive and have built up a good rapport with the playerbase. The weekly Friday Twitch shows they host are a good insight into what's coming next and it gives you a good chance to get your question answered in a much more open manner (people tend to be more complete when vocally discussing something I've found).\n\nThere's not a lot to talk about but this is where EC starts to build up traction and start moving faster in terms of development now they have most of the core systems in place. Eldar, Orks, Nids and more are still to come and can only add to the experience.\n\nIn short would I say buy it now? Yes and no. You already know why not and I'll be honest in saying to most players, just wait for beta/release. That's the experience you want. Alpha testing is just that, testing. They've set up a play environment but honestly, it's not what you're looking for right now if play is your interest. However if this hasn't deterred you and you understand the risks, go for it, have fun and enjoy the gameplay, just mind the bugs and I don't mean the tryanids.\n\n(AMD owners take note, this is an engine issue and they can't fix it, ♥♥♥♥♥ at Epic and not at bE.)","January 26","true","177.3"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","28","51","0","2"

There are issues, both with performance and balance. There is also a learning curve, which you need to take in to account when you review the game or play for the first time, so that you can help distinguish between a real issue, a pet-peeve that you feel needs addressing, or just a lack of experience. The game has come along in huge leaps and bounds since the beginning of last year even, with both huge improvements and some setbacks. So again, the game is still in Alpha, but it can and will only get better, so put your faith in it like all us other Founders.\n\nAs to the game itself, it's alot of fun. Even in 16v16 lobby setup the matches are intense and can often come down to the last few minutes capturing or defending points. Teamwork is essential, and although sometimes you'll be able to get some good victories with your teammates just going for the same objectives and sticking to the basics, you'll find the game a whole lot more fun and easier when you work well with a team, using the in-game comms rose, messaging or chating. Always be ready to adapt to any situation, be it swapping class to take a point or take out vehicle, mow down masses of enemies or leap into the middle of them and slaughter your way free. And remember that all classes can stop a point capture and to watch your friendly fire!\n","January 26","true","254.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I joined the Eternal Crusade as a founder in the later portion of the Closed Alpha (Warrior pack). I have played through a lot of different patches and have seen a lot of different features that were added and are still being tweaked. It still has a long way to go, but I am confident in BI that they will get it done.\n\nBeing a big fan of Warhammer 40K I can say that this does feel like a 40k game. Currently there are Space Marines and Chaos marine factions, with Elder on its way and Orks later this year. There are several sub factions for each faction with more to come.\nWeapons include the Bolter, Plasma Gun, Plasma Cannon, Heavy Bolter, Las Cannon, Storm Bolter, Chainswords, Power Axe, Force Sword, and Power Fist to name a few. They also currently have Predator tanks and Rhino transports.\n\nI usually play ranged and feel that the ranged combat is really good. Close combat is tough and really fast but they are still tweaking it. Balancing is still happening and they still have a few features they need to add.\n\nI have a pretty good Rig and so Eternal Crusade plays really fast and clear (I haven't checked FPS).

The 3rd person perspetive is not helping at all. I can't see what is going on on the left side of my character, so people can not only sneak at me from behind but from the left side too. Never had that problem of a blindspot in a mp game before. field of view is too narrow for a 3rd person perspective. You get 4 character slots, 2 factions, a handfull of weapon customization.

Been an early access player for a long time now and finally decided to put my two cents in. My reason for this rating has to do with not delivering the game we originally paid to fund. All of the open world, persistant nature of the game has been cancelled. We are seeing the exact same thing that happened to Mechwarrior Online. They promiseda big universe, lots of features, got lots of money, and then gutted the game and made it onto one more lobby based clone shooter.\n\nIt\'s pretty and plays pretty solid. If you are looking for the same gameplay you could get in 100 other lobby shooters except with a WH40K skin set then sure, go for it.

I absolutely love Warhammer 40,000 and pretty much everything to do with it, and I'm incredibly glad to see other companies pick up the WH40k ip after the death of THQ and Dark Millenium (the last 40k mmo to be made).\n\nThat being said, with a little under 2 years of development under their belts, this game does indeed show a lot of promise. At the time of launch, we should have 4 playable factions (Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Eldar and Orks) with weapon loadouts, a leveling system, armor/character customization, and [maybe - a huge maybe] open world combat between all the factions simultaneously spread across multiple continents. It is/will be moderately reminiscent of Planetside 2 and other games of that type, and it is intentional. It should only be viewed as a good thing, much like how other mmo's used the ui style and gameplay based off of World of Warcraft's success. Handled properly, Eternal Crusade can go a very long way, and down the road add in some terrific content.\n\nThat sounds great, right?\n\nCurrently, as of the release of Steam's Early Access module, we have 2 playable factions, 3 rotating maps, customizable weapon loadouts and 2 playable vehicles. Unless you're a die-hard WH40k fan, there's really not too much content to interest the typical gamer. In addition, this game is not optimized. At all. Infact the Devs repeatedly tell us that they have no intention of optimizing a thing until Beta (closed or open, not clear yet). On the Dev livestreams, they have told us that even on their rigs they maintain somewhere between 20-40 fps. So unless you have a powerful gaming PC, don't expect to be able to play this game anywhere near smoothly.\n\nFor reference, my system runs on:\n\nIntel i7 4770k @ 3.5 GhZ (not overclocked)\n16GB RAM @ 1333 MhZ\nNvidia GTX 980 FTW\n\nThe game is installed on my SSD, and at most I get 30-35 fps. Now, you may look at my time played and say "But Reithas, you haven't played as much as others, and they recommend it very highly!" And that is true. But keep in mind that there are many people who will sacrifice accurate descriptions of the game in favor of seeing it succeed. I play Eternal Crusade for an hour or two per week, and currently I find that I cannot suffer through more than that at once. And before anyone says it, yes. I know it's still in Alpha.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- Warhammer 40k mmo (the first of its kind if it succeeds)\n- Steady updates with new content\n- Great looking, runs on Unreal 4 engine\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Terribly unoptimized, even on the best gaming PCs\n- Not a lot of content currently (you'll burn through what's available in an hour or two)\n- No group function (you cannot group up with friends)\n- No key customization (you cannot rebind your keys. Who thought aiming with the alt key/middle-mouse button was a good idea?!)\n\n\nI will edit this review as things change.","January 27","false","41.2"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","0"

I love the graphics, the gameplay is looking sweet ( Tons of fun, obviously some bugs)\nBUT:\nMelee troops are way too OP, they literaly land on you, i feel "stunned" and get two shot. Moreover i bougth this game with -my friends- the fact that i have to wait for a server to empty out in order to attempt to join with my friend is obscene. No party system? duo-que? thats just obscene for a multiplayer based game. Moroever when i try JOIN a friends game a "fatal error" appears. Also, some maps have a clear bias to one team, i remmeber an attack defend where the spawn ofthe space marines was completely covered by an array of guard towers , machine gun nests and the lost. Needless to see I felt spawn camped but that may be because I suck at this game.\n\nOverall, gameplay is fine, good for an alpha but the UI and multiplayer system really needs to be fleshed out... This really shouldnt have been released in this state (unless you want to play alone then i suppose it is fine).

It is not complete and will not be for some time.\n\n\n\n\nFirst off let me say that I like this game so far and it will only get better by my opinion. The team making the game is dedicated and we see updates "Weekly" or sooner. Every week brings bug fixes, balances, and usually a new weapon or class.\n\nThis game does not hold your hand and you have to get good at it to really enjoy it. (As it should be)\n\nCurrently since the game is in alpha you can expect bugs, glitches, lag, imbalanced weapons, FPS drops, and poor graphics quality (the usual). Even with these current issues I find the game to be very fun and worth my time.\nThe devs have been awesome and they host a twitch/youtube stream weekly that shows the changes they've made and what's planned for the week after.\n\n\nWhat is not in the game that will be?:\n\n1. Ork's (Playable race) Including race specific weapons and mounts/vehicles\n\n2.Eldar (Playable race)  Including race specific weapons and mounts/vehicles\n\n3. Tyranid's (Non playable race) A.i that will attack during normal matches forcing enemies to fight the common enemy/Enemies during co-op missions.\n\n4. Other unknown playable/A.I  Races.\n\n5. Chapters of the Space/Chaos Marines and other races (Space wolves and other's)\n\n6. Open world (This feature will come very late in development possibly at or after launch)\n\n7. In game voice chat and friend/clan/guild capability.\n\n8. PVE (large scale battles with A.I Orks tyranids and other's.\n\n9.

So don't expect something complete or polished here.\n\nBut from what I've seen, I like it. It has potential. It feels like the developers looked at the good elements from Relic's Space Marine and expanded upon them and put them into larger-scale warfare. Compared to Space Marine's small, laggy arena matches (which I loved, granted), we now get LARGE, laggy warzone matches. Lascannons and krak grenades serve a real purpose, as there are turrets, vehicles, and other hard targets in addition to the Tacticals, Assaults, and Devastators running around. On top of that, they've added more classes to the 3 from Space Marine, such as the Apothecary. Healing seems to be a new concept, with wounded battle-brothers crawling around on the ground in search of a revive.\n\nIn short, it's Space Marine 2: Planetside. If the developers keep up the good work and polish what's in place (it's in dire need of both performance optimization and network optimization), they're going to have a real winner on their hands. Just don't jump into it now if you don't want to play around with a janky alpha build.","January 26","true","22.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Considering this is still early alpha, I already had lots of fun with it. The combat feel visceral and powerful, ranged vs melee is being constantly balanced in order to make them viable.\n\nThe game still has performance issues, bugs of course and at the moment only Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines, with Eldar coming soon and Orks further down the road. Basic loadout system has just been implemented and there is no progression. Also, it aims at being an open world Planetside 2 like game however for now we have 3 maps to play with. What is amazing is how the game already feels very WH40k, capturing its spirit.\n\nIt's quite amazing to see it grow and every patch brings in new content however this is still very early stage.

The amount of communication between the developers and the players (Founders) is unlike anything I've seen in the past with other games. Yes, EC has gone into the dreadful words we've all heard before:  "Early Access" . Don't let this lead you astray, as this game  will  be coming out in 2016.\n\nSome Pros and Cons for you\nPros  Graphics are well done for being in Alpha\nContinuous patches for optimization as well as character loadouts\nMaps very much fit the WH40k setting\nHeresy...Heresy Everywhere, Khorne for the Khorne Flakes (and all that jazz)\nFinishing moves feel oh so right\nCommunication between playerbase and developers\nFantastic community\nCons Melee combat is still a bit finicky\nThe min/rec. speccs do not matter much, so be aware that you might not run the game well  yet\nOnly 2 factions right now (Space/Chaos Marines) but Eldar and Orks are on the way\nFrame drops\nRandom crashes\nBugs/glitches\nWith that being said, I, as well as many others, still have a blast while playing this game. Personaly, I don't have high hopes for many games these days, but this one is a definite must for any WH40k fan. If you're put off by the cons listed above, then go ahead and wait a bit longer to buy. However, ease your mind knowing that the developers are top notch and have literally poured their blood, sweat, and (many) tears into EC; they will forever progress the game.\n\nThe devs also provide weekly twitch streams (usually on Friday) to provide us with insight on what the game is looking like. Link provided:  http://www.twitch.tv/40kcrusade\nIf you would like to see what the core plan of this game is, click this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cjhg7fCQWQ  In a nutshell, the game is arena based (16v16) right now for testing purposes. Over time, the player count will increase more and more (as well as the size of the maps) until it's a fully massive open-world; think Planetside 2 but with four factions as well as the Tyranids for PVE.\n\nIf you've read this far and have made up your mind on buying the game, use my referal code: EC-TXJ1ONSWWA6W0\nYou and I will gain 4k Rogue Trader Points which can be used to spend on cosmetic items in the Rogue Trader Store. FYI, there's  no  pay-to-win here, just more customization to make your character look even more badass!","February 5","true","20.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Graphics are choppy and unoptimized (to be expected in it's current state). Gameplay is fast, furious, and gritty in the spirit of StarSiege: Tribes, Unreal Tournament and Gears of War. But like it's spiritual predecessor: Warhammer 40K Space Marine, the movement feels like you're playing a paper cut-out model than a 1 ton space marine in armor. I know that sounds funny but, if you remember playing any of the original Gears of War games, not only was it gritty but, movement and physics made you actually feel like your character had some physical weight to it. I don't know how they would go about fixing something like that but it definitely needs some polish and optimization. But overall, I am most certain this game has potential to blossom into something gorgeous and real; something worthy of the Warhammer 40k IP.","January 30","true","2.9"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

Actually if you're a 40k fan, you WILL end up getting this. It's that fun ALREADY! :D Okay maybe not, but I love it.\nIt only has 3 maps, but theres 120+ planned, which is why I feel that if you dont want it now, youll en up wanting it later. Get it when its cheap.\nIt has Eldar, Chaos, Space Marines and Orks, but only Space Marines and Chaos Marines are available at the time of this review.\n\nNot a  40k fan? You should wait. Although Eternal Crusade is immensly fun for myself and many others, dont let an alpha be your first 40k game. Try Space Marine, or Dawn of War II first.\n\n\nTo be more specific on details: It's matched based PVP, but very tactical. Each class doesnt seem all too different from the next, but after a minutes you'll realize each is very distinct. So far the community is stellar, and a lot of people respond to squad tactics from the selection of commands we're given.\n\nLike I said, 3 map, but 120+ planned.

My current review of this game is as follows. I your getting this game as a shooter, DON'T .Right now there is no way I would call this game a shooter. I would call this a melee game with some shooting elements thrown in. The guns are 89% useless in a fight, it's all the melee classes that rule this game. The melee classes can kill anyone from 1 to 3 hits no matter what you do , and keep in mind that these are not slow attacks either if you see a melee chances are you will be dead in a max 3 seconds. Most of the time it will only be 1 second. Why don't you shoot them at range you ask? you can try to do that but thats where the guns really show how useless they are. The guns just don't have the power to take out a melee class from medium to close range. Right now you can empty almost half a clip into them and they will be on top of you before you can kill them. One of the biggest problems is that when they swing their weapon they leap forward, not little distance but a stupidly large distance, pluse they have a sprint. Most will just sprint up to you and kill you and the 3 other guys that are with you before deading if your lucky enought to hit him. From what i have seen most people playing the assult class don't even use the jump pack they just sprint everywhere, you don't get much jump time with it, you don't get enough time in the air to line up a attack so your better off just running on the ground. You will not get too many kills trying to shoot people, ALL the top scores are done by playing the melee classes. whats stupid right now is all the capture points are indoors in small areas that just make the melee class even most powerfull. Till they do something to balance the melee and the guns in the game I would not recommend this game, it simply isn't fun if your getting it as a shooter becuase it falls way to short at being one. If you like melee combat then maybe this game might be your cup of tea. I didn't like the melee on melee combat myself I thought is was like taking two action figures and bashing them against each other till one of them broke. My final thoughts on thisn game is that if they are calling it a shooter then that should be number one in the core gameplay, to market it as a shooter right now feels more like a big fat lie and a ripoff I would not recommend this game, and I am not going to bother to try this game again till they fix the shooting aspect of the game","May 18","false","32.6"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","21","40","0","0"

My forum account is dated October 13 2013, the first day you could register for the forums/website. So it's safe to say I have been invested and following this game.\n\nLong term goals of the game have already been discussed to death and back. We all know they plan to have 4 factions (Space Marines, CSM, Eldar and Orks) along with the possiblity of more after 'launch'. We all know they plan to add vehicles for the factions and hero units. We all know they plan to use the open world system of Planetside. We all know there will be PvE Co-op content with Tyranids. Etc.\n\nThe thing is these are long term goals. I mean LONG term. There is no telling when any of these things will even be on the horizon. We have yet to see anything about Orks, matter of fact I've heard from people that the whole Free 2 Waaagh thing has been scrapped. The main devs that hyped such things have since left or moved from the team. We saw a small glimmer of our fabulous rhinestone encrusted God-♥♥♥♥ed-Into-Existance Elfs on a dev stream. The only discussion about the Planetside system was a video from a year ago being discussed by devs that are no longer on the team. No one knows when or if the open world system will be implimented. We saw a small video of the Tyranid PvE Co-op content. Basically people running from Tyranids.\n\nThe game at its current state is basically a Space Marine clone with a server, more people, classes, vehicles and less customization and less optimzation. It's a X versus X lobby TPS team shooter capture the objectives etc. A basic barebones form of the game. If I had to give it a name, I'd call it a Poor Man's Space Marine at this current state. Of couse this is the point, they want to test and make stuff now so they can slowly impliment it into the actual product they promised. If the product they promised is still on the table. (COUGH COUGH SURVARIUM)\n\nUnless you're a big giant Warhammer 40k nerd/fan...I would suggest holding off and waiting. OR just buy it now and sit on it. That's my plan. I bought a Founder pack on like the last day of the sales because I caved in to my crippling Warhammer autism.\n\nI have hopes for the game. I have a desire to see it succeed. I'm sure you'll get entertainment out it but just remember the promised product is a year or two away.","January 26","false","15.1"," 28 of 54 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","28","54","0","0"

Although not as bad as when I first played, but I still can't keep my aim on the target, enemies teleporting in front of me and dying before I even released what happened.\n\nIf you plan on getting this, be prepared to get screwed over if your faction starts on the lower side of a certain map, you'd be put in a complete disadvantage from the get go. The maps are good, but this one inparticular map has one faction completely over towering the opposing faction on the lower side with only 3 paths to advance on, all 3 of which is exposed in the open to gunfire and suppression: main road for the tank(s) and 2 lifts on either side. The other problem with this map is gaining access to the capture points, again the top faction will have an easier time getting to them.\n\nAssault marines, assault marines as far as the eye can see. Pretty much from what I've played, Assault marines > every other class. Melee weapons hits really hard making you flinch plus the stun from the landing impact = guaranteed kill. A simple fix would be to make the Jump Pack more vulnerable to gunfire, thus increasing your chances to shoot them out the air.\n\nGraphics option needs to have proper settings rather than a slide meter or at the very least a custom option so you can at least tinker around with it.\n\nDespite what has been said, I'm still interested to see the end product of this game, I do think that'd be an enjoyable game, especially given that the WH40K Space Marine online multiplayer is dead, this would be ideal replacement.\nHopefully, we'll see some unit customisation too.","January 28","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm really excited for them to get the Orkz and Tau into the servers so we can see something new.\n\nRight now it plays more like BF with 32 players in large maps trying to capture points. The huge difference is it definitely feels like space marines fighting heretics from the movement to the executions to the voice acting. Much of this seems to have been borrowed from Space Marine, but I have no issue with that. The cool addition has to be the predator tanks and rhinos. You can already see the foundations of something cool here.\n\nThe maps could be more balanced, but I think theyre just there to playtest anyway. You really should be buying this to test the classes (a few more than Space Marine) and the mechanics as well as to get on the train early for what seems to be a really great project.","February 3","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its maps so far are very well and strategic and its combat of many opposing squads requires good coordination among squad members and squads themselves. The game now doesnt lag at all to me and i have an old cpu - amd phenom IIx4 - so there is nothing to hold people back from getting it now as there wont be lag. I can enjoy this game so much already and i dont usualy play shooters, i play rts cause i like rts and thats why i am good at rts and bad at shooter cause i dont like shooters much BUT in this game made me play good !!!!!!!!!!!!!! As its alpha no premade full teams are in availiable the official way yet but you can join a game a friend is in so you can play more than a squad with friends as when the game starts it takes time to fill at early so premade teams are possible this way. So if some friends want a good team game this is a game to play. Also dungeons of pve will be included for this game as its gonna be an mmo rpg shooter but these will come later closer to release i assume not any time soon which is great, a group of tanks, transports and troops going to attack the tyranid hives !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!

In it's current state it is a 20+ vs. 20+ battle arena with vehicles. There are currently 5 classes per race, with their own weapons/fighting styles, you can switch in game on death. Each race gets one heal/support class and one class that can capture objectives. Only 1 class per race can capture or interrupt captures.\n\nThe Rogue Trader Store is down, but you recieve currency with the purchase.  Here is a cache history of the previous items[web.archive.org] from when there was an NDA. If these are any indication of the future then you will be able to buy vehicles, weapon skins and Hero class characters.\n\nThe leveling system is there, not sure what it's for at this state besides a Steam achievment.

I run at 24 fps, which while low, this game is not optimized yet, it's an Alpha, that's a Beta thing to do.\n\nIf this was even remotely helpful in your purchase decision  please consider using my recruiter code : EC-IZ2JNA6DJAOUI[www.eternalcrusade.com]","February 17","true","14.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Well they did. And it's called Dawn of War. But if you want that whole grimdark wild, over-the-top combat vibe, Eternal Crusdade will definitely hit the spot. Basically I would call this 3rd Person light Shmup with it's fast paced matches and brutal 40k-ish combat. Not satisfied that the Chaos Space Marine will get to bleed out after you filled him with the Emperor's Holy Bolter Fire? Introduce that gentleman to a chainsword with a bleed-out execution. It's a nice touch that sort of captures that madcap violence that we've come to know and love from the Warhammer 40K universe. However this is not without a couple reservations; this game is most definitely in early access. It's a little rough around the edges and in some cases players can't play it due to optimization issues. I never had this problem but I did notice a few framerate hiccups that went below 30 FPS. I'm no expert but I would say on my rig (which I would call "mid-range" with a 750ti gfx card) I was getting 20-30 FPS on average. This game has a little while to go before it's fully optimized. Also quite a few features are missing and the matches are awful small but from what I understand that is being worked on. The missing stuff isn't bothering me too much but I am rather excited to play as Saim-Hann Eldar when they're finally released.\n\nTL;DR If you're a 40K fan, don't even hesitate to buy it. If you don't have a decent computer to keep pace with the action, well you might be hating life for a while until they can optimize it. If you want this fully fleshed out, wait til they're done with the early access alpha and then buy it.","January 27","true","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Bear in mind that I'm recommending it based on the state the game is currently in, it's alpha access which means that everything isn't there yet. Due to their partnership with Bandai Namco I'm pretty sure this game will actually deliver into retail apart from many early access titles out there. So that should be taken into consideration when purchasing this game.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid and incredibly addictive and fun. I expect to sink a large amount of hours into this once progress becomes persistent but I'm holding on a bit for now since I already tried the mechanics that are actually out there. In it's core it is fairly similar to Space Marine, which is a very solid game as well. For me personally, the Space Marine multiplayer is better, mainly due to the reason that you're not as squishy, which you are in Eternal Crusade. This is something that I believe has to be remedied in the final version. Space Marines should not be this squishy, I feel like a soldier in battlefield. This is really my only problem right now in the game. If this gets solved and gameplay thus becomes slightly slower this will be an amazing game. I can't really delve into any of the promised features since I haven't tried them yet but I'd advice any potential buyer to go check out the website and see what the devs are up to. This is one of the most interesting Warhammer projects out there right now!\n\nI can't wait to start sinking tons of hours into this once progress becomes persistent.","February 3","true","9.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Similar to space marine online but with a battlefield squad system and battlefront esque classes,  the base game is very fun and well built and the devs are in close communication with the players on the website's forums. Developers don't often listen like these guys do and it's a real treat. They want to truly be apart of the world they're building and you can sort of pick up they like the game a lot and really want to see it succeed.\n\nVery actively updated and optimization keeps coming every week.  My FPS has gone up every update which is nice, and content is weekly rather than monthly.

This should be the next best thing.\ncurrently in alpha and mainly testing gameplay and fighting mechanics this game has become realy enjoyable to play!!! while a lot of stuff is still missing the core components are there to make not only a great but an amazing game! meele combat is a strong focuse and the latest changes have made it pretty darn fun to use. classes could be a bit more specific but the overall game and especialy the progression on it is heartwarming to see in a world where ea and co. throw out stuff with less content than this.\n\nthings i like:\n-combat\n- Nathan\n-setting(40k is awesome)\n- Nathan\n-executions (executed a dev once <3)\n- Nathan\n-maps (not a lot of them but smartly designed)\n- Nathan\n- the goals\n- Nathan\n- the team\n- Nathan\n\nthings i don't like\n- no gore\n- not enough blood\n- needs more classes\n- needs more maps\n- needs more players\n- needs more factions\n- needs more subfactions\n- runs pretty unstable atm\n- not managed to kill Nathan yet\n\nedit: Eldar are in full development and seemd to be really interesting to play. The new really big maps add a lot to the fun and combat has been patched a lot. Even though I'm playing from europe i can now say that the game is okay to play (ping is still an issue but bareable).

So that said there will be major to minor bugs in the game however this game is extremely fun if you are into PvP. I do not know when the PvE part will come out but so far it's fun killing heretics! Even though you have to pay money to play the Alpha that money is going to the company so they can continue the works of this game on top of that you are helping the game progress even more just by playing till it breaks. They are constantly updating the game, having ALPHA TESTERS test out new features.\n\nIf you are a Warhammer 40k fan then I recommend this game even though it is in Alpha. To me the game feels like a bigger PvP version of Space Marines the game. There will be PvE soon not sure when but there will be PvE which i can not wait!

If you like TF2 (Team Fortress 2), then you'll like this game. The only issue that I think should be fixed is the balancing, diversity, and there should be armour: the Space Marines winning is uncommon and the classes stay the same when you rank up; the classes should get new weapons, maybe more health, and new armour. Also the races should have more variety. The game is very good for an early access game, though. The game is really fun and I would suggest anyone looking for a new game to play to buy this game.\n\nAlso just one race I think should definitely be added is the Tyranids. I'm imagining that there would be the Tyranid gaurd which would basically be like the Tyranid version of a Havoc Marine; there would be a  basic Tyranid that would be weak at ranged attacks but really good at melee; ranged Tyranid that would be good for ranged attacks, but not melee; and a medic type Tyranid that would basically be the Tyranid version of the Apothecary.

Even if you have the most powerful PC in the world you are not guaranteed good perfomance.\n\nFirst, I want to say what Eternal Crusade is going to be when it's out.\n\nEternal Crusade will be an MMO shooter game set in Warhammer 40k universe. Closest comparison you can draw is Planetside 2, but EC is going to be different, mainly because of asymmetrical balance(each faction plays differently) and equal emphasis being put on melee and ranged combat.\n\nHowever, this is what the game is going to be when it's actually finished. Right now, the game is in Alpha stage(and not the kind of marketing Alpha where you are sold a finished game). No, Eternal Crusade is in actual Alpha. What does it mean for you?\n* While the end goal is to have large-scale battles, right now devs are balancing the combat system to make sure that core of the game works(in other words, the game isn't an MMO at the current stage)\n* The game contains a lot of bugs and combat balance isn't the best(though it's better than it was when Alpha started).\n* The game isn't optimized, so don't expect good perfomance even if you have powerful rig.\n* Devs actually listen to what their community thinks, so you can actually influence the game's development.\n\nYet again, and I can't stress that enough - the game isn't finished and it will most likely have poor perfomance. In other words, if you aren't ready to play this game with 20 FPS, DO NOT BUY IT, because you will just get disappointed. Instead, follow the development of the game and hop in once the game is optimized enough.\n\nYes, I said about poor optimization three times already, but this is something that you absolutely need to know before you purchase this game.\n\nWhy is my review still positive? That is because while I will advice against buying it in the current state(unless you are fine with bugs and perfomance issues) this game still has a lot of potential. So I will definately advice you to keep an eye on it as it develops.","January 26","true","237.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Once more patches and features roll in I'll make sure to update it so it remains a good representation of Eternal Crusade's state.\n\nReview:\n\nOnce finished, Eternal Crusade is going to be a large scale action MMO where four unique factions (Space Marines, Chaos, Eldar and Orks) vie for supremacy over a war-ravaged world.\n\nHowever, as of right now Eternal Crusade is an objective based third person shooter very similar to the Battlefield franchise. It features only two out of the four factions (Space Marines and Chaos), a handful of maps and a bunch of interesting systems that are either unfinished or hampered by poor performance. But most noteworthy is the fact that its actually a lot of fun to play.\n\nI was first drawn to the Warhammer 40k universe, many years back, on account of the extremely vivid and awesome battles other people kept telling me about. To my surprise, Eternal Crusade ended up being more than able to replicate those desparate and doomed battles against overwhelming enemies, acts of heroism and sheer stupidity that somehow end up saving the day and most importantly, all of those sounds that you would expect to hear from Bolter & Plasma fire.\n\nWhile the battles are most certainly awesome the performance is unfortunately not. It can get so bad during large fights that you end up operating at sub 10 FPS which as far as shooters go is unacceptably low. I would be a lot more negative about the whole performance problem if I didn't have an entire day after a hotfix patch where everything worked as the Emperor demands. Issues sprung back up tomorrow but at least now I know they can be solved in the near future.\n\nDespite the performance still requires a fair bit of work the actual gameplay of Eternal Crusade is rather well done for an early alpha. There are a variety of weapons to chose from across the five available classes, many of which are similar but unique enough to appeal to different players. Even though I've tried and enjoyed the ranged classes, the real highlight of Eternal Crusade to me is the melee system which is a bit ironic because I consider it to be quite bad right now.\n\nIt operates on a rock, paper, scissors system and while it sounds balanced on paper (heh) in actuallity most of your engagements will be decided in large part by the roll of the die. If you initially choose rock (heavy attack) and your opponent choses paper (light attack) you're just going to end up dead without much to offer in resistance.\n\nIt really is a shame since the melee combat in Eternal Crusade makes you feel like an actual badass Space Marine that can charge enemy lines (ideally from the back) and cleave through enemies in an orgy of death and destruction. However, these complaints might be short lived as the next big patch is set to bring a complete rework of the melee system.\n\nSince not every situation is favorable towards melee playstyles I did also spend a good chunk of time playing around with the ranged classes, especially the default and "boring" Tactical Marine. The kill times are generally low enough that through skillful play, good aim and ideally ambush tactics you can bring down multiple unaware opponents before going down yourself. Now I'm not sure whether this was on account of the server lag, my performance issues or me simply being bad but I found the spray control to be rather challenging, especially with the rapid-firing Devastator class.\n\nGiven that we are, after all, talking about Space Marines here - simply shooting your enemies isn't usually enough to bring them down for good. Once a player is killed with "small" caliber weapons he will drop down in to an injured state from which he can then be revived albeit with limited health.\n\nThe solutions are about as simple as you might expect. You can either kill the medic and ensure the steady stream of healing stops, just finish off your downed opponent or better yet, use a weapon so powerful the enemy will need a spoon if they want to find the body. Just for the love of Khorne don't execute people by using your E key as the animation, while incredibly cool, takes 5+ seconds and is about 5 times as slow as simply stabbing them once or twice in the fleshy bits.\n\nBut if being a foot-soldier isn't your thing you could always hop in to a vehicle and give those a try... and then promptly hop back out because they're boring. Its not that they're not powerful, because they can be devastating, its just that the entire playstyle is so one dimensional and ordinary in a game where jet packing Marines rain from the sky.\n\nThe Predator tank for example is a very problematic vehicle because for some reason it can shoot 10 shots in quick succession which is poor against other vehicles but oh so good when it comes to spawn camping. When your team isn't absolutely disorganized spawn camping is easy to deal with but if you're stuck with a bunch of newbies, and odds are you will be because Eternal Crusade just launched in Early Access, its going to be the most frustrating experience this side of the Warp.\n\n** Verdict **\n\nEternal Crusade is nowhere near its lofty MMO goals but the objective based shooter on offer right now is pretty good and even though I've spent the majority of my playtime under 30FPS I can't say with a straight face I didn't have fun. It is very much so unfinished and unpolished so if that's something that bothers you then I recommend you simply wait a few months, it won't disappear anywhere.\n\nThe good news is that the developers have a very rapid update schedule (I've seen 2 patches during my week of playtime) and that the upcoming update is going to bring with it the Eldar faction, a new and improved melee system, performance fixes, new weapons and a bunch of other features.\n\nAs it stands right now Eternal Crusade is really fun but also really unfinished so if you do plan on buying make sure you're prepared to deal with any problems that might occur as it goes through development.\n\nIf you would like a more in-depth look at Eternal Crusade, coupled with some gameplay footage then I welcome you to take a look at the video I've done on the topic:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp3_or8KyT0","February 7","true","10.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

There are a few helpful posts that point out some ways to get better performance out of the game.\n\nThat being said, so far the game to me is very enjoyable for what it is. This is by far one of the best experiences I have had with a game still in development. The devs are VERY transparent about what is going on in the development of the game. We are constanlty updated via the forums, and weekly twitch streams. They also are very good about listening to the input of the players.\n\nIf you are looking at buying the game I recommend looking up youtube videos and twitch streams. Also come into it knowing this game will still be changing alot throughout the development. There is still a lot to be added. You also may not have the best performance right now due to issues with the UE4 engine. Like I said though, there are posts in the forums to help out with this issue. All in all, if you can understand that this game is still in Alpha and has not had its optimization yet then I highly recommend it.

If you aren't one of them, you'll either be playing "Space Invaders" trying to fend them off, or quickly become one.\n\nThe Bolter/Heavy Bolter are a joke. You feel like you're throwing pebbles compaired to every other weapon. The Stalker Bolter at least does some heavy damage if you land headshots, or your target is too stubborn to move to cover.\n\nThe cover system - Nothing says, "I hate being a squad lead" like everyone knowing where you are because your rank Eagle shows above the railing you're trying to hide behind. Yes... "Cover is for the weak" but I like to believe the Great-Great-Great-Great-Great-Great-Grandson of the SAS Charcater from CSGO is in the Blood Angels shouting "Sneaky Deaky Like!' over comms.\n\nThe melee system - Currently if an assault marine lands in the middle of a group of friendlies, it turns into a TK fest as the chainsword usually wins every "rock-paper-scissors" duel in the current system. Why not turn a tie/block into a quicktime-button-mashing event to discourage melee spamming?\n\nSpawning - Currently, spawning into a map is BORING. "Hi, I'm a space/chaos marine, and I'm here to defeat/promote heresy" Take a hint from Mechwarrior online - Why not have space marines actually fly in on Thunderhawks, or crash into the ground in drop pods? Why not have Chaos marines appear out of voids?\n\nTaunts/Voice Acting - Devs.... This is your chance to add witty and original lines to make players laugh. Currently, it sounds like a bad "Heresy!" meme the entire game.\n\nUI - The menu system is clunky, but will obviously be improved.\n\nClasses - Why can't I run 5 custom tactical marines? Or a combination of different classes?\n================\n\nI'm really looking forward to the final product of this game. The 40K universe has so much room for customization, and epic gameplay. I even have a blast in an early stage alpha game...

I would Recommend this game.  Eternal Crusade heavily relies on skill, teamwork, communication, tactics, and much more. This also applys to PvE elements of this game form what the Devs have show in there live streams. I have spent many hours on this game since Frist Wave, and have loved it, if they keep on track this game will turn out to be amazing.\n\nOne big thing to remember is that the state of this game is an ALPHA state, so there going to be some rough areas on it, like for example optimization, however it is slowly geting better. Still if you have a PC setup with Nvidia GTX 970 or higher you will not struggle as much in the FPS (Frame Rates Per Sec) as sadly an AMD GPU (Video Card) user at this time will struggle more so in the FPS (Frame Rate Per Sec) area. Also they are running the Unreal Engine 4, its a very new Engine and is also being work on to fine tune it, so it has it quirks too. So keep this in mind when if you do pick up this game.\n\nAny help the devs can get when it comes down to Feedback on fiding things in the game and breaking it so to speak will help improve this game even more. They have a long road ahead of them and alot of work, I can say that I have seen the hard work that goes into what they have done so far. They are seeking a wider net of players to join in to help improve the game, keep this in mind as well.

So to serve as a warning, this game may turn out to be very good once it is completely finished.\n\nAT THIS CURRENT STATE; I cannot recommend this game, it is very unstable, possibly too unstable for the average shooter genre fan.\n\nSo a lot of the unique features and paid for weapons don't seem to be implemented, and the "hero classes" aren't implemented yet, as of right now it's just Space Marines vs Chaos Space Marines, and the factions at the current state are purely for looks (ie no Interrogator Chaplains, no Sanguinary Priests, I didn't hear word of them being added anyway).\n\nSo the biggest problems I see in this game is the chaos of combat. Visually speaking, battlefields look very impressive but you basically have very few options of knowing what is happening around you. Melee attacks can leave you in a stunlock for ages, preventing you from rolling, counter attacking, or shooting back. Basically once someone staggers you in melee, you die. You'll probably not have a chance to react or fight back much if you are outnumbered. That's also another problem since clever movement isn't exactly functioning as it should be, you have very few options to recuperate. Even short range weaponry doesn't out damage melee attacks, doesn't matter if it's a combat knife or a power sword. I survived numerous meltagun shots (SHOULD NOT HAPPEN) and managed to stab the havoc shooting me effortlessly, and numerous times where I unloaded headshots with my bolter (all of which hit) to the point of reloading, the target managed to charge-attack me and stunlock me, and still had around 20% health remaining. Lots of "how come I died when I shot him that many times?" moments from other MMOFPS games.\n\nPerks aren't in this game as of yet, and there's only very basic options in all areas EXCEPT melee (lots of weapons there), so basically the best fun you can have in this game is picking a melee of some sort and just landing melee strikes and rolling around rabidly until someone melee's you back and staggers you or a bunch of guys shoot the crap out of you. Do this before they nerf it.\n\nIn terms of visuals, this game is just purely amazing, but a majority of the time the maps are so dark or so bright that you can't really see your character's armor details, or color, or anything (unless you pick the Blood Angels or Imperial Fists, thanks to their flamboyant color scheme you'll be seeing them from a mile away). They did a good job with capturing the "heaviness" of your movement like they did in WH40k:SM, good voice acting, stunning depth. Chaos looks good but their armor is a LOT LESS detailed than the loyalist marine armor is, in my opinion. (im guessing because the Chaos Marine was modelled first, or because CSM have older armor variants). Some Chaos marine paintjobs don't fit their warband either, the Alpha Legion paintjob for example is just this dark angels green with rusted bordering, no metallic scaley blue-green, not a lot of depth in the armor either. The "Appearance" option is where you pimp out your Astartes for the most part, but I really hope they revamp the chaos color schemes and add more light-dark transitions to the heretic armor as they did with loyalists.\n\nThe audio of this game are great, I have no complaints there.\n\nThe game is also pretty damn laggy, and that makes the chaotic battlefield extremely difficult to see through, you'll see bodies quickly running left and right out of the blue, your character glitching around, shots not registering, crosshairs going insane, random damage indicators from the Assault marine overheading you followed by sounds of chainswords, only to realize "oh, I'm dying". This is a priority for the developers as there's a cap of how many players can be on simutamiously, but it's still present.\n\nIn my opinion, this game definately has a LOT of potential and will probably kill a lot of the other MMOFPS games out there (considering who's behind EC's project, and the IP) if the developers manage to fix the issues surrounding it.\n\nTHERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE AMAZING IN THE FUTURE ONCE THEY FIX THE SURROUNDING ISSUES, JUST DON'T BUY THIS GAME IN ITS DEVELOPMENT STATE THINKING IT'S FULLY PLAYABLE. THE BIGGEST THING THAT MAKES THIS ENJOYABLE FOR ME PERSONALLY IS THE 40K ASPECT.","May 23","false","8.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","2"

However I really hope they improve the running mechanics in the game. The running mechanics for its predecessor space marine were just great! The space marines in eternal crusade run a little weird... kinda like toy soldiers instead of  hulking masses of destruction. It's quite hard to accept that a spacemarine weighs close to a ton with the current running mechanics and animation. My next concern are the sounds. the sound of empty shells falling on the ground after firing a weapon are excellent. The weapon handling is also great but the sound of a heavy bolter for example is pretty hallow.. It sounds just like the HB(heavy bolter) from the movie ULTRAMARINES. and the same goes for a bolter, bolt pistol but the current sound seems to suite the storm bolter. just not the other three... Check the sounds from the space marine video game or dawn of war 2 ... particularly the heavy bolters and the bolters..

Understand that the game is still in Alpha and Early Access. Understand there are no in game tutorials and there is a very steep learning curve. If you understand that then by all means purchase access to Alpha test this game. Notice I didn't say "purchase the game" because you're not purchasing a finished product, you're purchasing the ability to test a game that's being developed.\n\nThe Devs are very much in touch with the community and community feedback is shaping how we play and fight.\n\nThere's a great mix of melee and ranged combat. Understand up front that in the 40K universe melee is just as prevalent as ranged combat. Melee will NOT just be a minor annoyance ranged players have to deal with occasionally. Melee combat is ever present(yes you can melee with your ranged classes) so learn melee mechanics early on or have a miserable gaming experience.\n\nBig picture type stuff isn't in yet. You get to test maps and test builds right now in a match based system.  The combat is more enjoyable than many of the finished shooters on the market, though many weapons and builds are imbalanced and yes there are FOTM builds because it's still Alpha.\n\nCurrently you will only experience a match based shooter.

Though  the game will be starting as a lobby shooter, eventually small 'zones' will open up, so you'll have 2 to 4 "maps" in one open world zone. Well, at least that's the plan.","April 7","true","505.3"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","1"

The game plays really well and there are frequent updates, this is early access so we are basically all testers for the game, so what that means is that there are currently 2 factions and it is generally capturing and defending so far wtihout any overaching objectives other than capturing and maintaining points.\n\nAlot of love and care has been put into the game, and while it is still enjoyable the game has just recently been put into early access so there is alot of work to be done, but as mentioned earlier the game is enjoyable.\n\nNow a personal note from me and if anyone would like to comment on this sure as I am not sure how wide spread the issue is and if it is wide spread then I will tell people to hold off for a bit. The problem I run into is that my display driver crashes which crashes the entire game and I have to exit out, giving me roughly 5 mins of game time or less, this happens sporadically and sometimes I can play an entire game, but more often than not it affects me. I would like to know from developers or the player base if this is a natural occurance that will be fixed, or if it is just me as this is the only game I have played where I have run into this issue. If this is wide spread, then once again I would recommend to hold off for a bit as this is definately game breaking. But giving the benefit of the doubt and it is just me then I whole heartedly recommend this game and enjoy it as it evolves over time.","February 12","true","20.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you are intrested in a real review, then go look out for them, because the comments here offer quite a few good ones.\n\nI'm just really liking Warhammer and I think, that this game has hella' much potential. When they made a few steps back from the open world/ mmo concept, I still was kinda conserened, that it could turn into rubbish, like a lot of early acces games did. But though they have a fixed date for release already and are updating things more then once per week, I really acquired my faith back.\n\nAlso the game itself feels a lot like Warhammer and is quite some fun already, because the meele concept and the jetpack thing are just awesome and with the other races there are so much more insane and fresh concepts to follow.\nThe community is really active aswell and you can for sure express the nerd in yourself with those people, which is a fine aspect, because the game is made so much upon the actual board game, that it probably can bring together computer and roleplaying nerds (I'm using this term in a posetive way here, because you can just enjoy youre time so well witht these things).\n\nI cannot say, how the final result of this will be, but my hopes are high and i'm also willing to support the people making this game, because they present themselfs in a cool way and give us a lot of points to attach that hope to. And nevertheless they have persons like Graham McNeil, who just represent the Warhammer feeling through and through.\n\nAnd since i always wanted to write something like this at the end of one of my posts:\nFor the Emperor and may his glory enlighten us all! And may all his foes kneel down and bleed before us (which includes the producers of this game if they ♥♥♥ it up ... they are probably awere of this; so this is another pro ;D)!","February 11","true","20.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Be mindful of unwary chaos marines and strike them.\n\n4th: we have the apothecary who is a medic that can assist his allies in battle.\n\n5th: we have the storm shield class : Basically a tactica who uses melee weapons and has a shield to negate all damage from a direction until he is close and ready to strike.\n\n\n\nNow onto the CHAOS space marines , I will outline their difference classes here.\n\nThey do not have a class that uses a storm shield ( but this could change )\n\nthey have Tacticals , Raptors ( with are Assault marines ).\n\nThe sorcerer: A chaos marine who utilizes the power of the warp to assist his allies or destroy his foes.\n\nNurgle marines : a space marine that is blessed by the mighty father Nurgle whom has bestowed this devote follower with extreme duribility allowing him to take massive amounts of damage ( I hope later these marines can spread diseases but thats whishful thinking :/ )\n\nLater it is planed to release the orks and Eldar into the game.\n\nGameplay summery : The gameplay is a Third person shooter and each faction has distinct classes and loadouts that can turn the tide of battle allowing each faction to utilize their advantages efficiently without feeling OP.\n\nIs it worth buying : I would say currently ... No becuase its ALPHA and many early access games dont really evolve from this stage , and the game has crap optimization ( currently there was a patch that tried to fix issues on AMd cards such as mine ( R9290x ) and failed , I still get about 10 fps if im lucky ).\n\nBetween poor optimization and its current state I would say add this to a list and keep an eye on it , If it really changes into the MMO it promises to become then YES buy it then and buy the crap out of it! currently just buy space marine for a more solid experience ( it still has a community as well ).\n\n\n\nAs a side note ( I HATE THE LASCANNON IN ETERNAL CRUSADE!!! ) It has a laser ointer thats a dead give-away to your location and lore wise THERE IS NO ********* LOCK NEEDED TO FIRE A LASCANNON... they did this for balance however and It still sucks at the one thing it was sopposed to be good for ( anti-tank )... just grab melta bombs or plasma weapons instead and avoid the Lascannon until its changed ( please change the lascannon ) - TASADAR101\n\nHowever If you have a computer that can run this game I do recommened at least trying it out and if after an hour you dont like it refund it.\n\nfor now Im mixed with Eternal crusade , I want to say a maybe but for now I will say yes out of my support for this game and my hope that it becomes a truly great MMO.\n","February 6","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Once you learn the flow and understand the how combat plays out this game will quickly become very addictive.  Right now it is a map shooter, but a very fun map shooter at that!  I have never ever had so much fun with a map shooter before.  Once they add the persistant world and RPG elements, I fear I may play this more than The Division (as long as WH40k:EC implements a truely open world where players can run into other players anywhere and not just in specificly designated areas.)

And just about every single sci-fi IP in the past what 30yrs has been inspired by it.\n\nNone of the issues will stop from enjoying this game, and they do production updates every Friday via twitch and later port it to youtube.\n\nBuy it - try it - steam has a grace period that allows you to return games you don't like.\n\nThis game is win.

Yes, alpha, blablabla, bugs, blablabla, much time, blablabla,no MMO, blablabla, but it felt good to be able to play as one of the heroes of this awesome universe that is 40k and the game is still making progress. What shall I say about it ?\n\nThe main criticism (the others are, for me, more related to the early stage of developpement) I have seen about this game in matter of gameplay is about melee and therefore classes inbalances. Well what could we say about it ? This game is team objective focused, every class has to make its own part in order to achieve victory for the team. When the tacticals capture the objectives, the apothecaries /sorcerers heal their friends, the devastators/havoks defend positions and destroy vehicles and the assault, these crazy guys with huge swords and axes, they kill people. This what they are for, this is their purpose both in the 40k lore and in the game, so yes it can be hard for a tactical to kill an assault marine but this is the actual balance this game should have. Space marines and traitors are split into different classes in the lore of the 40k universe to answer different needs on the bloody battlefields of the far future, and in this game they do so as we could expect. Classes are not made to be even, this is not a battlefield or some game like that. Here the classes are made to be specialised, so yes this is not inbalance, this is specialisation.\n\nHowever there are still progresses to be made, patches to be added, and if you want to play only as an Ork or an Eldar you should better wait. But if you love the warhammer 40k universe, if you want to play PvP game which less focused on who's the best player (the person who get's more time for gaming in is life while overs are working and having a social life) but on how can everyone best serve his team for victory and we lack games like that. So I'll be optimistic (for the money I spent) and say this game is going to be great. We waited long for a 40k like this one claims is going to be, let wait a bit longer but we have a good start here.","February 6","true","125.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

With that in mind, let's discuss the game as it stands. First off I'd like to point out that the devs are fantastic. They are exceedingly transparent with the direction of the game and listen very closely to the fanbase (to not do so would be suicide, the 40k fanbase is hardcore beyond belief as it is rooted mainly in tabletop gaming).\n\nGameplay as it stands is a basic shooter with decent class customization and very unique mechanics, like the jump pack, executions, etc. etc. It's basically Space Marine with vehicles and an overall better feel. Combat feels heavy and impactful, very satisfying.\n\nFor those complaing about optimization, bear in mind this is an alpha. As the devs have stated, optimizing things at this point is not always the best course of action, as radical changes to the codebase might come along down the road. Even so, ninja patches DO help with optimization and a recent one brought up the performance a decent amount.\n\nOverall, it's very enjoyable even as a simple run-and-gunner and will be amazing with the addition of MMO elements.

The development team is extremely transparent, with weekly twitch shows that everyone can tune in to in order to see what progress is being made with development. As a founder, I have found the development team extremely responsive to our feedback on the forums and on the electronic surveys they send out. Several things I have suggested myself have been implemented, and the development team are all active contributers of the game's forums. They answer our questions and settle our worries time and time again. The development team are not starved for funding and are not gambling with early access money. Enough funds have been planned out to see the core of the game released. All additional early access funds will allow for more content faster, but the core of the game is already certain. They have expanded their development team due to the extreme success they have been having since the founder's program went live back in October. This is a safe investment to make if you love 40k and you love large scale online games.\n\nI would, however, advise everyone to proceed with care when purchasing, with regards to your personal expectations for what you might find after purchase. This game is in Alpha state (at the current time of writing). It is in it's development infancy and has only been playtested by players on live Alpha servers for a few months. There are frequently bugs and balance issues. At the moment the game is extremely hardware intensive, since it runs on the Unreal 4 engine which is undergoing updates and development its self. It is currently not an MMO and is only just beginning to introduct character progression that is currently non-permanent. Please understand that the game is not yet fit for judgement as what they are marketing it as. If you would prefer to wait to see more features in the game before purchasing, please do so.","January 26","true","368.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Even in Founders Access I've had more fun with this game than some major AAA shooter games. That alone makes it a worth while investment. With that out of the way I'd like to point out this is still in Early Access and a good number of features have not yet been integrated like Orkz and Eldar and Tyranids. The only thing you can customize at this point is loadouts, but that is going to change in the near future. Overall the game is simply fun. For $35 you get a good fun fps that you can sink hundreds of hours into while locking yourself in for the full experience that will be released in the near future.

Imo, thats part of the tactical/ strategical aspect of the game; dont walk into bad positions with the wrong gear and character for that situation. In other situations the t2k can be really long; melee feels short and ranged long.\n\nSomething that would be over the top, would be moving under ground, teleportation and playable Tyranids.

But if you want to support a game in true early development amongst this fraud system known as early acces then go for it. The game makes massive progress and is truly transparent development.","January 26","true","17.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

With that in mind, let's discuss the game as it stands. First off I'd like to point out that the devs are fantastic. They are exceedingly transparent with the direction of the game and listen very closely to the fanbase (to not do so would be suicide, the 40k fanbase is hardcore beyond belief as it is rooted mainly in tabletop gaming).\n\nGameplay as it stands is a basic shooter with decent class customization and very unique mechanics, like the jump pack, executions, etc. etc. It's basically Space Marine with vehicles and an overall better feel. Combat feels heavy and impactful, very satisfying.\n\nFor those complaing about optimization, bear in mind this is an alpha. As the devs have stated, optimizing things at this point is not always the best course of action, as radical changes to the codebase might come along down the road. Even so, ninja patches DO help with optimization and a recent one brought up the performance a decent amount.\n\nOverall, it's very enjoyable even as a simple run-and-gunner and will be amazing with the addition of MMO elements.

If you expect polish, story, all features, etc., you are looking in the wrong place. Characters get wiped with patches, item attributes change, and so on. This is nowhere near a finished game. However, the devs are pretty responsive, even if some people get vocal on the forums and assume that because all of their brilliant ideas are not immediately integrated into the game, that means the devs "aren't listening to the community."\n\nRegardless of all that, though, I think the game is a heck of a lot of fun, and I think it is only going to get better. Read the patch notes when they come out, Read (and understand) the thread on the forums about giving constructive feedback, and keep in mind that (channeling Gerard Butler) THIS IS ALPHA!

The development team is extremely transparent, with weekly twitch shows that everyone can tune in to in order to see what progress is being made with development. As a founder, I have found the development team extremely responsive to our feedback on the forums and on the electronic surveys they send out. Several things I have suggested myself have been implemented, and the development team are all active contributers of the game's forums. They answer our questions and settle our worries time and time again. The development team are not starved for funding and are not gambling with early access money. Enough funds have been planned out to see the core of the game released. All additional early access funds will allow for more content faster, but the core of the game is already certain. They have expanded their development team due to the extreme success they have been having since the founder's program went live back in October. This is a safe investment to make if you love 40k and you love large scale online games.\n\nI would, however, advise everyone to proceed with care when purchasing, with regards to your personal expectations for what you might find after purchase. This game is in Alpha state (at the current time of writing). It is in it's development infancy and has only been playtested by players on live Alpha servers for a few months. There are frequently bugs and balance issues. At the moment the game is extremely hardware intensive, since it runs on the Unreal 4 engine which is undergoing updates and development its self. It is currently not an MMO and is only just beginning to introduct character progression that is currently non-permanent. Please understand that the game is not yet fit for judgement as what they are marketing it as. If you would prefer to wait to see more features in the game before purchasing, please do so.","January 26","true","368.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The only thing you can customize at this point is loadouts, but that is going to change in the near future. Overall the game is simply fun.

Nice features are the mix of melee and ranged, and the rapid movement with a jetpack.\n\nRegarding the T2K, you can die really fast some times. Imo, thats part of the tactical/ strategical aspect of the game; dont walk into bad positions with the wrong gear and character for that situation. In other situations the t2k can be really long; melee feels short and ranged long.\n\nSomething that would be over the top, would be moving under ground, teleportation and playable Tyranids. Since the start ive followed this project, the progression is going steadily upward. Well see what EC has in store for us in the future, im holding my thumbs for this.","January 30","true","232.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Realize this is EARLY access not "The game is actually done and we're realeasing it so we can not fix anything but make bank anyways" access.

To the general public, just be warned this is not the full game they are expecting at launch and theres a lot in development (like PVE and open world maps) that wont be in the game right now.\n\nRight now, this game is a lobby shooter of 16v16 PVP matches on 3 maps which are like a capture the point kind of game. Only Chaos and Space Marines are in the game right now as the 2 factions. Watch some game play and video reviews of the game before buying it just so you get the full picture of what it is like.\n\nIve spent a LOT of hours playing this so far and I LOVE it, I daresay Im addicted :D Im very excited for when it does get to launch but if you are uncomfortable with the thought of playing an Alpha game, I wouldnt buy it right now but rather wait till either Beta or the Official Launch. If you are ok with buying into an ALPHA version of the game, make sure you know what you are buying (ie: new patches every week, bugs, class imbalance, FPS drops, lag) before clicking that buy button.\n\nThat being said, I hope to see you on the battlefield!

Be mindful of unwary chaos marines and strike them.\n\n4th: we have the apothecary who is a medic that can assist his allies in battle.\n\n5th: we have the storm shield class : Basically a tactica who uses melee weapons and has a shield to negate all damage from a direction until he is close and ready to strike.\n\n\n\nNow onto the CHAOS space marines , I will outline their difference classes here.\n\nThey do not have a class that uses a storm shield ( but this could change )\n\nthey have Tacticals , Raptors ( with are Assault marines ).\n\nThe sorcerer: A chaos marine who utilizes the power of the warp to assist his allies or destroy his foes.\n\nNurgle marines : a space marine that is blessed by the mighty father Nurgle whom has bestowed this devote follower with extreme duribility allowing him to take massive amounts of damage ( I hope later these marines can spread diseases but thats whishful thinking :/ )\n\nLater it is planed to release the orks and Eldar into the game.\n\nGameplay summery : The gameplay is a Third person shooter and each faction has distinct classes and loadouts that can turn the tide of battle allowing each faction to utilize their advantages efficiently without feeling OP.\n\nIs it worth buying : I would say currently ... No becuase its ALPHA and many early access games dont really evolve from this stage , and the game has crap optimization ( currently there was a patch that tried to fix issues on AMd cards such as mine ( R9290x ) and failed , I still get about 10 fps if im lucky ).\n\nBetween poor optimization and its current state I would say add this to a list and keep an eye on it , If it really changes into the MMO it promises to become then YES buy it then and buy the crap out of it! currently just buy space marine for a more solid experience ( it still has a community as well ).\n\n\n\nAs a side note ( I HATE THE LASCANNON IN ETERNAL CRUSADE!!! ) It has a laser ointer thats a dead give-away to your location and lore wise THERE IS NO ********* LOCK NEEDED TO FIRE A LASCANNON... they did this for balance however and It still sucks at the one thing it was sopposed to be good for ( anti-tank )... just grab melta bombs or plasma weapons instead and avoid the Lascannon until its changed ( please change the lascannon ) - TASADAR101\n\nHowever If you have a computer that can run this game I do recommened at least trying it out and if after an hour you dont like it refund it.\n\nfor now Im mixed with Eternal crusade , I want to say a maybe but for now I will say yes out of my support for this game and my hope that it becomes a truly great MMO.\n","February 6","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Once you learn the flow and understand the how combat plays out this game will quickly become very addictive.  Right now it is a map shooter, but a very fun map shooter at that!

Once they add the persistant world and RPG elements, I fear I may play this more than The Division (as long as WH40k:EC implements a truely open world where players can run into other players anywhere and not just in specificly designated areas.)

Yes, alpha, blablabla, bugs, blablabla, much time, blablabla,no MMO, blablabla, but it felt good to be able to play as one of the heroes of this awesome universe that is 40k and the game is still making progress. What shall I say about it ?\n\nThe main criticism (the others are, for me, more related to the early stage of developpement) I have seen about this game in matter of gameplay is about melee and therefore classes inbalances. Well what could we say about it ? This game is team objective focused, every class has to make its own part in order to achieve victory for the team. When the tacticals capture the objectives, the apothecaries /sorcerers heal their friends, the devastators/havoks defend positions and destroy vehicles and the assault, these crazy guys with huge swords and axes, they kill people. This what they are for, this is their purpose both in the 40k lore and in the game, so yes it can be hard for a tactical to kill an assault marine but this is the actual balance this game should have. Space marines and traitors are split into different classes in the lore of the 40k universe to answer different needs on the bloody battlefields of the far future, and in this game they do so as we could expect. Classes are not made to be even, this is not a battlefield or some game like that. Here the classes are made to be specialised, so yes this is not inbalance, this is specialisation.\n\nHowever there are still progresses to be made, patches to be added, and if you want to play only as an Ork or an Eldar you should better wait. But if you love the warhammer 40k universe, if you want to play PvP game which less focused on who's the best player (the person who get's more time for gaming in is life while overs are working and having a social life) but on how can everyone best serve his team for victory and we lack games like that. So I'll be optimistic (for the money I spent) and say this game is going to be great. We waited long for a 40k like this one claims is going to be, let wait a bit longer but we have a good start here.","February 6","true","125.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It’s absolutely fantastic to see such a transparent development team talk about the direction they want this game to go and take everyone’s questions and opinions on the game to help improve their product.\n\nOnce a few more things have been kinked out and more perks, appearance options and the rest of the factions and sub factions have been introduced this should be a must have game for any fan of the grimdark 41st millennium.\n","February 7","true","15.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Being able to rocket jump onto an opponent and slay them with a chainsword is pretty awesome.  This run and gun shooter is pretty familiar and solid, although I've found the cover system to be a little clunkier than other similar games.  The customization loadouts are in their infancy, but it still shows that they are really going to have a lot of options.  This game feels like your in a futuristic warzone, I really do have fun playing it.\n\nAll this being said, there are some real balance issues between weapons and the factions presented in the game.  Melee weapons are very, very strong.  A single character with a sword/axe can lay waste to a whole squad, negating the benefits of grouping together.  Apothecaries (healers) are practically useless since there are many one-burst kill weapons and the heal animation is painfully slow.  Vehicle combat is not quite clean yet (it feels like driving a rubix cube, I don't know how else to describe it).  Ultimately I would still suggest this game already, even though its in alpha you know it's only going to get better.  Fingers crossed, they add necrons or Imperial Guard in the future.","February 7","true","14.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I am really looking forward to see the Orks and Eldars kick in.\n\nI am really enjoying playing this and beHaviour (studio) is releasing a lot of updates. Kudos guys, keep it up! There has been a lot of improvement on the performance / optimization already since the STEAM release date.\n\nHowever:\n\n- Game is far from being a finished / polished title\n- LAG is real and really impacts the experience in the most annoying way (I suspect no EU server yet) / for a shooter it's a killer point\n- Current maps that are available are OK but simple capture'n'hold - honestly, I do not particularily like them and I think they need crucial level design revamp in some aspects / I really hope some better stuff is coming up\n- Mellee fight (+lag) is imba and you just die most of the time not being able to do anything when attacked by preds/assaults (stun locks)\n- Friendly fire is 1/3 of your deaths\n- Vehicles needs polish and maps designed to use them at their full potential\n- No real retention mechanic implemented yet except a shallow leveling system (with close to no bonus)\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game to any W40K fan with some money to chip in. It is kind of an investment on the future and the future looks good thanks to new production initiatives and strategy as well as co-publishing with Bandai-Namco.

It is not a finished product by any means. Thankfully, the update schedule has been pretty consistent with a patch weekly to bi-weekly and overall this game is moving fast.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me say that I've had a ton of fun with this game so far. Even in its current state as an alpha with only a handful of maps and modes, I keep coming back for more. By the way, I'm no scrub when it comes to online shooters, I've put hundreds of hours into the battlefield, halo, planetside 2 and cod.\n\nBasically, EC is a third person MMO shooter. The game is focused on PvP, although there will be some PvE modes where players fight against the AI controlled Tyranid faction. So far the "MMO" aspect isn't really there, as the game is working through a matchmaking system at the moment. On release, the games looks to be similar to Planetside 2, with a persistent world map with territories to conquer. The game will have 4 warring factions, Space Marines, Chaos, Eldar, and Orks. As of this day, the only factions in the game are SM and Chaos, with Eldar being added in the next few weeks. Also important to note, is that each faction has 5 sub-factions (with more planned in the future) which offer unique looks as well as some unique mechanics. Right now there are 5 classes in the game. A regular soldier class (tactical), a heavy soldier with heavier weapons (devastator), medics (apothecary), melee (assault), and melee with jetpacks (jump assault). Also, different factions have variations of each class. For example the SM medic (apothecary) can heal instantly, but has to be next to the person they are healing, whereas the chaos medic (sorcerer) heals over time, but can heal from several meters away with a beam of energy. This distinctiveness will also be present for the factions that will be added, so that each faction is very unique in terms of mechanics. You will also get to customize the appearance of your characters with aesthetic items and other accessories, but this system is not in the game yet.\n\nThere is also a heavy emphasis on melee combat, and this is one of the most unique things about this game. Unlike other games that have melee as an afterthought, melee combat is a big part of EC. There are many melee weapons; from a simple knife, to chain swords, to a power fist, etc, and the weapons are placed on different tiers based on their strength, speed, and anti-vehicle capabilities. Melee has a rock papers scissors system in place (light attack, heavy attack, and kick attack), however, each action is telegraphed by an animation, so it’s not just a guessing game, but mainly a skill based melee system.\n\nOverall this game is shaping up to be pretty awesome. Just remember, the game is in alpha, so know there isn’t much content at the moment and there a plenty of bugs. But when this game does come out, the finished product will totally be worth the price.\n\nShameless plug: If you do decide to get the game you can get some bonuses if you use a referral code from a current player, you can find codes all over the place but come on, I just wrote you this nice review ;), anyways the referral code is: EC-KOEJ52X0CD69A\n","April 10","true","46.6"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","0"

The exception would be when the game has legitimate problems graphically, mechanically, or about the community. Unfortunately at the moment it's all three.\n\nI cannot recommend the game in good faith. I've heard a lot of problems with AMD and the graphics, as well as optimazation being in a state of flux. It is an alpha afterall, so maybe when it goes into beta or full release this problem will go away.\n\nMechanically it's a fair bit off. Melee and the interplay between them and ranged forces are wonky at the best of times. Weapons clash with lore and function, and currently there's no reason for the bolters to exist unless you're skimping on points.\n\nWorst of all though, the core reason no one should look into this game before full release and perhaps not even then. The forum management between Moderators and Developers. With 100% certainty if you're not playing the loyalist faction, you'll be neglected and abused. If something is too weak on your side, it's going to be low priority because "Balance isn't here yet, it's alpha." but if loyalists have a problem that stuff gets patched within a week. The CSM side's sorcerer has had a near non-functioning weapon and all of its abilities are buggy so you're praying to Tzeentch it latches onto a target.\n\nOn the official forums, you'll have threads locked because one guy said something a mod didn't like. Hell, calling a dev out for making light of one faction's borderline useful class 'mark of nerfle' or passing the buck onto another dev then proceed to joke about the oncoming crap-storm will result in swift admonishment. If you dare suggest a dev should have some decorum, you'll be silenced.\n\nThe mods and the devs devolve into petty threats and insults if you don't suck it up and play their horribly bugged game with a grin. The game itself may get better but these people will still be acting in the same distasteful way. I regret every penny but I hope the game can be at least a little fun.\n\nlong post short: the devs and mods are horrible people if you're not a Loyalist. pass on it.","April 21","false","103.1"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","3"

At first I was unsure spending that much on a unmade game and yes the first few games sucked but that is the same for ever game at first.\nYou're going to love this because it feels like you're part of the empire in a struggle for victory. The footsteps in your armor feel and look heavy, your guns feel like beasts when you fire them. I will say that the meele is over powered and so is that plasma gun but hey the game still has a lot to come. I would not recomend a sniper because the charge time you have to have the curser on the enemy takes way to long to charge up and fire, but it is a insta kill.\nIf you get use to the controls and find a game with your team mates in your squad stick together you'll have the best time in the world as you lead your team to victory. Something that wasn't properly explained was that when you want to capture a point you have to be the "Tatical class" letting you know so you're not just standing there thinking you're captureing the point.\n\nSide note. "T" is to taunt and you may thing "Eh who needs it" but when you hear someone press that you hear in the back ground "For the emperor!" as you all charge into battle, it adds to the gameplay so try pressing it every once in a while.\n\nThe only negative feed back I can give though my experiences are just a few glitches here and there, nothing game breaking of course. When it says create an account don't be turned off by it its just a little thing. There is friendly fire and you do get some teamates that will kill you for no reason and there is no kick option yet so be ready for that. If it gets bad just leave the game and join another. The game is early access so you mind find a hacker or two that insta kills you if  they see you, found 2 so far so that isn't too bad. As of Feb,5,2016 there is only 2 maps and 2 races to pick from and 2 game types which is defending your points and attacking them. There isn't a lot there for gameplay but like I said it is very early access.\n\nIf you're still put off by the price tag or the game not knowing what it is, look up some lore videos on youtube to help you feel more immersed in the game play, as for the price just wait till there is a big sale.","February 5","true","13.7"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","12","25","0","0"

This isn't as much of a review as it is my experience so far in the 40 or so hours i have played.\n\nFirst of all, the community for this game is wonderful. i checked out the videos on the store page and saw DJPenguin's frag video, i wanted to see more so i checked out his stream. Not knowing anything about the game he was very helpful with anything i wanted to know. As soon as i bought the game i was invited to come and play with him and his posse. From there i have met numerous excellent players, data collectors, admins, and have even chatted with some of the devs. All of the people I have talked to have been very informative and encouraging to me as a new player.\n\nThe gameplay obviously has lots of issues such as balancing, optimization, wierd UI bugs, eh netcode, etc. but i can overlook them because the game is in alpha and the devs seem to be very vigilant on trying to fix them and open to suggestions.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that:\n\n1. Likes 40k\n2. Likes fast paced, stressful, team based games\n3. Likes easy to play, hard to master type gameplay\n4. Wants to see a game/community continuously grow\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone that:\n\n1. Doesn't identify with things above\n2. Can't deal with the buggy ever changing nature of early access\n\nPerhaps i have had a pretty good start but i am definitely hooked and i really look forward to what this game will turn out like.\n\np.s. die loyalist scum","May 11","true","86.4"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","1"

It is currently going through early testing and missing a lot of features.\n\nI've learned about "Eternal Crusade" few years back when a mysterious website came up with some awesome background music.\nSince then we have past a long road, people left and came but the overall vision is still the same - Massive scale mmo shooter set in the 40k universe.\n\nAbout the game:Full introduction:   About Eternal Crusade click here[reibornxdax.blogspot.co.il].\n\nIn short Eternal crusade is taking third person shooter style of game (like Space Marine) and adding massive scale world conquest (bit like planetside) and while doing that adding many systems and other features.\n\nGame is Buy2Play - > you purchase once and get full access to the game (all 4 races) and four character slots.\nthere will be free expansions and in the future paid expansions (like new races) will not gate you out of the game instead let's say they will ad new race then you can play against that race but playing AS that race will require a purchase.\n\nThere is sidegrades and decorative items store called "Rogue Trader", the currency for the store is "Rogue Trade Points" which you can get from referrals\purchase with money\in game activities.\nAll items in the store can be found in the game itself under different name\colors etc.\nIt's not P2W as best items and gear are only available via the game itself and not via the store.\n\nRight now (January 26th 2016) we have alpha testing module with small battles of 16 VS 16 (Space marines and Chaos space Marines), when the game will be released there will be also Eldar and Orks.\nGame is purely PVP based and the only PVE will be small dungeons of underground lairs with Tyranids controlled by the AI.\n\nYou can check my YouTube channel for gameplay videos: Reiborn xDAx\n\nShould you get the game ?\nIf you can't stand alpha tests, don't have patience and generally just want to pay now and play immediatly then early access is not for you. If you are 40k Fan or just want to take part in this amazing experience of taking part in a development of a game I highly recommend it.\nThe entire dev team is in contact with us via the game's website forums, each week they hold a twitch livestream of over an hour long with production updates and many more!\n\nOverall it's going to be one of those once in lifetime games, if you can stomach the early access you should get it now and jump into the action right away.\n\nAt any rate getting the game now for 40$ is a steal, you can get it leave it under your library and play when it's released.\n\nI'll update my review in the future when more updates are released, feel free to contact me via steam if you have any questions.","January 26","true","64.5"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

The developers are happy to communicate regularly with all the fans, answering your questions, incorporating ideas and feedback from players and even hosting a weekly Twitch show to keep you updated on the game's progress. The development is as open as it is possible to be.\n\nLike I said, it's an Early Access title so there will be some bugs, crashes and glitches as more and more features are added but with each new update the game gets better and better.

For a long time I have been looking for a game that I wouldn't get tired of, it didn't matter if it was going to be f2p or not I just wanted THE GAME. Then I stumbled across this soon to be masterpiece game. At the time I bought it it felt like a shot in the dark since I had no friends playing it to show me how it was and the content shown by the devs was not much to judge if the game was worth buying or not. To my joy it was more than worth it the game even on Alpha phase was more than a lot of complete games out there.\n\nFor the gameplay right now although you can only use Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines the game is planned to have at least 4 major factions which will be Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Orks, and Eldars and within these factions you will be able to choose 5 sub-factions as different Space Marine Chapters, Chaos Space Marines Legions, Ork Clans, and Eldar Craftworlds. Dependent on the faction you choose (you can create up to 4 characters of any faction without buying a new character slot) you will start your game in a giant battlefield against another faction and you will need to capture objectives to make your faction win in a brutal and adrenaline packed combat. The game is a TPS where you make the build of each of your 5 classes in (different for each faction) or chose the Preset which can inclued firepower in one hand and melee in the other, jump packs, healing specialities, shields, big guns and grenades and/or med/ammo packs.

I've been a founder since day one and what I will say about this game in comparison to the flood of other 40k games, and similiar third person multi player shooters is that it has, hands down, one of the most commited, respectful, and diligent of any devs I have seen in years. DO NOT BE TURNED OFF BY A CURRENT STATE OF THIS GAME, I can say without doubt they are working hard to perfect this title with each, frequent update, and even since early alpha I used to joke about how I wished I had never bought Star Wars Battlefront around last Xmas, as Eternal Crusade has had nearly as much, or more, content than that game since early Alpha. The only caveat was this game ran like ♥♥♥ in early alpha due to well, an alpha game engine, now however with recent updates I've noticed the game running like silk, and looking way better.\n\nSo in summary it has solid graphics, runs great now a days, and is a seamless shooter with great potential for class building, squad/clan gameplay, PvP WvW(ish) conquest, and as far as they've announced eventually PvE agaisn't things like Tyranids and Imperial Guardsmen I believe.

The game is poorly optimized, set to the highest graphics setting and resolution the game plays at a crawl, with a terrible frame rate. I've read that if you lower the settings it becomes more tolerable, but that is hardly a plus in the game's favour.  The game offers very little content for the price it's asking. This game will feel familiar to anyone who has played Space Marine both visually and gameplay wise for the most part, with the addition of vehicle combat. It has solid visuals and when I wasn't suffering frame rate issues the weapons and gameplay was well executed with good weight behind everything. The game is supposed to be improved as time goes on with new content and races being added in and I personally am excited for that.

This is the most toxic community I've encountered since League of Legends.\n\nI've been following Eternal Crusade since the beginning, and it was one of my most anticipated games, especially since I was a huge Dawn of War, and Space Marine fan.  When we finally got access to the game though it was completely lackluster and not at all what I expected. What I expected was at the very least a fun warhammer game, but I was mistaken. Eternal Crusade doesn't really have anything noteably good about it for the type of game it's trying to be. It's stuck in confused state of being between a 3rd rate planetside and Space Marine but taking none of the good qualities of either and mixing only the bad of both.  For example it's not truly open world like it was originally advertised as, everything is matchmaking based rather than territorial conquest, which would be fine if the gameplay was at least fun but it's extremely redunadant.  The executions look pretty at first but when you realize you're locked in a 20 second animation that you can't get out of, 90% of the time you're going to die if you use it.  While they offer multiple classes only 3 are really valid choices. The tactical and ground assault are the only one's who can capture terminals which invalidates pretty much everything else on that basis alone, but you'll find out that vehichles pose literally no threat and are more like gimmicks than having any tactical advantage. Again tactical has melta bombs which is antivehichle so just throw 2 on and the vehichle is gone, which is significantly faster and more efficient than any anti-vehichle weapon like the lascannon which is literally useless. Unlike in Space Marine where you could use the weapon as a sniper rifle of sorts, this lascannon in this game uses a lock-on firing mode which means you have to hold the aiming reticle precisely on a target for 30 seconds before it fires. That means it's impossible to hit infantry unless they stand absolutely still for the full 30 seconds, and on vehichles it takes well over 10 shots to do even a significant amount of damage.\n\nWhen you go down nobody really bothers to pick you up so instead of wasting 30 seconds just sitting there it's normally faster to just kill yourself to try and speed up the already absurdly long respawn process. Another example of a bad planetside trait this game borrows. You have about a minute to wait before you respawn which gets old very fast.  Melee doesn't feel satisfying in any way and is very broken at the moment.  Overall everything is just extremely redundant and lackluster, you don't feel anything refreshing in the gameplay. Once a match is over you kinda just sit there and look at the clock and go "Wow...did I really just waste 40 minutes playing this game?".  Space Marine is 100 times more polished, and 100 times more fun, so if you want a good warhammer multiplayer game go grab that while It's one sale because Eternal Crusade will never be up to par. Needless to say I was very disappointed after following this game for years and I wish they could have done better but the Devs aimed for something grand scale but ended up missing their mark. They tried and I'll give them that but there was some issues with the funding and nothing turned out like it was originally intended.\n\nIf you get the chance to play for free, then by all means give it a try and make your own opinion, but I warn you now you will regret it if you spend $40 on this. It's barely worth $10.  Even if it was entirely free I still wouldn't play it anymore because it's not fun, there's no reason to torture yourself with mediocrity when there's much better games out there, even for Warhammer fans.","January 26","false","72.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Fast-paced. Plenty of action. Once you enter the fray, the combat is laid on you thick and heavy. There's little time to try and formulate some complex idea. Fire until there's nothing else to hit, or slash and chop until they've all dropped.\n\nThe game features a very enjoyable experience for an early access game. Naturally, there's bugs. There's crashes, problems, ect. It's early access. These come with the label. They work on them quickly, practically releasing a new update once a week. They listen to the community fairly well, and have a good idea on how to approach balancing issues, which is difficult when a game features both ranged and melee as viable and effective ways to kill your foes.\n\nThe maps are fairly average. Some design flaws here and there, and honestly I feel like there could be more improvement in this department. That'll come with time as the developers listen to our feed-back and things get beaten down through trial and error.\n\nDespite the fast-paced, high-action content, you have to pay attention to yourself and your allies as much as your enemies. The slightest mistake can cause you to get killed while fighting. Missing a key headshot where it counts can mean you'll lose the ranged duel. The melee system is currently a rock-paper-scissors mechanic, and is still going through constant changes and balancing.\n\nOrks and Eldar will be put into early access fairly soon. As of this review, only Chaos Space Marines are in. Three Chapters/ whatever you dirty heretics call it, are in the game. More will be put in as time goes on. It's expected more races will be added via DLC/expansions after the game has been released.\n\nAs of this current review in its current Early Access? I have a lot of fun. The combat is addicting. The classes offer a different approach to the game, none of them feel alike. I've sank hours into this game as it is already. It'll only get better from here.","February 26","true","115.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

This is very important to remember.\n\nThe next point I want to make is that considering this IS early access I really enjoy the game.  This gives me confident optimism that it will deliver more good things as time goes on (it is essentially going to be an MMO so its development is constant).\n\nWith these things in mind you really have to ask yourself the big question as with ANY early access which is whether you want to pay for a game that is not finished yet.  Try and base it on these facts (correct on the date shown above):\n\nThe most important thing to consider is that if you enjoyed playing the multiplayer mode in the game Space Marine you will essentially like this.  It is the exact same concept however cleverly expanded upon in gameplay mechanics with things like cover, healers, picking up fallen team mates, resupplying your ammo and especially vehicles.\n\nYou should remember however that the game has not yet reached MMO status in terms of battle size and there is no persistent world yet either.  We are a fair way away from this.  Currently in early access we are in effect helping BeHaviour test out the combat mechanics so that the core aspect of the gameplay will work.  This is so that as the scope of the battlefield expands the action remains consistent and enjoyable.\n\nNot all of the races, weapons, complete loadout options or customization options are available as yet.  If you are looking to play anything other than Space Marines or Chaos you are out of luck.  Eldar are due to be released over the next few weeks and Orks will be some time after that but definitely before release.  You also need to remember that if you are looking to define what your character looks like and / or pimp out their accessories this is not yet available.  It will definitely be coming in the foreseeable future and in a big way but is not currently considered key to testing the core combat mechanics at this point in time.\n\nThe game in effect currently plays like a lobby based shooter.  As mentioned above the more meta-level of the game with connected territories and a persistent map is not yet available.  As a result we currently have a handful of maps (presently 4) that are randomly cycled through with X vs X number of opponents.  Whilst this is a far cry from the end game we can eventually expect it does essentially play like the multiplayer mode in Space Marine, just on a more epic scale.  As I said above, if you enjoyed that gameplay then this early access is worth it for that aspect alone.\n\nBe aware that there are bugs.  As with ANY game there are always some issues.  To add to that this game is EARLY ACCESS and is changing at such a rate that sometimes minor issues arise.  Fortunately the cause of the issue is also the solution to the issue as well as also being a comforting thing for an early access game.  It means that things are developing and changing.  Progressing if you will.  It also means that the balance is meticulously being monitored and tweaked to ensure that it will be just right and not rushed out the door totally broken when released on general sale.\n\nThe developers are refreshingly active, open and communicative with the community.  Theyare closely monitoring the early access action and are involved on the forums listening to our feedback and helping the game develop into what WE want it to be rather than what is just the easiest thing to push out the door.  We get relatively regular updates (patch wise) as well as consistent Twitch video shows with the developers letting us know what is going on and what we can expect in the near future.\n\nFinally, if you are a die-hard Warhammer 40k fan, who enjoys a good FPS game, this is also a fine choice just for that.\n\nIn closing, REMEMBER that this game is in EARLY ACCESS and currently has minor issues from time to time.  These are constantly being tweaked as the game develops.  If you are expecting to play a FULLY finished and COMPLETELY polished game, I would hold back and wait for release.  If the rest of the above description hasn’t scared you off, it sounds like you are really gonna enjoy buying this.\n\nHope to see you in glorious battle!","February 27","true","185.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Seeing this as an attempted mmo take on their TPS Space Marine, I decided to set aside my concerns about it being in Alpha and give it a shot. While my concerns ultimately became regrets, I would be lying if I said the game, what it stands for, and what it may become, is outright disastrous and not worth trying.\n\nFrom the perspective of an alpha player, I can pleasantly see the promise this game has. Being able to play only as Space Marine or Traitor Marine at the moment, the choices of loadout and map are fairly limited but self-explanatory as to where to go, what role to serve, what actions and approaches you can make once you familiarize yourself with each map. Weapons are all familiar and self explanatory, with very little complexity in what does what, and objectives are likewise straightforward. The game has a long way to go but what could be lying further down the road may very well be in the longest time what WH40k fans have tried to find.\n\nFrom the perspective of an intermediate-level shooter-games player, this was an unbelievably disgusting nightmare of a game to try. Graphics requirements will give anyone with inferior hardware a bad time as high graphics settings give you a very good picture but tons of lag (and tactical disadvantage) while low graphics make it harder to spot and identify your enemy short of cross-referencing with the minimap and even at lowest graphics the game itself becomes choppy-feeling (still tactical disadvantage). Bad aim (and/or bad graphics compatibility) and bad loadout against veteran players of a stronger build can easily overwhelm you and while it takes you longer than 10 seconds to kill one player as he dances around slashing your allies to ribbons, you often find yourself bleeding out on the floor in less than 3. And the biggest problem of all: no key bindings system. Your controls are whatever the system sets it as so you're gonna have to memorize and utilize all the controls given to you on the fly, which will make things hard if you just jumped into a game and harder if you use keyboards or mice that are built in such a way specific buttons are hard to press in certain ways.\n\nAt the moment there's only public matchmaking so expect to have yourself thrown into a map with both new and veteran players...and because of the lack of tutorial, lack of controls customization, and potential graphics issues affecting gameplay, expect to be butchered by the latter for up to a good ten matches before you start to understand how things work and try to turn the tables. If your tolerance for being abused as a gamer or enthusiasm for the WH40k universe is fairly high, this could still work out for you but otherwise, like myself, give this game another few months...maybe years...so they can hash out the graphics and add a few more features that will rid this game of the many frustrations alpha tends to carry.","February 1","false","0.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Holy ♥♥♥♥, I know this is in early access and there are people screaming and crying 'its in alpha' here and then, but I remember other Alpha games that didn't stray too far from alpha while still adding onto it.  This review is from the perspective of a strict Space Marine player.  I've never been on the delivering end of a Chaos's bolter, and I don't think I ever will.\n\nThis review was written on the TENTH of APRIL, 2016.\nOnly an idiot would bring up future patches to contradict this possibly OLD review.\n\nTOO LONG, DIDN'T READThe game is pretty bad at the moment, and it's the better idea to sit back and watch as it progresses to see if things get better or worse for it.  It has some good aspects, but I can't say they outweigh all the negatives I've personally found in the game.  Initially, I was happy with the game-- until I played it longer and found more personal evils to sneer at.  Maybe when not everyone is packing a one-shot axe and killing more of their own team in random sword fights than actually using a weapon, I'll give it a look.  The game is also pretty laggy at the moment, and the vehicles aren't much to write home about.\n\nNOT LONG, I'LL READCONS\nMelee is absolutely broken.\nIf you lack a proper melee weapon and go up against an enemy with a melee weapon, expect to get stun locked or one-shot by the game's ridiculous idea of melee.  The primary options for a range-based class are roll, keep running, hold shift, or die.  Rolling doesn't do much but prevent them from hitting you- which, even then, most Melee classes are able to LOCK ON to you and follow you, as each attack LUNGES them towards you to do an ungodly amount of damage and stun you.  Assuming you can't gun them down first (which they tend to have a lot of HP), expect a lot of chasing until an ally can take the heat for you.  Otherwise, melee units can 'duel' other melee units in a game of 'rock, papers, scissors' in a boring, bland hit-and-roll fest between them before they get Dark-Souls style ganked.\n\nThe game is extremely laggy.\nThe game seems to favor players who lag versus players who don't.  I've gotten to the point where I can't even tell if I'm the one lagging, or if they are, as I will see enemies move and stop in place, as if they're lagging, only to gun them down and then have them warp into their intended cover only to go into 'revive me' mode.  Sometimes, an enemy to my direct left will warp to my front.  I've also come to notice that some hits continue to register, even as I go into cover.  This has not only resulted in some infuriating melee and gunfights, but also resulted in some VERY undeserved kills.\n\nThe movement is clunkier than Relic's pathfinding and makes the RTS-game units seem more intelligent than EC's marines.\nI've gotten caught on many small objects and been unable to step up a very small, meager ledge multiple times that commonly meant life or death.  I understand, giant men in big power armor waving chainswords and .75 millimeter guns around aren't going to be the most mobile people..  Except they are.  Regardless, I've been finding myself caught on small things, unable to climb things I should be able to climb and unable to traverse what I should be able to.  On the bridge on the way in to a map where you storm a fort, after you blow the gate, I've seen and been the victim of some ungodly tossing and throwing of my Rhino or Vindicator or whatever by the afformentioned small, unimportant stuff that can send your vehicle, figuratively, on two wheels.\n\nThe vehicles feel like cars.\nThis isn't a joke either, the Rhinos have VERY little weight to them and move awfully fast versus what I've seen throughout the games.  Plus, as mentioned before, they tend to get stuck and caught a lot on very small, unimportant things.\n\nAt the moment of writing this review, there is VERY little to do.\nKeep in mind, there are bound to be positives in the future, but as it stands, it's nothing but deathmatching and there are few maps with no difference in game mode beyond 'control point' and 'siege'.  Visually, there are very few differences in the CSMs and the SMs and I've found myself- when aiming down the sight, unknowingly shooting an ally because their 'friendly' marker doesn't appear when you aim.  The only telltale sign is the edgy black coloring most of them have and their goofy looking horns.  (hence why I main Space Marine, horns are for nerds)  Also, matches last too long if the defending side is good at defending.  The base time for the 'siege' game mode is thirty minutes.  That's an hour for one games.  Shorter if the attackers manage to break through in time.\n\nTeam damage and team killing is a thing, and you can be punished for dying to a teammate.\nIt's understandable for there to be stray fire, people aren't the most accurate Space Marines in the world.  However, Eternal Crusade- as it is now, loves to make it very apparent you can team damage and team kill, and it happens a LOT more than you think.  Melee fights in a one-Chaos vs four-Marines can turn into one-Chaos vs four-corpses, as in a melee fight, you CAN damage AND stun your teammates and potentially kill them, assuming the Chaos survives long enough to watch them slaughter each other while attempting to 'GET THE LIMEY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!'.  This is also apparent when using a Megamelta or a Heavy Plasma Gun, as you tend to kill everything infront of you if you don't die first.  This involves teammates.\n\nEach team's respective unique class has a little more bang than they should.\nThe Apothecaries can revive Space Marines will full health and a temporary buff to them.  Aspiring Sorcerers shoot magic and boogers that do a lot of damage over a large range.  I don't think this deserves its own bulletin, but Raptors and Assault marines are also pretty ♥♥♥♥ing dumb.  Their jetpacks recharge fairly quickly, and they can dive-bomb-stun you and immediately begin sawing into you.\nPROS\nI got this for my birthday so that's pretty cool.\n\nThe gunplay feels pretty nice.\nI don't think there is any gun in any game I've ever shot that has felt as comfortable as the Boltgun does, though I can't entirely speak for the large variety of weapons throughout the game- the bolt weapons take the cake.\n\nIt's gonna be free-to-play, and F2Ps only get to play Orks.\nThat's funny.  The game is going to utilize a 'Free to Waaagghh!!' system which allows you to try the game as an Ork with limited loadout options and abilities.  (Though, to some, this could be a con.)\n\nThis is probably the most tactical shooter I've seen in awhile, in terms of teamwork.\nThere is no one man to rule them all or going 40-4  with no teammates unless you, y'know, steal kills like a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥.  Beyond that, I've found there to be a high level of cohesion necesarry between you and your team to win properly, and when it sticks, it wins.  Like a really big booger with really big guns.  Then again, I don't find many 'tactical shooters', so this is just a personal opinion.\n\nThe vision for the game looks pretty good, and the team is active.\nThey have podcasts every Friday where they show off what they've been working on for about an hour.  There is also plans for a 'cash shop' with 'premium currency', which is a personal con, but is a way to support developers who are hard at work.  There is going to be a system of war and dominance where you fight over a large map for control in a four-way fight between the Tough McGruffs, Peanut Gallery, Space Elves and the Mean Greens.  There is also plans for a Horde co-op mode where you fight Tyranids, which hopefully vary beyond 'hormaguant'.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvR8yr6cG1c\nThis video glosses over the issues of melee and provides gameplay from ZoranTheBear who is to date with WH40K: EC.","April 10","false","8.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I can tell you with complete assuredness in my own experience that many of these reviews are by people who have no understanding of what this game is intended to become, nor the progression that it has gone through since it's early access was launched.\n\nFirstly, this is not a beta. This game is in an ALPHA state. What does this mean? It means you simply CANNOT expect it to have even a fraction of the features or development to be considered a complete game. Is it doing a damn good job of progressing? Hell. Yes. At this current stage, Behavior is focusing solely on the core mechanics of player-vs-player combat, which is already immensely in-depth for being in an alpha state. This is the reason for opening the game to an initially closed (and now apparently open) alpha, as there are no better testers for the game than the consumers who believe in its creation. I passionately follow the development of this game and play it regularly.\n\nSecondly, where this game is going is a far more grandiose ambition than what many of the notorious whiners I see in online matches would seem to understand. Calling this game "unplayable" due to technical issues which are to be expected is, frankly, short-sighted and contributes nothing to the positive development of the title.  Many of the issues I see people complaining about are NOT often widely experienced issues, but rather technical problems that are limited to a case-by-case basis.\n\nAlso, don't listen to the kids who cry "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t" every time they die to a more experienced player.\n\nThis game is already top tier in terms of it's development track and it's going fantastic places in the future. The gameplay is superb for its early state, the vision for the final product is clear and the developers have an immense and proactive care for both this game and its growing community.\n\nIf you want one of the best 40k titles we've gotten yet, sign up for this game.","February 25","true","147.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","5","11","4","0"

(That's just a summary of how it is.)\n\nAs for Eternal Crusade, it's a re-skin of the Unreal 4 engine developed and supported by Epic Games; Not bE who just does the artwork (which is nice) and scripts the environment (which is currently not good).  For bE's part, they are working on it, but after more than two years they still haven't added the Orks, Eldar, Tyranid, etc, etc.  And with the above EA commitment, they don't have to until sometime well after they 'release'.  Just like their 'goal' to make the Orks a 'free to play' aspect of the game ... where are they?  Right ...\n\nSave your $$$, I'd wait for this one to finish and go into the discount basket.  There are lots of EA games that are actually worth it, or even 'free to play'.  Maybe someday EC will fit that bill, but it's not today.\n\nAs always, your choice;  Buyer beware.\n\nHave an opinion about mine ... cool.\nWant to be vulgar ... delete button is easy.\nWant to pick a fight ... ban button is easy too.","May 19","false","23.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","2"

Sure we have the Fists but here, in this game, I would rather have Black Templars. Enough about my rant most of you won't really care about.. Besides this, great fun to be had in this early access. It's in a very early stage, yet I have had a wonderful time. In this stage of development I expected waayyyy more glitches than there are. As with all early multiplayer matches there are some bad spawns and balance issues I am sure will be fixed. They just put in the melee clash system not too long ago, it needs heavy improvment, and at this stage I cant say I like it. One last thing and I hope the devs read this, the shield is EXTREMELY overpowered, the lascannon's charge up time is too long to be useful in a meaningful way. I can't wait until they fix these things, like with the shield have the user take at least SOME damage instead of keeping it up until one of their buddies can come to kill you. I will still reccomend this game and can tell the devs care about the universe this game is set in. I can't wait until the PVE modes are introduced I am psyched for them!","March 15","true","16.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The core combat of the game is very bland and basic at this moment, and some aspects of it are very broken. the game can be fun however, but id recommend newer players join chaos so they arent getting eaten by the veterans of chaos. seems like most of the original founders are currently on chaos to avoid new players ruining experience. Melee is very broke, but theres nothing more exilirating than a ferocious duel with another guy.

A tabletop game concerning huge battles and lots of killing and basically a ♥♥♥♥ load of DAKKA. And a Planetside like system. With huge battles and fantastic strategic gameplay? You get Warhammer 40k: Eternal Crusade.\n\nI have been following this game for a while and i have always loved the idea. Huge battles in a 40K setting who would not want that? Idiots. Idiots would not want that. The series lends itself well to strategic games like Dawn of War but getting into the trenches yourself and taking up the chainsword is also a possibility. And that is exaclty what Behaviour has done for us here.\n\nMy reasoning for not wanting to buy in for so lang was fear. Fear of the developers cashing in on this great idea and then leaving after a month or two. Going on to other projects. But these developers. These developers are commited. They are figthing hard for a game that they want to play. And you migth think that rigth now this game is totally unfinished. WELL LOOK AT THE FREAKING THING ON TOP OF THIS PAGE! EARLY ACCESS GAME. Im sorry for screaming, but this game is currently in development. Thats obvious. They are first of all working on making the combat smooth as heeeell. And they are reaching that goal with thunderous steps.\n\nI can not wait to see what Behaviour has in store for us. And i will follow them all the way into the Eye of Terror.\nWhile this game has bugs, and weird things, and unbalanced weapons, and few races, and few maps. It also has AWESOME weapons, Cool as hell and polished maps and just. A team behind it who are fans of the 40K franchise, and who wants to see this game succeed.\n\nI am not going to rate this game, because it is yet finished. But when it is finished, and believe me i cannot wait for that joyous day to come. I will be the first to stand upon the mountaintops of Holy Terra and sing the praise of this great game.

No, no it does not. However what is here is a dirty gem, just needing some gentle polish to become a beautiful diamond of a game, a game that will be remembered as the one true warhammer game of all time.\n\nThis game truely feels 40K, from how the bolter fires slowly and insanely loundly and you feel it as you fire, you feel the power in each shot true to the lore, as the rounds ding like hitting steel as you pummel a space marine from pointblank, how when you down a marine, you stand over them, pumping another 12 bolter rounds into them to finish them off, holy ♥♥♥♥! This is 40k right here. Your marine can take punishment, this isnt call of Duty you can survive a good smacking until you finally go down, this means 2v1 you will always lose, you cant go crazy and one shot everybody, you need to work as a team and a unit. If you round a corner and there are two tactical marines? Your screen will shake as you are pummeled by two bolters until you die. Team work is key.\n\nPROS.\n\n1) So 40k its more 40k than 40k.\n2) Incredible team based gameplay, class system, loadout system with points.\n3) It has great bolters, (I tried each gun once, used bolter for 7 hours straight)\n4) This game has a great potential for being the game of the year if the developers can pull it off.\n\nCONS.\n\n\n1) This game is very early alpha, many bugs, lack of any content from discription, a long road until finish.\n2) I wont list alpha problems, as its alpha, however if you purchase this game, like i say its currently not worth £35, you get a few maps to play and thats it.\n\nHowever If this game delivers it will be worth £50 full release, so I still say buy now, if you like 40k and like tactical shooters this game is for you.

Short way of putting it: It's space marine that has been remastered and being made into a true warhammer 40k shooter(much like space marine should of been).  The idea is that it will match the lore and the actual table top, to a certain point(obviously)..\n\nThe fact that there will be hero classes and terminators(elites/heavy's) for each race is just exciting to know.  Giant maps with squads/guilds designed to match the groups game play(someone has a banner that buffs a certain stat, etc etc) is coming with the maps later on into development.  Game feels great for being in alpha, they have an impressive dev team.  Check out some of the known streamers to get an idea of the game.\n\nMy only gripe is the keybinds arn't in, but it is being worked on..

I'll take a game like this any time of the day.\n\nCurrently the game is in early access (Patch #15 as of writing this) and has a lot of things missing (e.g. no persistent map, no orks, no eldar yet), and a lot of things need some additional love (e.g. performance, even though it became much better with last couple of patches).\nBut, with all that said - this game is amazing even in current state.\n\nIf you'd played Warhammer 40k: Space Marine multiplayer - this game is basically extended version of it.\nIt feels very close to the way Space Marine played. Gunplay is fun, melee system is pretty sweet (just mashing attack button won't get you far), maps are well designed.\nIn addition to all the parts from Space Marine, you have some new things of course.\nFor example - vehicles are good addition to general gameplay since maps are pretty expansive even now. And I imagine moving around on foot on persistent map would be near to impossible.\n\nThe game currently has two races available - Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines with Orks and Eldars coming later.\nEach (current) race has 5 classes available: assault, tactical, ground assault, devastator and apothecary. (they are named slightly differently for Chaos side)\nEach class has a distinct set of items and abilities it can use, and a unique way to be helpfull at battlefield.\nFor example, only tactical can capture bases. While only devastator can do anything to vehicles. And assault just has a bad-♥♥♥ jetpack and can fly.\nMaking classes have specific roles shapes the gameplay - even if your team is very good, but enemy has taken down your tactical, you won't be able to capture their base. I find that to be absolutely awesome.\n\nLater down the line, along with PVP world map, the game will have PVE coop game mods.\nWhich in my opinion is fantastic, since I'm more of a PVE person.\n\nBut, as I mentioned, it's not all good in the land of WH40k. It's early access, so expectedly - there are issues.\nMy biggest gripe would be the framerate that is not quite stable yet (it's much better than at the game launch, but still not quite there).\nThe game also tends to occasionally freeze for short times after loading (for me), but that's more an annoyance than a huge issue.\nThen there's rough UI and occasional crashes out of menus (haven't had any during the matches, though!).\n\nIf that doesn't bother you too much - you'll find a great PVP match-based 3rd person shooter with amazing community - just look at all those guides and fantastic discussions on official forums, also finding games takes seconds.\nDevs are pretty active - patches come out regularly, updates on progress even more so, new features are getting added to the game. And in general the dev process is going quite good since launch day.\n\nIf you want to see more details about the game along with some gameplay, watch my video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/TLjq5YG-0x4","April 1","true","4.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's rough around the edges, it's not yet optimized, and some of the weapons feel a little off when you use them. Sorcerers and Apothecaries aren't too great unless you want to be a healer who's otherwise useless, and half the factions are currently unavailable.\nThough what I can say is that what's there so far is fun, if a bit out of balance as of yet. I've been playing around in missions, trying out various weapons and roles, and I've had quite a bit of fun doing so.\nIs it a finished product? Certainly not.

As I am a lover, how couldn't I buy Eternal Crusade?\n\nAs the game is alpha my review may not be very helpful after some time, but don't trust everybody who says to you "This is alpha, everything is going to change, don't worry! " No... unfortunately no, it never happens like this, they add a lot , but they do not change a lot. For a start, here is what the games is like: 2 Teams - Space Marines and Chaos , something like 3 gamemodes-Siege , and 2 others with points. Not a small amount of weapons and 2 type of grenades and 3 types of kits- repear, heal and ammo boxes. Here are the classes- Normal Soldier with normal weapons, Heavy Weapons soldier, Assault soldier with melee weapons and Healer. Nice graphics and nice fatalities when you down somebody. Also there are 3 types of tanks- transporter, predator (tank) and a new one , dunno how it is called , which is very slow and has a big gun.\nSo here were the good things, now the bad ones...\nyou need a strong computer to see anything in the game, mine totally fits the game and has a lot above and still laggs when I get in melle combat\nMelee combat is TERRIBLE here is what it is: attacking, stunning, defending  yeah, no problem that you still can spam attack and win, and the defense is terrible, and also you get a pistol which aim automatically at near targets and u can't miss\nNO SENSE of playing because Chaos, somehow are OP, they have like 30% more HP and if I have played like 100 battles, I have won like...7.... I am EXTREMELY ♥♥♥♥♥♥, my Team score (ALWAYS) 5/7  2/14 1/2  4/9  my enemy team scores 24/5 19/0 14/2 18/7 and this is because I have never played with chaos. It is like playing CS:GO where Terrorists always win no matter what....\nFriendly fire... SOOO much friendly fire and so much hatred among players...\n\nOk so those are the main problems, and positive sides of the game but there are millions more from both.\n\nThe Devs are strange- They said the new race Eldar should be ready after a month or two 4 months ago... They also made servers with 64 ppl which is super stupid as the game gets too laggy. They often show us gameplay with the new races and new maps where it is super laggy but of course they are already in-game. The game is cool, I like playing with my friends BUT those things that i just wrote just ♥♥♥♥ me off... I always start playing the game with good feeling and then i get rekt from chaos with 1st place and team can't get out of the spawn cuz chaos are stanging by the border and killing any of the idiotic team's members which come out just to die... Just... I don't know this is totally 50/50 review but ima mark it down as a positive cuz i had more time enjoying it.

This game is, in its current state (january 26th 2016) not good at all. And that's understandable, because it's an early alpha. Which is why it SHOULDNT be sold on steam early access. It's not ready, it's too rough, there's little to no content, the gameplay is rough, the optimization is horrible, and I could go on.\nWhile the game has potential and I hope it will become the game we were promised as founders, I would just say do NOT buy it in this state UNLESS you do it to support the devs.\nThe game is simply not close enough to being finished at the moment and you would have a better time buying any number of finished games. Spending 50$ on this game and expecting to spend dozen hours having a blast is just not realistic in the state the game is in at the moment. If you have enough disposable cash and want to the support the develoment like me and all the other founders do, buy it, otherwise, buy a finished product that you can actually enjoy right now. You'll have plenty of time to get the game when it gets closer to being finished.\nSo again, buyer beware : I will definitely recommend the game and change this review when it becomes closer to release, and closer to a good, playable state, but it's just not the case at the moment.","January 26","true","1.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

With PvE, massive PvP battles over a conquest map, skills/Traits, marks of chaos, Eldar,Orks, Weapon/Armor skins, factions and just the lore of warhammer that is planned on being in the game in the future this is a must buy if you are willing to take the risk. If you get this game right now as of Jan. 2016 do not expect a AAA game but a true work in progress alpha. It's up to the devs to deliver and I believe they will do so. If you are looking to help out come join the WAGGGGH!!! and may the Emperor Protect. But keep a eye out for this game if you choose not to help.\n","January 26","true","31.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Every week the game gets updated with significant improvements and features.\n- The community is very friendly, so long as you don't act like a total dickweed.\n- The marine characters feel sufficiently heavy and massive. There's a lot of momentum in your movement, and it feels good just to run around.\n\nCons:\n- Bugs. There's a lot of little annoying issues that are still waiting to be smoothed over.\n- Not much content. 3 maps, 2 factions. Certainly not worth $50 in itself.\n- Performance is bad. Really bad. (Though there's supposed to be some major optimizations coming pretty soon).\n- Some of the animations, sounds, and effects are lackluster. (But in all likelyhood, they're not anywhere near final).\n- The melee system is a rock-paper-scissors game of chance – by design. It doesn't work well, feel right, or look good.\n\nRight, now here's the skinny on the project's goals.\n\nAt launch there will be 4 playable factions: Orks, Eldar, Space Marines, and Chaos Space Marines. Tyranids with comprise the 5th faction, though they will be NPCs used in PvE content (there have been rumors of playable tyranids, and the developers have said it's something they're looking into). The plan for the meta is similar to that of Heroes & Generals – that being a persistent tactical map with outposts and fortresses connected to one another through a lattice. Each outpost/fortress with be its own instanced 'map'. Outposts will host smaller skirmishes, while fortresses will be massive siege battles of 100+ players.\n\nThere are plans to merge the facilities in sets of 3 outposts and 1 fortress further down the line (post-launch), each of these instances would be roughly 1/4 the size of a continent in Planetside 2. Battles in those areas would likely have 300-500 players. The end goal is to open the continent (which is much larger than any in Planetside 2)  completely,\n\nBy lauch there will also be terminators, drop pods, hero characters, elite units, social hubs, and more things I don't remember off the top of my head.\n\nIf that sounds interesting to you, I reccomend picking it up. Even if it's not worth the $50 right now, it's quickly shaping up to be. If you're on the fence, I say wait. Keep an eye on the progress and jump in when you think it's worth it.","January 29","true","154.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Obviously, being early access, there are a few graphical glitches here and there, but for the most part it runs smoothly. Curently I am running everything on high with a GTX 760, and it's smooth. The game is fun, but there are a fair few issues with balance that really need to be addressed.\n\nMelee is far too overpowered in this game atm. A single space marine equipped with sword and shield can walk on into a room full of chaos marines, and vice versa, and wipe them all out. The majority of matches I have played so far, the top places on the leaderboard have all been melee marines.\n\nMark of Nurgle on chaos marines is too good also. You can land headshot after headshot on marked marines, and they won't die. As such, most matches are won by Chaos.\n\nThere are issues with some weapons being too good to not use, and some being plain useless. The Lascannon for example, tickles if it hits you, whereas the plasma gun, charged up, can one shot a group of marines.\n\nIt can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between a team mate and an enemy. The Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines do look different when you can stop and admire how good htey look, but in the thick of the fight, it can sometimes be very difficult to tell them apart. The game does add a small red marker above enemies, but I have found that this marker can sometimes vanish, or it's jsut too small to notice.\n\nThere are big issues with spawning in the game currently. It feels like everyone who died in a certain time period will spawn at once, in one big clump. Some players, based on the map, take advantage of this and will have a charged up plasma gun waiting for such an event.\n\nOverall, the game is alot of fun and looks stunning. It feels like a Warhammer game should. Any fan of the Warhammer 40k universe will love playing this, if they can ignore the current issues that need addressing. But as it is an alpha/early access, these are to be expected. The game does have a rather steep learning curve, such as how hte melee combat works, but it is alot of fun once you start to understand things.\n\nCurrently as it is, I would recommend this game, but only to people who enjoy the Warhammer universe.\n\n\n\n","April 3","true","5.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is not recognized in NVIDIA EXPERIENCE software as of yet so forcing GRAHPICS settings takes a little know how but it's a good game... like I said realy choppy on windows 10.. Hopefully it will improve as it develops.    For being an early release ALPHA.. I would give this title a 7/10.\n\nCons- Lack of known patching and updating status. Lack of servers, options and general game settings  are extremely limited.\n\nPros- Really well done physics, combat, enviorment  and  art work. It's warhammer 40k 3rd person style and it's got a Gears of War feel to it. I can't wait to see the title grow as it will simply just get better if the developers invest a little bit more to get the ball really rolling.\n\nI would encourage people to pick up this title and invest in what these guys are trying to accomplish in the hopes they fund it right and get it going.

The game is by no means perfect there are still a number of bugs and balancing issues to iron out but being early access thats expected and with each update the game continues to shine. Right now we dont have dedicated servers for EU but the game is not unplayable and I have not had many issues with ping/latency. I would advise that you do some research or watch a few streams just so you know what to expect before you decide on making a purchase to play early access. If you are still unsure I would say wait for the full games release if your not up for waiting for content updates with each new patch but now is the time to really get a glimpse of the community and forge your squads/guilds ready for the full experience.\n\nThe game may feel a little barebones as an arena shooter but it has a selection of great diverse maps available to do battle on while utilizing tanks, teamwork and tactics to bludgeon your foes and laugh at their inferiority. There is just something rewarding and satisfying about storming a fortified position under a hail of plasma and bolter rounds with the echoes of heavy support in the distance and the descent of chainsword wielding death chewing through any unfortunate victim who wandered into their path.\n\nThere is still plenty of things yet to come while the devs and players test the core combat mechanics and stress test the servers such as customisation, new factions and classes, PVE and a large scale world to conquer. The game is worthy of the support and I would ask everyone to check out the official site and research what the game is going to bring to the table.https://www.eternalcrusade.com/\n\nIn it's current state I would give this game a solid 7/10 taking into account:\n\n. Bugs/errors such as rare disconnects or reloading bugs.\n. Combat (A little rock/paper/scissors but there is a nack to it with light/charge/bash attacks.)\n. The community; a diverse group of skilled players there is alot of banter and teamwork.\n. Ping/latency (Not too bad considering but more servers will come its still Alpha).\n\n\nSo finally why do I recommend this game to you and why do I continue to rack up more and more hours of playtime..... well heres a few questions to you guys:-\n\n. Want to worship the Chaos gods and bath in the blood of your enemies as you crush your foes to show your true devotion to the ruinous powers? Then get this game!\n\n. Want to devote yourself to the emperor and slay the heretics? Then get this game!\n\n. Want to wield devestating weaponry and unload it into the next poor soul who looks at you funny be it a plasma cannon, heavy bolter etc? Then get this game!\n\n. Want to work as a team to overcome impossible odds in the heat of battle? Then get this game!\n\n. Want to revel in your factions conquest of Arkhona? Then get this game!\n\n\n(And while orks/eldar are not here yet they still deserve a mention)\n\n. Want to unleash your inner WAAAAAAGGGGHHHHHHH? Then get this game!\n\n. Want to banter as an ork over voice chat? Then get this game!\n\n. Want to unleash the power of the Eldar and earn glory for the craftworld?

The FPS was a thing, but mine was pretty average considering.  I am thankful for that.\n\nThere is a lot that needs addition, but again, such is the way of Alpha.  The game is functional and feedback is ALWAYS considered.  I have never seen a company more dedicated to a game and its community.  These guys and gals are honest, and this game is for more than a quick buck.  Lore is taken into account (though not to an extreme amount where it negatively affects gameplay) and nothing is really that unfriendly toward the lore.  It also helps that everything they do is approved by Games Workshop themselves.\n\nSo I'm going to list the postitives and negatives of this alpha thus far.  Now, I will not include things that aren't in the game as negatives, only what is currently there.  They have a lot of plans in terms of visual customization, weapons, races, vehicles, maps, terrain, so on and so forth.\n\nEdit: 1\n\nThe Plus Sides:\n\n+ The game makes you feel like you are weighty, as a Space Marine would feel.  Although many argue that the Space Marines run too slow (as described in some lore, they are superhuman fast) we must keep in mind that there is no "normal" running speed to compare this to in game, so we go with what we've got.\n\n+ Has a decent mixture of melee and ranged combat and has emphasis on both.  You will likely have fun playing as a melee unit as much as a ranged unit.\n\n+ The classes are diverse enough to be unique, yet similar enough in concept to where it isn't unfamiliar right away if you change factions.  Chaos and Space Marines are probably closest in base classes (Tactical, Devastator, and Assault in comparison to Traitor, Havoc, and Raptor).  Once Orks (WAAAAGH!!!!) and Eldar are implemented (Eldar soon!), there will be plenty of options to choose from and diversity.\n\n+ Sound effects are pretty spot on.\n\n+ Nice and brutal executions.\n\n+ Emphasis of teamwork.  Without teamwork, you won't win much.\n\n+ All animations, weapons, such and such, have been approved by Games Workshop, the official lore creators.\n\n+ You are a part of the development process.  Everything you do with the Alpha is in contribution to a potentially epic game!\n\n+ The game updates and patches every single week, and the developers do Twitch streams on the progress each week.  Nowhere to go but up.\n\n++ Eldar and Orks that are playable as individuals (never been done before in any Warhammer 40K game!  It has usually always been Chaos, Space Marines, and maybe a Tau game).  This alone is worth the buy, I believe, once the Eldar are in and Orks soon after.\n\nThe Negatives/Neutrals (=):\n\n= Time to kill is rather low, some would argue.  I personally think it should be tweaked a bit, but if you don't like using your smarts to get out of a situation or to take down an opponent, don't buy this right now.  (Remember that the Bolter isn't just some gun; like the Power Armor, it has lore, too!)\n\n- The frame rate sucks.  Results may vary from person to person, but generally you won't have more than 25 in my experience.  EDIT: Has since improved, but again, preformance varies greatly.\n\n= If you like to win or are competitive, you may not have fun here as of now.  In this alpha, it isn't much about competition right now.  It's about testing.  Plus, many Founders have been playing this for days on end; they know the game better than you do, so if you get into a match with them you have no choice but to use teamwork.\n\n= Asymmetrical balance has ephasis here.  If you are expecting a copy and paste of each class from faction to faction, or if you expect each race to function the same, you would be wrong.  This is a good thing in my opinion, but many can't seem to grasp that idea and scream out "unbalanced" before making proper judgements.\n\n- Matchmaking is primitive (alpha) so don't expect to be in fair matches all the time.  In fact, ignore negative reviews that talk about this, and talk about player count and balance; there will be a lot of times where you end up in games where you will be outnumberd, or where you will be fighting a guild while you're fighting alongside noobs.  It will happen quite a bit, so it doesnt' really have much to do with imbalance as much as it does a crappy matchmaking.\n\n= Guilds dominate the playing field, due to their use of Teamspeak and communication.  This is a good thing in my opinion to emphasis team work, but if you're team isn't using teamwork, then you're going to get your asses handed to you.  Be prepared for that.\n\n\nIn Summary:\n\nThis game is good if you don't mind some poor performance temporarily.  Otherwise, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  It is a little bit of an investment, so if you don't feel like putting your money down yet, I'd say wait and keep an eye on this game.\n\nArgumentative:\n\nSome would argue that the Space Marines are too powerful.  I disagree wholeheartedly.  The balance here is rather strong, and most matches depend on team preformance.  Sometimes you get stuck in a game full of noobs.  It happens.  And often times, they do not know what to do when around a Shield Marine or Assault.\n\nThere are some matches where you will be pinned against those outnumbering you.  That is a result of bare-bones matchmaking.","February 2","true","78.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Weekly twitch shows give players a sneak peak at what's being worked on  as well as giving us the opportunity to interact with the games development.\n\nCurrently the game plays as a lobby shooter based on 16vs16 and 32vs32 matches of chaos vs space marines(the long term plan is to grow the size of maps and players until a semi open world game akin to planetside 2 is achieved). There is some diversity between the races but currently they are fairly similar, further differences are being added to the loadout system in the coming months.\nSquads can have their leader set objectives using the comms rose, and tanks can be used as respawn points /offensive weapons.\n\nGame modes include domination/ sequential capturing of points(tug of war)\nGraphically the game is quite stunning, however performance is currently subpar due to being alpha and emphasis on optimisations not being the main priority yet. However I'm able to get 45fps with an i5 6600k/r9 380 4gb/8gb ram at 1080p and around 30fps at 1440p. Fps improvements are being made all the time.\n\nWeapon choice gives a nice variety to gameplay styles from being melee focused to a braced heavy spiting suppressive rounds from a distance.\n\nIf you're considering buying this game feel free to use this referral code/link to earn yourself and I a further 4k rogue trader points to be spent on wargear .\n\n\nhttps://www.eternalcrusade.com/account/sign-up/?ref_code=EC-19F33HLI22149","April 19","true","295.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You will likely have fun playing as a melee unit as much as a ranged unit.\n\n+ The classes are diverse enough to be unique, yet similar enough in concept to where it isn't unfamiliar right away if you change factions.  Chaos and Space Marines are probably closest in base classes (Tactical, Devastator, and Assault in comparison to Traitor, Havoc, and Raptor).  Once Orks (WAAAAGH!!!!) and Eldar are implemented (Eldar soon!), there will be plenty of options to choose from and diversity.\n\n+ Sound effects are pretty spot on.\n\n+ Nice and brutal executions.\n\n+ Emphasis of teamwork.  Without teamwork, you won't win much.\n\n+ All animations, weapons, such and such, have been approved by Games Workshop, the official lore creators.\n\n+ You are a part of the development process.  Everything you do with the Alpha is in contribution to a potentially epic game!\n\n+ The game updates and patches every single week, and the developers do Twitch streams on the progress each week.  Nowhere to go but up.\n\n++ Eldar and Orks that are playable as individuals (never been done before in any Warhammer 40K game!  It has usually always been Chaos, Space Marines, and maybe a Tau game).  This alone is worth the buy, I believe, once the Eldar are in and Orks soon after.\n\nThe Negatives/Neutrals (=):\n\n= Time to kill is rather low, some would argue.  I personally think it should be tweaked a bit, but if you don't like using your smarts to get out of a situation or to take down an opponent, don't buy this right now.  (Remember that the Bolter isn't just some gun; like the Power Armor, it has lore, too!)\n\n- The frame rate sucks.  Results may vary from person to person, but generally you won't have more than 25 in my experience.  EDIT: Has since improved, but again, preformance varies greatly.\n\n= If you like to win or are competitive, you may not have fun here as of now.  In this alpha, it isn't much about competition right now.  It's about testing.  Plus, many Founders have been playing this for days on end; they know the game better than you do, so if you get into a match with them you have no choice but to use teamwork.\n\n= Asymmetrical balance has ephasis here.  If you are expecting a copy and paste of each class from faction to faction, or if you expect each race to function the same, you would be wrong.  This is a good thing in my opinion, but many can't seem to grasp that idea and scream out "unbalanced" before making proper judgements.\n\n- Matchmaking is primitive (alpha) so don't expect to be in fair matches all the time.  In fact, ignore negative reviews that talk about this, and talk about player count and balance; there will be a lot of times where you end up in games where you will be outnumberd, or where you will be fighting a guild while you're fighting alongside noobs.  It will happen quite a bit, so it doesnt' really have much to do with imbalance as much as it does a crappy matchmaking.\n\n= Guilds dominate the playing field, due to their use of Teamspeak and communication.  This is a good thing in my opinion to emphasis team work, but if you're team isn't using teamwork, then you're going to get your asses handed to you.  Be prepared for that.\n\n\nIn Summary:\n\nThis game is good if you don't mind some poor performance temporarily.  Otherwise, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  It is a little bit of an investment, so if you don't feel like putting your money down yet, I'd say wait and keep an eye on this game.\n\nArgumentative:\n\nSome would argue that the Space Marines are too powerful.  I disagree wholeheartedly.  The balance here is rather strong, and most matches depend on team preformance.  Sometimes you get stuck in a game full of noobs.  It happens.  And often times, they do not know what to do when around a Shield Marine or Assault.\n\nThere are some matches where you will be pinned against those outnumbering you.  That is a result of bare-bones matchmaking.","February 2","true","78.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Either it's being compared to other, complete, games or it's cast in a negative light because it hasn't yet reached all of its development goals. These would be fair criticisms if this was also being advertised as a complete game, but it is not. It's clearly Early Access. All you can do is review the content that is currently available.\n\nEven with only two factions and three maps to play with at the moment, I'm having a hell of a good time. Battles feel hectic and dangerous, gutsy tactics often turn the tide. Be careful of friendly fire though... I may have accidentally sent a few brothers into orbit.\n\nThe classes feel decently balanced, save for the melee buffs the Ground/Traitor Assault units gain.

For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor of Mankind has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the vast Imperium of Man for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day so that he may never truly die.Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in His name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat to humanity from aliens, heretics, mutants -- and far, far worse. To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be relearned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods."\n","February 25","true","20.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have been burned by many early access games before but not this one. First thing to get out of the way, it is an early access game so it is unpolished, what you get right out of the gate may not be alot but bear in mind that they update quite frequently. Combat is fun, not too many good third person tactical shooters out there anymore. The game is also fairly forgiving for new players. The biggest issue I saw when reading reviews was huge lag stemming from the Unreal 4 Engine. I expected my four year old PC to just crash and burn when loading this up but all I did was turn the graphics down a bit (for me it autoset the graphics to maximum, dont know if it does that to others) and it ran perfectly. However they are working on stabilizing the game so it runs better for those who do have lag so dont fear getting this game before the price goes up.\n\nLong story short, I highly recommend.\n\nDeath to the Corpse Emperor","January 27","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhantomAnon/recommended/375230/","PhantomAnon","His Dudeness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhantomAnon/","392 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is the Warhammer game I have been waiting for. It's a little like Space Marine, but you are not an unstoppable bullet sponge. Instead this game rewards uses of cover, strategy, and above all else, teamwork. Things are still a little rough as the game is in the alpha phase, but the framework underneath is pretty solid. The melee mechanics have gotten polished up more recently; as long as you don't rush into a hail of bullets and understand the rock/paper/scissors mechanic of fast swing/charged attacks/defensive bashes you can become a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThere are some issues at the moment with how teams are playing out, but this is more a problem with 40k than the game, in my opinion. With the only factions at the moment being Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines, and the game having no team switching, often the SM will outnumber CSM by a few people because of how many people love SM over Chaos, those weaklings. Recently it seems that things have started to balance out more because if one faction is flooded their time-to-find-a-game will increase while the other faction will have open spots to jump into.\n\nThe selection of weapons is pretty great at the moment as well; storm bolters, heavy bolters, and the classic bolter all play out quite differently and excell at different functions that set them apart. Your weapon loadouts also will depend upon class selection.\n\nScouts have a breadth of options from a stalker bolter, sniper, to the chargable plasma gun and classic infantry destroyer, storm bolter.\n\nHeavy classes can wield the plasma cannon (which can alt-fire into an artillery death machine), a lascannon (you have to keep the laser on the target for a few moments, one-shots most classes and tears through vehicles), or the heavy bolter for amazing suppressive fire.\n\nRaptors, jump packs of winged death, can outfit themselves with the classic chainsword (fast as hell, but less of a punch),  a powersword (medium speed, tears through armor, powerful hits but less manueverable), the poweraxe (slower, but will cut through most other melee in a clash and does great damage to vehicles), or the powerfist (slow as ♥♥♥♥, but powerful as hell; can one-shot enemies with a charged attack and fling vehicles away).\n\nMedics can a special bolter that can do a soft-lock on enemies, powerswords, and their healing ability. Space marines heal allies  and poison enemies with a sword hit, while chaos has a healing beam.\n\nGround assaults are the last class and are the melee powerhouses. Space marine's assault unit carries a shield that absorbs damage at the cost of stamina and their pick of the melee weapons (chainsword, powersword, poweraxe, or powerfist). Chaos assault units are outfitted with a bolter and melee weapon with 'the mark of Nurgle' which doubles your HP.\n\nAt the moment their is your choice of Space Marines or Chaos Space Marines. The devs are planning to bring Eldar into the mix soon and Orks will follow suit soon after.\n\nTo note; the free-to-WAAAAGH idea, Orks would have a free-to-play option with limited capabilities, was actually scrapped last year.\n\nPost-script; hitting a Predator tank with a charged fist attack and watching it fly thirty feet through the air to topple off a cliff is one of the best moments in gaming for me.","January 27","true","29.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It took me a little bit to find out which play style works best for me, so if you buy it and have a tough time on the battlefield, definitely spend a little time going over equipment loadouts and play around with all the different weapons and combat roles.\n\nAs a heads up on what to expect, watch out for chaos raptors and loyalist assault marines as melee focused classes can be devastating in this game and are often spammed by both sides. Also plan to make good use out of the rhino transport, as many people seem to undervalue/underuse it but it can make or break a game if used right.\n\nIf you are a fan of the 40k universe and like high intensity combat where life expectancy on the battlefield is about 90-120 seconds, then this is the game for you. I definitely recommend this game!","January 27","true","18.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Only with teamwork and by the Emperors grace will you prevail.\n\nI picked this game up just about a month ago and have been loving every minute of it. The plans for the future of this game are for it to be an MMO similar to that of Planetside 2 with 5 factions (Eldar, Space Marines, Chaos, Tyranids, and the Orks). Right now it is more akin to Battlefront (More so the older ones) or Battlefield. The modes are more like assaulting a “base” and capturing the points in order to increase your team’s tickets to the max before the time limit(While the enemy team tries to run down the time limit), capture points in no order, or have to sequentially capture points up until the last one.\n\n\n\nImmersion:\n\nPros:\nThis game is the embodiment of how 40k combat should feel, you feel like a space marine with the ability to slay foes like they are pests or be the cannon fodder.\n\nEverything in the game feels true to the 40k universe with the Exception of some names like "Traitor"(Which isn't a big deal, but poor wording for Chaos units).\n\nCorrect weapon characteristics such as Predators don't just fire once every 10 second like in DOW(It was an ability, but yea) and make use of the autocannon as it should be and plasma is extremely dangerous to both your target and yourself as it should be, beautifully modeled weaponry and characters.\n\nVoice acting is very good (However I do believe they said they are going to improve it further) .\n\nFive sub factions for each faction.

This makes it so you know what type of role you want.\n\nMelee weapons are different, chainsword is the fastest with the least damage, Power Sword is slower than the chainsword and does more damage, Power Axe is slower and more damaging than the Power Sword with the ability to break through a parry, as for the last one I am not sure if it is a part of the NDA or not at the moment so I will refrain from mentioning it. The Apothecary also has use of his Narthecium, however I have never used it for battle.\n\nTeamwork, it makes all the difference in the world. One of the few strategies I like to employ is grouping up with other players who have a Stormshield and use that to protect allies behind me. Coordination is key, if the team is spread out or trying to do their own thing than loss will surely follow.\n\nNeutral:\n\nVehicle handling needs improvement.\n\nMy performance is decent enough, I am hitting around 45-50 fps on average since the latest update. Hardware is a GTX 970, Intel I7 2600k, 1TB HDD, 16 GB RAM at 1600 MHz, and 1920x1080 monitor.\n\nCertain surfaces should not allow Raptors or Assault Marines to stand on.\n\nSome weapons need balancing.\n\nCons:\n\nStamina based melee system can be frustrating and does contain some bugs. Melee is still an enjoyable experience, but definitely needs work.\n\nCamera needs work indoors especially for Raptors and Assault Marines. It can feel cramped in certain areas.\n\nRaptor and Assault Marines can spam their ground pound too quickly creating a disarraying situation for all involved.\n\nCover mechanics are very similar to Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes and the Phantom Pain which is good, but they are not perfect and have difficulties with the camera sometimes.\n\n\n\nThis game is incredibly fun, in its current state there is enough content to keep one playing for many hours and to me the $50 price tag has been justified EA or not(I did get it for $40 during the Founder packs though). If you have any interest in large scale battles or Warhammer 40k I would advise you to take it into consideration. What it will become down the road will be quite amazing with the hopes of competing with Planetside 2.\n\nI will update this review as more updates come out, I missed something, or my general opinion changes. I hope I have helped and please give constructive criticism of my review, I don't do so often unless it is for certain games.

The Apothecary also has use of his Narthecium, however I have never used it for battle.\n\nTeamwork, it makes all the difference in the world. One of the few strategies I like to employ is grouping up with other players who have a Stormshield and use that to protect allies behind me. Coordination is key, if the team is spread out or trying to do their own thing than loss will surely follow.\n\nNeutral:\n\nVehicle handling needs improvement.\n\nMy performance is decent enough, I am hitting around 45-50 fps on average since the latest update. Hardware is a GTX 970, Intel I7 2600k, 1TB HDD, 16 GB RAM at 1600 MHz, and 1920x1080 monitor.\n\nCertain surfaces should not allow Raptors or Assault Marines to stand on.\n\nSome weapons need balancing.\n\nCons:\n\nStamina based melee system can be frustrating and does contain some bugs. Melee is still an enjoyable experience, but definitely needs work.\n\nCamera needs work indoors especially for Raptors and Assault Marines. It can feel cramped in certain areas.\n\nRaptor and Assault Marines can spam their ground pound too quickly creating a disarraying situation for all involved.\n\nCover mechanics are very similar to Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes and the Phantom Pain which is good, but they are not perfect and have difficulties with the camera sometimes.\n\n\n\nThis game is incredibly fun, in its current state there is enough content to keep one playing for many hours and to me the $50 price tag has been justified EA or not(I did get it for $40 during the Founder packs though). If you have any interest in large scale battles or Warhammer 40k I would advise you to take it into consideration. What it will become down the road will be quite amazing with the hopes of competing with Planetside 2.\n\nI will update this review as more updates come out, I missed something, or my general opinion changes. I hope I have helped and please give constructive criticism of my review, I don't do so often unless it is for certain games.

There are performance issues, jankiness, missing features, lag issues, and so on. So why am I still giving this a thumbs up? Because it shows promise. It's only in Alpha and yet I can sorta see the peices all falling into place. While I would strongly caution users to think if they really feel like spending money on a game that won't be finished for at least another year, I will say that I can seethis becoming the game it's meant to be eventually.\n\nAgain though, it is not there yet. At the moment there are only two factions, Chaos, and Loyalist Marines, playing in 16v16 battlefield maps. Physics is a bit wonky, and vehicles can be utterly uncooperative sometimes.\n\nLastly as to the obvious planetside comparison I'll just say this. Actual Multi-Crewed tanks.

I have been burned by many early access games before but not this one. First thing to get out of the way, it is an early access game so it is unpolished, what you get right out of the gate may not be alot but bear in mind that they update quite frequently. Combat is fun, not too many good third person tactical shooters out there anymore. The game is also fairly forgiving for new players. The biggest issue I saw when reading reviews was huge lag stemming from the Unreal 4 Engine. I expected my four year old PC to just crash and burn when loading this up but all I did was turn the graphics down a bit (for me it autoset the graphics to maximum, dont know if it does that to others) and it ran perfectly. However they are working on stabilizing the game so it runs better for those who do have lag so dont fear getting this game before the price goes up.\n\nLong story short, I highly recommend.\n\nDeath to the Corpse Emperor","January 27","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I only have 3.6 hours in so far, but as a Space Marine and quite a few matches later, Space Marines simply lose. I don't know why exactly, but I've won probably <10% of my matches (can easy count it on one hand).\n\nMore than a few mobacancer comments... because nothing draws new players quite like the worst parts of mobas!\n\nHowever, the biggest issue I have atm, is that the game is really just a melee game. I honestly don't understand why they have guns in the game atm, as sword beats gun every time. My last match, I was an apothecary (healer). Defending a point with 2 others, an enemy raptor (fast sword guy) flies in and melees one of my teammates down in one hit. Now, I've put a few rounds into him and proceed to rez the downed teammate while the other teammate is still firing into this raptor. The raptor one shots me, one shots the guy I JUST rezed, and then one shots the other teammate and proceeds to cap the point. Seriously, just  ignore guns. Want to snipe? No you don't because sword to the face, that's why! You can either 1 shot something and take almost no damage from ranged attacks, or you can BE one shot and still take the same amount of damage from ranged attacks.... That's basicly your choice right there.\n\nThe controls seem clunky. I hate the natural keybinding with a passion. It is alpha and I do think that with a little time, the controls can become a lot tighter, but right now it's kinda "meh" in the control department. I feel slow and heavy mostly because I'm fighting the controls more than anything else.\n\nGrenades, now, this is an annoying one for me. So, your a Space Marine.  A super soldier that can't for the life of him throw a grenade... You can casually toss it about 10 feet, but "throw" is an overstatement. I've had times when I couldn't throw it up to a walkway right above me. You can wield a sword (because why would you wield anything else?!) like it's nothing, but you throw a grenade like your a 2 year old with brittle bones (and that still might be too generous).\n\nNow, that's not to say the game doesn't have good parts so far. I like the audio for the most part (grenades going off could use some real improvement though). Most guns sound really good (even if they are worthless, you'll fall to a melee guy, but you'll sound awesome doing it!).\n\nThe level design is pretty good as well. There is a lot of nuance on some of the maps with enough chaos happening to keep everything interesting. There is no real area that seems campable/OP. I do think there are some areas with wasted space (areas that will probably never have anything happen in them) but I think the level design is overall pretty good. Every map feels unique and every part of the maps feels unique.\n\nThey nailed the Warhammer 40k feel as well. This is clearly a 40k game and that is one thing they absolutely had to nail and they did. The archetecture of buildings, the design of tanks, the feel of the guns, and the shouts of the PC's all represent 40k really well imo.\n\nI can really feel where the game wants to pull me in and consume my life, it just isn't quite there yet though. Give it some time, give it a few patches and the game could be an amazing "recommended" no-brainer. However, I can't really recommend a game on what "could be", only on what "is" and what this game "is" right now, is just too early.\n\nImo, if you want a really fun game, don't buy this, not yet anyway. IF however, you want to get into this to be an alpha tester and provide feedback, it's great. Just don't go in looking for a fun game, it's not there... yet.\n\nIn time, if the devs don't royally mess this game up, I have no doubt in my mind I'll change this "not recommended" into a "recommended". I will continue trying to play a bit here and there, as the game has tons of potential, till then. But right now, this game isn't worth $40. It is an alpha, which is perfectly fine, and if you do buy it, do go in knowing this is VERY much an alpha.","February 20","false","53.5"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","1"

Currently it's a lobby shooter so you get into 16 vs 16 matches where you fight over 4 points as defender/attacker. The devs state that they're making it a lobby shooter during beta so that they can refine the combat system before making it a open persistant world (I guess like Planetside 2). I personally think that this is a great idea, if the combat sucks then the shooter sucks and it's a flop.\n\nThere are some balancing issues but if you're a part of a beta, especially a alpha beta then you can expect it to have those kinds of issues. They seem to be updating the game on a weekly basis though and working on balancing which is nice.\n\nThere's reviews mentioning frame rate problems.. My friend plays on a laptop and had terrible frame rate which made me skeptical of playing, however I built my PC 3 years ago and was able to play it on max graphics with almost no clipping showing, so you can still play in 'decent' FPS but the game is far from optimized.\n\nI really hope that they add a grouping feature to make playing with friends easier, I'd be more up to test the game if I could team up with my buddy easier than Qing at the same time and leaving a few times until we get lucky.\n\nSo far however the game seems promising, it's exciting to think about how well it could turn out being.. fingers crossed.","February 14","true","9.3"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","0"

It allows bad players to spam their mouse buttons and be rewarded for it. The animation de-syncs from what is actually happening all the time so you try to play within their horrible melee system and still get killed because of it.

The current races available as of this review (26-01-16) are the Space Marines, and Chaos Space marines. Seeing as these races are similar in alot of ways, they were alot easier to implement than some of the other promised races (Eldar, Orks) But the other races will join us eventually!\n\nThe game currently is balanced heavily around being more of a shooter, with some very strong (although wonky at times) melee mechanics. Some things are going to be unbalanced, but that is the nature of developing a game, its easier for the developers to spot these things if people play the game and give helpful feedback, instead of just complaining something is "op". Being part of early access means you can help influence the games development by giving feedback, and in general just playing the game, as it gathers data for the developers to change things around if something's not quite right.\n\nThe game is going to be under heavy development, which means the game will change ALOT during its time in early access. So if somethings broken one day, it might be fixed the next, remember this.\n\nIf you're unsure about buying the game, please.. consider going to either youtube or twitch and watch gameplay from it. A good idea would also be to keep up with the streams that the developers put up every friday, to show off and give information of upcoming changes (http://www.twitch.tv/40kcrusade) or follow their youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxH-BQF2CRQV6lXTf41xEeg) where they post the Vods of the livestreams, as well as new trailers. Keep up with the community on the forums, (http://forum.eternalcrusade.com/) for new announcements and general discussion about the game, and the various guilds/factions that will be a part of the game.","January 26","true","279.4"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

Don't expect anything to be polished and bugless or you will be disappointed. If your PC is below awerage, you might have performance issues (check recommended specs!!!).\n\nHaving said that, I think Eternal Crusade is a lot of fun. There are 5 classes per faction with totally different playstyles. 2 of 5 classes are faction exclusive, so you really can feel the difference between the loyal space marines and chaos! Can't wait to see what Eldar and Orks will bring to the table... 8) As customary for 40k universe, melee combat plays a very important role. Add some psykers to the mix and you got yourself much more, than just Battlefield with 3rd person view.\n\nThe Dev team is very motivated and listens to community feedback.

Playing the game at the moment, while it is still horribly optimized (30 fps max) is so much fun and very engrossing. The developers have been listening to the community, and are slowly but surely making the game better with every passing day. While some players may not want to buy the game now, due to performance issues and game imbalance, I say that buying it in early access is a great way to show your support and hopefully turn this into the W40K Battle Fantasy all fans have been dreaming of.","January 26","true","1.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

The game has gone under a lot of optimization, and runs at a solid 40-50fps on a Core 2 Duo, GTX750ti and 4gb of RAM on my end; This being at max settings at 1080p. On top of that, the game looks great, and feels like you're in the grim, dark future of the 41st millennium; With the exception of some of the maps which can be quite dull, but this game is in ALPHA. It is to be expected.\nIn my opinion, it reminds me a lot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine and Planetside 2.\nBy no means is this any twitch shooter, because you are shooting at nigh inhuman Space Marines adorning Power Armour, plated with adamantium - Or you will fight the Space Marines' sworn enemies, the Chaos Space Marines; Traitors that broke their oath to the Emperor during the Horus Heresy, or after. You will have to keep your aim true and steady as a Battle Brother would - because it will take many shots to down your foe, with the exception of the OP plasma weapons, which I'm sure are going to be balanced soon enough, as this game is in Alpha. Even then, being the 40k nerd I am, I don't find it frustrating, as superheated bolts of Plasma in the 40k universe will almost surely tear through anything short of a bloody Tank.\nThe only true gripes I have with this game are that there are no Salamanders. (Which I'm sure will be fixed later on..) and that the Graphical options have a slider instead of actual options. But again, everything is subject to change and the Devs are very good at updating the game, and will livestream every week or so to update you on new features or things that have been fixed pertaining to gameplay, performance, etc.\nThis makes me ever more excited for the coming introduction to the PVE elements of the game, which I'm dying to try out.\nDo yourself a favour, and purchase this game and become a founder - It truly has the potential to become something great - maybe even better than Planetside 2 ever was, and with a Warhammer twist.","May 2","true","1.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Definitely.\n\nIs it fun to play? Hell yeah.\n\nDoes it have bugs, missing content, lags and its non-optimized? Yep, here also.\n\nSo why do you saying yes? Because there is ton of fun in this game and if you understand that game is under development and it's still in alpha, it's in great state (trust me, I'm working in development for ten years).\n\nSo you are recommending it? Of course, if you understand what under development mean, you are fine that lot's of content will be add later, you have solid PC (you know, not optimized yet, but hey, I'm playing on notebook), and stable connection (reading some reviews it look like they are plying on WiFi, seriously, don't play on WiFi), you are good to take this funny game, where you can shoot loyalist/traitors (depends on you preference) and enjoy yourself.

I bind it to "Q" and I have no problem with sheild bro (Melee Space Marine with shield) anymore. Just when I see he is going to attack I will look at him, press "Q" and then kill him with quick attack (sometimes you have to repeat it twice).

Something that every 40k fan is waiting since... ever. But should you buy it right now? Questionable.\nIf you're a fan, you'll probably want to support the development, so do as you wish, but if you're not, i'm sure you wouldn't mind to wait a few months. This is Early Alpha. Bugged, still early on development, really early. I'm not going to give a thumbs down cause the game is fun and will probably be a masterpiece, in the future, but right now has really little content to be released on Steam. Personally i'd have waited 6 more months of development, or at least until the orks introduction and a better overall experience.\n\nKeep in mind a few more things:\n\n- The game right now has a "small" deathmatch mode on smaller maps. One day they will form a huge continent for thousands of players. There will be a slow progression from arenas to open world, with increasing population per map.\n- Right now there are only Space Marines and Chaos Marines. Eldars and Orks are planned. Tyranids are controlled by the IA. (PvPvPvPvE)\n- Orks will be Free to Play, to simulate the WAAAAAARGH lore.\n- If you're not used to the 40k lore, be ashamed of yourself (seriously though, give a look on the official w40k wiki, you will be amazed).\n- If the game succeed, Tau, Necron and Imperial Guard are considered as next factions.\n- Every faction has multiple chapters/whatever it's called.","January 26","true","60.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

EC is like if Space Marine and Battlefield had some super awesome love child. You have the third person combat style of Space Marine matched up with the large player vs player system that Battlefield is known for. You are able to play different customizable classes, take control points and use vehicles much like battlefield but coated in Warhammer 40k flavored goodness. If you are a 40k fan I would recommend buying the game now and saving some money as you'll just end up getting the itch and buying it later anyhow. IF you are NOT a 40k fan then I say either sit back and see how it develops as it is still in Alpha. Now if you are the type of person that enjoys putting in their two cents and helping a game along and are willing to part with the cash then again I suggest buying it. As I've seen so far the developers are very intune with the community and listen/read all the input that the founders have been passing their way. I do not feel this game is a money grab that soooo many that get put on steam are. I was not in favor of this early release to steam in the state of the game at this time but alsp must say I'm more than pleased with what I've seen so far and am looking forward to further development of EC and will remain a part of the Founder community.","January 30","true","94.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamPool/recommended/375230/","IamPool","Pool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamPool/","168 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEternal Crusade is still in early alpha, and I'm keeping this in mind as I write this.\n\nIn short; I recommend this game. It plays much like Warhammer 40k: Space Marine, without the ridiculous grenade launcher and is hosted on dedicated servers. Once the MMO aspect launches, I have high hopes that it'll be the game that Planetside eventually stopped being.\n\nIn actual explanation:\n\nEternal Crusade offers gameplay for Space Marines, Chaos Warbands, Eldar and Orks. Eldar are about to be released and Orks have been mocapped and are being worked on. Units are well rounded, from Tactical, to Devastators, to Assaults, to Apothecaries and to Ground Assaults, and their chaos counterparts, the Traitor Assault getting the Mark of Nurgle instead of getting a shield, and the Apothecaries getting replaced with Sorcerers with powers both capable of healing at a distance and inflicting enemy units with the plague.\n\nI personally like the balance of each class. Tacticals/Traitors are the most versatile with their loadouts, going from good ranged combat with the stalker bolter and the normal bolter, to good close quarter combat with the storm bolter and the melta, to good support use, such as flushing people out of cover with plasma rifles, or bombing Traitor Assaults and Ground Assaults away.\n\nDevastators/Havocs are support based with the heavy bolter that turns everything into ribbons at point blank, and is capable of providing a suppressing effect at a distance that makes the enemy's crosshairs bloom wide open for as long as they're being shot at directly. Alongside the heavy bolter is the heavy melta, which can roast infantry in but a few seconds in close quarters and set vehicles alight, as well as the plasma cannon, which can be overcharged and shot into a heavily armored target, infantry, vehicle, or turret, and providing devastating effects. Lastly, there is the Las Cannon, which requires a few moments to lock onto a target, but does a great deal of damage to vehicles and turrets.\n\nThe most important part, is that they all carry weapons that counter vehicles, and can blanket the 'vehicle spam' problem that Planetside 2 had.\n\nAssaults/Raptors attack from the air with a variety of melee weapons ranging from fast swinging to slow but impactful, making ample use of aerial diving their targets to discombobulate a Devastator nest, or a heavily defended point, providing surprise and shock where the Ground Assault/Traitor Assault provides only survivability while under fire of more than two to three guns at a time, and is capable of escaping after the deed is done.\n\nApothecaries/Sorcerers are armed a little differently, Chain Sword or Bolter for Apothecary, and Power Sword for the Sorcerer, they both are capable of inflicting and healing damage. The difference that sets them apart is that the Apothecary has to run up to the wounded to deploy a quick-reviving heal that restores them to full, while the Sorcerer can heal a target over an impressive distance over time, keeping them out of harm's way whilst doing their doctoring. Apothecaries can use their wrist device to poison the enemy, while the Sorcerer can inflict the plague on a target from a distance, capable of increasing the potency of it for each second the target is under its effect.\n\nGround Assaults/Traitor Assaults attack by land, as opposed to jump packs worn by Assaults/Raptors. Ground Assaults get a Shield that they can hold up to enemy fire which drains their stamina instead of their health, while Traitor Assaults are given the Mark of Nurgle, doubling their health and allowing them to carry a pistol in their off hand instead of their shield. They are 'the' vanguard of any point push, bullet sponges that last long enough for the enemy to pour in and shoot those curently set up to defend the point.\n\nWhile the MMO aspect is unfinished, there are deathmatch-esque maps large enough for vehicle warfare, with varying degrees of range that play well into the different weapons, from stalker bolters, to heavy bolters, to storm bolters and so on, so forth. Little is beyond these maps besides capturing and holding objectives, but it's certainly entertaining.\n\nChapters, Warbands, Craft Worlds and Ork Clans can be chosen between, and upon the full game, war gear will allow you to kit and decorate your character as you see fit.\n\nFor competitive players, you may find that the TTK isn't fast enough to keep the pace that is normally eye-catching at tournaments unless you're in close quarters hip-firing a heavy bolter, a storm bolter or using a melee weapon. I personally believe that the slowed TTK provides a different type of skill, where you have to consider how best to engage your targets, and promotes the usage of headshots.\n\nWith all of the good things I have to say for the game, I unfortunately have my gripes with it. The engine is still under heavy development, and doesn't run as smooth as other polished titles. I get about 60 frames with occasional hitching whilst on a 660 TI boost, a i5 3.4 quad core, 8 gigs of memory and on windows 7, but I have to run it at its absolute lowest graphical setting, and the UI scaled down to its smallest point.\n\nOn their 'Fortress' map, I find that they have too many turrets on the defending side, capable of obliterating infantry and vehicles alike under continued firing.\n\nMelee is clunky. Playable clunky, as power attacks overwhelm defensive bashes, defensive bashes stop fast attacks, and fast attacks interrupt the wind-up of a power attack, with easy access to breach their defenses by attacking them while their back is turned, but still clunky.\n\nThis game will be free to WAAAAGH once it comes out, where you can play the entire game for free, but only as an Ork, and you have to buy the base game to play anything else. I think it's worth the buy, if you're a fan of the WH40K setting or if you have little better to do.","May 22","true","45.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Gameplay elements, from character customization to core combat, are still being adjusted.  If you want a 40k MMO, give it a few months before you buy(posted in January of '16)- the current game build is a Space Marine-style lobby shooter with no PvE, but that is scheduled to change.

The game will feature large environments in which these different factions will do battle upon wheither it be in the name of the emperor or simply in the name of more dakka.\n\nThat’s what this game is hoping to be but in its current state it is none of that currently there are only 2 factions which feel mostly similar (apart from a few things but more on that later) fighting in a conquest mode with 16v16. The current game is only combat and that is it no open world, story or PVE currently implemented. The pvp is quite fun even thought at the time of this review there is no progression the classes feel a bit similar but different enough not to make it an issue. There are 2 forms of infantry combat currently ranged and melee. Ranged work well enough and as you expect you point gun press the left mouse button and things tend to die. The normal bolter feels quite meaty and fun to fire which is good. The melee however currently is too strong in my opinion especially for chaos due to their traitoris assaults being able to eat a grenade to the face at full life and a lot of bolter fire. The melee is too good but this can easily be fixed with some stats and weapon balances. Now the vehicles they control like a drunk elephant, are built like paper Mache and their weapons might as well fire cold ♥♥♥♥ for all the damage they do. The game at its current state is only worthwhile if you are a Warhammer 40k fan and do not let the fact that it is an alpha is wade you from criticizing or avoiding the game I got a lot of people saying that it’s only an alpha and you shouldn’t expect it to be mazing but regardless it is still a product and costs £31.99 which is with a discount. If you are sceptical wait until the full game releases and play the free to waaagh edtion ( EDIT The free to play version may be cancelled so take this with a grain of salt and instead reaseach the game alot to see if its something you like) which gives you one character slot and lets you play as the orks. On the technacial side the game with the newest update has improved from the past but the crashing has become way more prevelant but I’m enjoying it and can give it a recommendation to people like myself who like Warhammer 40k.","May 28","true","27.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Since 2013\n\nHow Long have I been an official moderator? Oct 16, 2013\n\nHow Much do I know about this game?  All my youtube game play and reviews of the game patches.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOircMrBjvxdexLlSj5-doOFOClKdOB5d.\n\nHow much info have I gathered? About 10 pages worth of updates since SEP 2013 when we could play the game.\nhttp://forum.eternalcrusade.com/threads/upcoming-planned-changes-unofficial.47362/page-8#post-983879\n\nIs the game fully funded? Yes. Any new players only add to the speed of content introduced. Any new players increase the possible amount of content to add.\n\nWithout making this a journal I am going to give it you quick with a block a text following\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe game is in Alpha. It is tons of fun but it is not perfect.\nAlmost every week since September we have received a patch adding a new weapon, lighting, gfx....you name it\nEvery stated goal by Nathan has come to fruition. He has not said nor sold us on words. He has brought action to his promises.\nThe devs are constantly posting. They explain in detail why they made a change or the direction they are heading.\nThe goal of the game is recreate the feeling of being an WH40k soldier (ORK,SM,CSM,Eldar)\nThe scope of the game is to make a planet-wide conflict with multiple PVP objectives, PVE objectives and Campaigns. https://www.eternalcrusade.com/news/480-State-Of-The-Crusade-IV\n\n\nLong Part\n\nThe game is now run by Nathan Richardsson. He has formerly worked on EVE, Dust and other LARGE, MMO type games. ALL have been successful by many metrics. Please be aware that since his addition every single goal that has been stated has been reached. (items, classes, races, factions, tyranids, maps..etc) Are the goals gigantic? Yes. It is impossible? Not with the progress we have seen. Is it fun? YES!!\n\nBy any measure so far (surveys, reviews, YouTube Videos…) the game is accomplishing its goals. With the amount of failed games given the title Early Access we gamers are already prepared for the worst. I am not saying this untrue. It is a valid concern. I want to give you a current review which I will update as needed.\n\n1. The game is FUN!\n2.  The game has 2 factions right now SM and CSM. (Ork and Eldar later)\n3. The game is map based as they test out mechanics, lag, optimizations, GFX etc.\n4. Every new map that has been added is bigger, taller, wider or has an interesting feature.\n5. The 1st iteration of the loadout system came out Jan 21 2016. There have been dozens of additions to weapons, items combinations …ETC\nTo quote another member, “The developers themselves do weekly patches to address these issues, they supply us with a weekly production updates via Twitch where we can see all the new features that will be coming, and they listen to people's concerns and make sure they answer the questions people put towards them about game features and the game's future. For us who have been following this game, we know that once the game is released it will receive FREE expansions periodically (every three months) that will give players new content and abilities. The first expansion planned will add Terminators into the game!”\n\n\nThe game has left me only wanting for more. I will be completely convinced they have done the universe justice when they add in the Xenos Factions (properly). To me that will be the test to determine the future of this game.\nI could go on and on. I have been following the game with all its ups and downs for years now. Management changes, devs leaving, doubts on the publisher and how they plan to generate income. I am normally a fickle gamer and person so anything that leaves me lacking in confidence and usually I drop the game instantly.\nIf you have any questions I am MOD here in steam and on the official forums\nhttp://forum.eternalcrusade.com/members/gorilla.81/\n\nIf you think I’ve helped you decide to buy the game from my review, you can use my referral code (4000 free extra Rogue Trader points for both you and me): EC-ULA1Q6C1USBP0\n\nORKS FOREVER!!\nWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\n","January 26","true","65.1"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","44","11","25","5","0"

I cannot take this game seriously and I have very little belief that Behaviour Interactive will produce the products which you desire without stealing more money out of your wallet. There are so many problems wrong with this game, still, that it will drive you insane, ecspecially if you are a beginner. I will give credit where credit is due, the graphics and customization are b-e-a-utiful and i'm pretty sure Behaviour Interactive will be able to make this game everything you will want it to be in the coming future. And the fact that Behaviour's combined developement/community efforts in performing livestreams of updated material every Friday is a huge plus. But I can't stand when a company tries to sell a half-a** product and won't acknowledge when balance in a game is terrible. 1) This game is HORRIBLE about placing you into an already completed matches that puts a 1 under your "L" column, if you care about the stats side of the game. 2) I don't know who thought the maps that were developed were good enough to play on, but two-thirds of the playable maps are pure spawn traps. 3) There is hardly zero balance to the ranged/close combat system in this game. 4) If you are a founder (like me, unfortunately) then there has been ZERO effort to get you your "in-game cosmetic gear" from the Rogue Trader store in Eternal Crusade. How long has this game been in developement? And I can't even use my Rogue Trader points yet!? I cannot have fun playing this game. All the developers had to do was copy/paste everything from Space Marine (the video game) and then add all the "swagtastic" things we would throw our money at.

It is so frustrating, not to mention sickness inducing because it is a fast paced game with a console field of view.  You swing the camera around at high speed constantly simply because you have to in order to see what is going on.  Console field of view is always terrible but this felt like one of the worst examples.\n\nNo idea if the graphics will be fixed, they are incredibly basic.  This could be addressed but given that it is clearly designed for another platform. I am skeptical. It would have a long way to go.\n\nOutide of this, it doesnt feel like I would expect a warhammer game to feel in any way.  Spawn and spam.  Not fun. Melee is an afterthought and is a one button one move spam.   Like spamming a knife in BF4 only far uglier and because of the field of view you cant see anything besides what your looking right at.  It also never feels like it connects even when it does.\n\nFeels like a reskin of some much old arena based shooter.\n\nTiny map area.\n\nNothing tactical about it and the "marines" are dull and have no character.  The weapons feel uninspiring and like nothing ever really connects.\n\nYou cant see the server your connecting too. Its always auto at the moment so you have no idea what your ping is.  This makes for odd experiences mid game at times.\n\nVery strongly would not recommend buying this unless it becomes something other than a terrible port of a badly designed game.","January 26","false","1.8"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

I am a supporter for this game even since it was a concept - buying into it since day 1. I want this game to succeed epically, but I must judge it on its price and current state - there is no "but it'll be better later on" nonsense. I DO encourage people to support this game if they are passionate for its possible future - but don't dilude your views with it. So understand that my views are incredibly fanboy because I was sold on the Planetside 2-Style combat but in 40k. As such, I judge it on that merit; the merit of which I was sold on for the game.\n\nRight now the game is not worth its price tag. It is currently 40-50$ for what summarizes as a shallow FPS multiplayer experience. The Framerate slogs through mud more often than naught, and the game requires significant balancing. Combat is floaty and nothing feels as good of a success that it should (melee sounds like your hitting a tink can with a stick, shooting feels whimsy on successful shots, blowing up vehicles doesn't have the significant intensity, etc.).\n\nHowever, I encourage people to support this game. It has a great amount of potential, of which the Dev's are working on. The community is much better than other game's I've seen, and server connection is sufficient to support everyone (currently). This game should still be worth the money in the month's to come - only if the Dev's kick it into high-gear and start introducing some significant amounts of content.\n\nThat being said, I still hope they get rid of certain mechanics (Stamina bar, Charged Melee Attacks, etc.) because they simply disorganize a balanced system. What should be an easy Rock-Paper-Scissors-ish formula is diluted by mechanics that (REALLY) don't need to be there to begin with.","January 27","false","29.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Overall it is already a great game but the best thing is the huge potential that it has. For me what sold me the game was the fact that finally there were going to be playable Eldar in a FPS/TPS version of this universe! And I'm such a big fan of this race that I couldn't let the opportunity to support this game escape. It's true, it has been long a time without any Eldar in the game but they are certainly close to being released! And how do I know that?\nBecause the devs that are making this game are so awesome that they do streams every Friday, showing new content and things they have been working on.\n\nExpect to see some bugs in the game right now, since it is in alpha stage, although in my opinion they don´t make it unplayable at all, and also it is likely that many of the Cons here are going to be fixed by the time the game launches.\n\nPros, Cons and my general perspective of the game:\nFor example the camera angle sometimes can be a bit weird when you are in cover and trying to rotate, and also the crosshair occasionally decides to not stay in the center of the screen, but that’s certainly something they are working on. And I can say that because, in one the many updates that this game has had, they fixed that issue on the vehicles crosshair, so it no longer runs away from the center when using vehicles turrets.\n\nI agree with the fact that this game shouldn’t have a jump button, because that would lead to bunny hopping marines, which doesn´t really fit the universe, and it would break the immersion. Despite liking the no implementation of the jump mechanic, it can create some problems when facing terrain elevations (even slightly elevations). To counter this problem the developers introduced in the game some mechanics like “Vault” or “Climb” which are great but in my opinion should be expanded to more situations.\n\nAbout the vehicles, I think they did a pretty good job in the design of them, they work great but there’s a situation where they can be used to spawn camp, which should be taken in count by the devs. Besides the spawn camping created with the vehicles, it isn´t that easy to spawn camp as infantry because there are multiple spawn points across the maps, so if an area is being attacked you won´t spawn right there, but around that area which is great. There are some areas where the tanks shouldn´t be allowed to go and in the maps there are some anti-tank fortications, but they can usually go over them. This is also being fixed because recently, in one of the updates they tweaked the vehicles so they won´t roll as much and are more stable. Of course it isn´t perfect yet but nothing is perfect in an alpha, and they are certainly in the right direction.\n\nThe design of the maps, the space marines and chaos models, the architecture of the buildings are all great in this game, which is also very positive when playing a fantasy universe, because it is very immersive. I’m hoping that this will also apply to the Eldar and of course the Orks and Tyranids as well, when they join in. The fact that they are working with Games Workshop is great because they make sure that everything looks and works as intended.\n\nThere are some minor balancing issues with the game now, but that’s much more subjective, because what some think is OP others think it is useless. What I mean with this is that the game will never be balanced until all the key features are in. Right now it may be balanced but every time they add something, like a new gun, a new race… it will create some balancing issues, which have to be fixed.\n\nAbout the performance, yeah you need a beast to run this game properly right now. I’ll give you my example. I have a R9 390 GPU and an Intel i5-6600k processor. Now, most of the maps I play I have an average of 40-50 FPS with max settings at 1080p, but when you go to Torias, which is one of the 4 maps available right now (soon 5 with the Fortress), your FPS drop a lot (I reached a minimum of 18 FPS in that map), but this map is really big and has rain, also it isn´t very optimised, in fact the game is not optimized yet.\n\nMy only concern about the game is turning into a MMO, because right now it has battles of 16vs16 and you get this kind of performance. When they tried to add more players to the maps the FPS dropped quite a bit. This is also the first time I’m actually playing an Alpha of what’s going to be a MMO, so it may be normal I don´t know. Soon with the introduction of the new Fortress map, we will be able to tell if it gets worse since it’s going to be 30vs30 battles in this map.\n\nTo conclude this review, I totally recommend this game mainly for 40k fans, even if you can´t run the game right now, you will possibly be able to run it later when it is optimized, so you might as well buy right now and get the benefits. For people who are not sure if they like the direction that the game is taking, I recommend waiting to see how it goes, because according to the developers the game is funded anyway. It is after all a game in alpha stage, so there’s still so much to come, and the idea behind it is awesome. The developers are also very open to the community and they are absolutely listening to us, in order to make this game the best Warhammer 40k out there.\n\nIf you liked my review and considered it helpful, make sure to use my code when creating an account for the game.\nReferral Code: EC-FH537JT08M8VJ With this code you get free 4000 RTP (credits to spend in the future store).","March 5","true","183.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","38","5","13","6","0"

The game is good/ok (depending on your standards) to look at, it's very poorly optimized and the gameplay is pretty bad, if you're expecting thq's space marine level of quality when it comes to combat you'll be disappointed. The dev's team enthusiasm is commendable, but enthusiasm alone doesn't make great games, and this for now is far from great. As i said, wait for release and see if they can deliver because they talk and promise a lot, but so far i have zero faith in the project.\n\nI had 150 or so euros invested in this with a founder pack, but asked for a refund sometime in 2015 and it honestly felt like one of the best decisions of the year. My advice, play Planetside 2 if you want this game type while you wait for this, don't give them any money for now.\n\nDon't get fooled by the large amount of positive reviews, the vast majority of people in alpha and early access are 40k fanboys with little to no previous gaming experience, and trying to have discussions with them on the testers forums is like talking to brick walls because literally everything for them is great as long as it has a 40k skin on it and they can't be objective about the game itself.","January 26","false","4.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

And melee combat is kinda skinny. It's glitchy, got stuck in my oponent once, also got stuck when rolling away etc. etc. Few maps, few modes in general, this game is a real Early Access, I'd say it should cost around 25 euros at its current state.

Melee classes are dominating battlefield and all they have to do is spam light attack to win. All it takes to kill you with melee is 3-4 light strikes with Chainsword (takes not even 2 seconds), meanwhile you have to empty half of your magazine into them to kill them. Also, melee system works on rock-paper-scissors system, so all you have to do against non-melee class is spam and after cca. 4 hits you will brake their defence and spam them to death. Same can be used against melee classes, but not so efficiently. And did I mention that there is auto aim? Yes, there is auto aim for melee and pistol, so all what melee class has to do, is to look at you, hold aim button and spam and wherever you go, he will automaticaly turn. And if you manage to get out of his reach, he can finish you with auto aim pistol.\n\nSo, to wrap this up. Melee is king, if you are non-melee class and you meet melee class and no one helps you, you are dead.\nThey don't have to turn with you, because they have auto aim, all your evasive actions are useless.\nThey don't have to use any strategy in melee, all they have to do is spam light attack and roll around to avoid attacks.\n\nAll of thic could be easily fixed and this would be awesome game, but because devs are lazy to implement working and balanced melee system, game is almost unplayable, when you get squad of melee noobs against you. If you don't mind being recked by every spammer you come across go ahead and buy the game, you might have fun. But if you want balanced game, where one class isn't dominating other, this game is not for you.","May 17","false","10.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

It's in early access so don't be a goober and post hate when it's not even done yet. I wouldn't recommend getting it if you have an old computer like mine because developers have to optimize stuff at the end of making games.\n\nThe best part it is the developers themselves, if you need any help deciding these reviews are good but watching their twitches and how much they cared for and developed the game over the years is the best way to know for sure!! ♥\n\nAs far as the gameplay I've experienced it has suppression, a melee combat system, the jump jet pack things, vehicles, power fisting (and all the inappropiate jokes =p), healing, controlling points, customization, executions, chainsaw swords, Loyalist and Chaos Marines, and very good ingame graphics.\n\nWhat's to come is Eldar (clearly superior, /hairflip), Orks (comical space barbarians), other factions via expansions, open world, loot, fighting tyrannids (the space locusts) and maybe more for pve and loads of maps.\n\nI'm most excited for the potential for a left for dead style of X faction vs tyrannids and the Devs hinted the tyrannids may be playable in this mode.\n\nAlso my referral code is EC-Z4PVOTHOSOUB5 if you want free stuff via the store.

Lag. Lag. FPS and Server Lag. Though they'll fix that in the time to come so there isn't much issue to that it's still bearable. The game is much like Space Marine and it's fun. Usually when you go in solo you'd be bored because most of the time (at least the time I spent) was with unenthusiastic players with no sense of roleplay or tactics in mind. Even when in a squad you run like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥s around the battlefield. I know it has freedom but the whole points was made so you work together as a team.\n\nUsually another clan wrecks the ♥♥♥♥ out of you because most players can't be arsed to use mic chat and don't know team play.\n\nPeople who are being salty about balance just need to get good. Read a guide or two it's written for you to help you. You have community forums to eve help you with something.\n\nThe game in it's current state of writing is somewhat acceptable even though the random disconnections and complete freezing of the game get annoying (I have mid specs for this) and play on lowest quality with minimal issue.\n\nAnother thing I dislike is the whole Founders get faster access to things and Early Access get squat.\nI checked the Founders Packages which were waayyyyy back before Early Access and now everyone who has Founders (similar pricing) with Early Access can play Eldars or access contents which we plebs cannot access because "HURR YOU DINDU SUPPORT THE GAMM ON TIM"\n\nDevs pls.","May 29","true","20.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

This game is still an alpha and if you are going to spend money on it you need to be willing to put up with the crap that entails. There have been multiple phases where the game is virtually unplayable due to crashes from poor optimization. That being said it is still a fairly fun 3rd person shooter. Do not let idiots who are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about balance dissuade you from this game. When pressed it is easy to tell most of the most vocal complainers only play one faction and do not understand the advantages/disadvantages to their opposition.

Yes and No. But read closely as to why:\n\nFirst, this game is Early Alpha at best, with limited weapon and tank choices, only 2 factions (excluding 'sub-factions' which at this time are very minor cosmetic changes), small and limited maps and many bugs from crashing (I have not experienced this) to missing textures (literally missing grates inside of pipes, I even have a screenshot), this game is obviously only barely at the point of being playable and has not laid out any more than the bare basics of a game it wants to be. As is, this game is a solid 5/10 for gameplay but not worth 40$ (maybe 15 as is).\n\nHowever! It must be said, if promises are to be believed, and gameplay stays roughly as it is now (promised to be much more fleshed out and balanced in the future) with much bigger battles, better customization, larger maps and way more everything (Orks, Eldar, actual differences in sub-factions whether they be mostly cosmetic or not) with smoother gunplay and melee combat this came could be the real Warhammer deal! Well worth the money now with the promise of a grand future!\n\nBUT!! I for one have NEVER believed the promises of others and solely look upon their actions, beyond the promises and roadways they chart. And so far... I see a warhammer game I could be proud of *FUTURE TENSE*. Being a huge fan of Warhammer 40k (and many things similar to it, and it to) I feel this game is worth the price of admission as of right now due to what they could put out in the future. As well, I actually like the feel of the gameplay as it is now and feel it can be improved upon. This developer hasn't dug themselves a hole to crawl in to, they actually seem to care (excluding GW's um... Reputation).\n\nIf you want a game right now to play, this is a 16v16 player battlefield-like (many people killing over few objectives, all capture based) mixed with Gears of War 1 control-style (cover, rolling, heavy feel of foot and gun) and Warhammer 40k textured game will not be worth the 40$ to anyone but a solid fan of Third-Person Shooter with Massive Multiplayer.\nAnd for a solid Warhammer 40k piece in the future? Yep, it is worth the 40$ IF IT DELIVERS.\n\nIt's a possibility that this game could tank straight out of the gate, or steam on it's tracks to deliver a great experience. Only time will tell, and I for one DO recommend for anyone that like Warhammer 40k Shooters.","February 20","true","24.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This review will be updated as development progresses.\n\nI hate to mention bugs because it is in an alpha state and you are effectively paying for the privilege of being a bugtester, but buyer beware, it is -very- alpha right now. I will not complain about the lack of optimization either, but be aware I run a Titan X, with an Overclocked I7 4790k, with 32 GB of DDR4 Ram and I still get chugs in my framerate from time to time.\n\nWhat I wish to dedicate the bulk of this review to is the generous amount of baffling and simply god-awful design decisions that have gone into this game, but before I get into that let's take a minute and talk about the positives.\n\nArt/Audio - The emperor would be very pleased with the art direction of the game, the marines look excellent. Without a doubt someone involved in the hobby did the design work on the art of both the characters and the world, and you cerainly feel like you're stepping into the grim darkness of the 41st millenium. Bolters sound like bolters, evergy weapons sound like energy weapons and the rumble of a tanks engine approaching is unmistakeable. The voices are basic, but the lines are thematic, and delivered well, if a little repetitive. The devs need to either add a lot (and I mean a whole lot) of new lines or have the character not deliver 1 of the same 3 speeches every time they spawn. In addition, chosing a space marine and chaos space marine chapter who both wear red was possibly the worst art decision ever made in a game, the two are virtually impossible to tell apart in a firefight or melee, especially with multiple characters on screen at once, however this is more of an interface peoblem, as unless you keep your finger glued to the "q" key, the game gives you no indication of who is on who's side.\n\nKudos to the artists and art direction aside, it's time to get into the meat of the review. It's obvious that someone on the dev team played Space Marine and Planetside 2 on the same day and had, praise the emperor, the great idea to combine the two. Unfortunately this man's mind mind was immediately corrupted by chaos as he or she seems to have taken the worst parts from each, hopefully his most holy inquisition, along with the forces of the Mechanicus, can purge the system of this heresy before the final product is released.\n\nMaps - Fire your map designer. Not the guy who did the art, but the person who actually designed layout of the maps, fire this person now. This is not a joke, whomever thought up this flustercluck should never be involved in creating maps for any kind of game ever. The maps, whle great looking, represent some basic mapping 101 problems that were woked out sometime around when .wad was the standard format for a map in a multiplayer game. Some examples include:\n- No set spawn areas, slecting point D to spawn at will spawn you somewhere within a 150m radius of point D, often within 20 meters of point A, B, or C, which is especially amusing when those points are currently held by the enemy.\n- No cover at spawn points, unless you happen to spawn in it, you can literally be killed before your character finishes loading in.\n- One of the maps features a heavy gun turret (emplaced on the map, not moveable) which can fire into the attackers spawn point, not a captured spawn point, but their main spawn point. I mowed down about 8 people before I realized what I was doing and spammed an apology message. I would never have comitted such an act of heresy knowingly, I had no idea someone would possibly design a map that way, I thought they were just foolishly running into the field of fire.\n- Due to grenades apparantly operating in a 2 dimensional plane, 2 competant people with plasma weapons can hold any point with ease by standing on boxes and corner camping.\n- Speaking of which, since the release of this alpha, Khorne has changed his name to "Khorn'ar Kamp'r" and has since surpassed all other chaos gods in power.\n- Parking your Rhino (which serves as a spawn point) on top of the enemy spawn point is not only allowed, but encouraged by the map designers, on one map, it is the only viable way to take point C.\n- Main spawns, which should be safe, are so far from the battlefield that if you elect to spawn in one you will not make it to the point you are trying to defend before the enemy captures it, which gives you the choice of likely dying immediately upon spawn, or consigning yourself to walking to a battle you likely already have lost.\n- Several of the main spawns, which thankfully the enemy cannot park their rhino on, are in the line of fire of heavy weapon emplacements, or even better, have sniper nests set up aiming at them. Yes the designer actually put sniper nests in a spot where the only place they can aim into is the the enemy spawn. Thats some great map work there Lou.\n\nCombat\n- Yes someone thought it was a good idea to include stunlock into a 3rd person Action/Shooty MMO. No I don't understand it either. Rumor has it the techpriests of mars have an inkling, but the whole truth was lost in the dark age of technology.\n- If you pick a melee class, you cannot shoot (actually one option allows a bolt pistol, which takes more than an entire clip of ammunition to score a kill).\n- If you pick a shooty class, you will not be able to melee to save your live, unless you sneak up on someone, in which case you can potentially put them in stunlock with melee untill they die\n- Due to a shortage of bolt rounds, the Adeptus Mechanicus has replaced all ammunition for small arms with nerf rounds.\n- Yes this means it takes 3-5 headshots to kill with a stalker bolter, no this is not an exageration\n- Mathematically inclined veteran players of WH40k are aware that at scale, the Space marines bolt weapons would only be accurate to +/- 20 meters when scaled up to real life. The gave devs looked at that and decided this was far to large of a number\n- Plasma Cannons (explosve anti-vehicle) weapons have greater precision and effective range than sniper weapons\n- While anti-vehicle weapons are excellent at destroying troops, they are nearly useless at destroying vehicles. It takes 3 entire overheat/cooldown cycles from an emplaced anti vehicle weapon hiting a vehicle dead centre to destroy it, by which point the next one is read to spawn.\n- You can execute fallen enemies, preventing medics or teammates from returning them to the fray and forcing a respawn. In the game "Space Marine" this granted you a cool scene, invincibility frames and bonus health, in Eternal crusade it paints a giant target on your head, plays one of 3 boring animations, and accomplishes nothing that knifing or shooting your downed opponent cannot\n- Respawn timing seems to be random, ranging from 1-20 second when you bleed out, meaning that if you are lucky, you can make it from your "safe" spawn back to the fight just in time to see the enemy capture the point.\n- Class balance is as follows: Space marines are death dealing engines of destruction, laying waste to everything in their path, soaking up bullets like a sponge does water, and slaying their foes with mighty blows of their weapons or blasts of heavy ordinance. Except the tactical marine, who can, if he is lucky, score a kill by emptying an entire clip into his foe, praying to the emperor that he doesn't run out of ammo before his foe spits him like a pig in a single blow.\n- The tactical marine is the only marine who can capture points\n- The entire game is based around capturing points\n\nTL:DR - This game is heresy! *BLAM*","February 11","false","7.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

It does have it's kinks, but that's natural for an early access game. I'm a huge fan of the 40k universe and I feel like this game does a very good job of representing that universe. While I see alot of people complain about melee combat being broken, I find that once you get it figured out, it's one of the best melee systems I've seen. It's just not very well explained and can be frusterating to a new player. But the basics are everyone has three melee attacks. quick attack, strong attack, and defensive attack. They kinda have a rock, paper, scissors effect. You just have to mess with it. Ranged combat works extremely well with little more than the typical issues that plague third person shooters, such and objects getting in the way of your line of fire, but they've fixed all the glitches that let you shoot through stuff.  I'd like to list a few pros and cons that I feel are present in the game at it's current state.\n\nPros\n-Amazing 40k world including referances and quotes from codexes and 40k lore\n-Great gameplay with a healthy mix of melee combat and intense shootouts\n-Executions (nuf said)\n-Various classes and loudouts that will continue to improve throughout development\n\nCons\n-It's early access so it's incomplete and several balance issues are the result of them testing and trying various things to find that balance.\n-Minor bugs and glitches can be annoying. While I personally haven't run into anything game breaking, it's sometimes annoying when you try to crouch behind cover and your character just stands there getting shot in the face. (This has improved greatly since eraly access launch tho)\n-No PvE content as of yet, but PvE content is planned.\n-Not much in the way of tutorials so some things require some patience and a little trial and error to figure out. You can also ask other players, most are willing to help.\n\nOverall I say it's easily worth the $40 price tag for the 40k fan. The Devs have been great and I can't wait to see where this game goes from here. I feel like it has incredible potential and has held my attention like very few multiplayer games have. I'm extremely excited about the progressions trees being added in the near future because that will only add more appeal to the game. If your the kind of person who doesn't have patience for games to change nd grow, then I can't recommend this game for you. But if you like third person vs multiplayer, the 40k universe or action games with a progression system then this game is great. Thanks for your time and I hope this helps.","May 27","true","28.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Which is an even bigger disappointment considering they've been working on this for over 2 years; considering that, I'd guess they will need another 2-4 years to make it what I'd call "playable" or indeed an "enjoyable experience" as currently its like a turd that's been ♥♥♥♥ out by Nurgle onto your PC.\n\nMy verdict: Wait for at least a year before buying it, then it might be playable for more than 5 minutes without it crashing out.","May 17","false","6.9"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

There are quite a few issues with the game, issues that I believe will never really be sorted. Imagine Warhammer 40k: Space Marine, take all the movement, tactics, weapons, stats and all. Make it all worse, add latency (both internet and framerates), throw in a couple of extra players. Now you have Eternal Crusade.\n\nNo matter how hard they try, they will never duplicate Space Marine, that game (the gameplay and PvP combat) was near flawless, as good as it gets. The only real slayer of Space Marine was no dedicated servers, which later on with player decline became more apparent. But it seems that the genre in combination with Warhammer was not as popular as could have been. Had nothing to do with the actual game, but peoples' taste in games and art style.\n\nThis project is doomed to fail, it already has to some degree, it will NEVER get a big player base. And thus, for legal matters as well as reputation, all they can do is push for a release with a decent enough game before dropping all the support for it and moving on to the next project.","May 12","true","44.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Huge, longtime fanatic of the lore, the hobby, many of the games, been waiting for over a year for this game to get to early access. Complete disappointment. Still, my go-to action 3rd-person 40k shooter will remain 40k: Space Marine. If you're a fan of W40k:SM, prepare to be wildly discouraged and disappointed. This neither adopts nor makes any attempt at emulating the fluid gameplay of SM, and replaces it with clunky, slow-moving inaction, mixed with map designs that are boring and/or completely off the mark for a decent multiplayer map. Graphics are equally non-immersive. Drab textures, uninteresting character upgrades, and zero incentive to work as a squad or unit.\n\nI had so much hope for this game.

The very term conjures up immages of unfinished, glitchy, horrible games. Most Early access games never get finished, and just take players' money and run. That is not the whole story here. Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade is is possibly your best bet as far as early access game go. While the game is very unfinished, it's not bad as far as games go.\n\nFor one thing, the devs are some of the pest I've seen on steam, as far as PR goes. They have a weekly live stream (which you can watch on youtube and twitch), and they listen to the fans. And they're not too proud to admit when they made a mistake. That alone is enough for me to want to support them.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's very limmited right now. It's meant to be an mmotpsrpg (massivly multiplayer online third person shooter role playing game) not unlike Planetside 2, except in the Warhammer 40K universe, and with pve (player versus environment) aspects. In its current state, however, it is mostly just a lobby shooter. That's not a bad thing, however, I'm more than eager to get to the good stuff.\n\nWhich brings me to the game's flaws. Melee is currently broken, and the latest patch that was supposed to fix it (amung other things) caused crash after crash after crash etc. (I'll get to melee combat later). Being in early access, most of the game isn't there. So options are extreamly limmited. Also, (though I don't believe the devs are at fault for this) Chaos Space Marines beat Space Marines 9 out of 10 times. So, if you want to win, join the forces of chaos. Though this could change at any time. Also, there's no tutorial. So you need to figure things out on your own, or look on youtube for tutorial videos.\n\nMelee is definatly a plus in this game (dispite its broken state). It's gasically a rock paper scisors game. fast attacks beat charges attacks, defensive bashes beat fast attacks, and strong attacks beat defensive bashes. This makes the melee combat more dynamic. There is no better satisfaction in this game than executing an enemy that you spent a good minute or more dueling. These duels are what I live for. And, of you get it down, you can beat anyone in melee dispite your class. (As a Devistator [heavy ranged class] I beat an assualt marine [jetpack melee class] in a melee duel, and excecuted him for his trouble). This will only get better once Eldar and Orks are added.\n\nFinally, this game will feature Orks, Eldar, Space Marines, And Chaos Space Marines once the game reaches beta, and finally launch. Not to mention the devs plans to later add Tao and other races. The future of this game looks good, and I am happy to recomend this game. It's not much now, but it'll be fully worth it once it's finished. But if you want to wait untill it's actually worth the 40 bucks you'll put into it, I can't blame you.","May 14","true","107.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Promising the world, selling nearly a thousand dollars of DLC alongside the founders packs, and then (after the money changed hands) saying they couldn't actually accomplish what they promised is not the best business practice, I think.\n\nAs to the game itself: right now it is basically Space Marine multiplayer, on a slightly larger scale. Orks and Eldar aren't in yet, so there isn't much new to see or get excited about.\n\nThe game might be fun one day, but in its current state, and with numerous Early Access pitfalls already hit, I'd avoid it for now.\n\ntl;dr 850 dollars of pre-order DLC","January 26","false","1.1"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","12","30","3","0"
