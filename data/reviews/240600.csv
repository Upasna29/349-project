Easy is easy and Realistic is just that. Realistic AI laptimes are actually faster than real life to match a player's ability to do so.\n\nCons:\n-Sound feels a little dated\n-Limited helmet choices and they are all very similiar.\n-It's too easy to run on the grass or clip a sand trap without falling, doesn't feel harsh enough\n-The game has a thing for rain in Career mode races. More variety and sun would've been appreciated\n-Not that its a problem unique to this sim but the AI still fail to take high speed corners effectively and so tracks with multiple high speed corners are too easy.\n-If you use braking lines, this one is alittle off. I prefer to use the real white markers, which are perfectly placed and easily visible\n\nOverall its an above average sim for me, and its actually fun to play. Setting the AI to max and going to one of your favorite tracks actually leads to exciting battles and the motorcycles are very forgiving in what racing line you take, allowing you to have even tighter battles than you would have with cars.\n\nNote: There is a huge glitch in this game that should be forwarned before buying. If you use Steam Cloud and have more than one computer, using this game on a second computer will stop your career mode from saving -ever- again on either computer. The fix is simple enough, you just don't use Steam Cloud for this game.\n","December 6, 2013","true","54.3"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

I keep thinking "I haven't liked a motorcycle game this much since Superbike 2000".  I just realized the two games had the same developer.  I'm sure there are a lot of different people at the company now, but still, it seems like there's some similar DNA between the games.\n\nI don't really understand some of people's  negativity towards this game.  I guess maybe it doesn't feel simmy enough for the sim enthusiasts, and not arcadey enough for the GRID and MX vs ATV crowd.  I, however, love the balance.  The menus are beautiful, lots of good multimedia content that gives it more life, lots of game modes, love the Moto2 and Moto3 options because MotoGP is pretty intense for a starter.  Great control/realism options (I like joint-braking and auto-tucking because I don't need THAT level of simulation).  I think the graphics are great personally.  The player models are particularly good I think, and the tracks have a lot of spectators and a good lively feel to them, although they don't quite have that GRID polish and detail, but I don't really care for that look.  This game is clean to look at and not cluttered.\n\nPeople have complained about the controls being unrealistic, but I don't see what the problem is.  I loved MotoGP 07 which actually felt a little too arcade-like to me, but I like this game much more now that I've tried it.  The camera is more stable and improves gameplay, and I like the way the bike responds to over-throttling it.  High-sides and low sides seem to occur reasonably, and if it were any harder or sim-like, it would be a pain to play (using a controller with joysticks will never perfectly reproduce the feel of a real motorcycle and people need to accept that.  So why not make a game reasonably PLAYABLE?  I think this game is, yet isn't a silly arcade game either).\n\nThe wreck physics are a litte silly though.  You can bump into the back of people and flail around over the handlebars and easily recover.  It's easy to maliciously wreck other people too.  But reasonably trying to race among a large pack isn't impossibly difficult.  But it's a challenge.  I think the wet conditions LOOK nice in this game, but they don't seem to affect control very much at all, so that seems a little unrealistic.\n\nI tried MotoGP 14 first and my video card struggled, and it seemed glitchy as hell.  I actually prefer the cleaner look of MotoGP 13 anyway.\n\nI think Milestone did a admirable job with this game and I'm happy with my purchase.","August 30, 2014","true","26.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

I'm certainly glad I purchased this game (on sale may I add)! I've also rode a motorcycle so you can count on me being judgemental on this one.\n\nNone the less great game. The user interface is easy to use with many options available. Options to change resolution can be configured before the game boots. There is a launch menu that appears with different settings. Changing controller buttons is easy and the game is very controller friendly. Some of the game mode options are instant race, grand prix, championship, career (which I'm really enjoying at the moment), multiplayer and YES!!! SPLIT SCREEN!!! <---- :) .... seriously, need more games like this on steam.\n\nGameplay is pretty immaculate on this one. Need for Speed Shift 2 was one of my favorite racing games until I stumbled upon this. Shift gives a challenge, I feel this one does too. The AI will give you a challenge certainly when you first start, but getting a hold of the gameplay/controls  will eventually put you up front (unless you make a mistake... in which they added a feature to rewind. I've used this feature a few times watching me demolish a race because I cut a few people off). Added features are the options to have assisted steering, traction control and all that hooplah but I really like the feature where you tuck your rider into the bike. With the press of the Y button on the x-box controller, the rider tucks in obviously (too much work? Just turn it off in options and make it automatic). When taking a turn though this tiny modification can make your turn ever so smoother, and definitely a more enjoyable experience. Ever seen the guys out there racing put their knee to the ground? Well having a first person view (and even option to add a helmet HUD) delivers that experience. The friciton system also feels accurate when taking turns.  I like the controls, I like the steering, I like doing wheelees, I like being able to do stoppies, and I like to be able to drive in reverse backwards on the track and collide with other players to watch the physics system. The crash effects are pretty neat on this one, especially when you don't break enough and send another rider flying. Of course this isn't ideall; it is fun to watch the reply. All in all, the racing aspect is very apparent. My only complaint is touching the joystick ever so slightly sometimes makes the bike look like it "jerks", as in it's sort of quick or choppy to move a bike like that.\n\nThe visuals of course are as nice as they are shown. 1980X1080 is an option with this game. The bikes look appealing and the riders are as good as they get. I'd like however a little more ability for customization when it comes to the bike or the racing suit. I'm not sure if it's only my computer (and I haven't done my research on this yet ... may edit later) but I'm having issues with cut scenes. The screen plays the scene but sometimes it does a bunch of pixelation stuff then goes back to normal. This is NOT an issue while playing the game though. I have yet to have a problem with the gameplay aspect. Side note on first person view, there are stickers on your windshield. Personally I'd like the choice to have them off. It bugs me! Seeing riders bump into one another and then react is quite neat as well. Changing gears and seeing the clutch being pulled is also a mentionable feature for motogp 13.\n\nSound... well the sound is good because usually I keep my music on while I play games. However I find that listening to the motor while playing is helpful at least to me. In this game you have to be quite attentive or get ready to wipe out. Although the sound is decent, that's all it is. I think the sounds could have been a lot more authentic (especially from the motorcycles).\n\nI would have to highly recommend this game to anyone and would say it is a great addition to a steam library.\n\n***I would recommend for future motogp games perhaps add a stunt bike section? I know it's not quite GP but it would add an extra depth and a few more challenges to the game. Not the mention the handling of stunt bikes would be different***. Also... for goodness sakes please make the replay interface better. Also, adding some more tracks for local co-op would be greatly appreciated!\n\nRATING : 8.2/10\n\nGameplay	A-	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	B+	Overall 	B\nScreenShots\nWhat it looks like when I'm not tucking into the bike\n\nOne of the best aspects of the game in this screenshot - the lean\n\nThe game likes to inform you of the track you're racing on, and even gives a little introductory video of the location your racing around\n\nBefore the race, you may fine tune your bike in the pit\n\nNice to see the bike is in view when looking back\n\nWhat career mode looks like behind the scenes.

When you apply the accelerator after slowing down for a corner, it is necessary to gradually and smoothly increase your speed.  If you fail to do this gently, your bike will slide wide and eventually spin out In addition to steering and throttle control, you have to balance your rider appropriately for the upcoming corners.  This at first is fairly difficult, especially if you have no previous experience with motorcycle games.  On the standard setting, this is automatically done for you, and allows the player to concentrate on tackling corners The better you do in a race, the more fans are attracted to you and the better your racing team offers become You can sign with different racing teams thorough out the campaign, getting better offers the better you do in a race The tension and excitement of whipping across tarmac at high speed - feeling every bump, leaning into every corner should you shunt another rider you visibly nearly fall off and sometimes when you spin out and lose control your rider ends up with both legs on one side of the bike, struggling to balance which is a neat and realistic looking touch it  takes time to learn and master When you first boot up the game you create a custom rider and are even able to choose avatars for yourself and your managers. You get to choose things like your clothing colours and helmet and the further you get into the game the more you will unlock Milestone has included lots of driving aids such as showing the racing line, assisting with breaking and even with cornering to help newcomers to the game The lower powered bikes you begin with are much easier to get used to and feel lighter you can check current standings via a TV, change your outfit in the wardrobe, check your laptop for emails and social feeds within the pits called the Technical Meeting where you can have a conversation with the mechanic who will assess where you are having issues Once you do get to grips with things however it becomes a truly gripping, engaging and downright thrilling ride. Obviously motorbikes differ drastically to cars and the added factor of rider weight distribution makes leaner into corners at breakneck speeds, winding through S-bends and powering down the straights intensely rewarding If you want to be truly great at this game, you’ve got to put in a lot of time and effort in, but when everything clicks, it’s rewarding and worth it...............","September 27, 2015","true","27.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The AI are competent and the difficulty levels feel spot on. There are the usual driving assist you would expect to find in any racing titles and these can be switched on r off independently.\n\nThe game runs well, even on relatively low-spec machines.\n\nMy favourite part of the game thus far is the very well crafted career mode. Create your rider, enter some races as a wild card and work your way not only up teams, but up from lower racing series. This enables a rewarding progression trail to follow and a gentler learning curve which i expect will be invaluable for improving.\n\nThere is a selection of managers and engineers for you to choose from to support you through your career and theres a limited fictional social media interaction with your fictional fans which ticks the egoist's authenticity box. Contract negotiations, magazines and the email system all feel useful and don't clutter you up with useless information.\n\nAnother excellent addition is the ability to have sit-down meetings with your race engineer in the pits. Answer his questions about how you find the bike and he'll set up the bike for you based on your feedback - a superb feature for those who just want to race or don't have much understanding of the set-up system.\n\nHighly recommended.","October 24, 2015","true","49.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

No amount of physics modeling is going to make the experience of a racing game truly comparable to real life, so I believe it is much better to focus on fun and presentation.  In terms of presentation, the game is already quite attractive.  The pavement looks just right, the environments look close enough to the real tracks that I can't find faults, and the game has absolutely no pop-in artifacts.  What it really needs, though, is some quality voice-over and overlay work.

Overall riding feels realistic and compelling. It is true that only a small amounts of the technical aspects of the game alone would possibly make you fall for it .. there are indeed numerous glitches and the textures and polygons seem somehow dated (graphic engine of WRC3 supposedly .. takes us back quite a few years that is .. ) the sound of engines is ok with the music generally being a lame worthless ♥♥♥♥♥ (for all i care it could get even worse since it doesn't seriously damage the game experience in itself .. you can always mute it but hell i thought it was maybe something I had to mention anyways) YET the difficulty is challenging to say the least and the pro rider settings will require a bunch of hours of practicing before you can even start hoping to take the lead in any of the major events but what a thrill once you're starting to feel like you're part of the race for broke!!

Nothing can overcome the lack of steering control.\n\nThe issue is... When cornering, your either on full lean angle or no lean angle.. Nothing in between is controlable, so holding the racing line or any line for that matter is impossible. Basically it's like driving a car around any angle of corner with either no steering lock OR full steering lock to choose from!\n\nThe game is impossible to exit too, you MUST finish your race before being allowed to exit. I needed to restart my computer on each occasion to exit the game fully. My computer is a top end self built machines and has no issues with any other programs including all the others in my 400GB+ Steam folder.\n\nWish I hadn't wasted the £9 on the special offer now!","April 6, 2014","false","1.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The AI are competent and the difficulty levels feel spot on. There are the usual driving assist you would expect to find in any racing titles and these can be switched on r off independently.\n\nThe game runs well, even on relatively low-spec machines.\n\nMy favourite part of the game thus far is the very well crafted career mode. Create your rider, enter some races as a wild card and work your way not only up teams, but up from lower racing series. This enables a rewarding progression trail to follow and a gentler learning curve which i expect will be invaluable for improving.\n\nThere is a selection of managers and engineers for you to choose from to support you through your career and theres a limited fictional social media interaction with your fictional fans which ticks the egoist's authenticity box. Contract negotiations, magazines and the email system all feel useful and don't clutter you up with useless information.\n\nAnother excellent addition is the ability to have sit-down meetings with your race engineer in the pits. Answer his questions about how you find the bike and he'll set up the bike for you based on your feedback - a superb feature for those who just want to race or don't have much understanding of the set-up system.\n\nHighly recommended.","March 1, 2014","true","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Straight away I set everything to realistic and difficulty on max removing racing lines etc.  I started a Moto 3 career as myself and with the difficulty being so high the rewind button is a definate help as you won't get back in touch with riders once you fall off.  Limiting it to 6 rewinds in fair, I usually do 25% race distance so have the option of one per lap.\nSo far 10 ten races into my first season I've had a 5th place best finish, nobody lets you win which I like.   Setting the bike up takes a bit of thought, the technical adviser will undo good settings if you use him too much so best to sort it yourself and save the data as it will get altered when you come to the next session sometimes.\n\nI like the way you can switch teams mid season and set targets of certain riders to beat so even if you are not battling for the win it's worth playing.  You can also adjust traction control setting while riding which is handy as conditions sometimes change during the race.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that on the highest difficulty it is almost impossible to qualify much higher than last place despite overtaking people through most of the qualifying sessions.  Also I can carve my way close to the top ten within a lap and have been holding 4th postion for 5 laps of a race so I definately have the pace.   That said I've not played a racing game for 2 years so am re learning the tracks as I go so maybe my qualifying will improve next season and I'm just picking the best lines from following in the races.\n\nI highly recommend this game for it's playability and realism (I have raced a motorcycle in real life).  To give you an idea I have listed how I rate the Moto GP games I've played in order of how good they were.\n\nMoto Gp 13 - PC\nMoto Gp 07 - PC & Xbox 360\nMoto GP 4 - PS2\nMoto GP 06 - Xbox 360\nMoto GP 3 - PS2\nMoto GP - Xbox\nMoto GP 10 - Xbox 360 ( don't bother)","May 10","true","52.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Graphics are not bad for a 2013 game. The tracks are good too.\n\nRating - 35/100\n\nConclusion:\nThe rating was bad because the critic doesn't have good things in it, so I'm not recommending this game to you guys.","May 15","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was VERY hard at first and i started to get really good at it after about 20 hours of gameplay. I really enjoyed learning on the moto3 class. then progressing to the moto2 (still my fovorite because of the screaming 600cc engine and handling) After that I have just gotten better and better. The physics are very good and I havent played motogp 14-16 because I'm still mastering this baby. I will get 15 when it goes on sale :)\n","May 24","true","82.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
