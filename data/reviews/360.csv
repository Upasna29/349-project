A few years ago I would've recommended this game to everybody, but due to the Steampipe update back in 2013 this game was entirely ruined. Before I go on, let me define the word "ruined" as it's used in this context. By "ruined" I mean that this game is so properly glitched that you cannot even change your player model anymore! Yeah, that should give you an idea of how much Valve cares for their games.\n\nI blame Valve for this, but mostly an incompetent and lazy person whose name starts with an A and ends with a D, that was supposed to fix this using the input from the community on GitHub.\n\nSo yeah, rather buy the normal HL because not only do you get the singleplayer portion of the game with the multiplayer, the online play is still functioning like it should and there is at least a player base. Oh, and if you are planning to buy Half-Life Source which is the other half of this, then don't. It might not be equally broken, but broken enough to make you mad.\n\nOr just get Black Mesa, then you will at least get something that is prettier on the eyes and functioning like it should.","October 4, 2015","false","3.1"," 98 of 121 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","98","121","6","7"

These remakes varied in quality, with Counter-Strike getting a full overhaul and Half-Life getting a simple port with barely any changes. It was around this time that Half-Life Deathmatch: Source was released. Like Half-Life: Source, it was a simple port from the GoldSrc engine that introduced very little changes.\n\nIn 2013, Valve introduced Steampipe, which would simpify downloading their games and not have them take up as much space. However, the update caused numerous bugs and glitches across all of their games, notably Half-Life: Source and -you guessed it- Half-Life Deathmatch: Source. As of writing, Valve has barely fixed any of these glitches.\n\nNow, where do I begin?\n\nAgain, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source suffers from countless bugs and game breaking mechanics. Like Half-LIfe: Source, it shoves so many special effects into assets and maps created in 1998	. The chrome effect that you could see on the revolver in the original Half-Life is slapped onto every weapon and every silver texture in the game. The lighting is okay by itself, but it's ruined by the overpowered bloom. I've seen better bloom in the Cinematic Mod for Half-Life 2! And there is so much more visualwise.\n\nThe hitboxes feel weird, and it seems that Valve fixed only the player hitbox so the game is somewhat fair. The MP5 grenade is a one hit kill and you'll bet that me and other players spam these like crazy. Just everything feels like it was stuck into the game, no adjustments, no tweaking,  left the way it is.\nHere is the final nail in the coffin for me: sometimes textures don't even show up on the map, and you'll be standing on an invisible floor.\n\nThis isn't Valve quality. This is the quality of a fan that just got into Source modding, and released this under Early Access as Pre-Alpha. But this game isn't the scams you'll find sitting under the Greenlight, this is a game released by Valve onto their own platform. And that's pretty disgraceful.\n\nHowever, at it's core, it's still Half-Life Deathmatch, and it can be fun. So if you own the Orange Box and you're looking for something new, give this a try.\n\nOtherwise, do not buy this game.","April 13","false","6.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It actually was released later after Single-player Campaign and wasn't so much loved either. It contains same graphical changes as in Half-Life Source, most noticeably water and ragdolls. But this time around it emits HD Models bundle from Blue Shift out.\n\nAnd it's dead. Barely has any players.\n\nTo be short, it wasn't good idea at all. First, servers of original and remake aren't compitable, so it naturally splitted HL1 deathmatch community, in this case most stayed in original. Second, this Source remake as of right now is bugged. Not bugged enough to be unplayable, but just take look at popular map: Crossfire. The turrets there became unusuable, there is strange flying grate texture over lifts, it has double windows for some reason. Not pretty.\nSo, stick to original Half-Life if you want multiplayer.","August 12, 2014","false","2.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/recommended/360/","badtexture","Kill-Cam Celebrity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/","184 products in account","Summary: It may be more compatible with Windows 7/8/8.1 than HL1 normally is, but aside from compatibility and better lighting, there's not much to make this game worth your money.\n\nFirst off, nothing has changed from HL1's multiplayer mode.  The maps may be running on Source, but there's still no props or anything-- it's still all just the map geometry.  More than that, you have to deal with the regular HL1 models without the HD pack, unless you feel the need to go through HL1 with Photoshop and do it yourself via modding (which will most likely not work on some servers).\n\nHere's the real reason you want to stay away: 1) the GoldSrc HL1 has more players (source is pretty much empty, HL1 has a few players), and 2) this game is an EXTRA price.  That's right.  It's not like "oh, they just separated it because it's a big file" as Red Orchestra 2 and the CoD games do it.  No, you have to BUY the singleplayer for HL:Source (a broken mess) for $10, then HL Deathmatch Source is a standalone for you to slap down more money for.  Why not just buy HL1, with Deathmatch mode included?\n\nAside from what's above, what's advertised in HL Source isn't really that great.  The ragdoll physics are present, yes... however, they're bugged.  VERY bugged.  They lock up as soon as you die and you fall sideways in a stupid pose, whether you're posed to run in place on the ground, you're failing at parkour by getting your arm phased into a guardrail, or you're doing a handstand... sideways.  Other than ragdoll physics, the lighting looks better and the skybox is now 3D rather than a few jpg's of a New Mexico backdrop, but other than that this game has no real improvements.\n\nFinal verdict: It's a waste of money.  Just buy the old HL1, which will include this mode AND the singleplayer for $10 total.  It will also have HD models and the old death-animations rather than the failed ragdolls you see here.  It also has more players and better servers (both vanilla and modservers as opposed to a few vanilla).\n\nIt's not worth your cash, just add the original Half-Life (not HL Source) to your cart and move along.\n\nEDIT: Take a look at these next gen ragdoll physics!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345473153","November 22, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Still though, the title screen is really prety. It really has that classic Half-Life mood and almost makes it feel like as if though this were a game you could play. In fact, the title screen is rather inspiring as it gets you to imagine what it must be like to play the game. The font for the text is also really nice.\n\nJokes aside, I'm really glad I bought this when it was on sale because it's in a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•awful condition. It crashes after -2 seconds and the most active server I could find had five people on, and I was lucky. I suggest you pirate the 1998 game because it actually let's you play and the community still has numerous 5-10 player servers as well as a 32 filled Crossfire one.","December 22, 2013","false","2.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I suggest you wait for the next update (in about 10 or so years).\n\nThere are a few gameplay-breaking bugs in the game as well as minor annoyances that make you regret buying this game as it is now. I'll list just some of them so you can judge for yourself.\n\nGameplay-breaking:\n\n- Double-spawning entities that cause various physical systems to break down and to stop functioning including doors, fans, conveyor belts, etc. This is extremely obnoxious.\n\n- Turrets do not work in both crossfire and stalkyard.\n\n- Hitboxes are misaligned with the playermodel.\n\n- The nuke can be spammed in crossfire, resulting in multiple instant deaths until it stops.\n\n- Acid pool trap does not do any damage in Snarkpit.\n\n- Bad interpretation of client actions by the server, resulting in delayed crossbow fire, gluon beam redirect, tau laser, etc. (this can be altered somewhat at a large cost of server resources).\n\n- Team deathmatch does not function entirely correctly.\n\n- Coop is broken (yes there is a coop command).\n\nAnnoyances:\n\n- Extremely bright lights due to HDR rendering and the use of mostly quadratic lighting and huge glow sprites.\n\n- Strange looking gloss on weapons.\n\n- Weapons feel "clunky" compared to the original game.\n\n- Changing playermodels in the menu does not work (can be changed via console though).\n\nSo that's that. If you're still edging towards buying this game, you're not making the biggest mistake of your life since the remaining community is awesome and sometimes hilarious.\n\nP.S. The Tau Cannon is glorious!","March 27, 2015","false","462.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I suggest you wait for the next update (in about 10 or so years).\n\nThere are a few gameplay-breaking bugs in the game as well as minor annoyances that make you regret buying this game as it is now. I'll list just some of them so you can judge for yourself.\n\nGameplay-breaking:\n\n- Double-spawning entities that cause various physical systems to break down and to stop functioning including doors, fans, conveyor belts, etc. This is extremely obnoxious.\n\n- Turrets do not work in both crossfire and stalkyard.\n\n- Hitboxes are misaligned with the playermodel.\n\n- The nuke can be spammed in crossfire, resulting in multiple instant deaths until it stops.\n\n- Acid pool trap does not do any damage in Snarkpit.\n\n- Bad interpretation of client actions by the server, resulting in delayed crossbow fire, gluon beam redirect, tau laser, etc. (this can be altered somewhat at a large cost of server resources).\n\n- Team deathmatch does not function entirely correctly.\n\n- Coop is broken (yes there is a coop command).\n\nAnnoyances:\n\n- Extremely bright lights due to HDR rendering and the use of mostly quadratic lighting and huge glow sprites.\n\n- Strange looking gloss on weapons.\n\n- Weapons feel "clunky" compared to the original game.\n\n- Changing playermodels in the menu does not work (can be changed via console though).\n\nSo that's that. If you're still edging towards buying this game, you're not making the biggest mistake of your life since the remaining community is awesome and sometimes hilarious.\n\nP.S.

I love Half Life Deathmatch: Source to death, it has great weapons, fun game play, etc. But this game is pretty much dead when it comes to online servers. However, a couple of people are on sometimes and I find it to be a fun little game to play at night when I'm bored. It's a shame more people don't play it...","November 1, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
