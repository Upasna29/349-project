For the first two thirds of the game I was certain it was my least favorite of the Bit.Trip Saga that I'd yet to play, only to find the final third of the game (or in other words the third level) vastly improved on everything that came before. Even still, it's hard for me to even begin to recommend it, as by that point my experience was already soured and I was ready for it to be over.\n\nAs is the case with every Bit.Trip game, the gameplay of Core differs wildly from past games, placing you in the middle of the screen with the ability to shoot lasers in four directions. Blocks come out from the sides of the screen, and you need to time your shots to hit them as they cross over your line of fire. In theory and keeping with Bit.Trip tradition, these are supposed to line up with the beat of the audio track, but in practice there is very little rhythm at all to the patterns which makes it incredibly difficult to time shots with how short a window you are given. It's not until the last level that these designs finally come together and you can see what Gaijin Games was going for with a fantastic closer that feels really rewarding once you get in sync with the track, which makes it so disappointing that near everything that came before was just rubbish.\n\nFor a game you can finish in under and hour, it's hard to recommend Core when only a third of it is worth playing, and even then is likely to annoy those who don't posses a keen sense of rhythm. It's ideas are solid but its execution lacking, and on the whole I found little enjoyment to be had from what eventually showed itself to be an interesting concept. If only it had done so earlier.","June 27, 2014","false","1.3"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

The main issue I have is that there is a huge delay between pressing fire, and actually shooting your beam. It really ruins the experience. The Wii version, where this is ported from, has no delay at all. Now, you're not getting the game for $1 on the Wii version like you are for the winter sale, but it is SO much better than this game. If anything, I recommend picking up a copy of Bit.Trip Complete on the Wii for about $20. It includes all 6 games in the main series, fun extras, and it includes the true story of the Bit.Trip games. It's a great buy.\n\nSO, final results:\n\nWii Version- Very fun and challenging for all the right reasons! Recommended, 8/10!\nPC Version- Kind of fun, and challenging for all the wrong reasons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/205060/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Bit.Trip Core is the second entry in the Bit.Trip series, playing a bit more like a typical rhythm game in some aspects. The graphical and musical style from Beat is carried over from Core. In this game though, the graphics are not as crazy but still are trippy and weird, while the music is a lot more subdued. The story and cutscenes tend to revolve around Commander Video and 2 figures that look a lot like Commander Video.\nThe gameplay consists of controlling an object in the middle that can fire up, down, left, or right. The goal is to hit each block as it passes through a line. This felt a little bit like Guitar Hero in trying to match a block with a direction and firing the laser. Just like in Beat, blocks move on the screen and with different patterns or in huge groups. Bosses exist at the end of the level with 2 more Atari references, and included to the game are bombs to remove difficult blocks onscreen.\nCore feels a bit flawed though. There are times when I was interested in the pattern of the blocks and the level designs, while other times I felt bored. Sometimes I would easily get the hang of a pattern and be in sync to the music, while other times I wouldn't and try to button mash my way out. The mellowed out design and more abstract gameplay in Core makes the game a bit harder to enjoy. As a whole, the game is roughly harder than Beat, although there are points where the game is easy and then it suddenly ramps up in difficulty. The time to beat Core is also roughly the same as to finish Beat as well.\nBit.Trip Core will be fine for players who played some of the other Bit.Trip games like Beat or Runner and want more Bit.Trip action. The game itself isn't perfect, but gives a different kind of game that isn't the most amazing, yet offers some interesting things to check out.","July 15, 2014","true","1.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Pad is near essential, port is completely horrible and functionality of the PC version is near non-existent. If you don't want to risk, I can completely understand that. Avoid if you are not prepared or are not interested in rhythm games in particular.\n\nThat said, I just cannot force myself to give this game a negative review, since I had great time playing this. Yes, it's most difficult of the Bit.Trip original series, but the rhythm in this one is nearly hypnotizing. You need to be more precise with hitting those flying bit and pattern recognition is ESSENSIAL but I was constantly finding myself replaying those levels enjoying how much a great musical experience this game is. Your whole mind will act and react to the beat.\n\nThat said... Someone should contact the authorities. Making that poor port of such a great game should be considered a crime.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yargles/recommended/205060/","yargles","Yargles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yargles/","169 products in account","BIT.TRIP CORE is a rhythm game and is the second entry to the BIT.TRIP franchise also being my favorite. Note that I have played the Wii (and 3DS) version of this game a lot more then I have on the PC so I have a lot more hours in the game then it shows.\n\nGameplay\nThe way CORE works is, you are playing at the + in middle of the screen. When a beat (square things) comes you have to take aim in one of the four directions and shoot the beats. The beats are in-time with the music and you will need to use the beat of the song to hit these accurately.\n\nA staple to the BIT.TRIP franchise is the zones. The higher the zone, the higher your multiplier will be, thus more score. You zone up by hitting a certain amount of beats while not missing too many. Staying in higher zones results in more score, but it is really easy to fail out of it. The higher the zone, the better the music gets which is another thing to keep you motivated to keep doing better.\n\nTo fail a stage you will have to drop out of the Nether zone (the lowest zone) and there are no checkpoints. If you don't have experience then this game will be really hard at first. The difficulty curve is steep and the first level (Discovery) will be hard for first-timers. However once you get the hang of the game and mechanics, the next two levels will not be as hard.\n\nPersonally, once I pick up a good rhythm game I will spend too much time in it and this game is no exception. I find it very addictive to try to improve my score more and more.\n\nAlso, note that there are only the three 15 minute levels; Discovery, Exploration and Control. Playing through the game without failing will take just 45 minutes, but if you're motivated to get further improve your scores (like me), it shouldn't be a huge problem.\n\n\nMusic/Sound\nAs a rhythm game, the game is partially dependent on the music, so is it good? Definitely, CORE probably has my favorite music of any of the BIT.TRIP games, though that is subject to opinion. Also as I said before, the higher zone you're in, the better the music gets. Exploration is my personal favorite. (*^▽^*)\n\nAs far as sound effects go, they're solid and they do the job well.\n\n\nVersions\nBetween the three versions of the game (PC, Wii, 3DS) I feel that if you have the right controller (the Xbox 360's circular D-Pad design does not go well with CORE), PC is the best because of the increased resolution. Also, the challenges which flip the + 90 degrees are actually challenging on the PC cause you can't just flip the controller like you can on Wii. Don't bother with the 3DS version, it's basically broken as the music de-syncs after the first section of Exploration and Control.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBIT.TRIP CORE is up there in my all-time favorite rhythm games. The great music and addictive gameplay keep me coming back to spend even more time in it.\nDespite the difficulty curve, this is a very solid game. If you are a fan of rhythm games, definitely consider picking CORE up, and check out the rest of the franchise for that matter.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you'll like this game as much as I do if you decide to pick it up!","June 24, 2014","true","10.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

CORE starts the pattern of adding a new mode with each successive game, adding SUPER.\n\nFor people who really enjoy rhythm games, I'd recommend checking it out, but in another format - it's difficult to play in its current form, albeit not impossible.

What, do they actualt expect me to have an NES controller plugged in? Don't they know that the Xbox 360 controller's d-pad blows? You can't use the LS to control the direction, only the d-pad, which is why the controls feel really unresponsive.\n-Confusing. Yes, you can get enjoyment if you're a rhythm fan but the whole thing looked WAY too confusing.\n-Has that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ main menu from BIT.TRIP BEAT. (Well, it's arguable but why can't you just control it with the analog stick/d-pad/keyboard normally? At least in BIT.TRIP BEAT you can use the mouse, but I think it's because that game is a mouse game.)\n-Gets boring really soon.\n\nOverall, great concept, bad execution, but not the worst. I really think they could have done something better with the concept. Even in BIT,TRIP FATE I gave it a recommendation (to get it on sale) because I thought not only bullethell fans can enjoy it, but with this... Only rhythm fanatics can actually have some fun with it. Anyone else, no.(Well, there's a lot of fans but, still wouldn't recommend it.) If you got this on the BIT,TRIP Colection then we are on the same boat and I think that some people were REALLY dissapointed (I got it for 5 euros so I'm happy with my purchase).","January 1, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

CORE is the second game in the BIT.TRIP saga, after BEAT. If this premise sounds similar to Bit.TRIP BEAT, well, the similarities don't end there. Like BEAT, doing well in CORE makes the music sound better and the graphics look better, but more distracting. Doing poorly makes the music worse and the graphics simpler, and when you're close to death, the game drops to black-and-white mode and removes all but the basic beat of the music, so nothing is left to distract you.\n\nI think BIT.TRIP BEAT is wonderful because of the game's elegant game design. CORE is more of the same, but clunkier. To hit the dots, you have to hold a direction and fire, and the fact that you have to worry about two button presses per shot makes all the difference. It's hard enough keeping with the rhythm when the dots start hitting your line of fire on the off beat (which can be difficult even when there's enough warning, but is much harder when CORE starts throwing them in with no warning), but it's a lot more work also figuring out which direction to fire in when the game starts moving the dots around in an erratic pattern. I feel that the gameplay in CORE is a bit too unfair... you have to either have incredibly quick reflexes or simply memorize the tough parts to do well. Some of these same criticisms apply to BEAT as well, but the superior game design in BEAT makes up for some of those issues.\n\nUltimately, BIT.TRIP CORE is still a decent game, and if you liked BEAT, you'll probably like CORE well enough to tolerate its faults, because when you get right down to it, CORE is really just more of the same. Get BEAT before CORE, though. BEAT is much better.","January 12, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very unsatisfying to play on the PC and along side that the controls make it nearly impossible to play. I can tell the game was designed with a controller in mind, but even then they could have tried to make a port somewhat coherent for PC controls.\n\nThe Main Menu is a mess, the Options menu is impossible to navigate, and worst of all there is ZERO mouse support in the menus. You can tell this port was half-♥♥♥♥♥ and haphazardly tossed onto the PC in hopes that people would buy this game without knowing better.\n\nI played for about ten minutes with a controller and just felt this game had no heart and soul. Music is okay, but not nearly as catchy and enjoyable as Bit.Trip Beat, the heart of the series. I didn't enjoy the time I put into this game and I felt the drawl of the music just didn't help the game flow. Bit.Trip Beat was all about movement, whereas Bit.Trip Core is all sitting and shooting lasers in four directions. I could have tolerated it if they had at least just made it so that when you push the direction keys it would fire the laser instantly rather than having it just aim the laser and you have to shoot it right after.\n\nGet a controller if you even want to try playing this game because playing with a keyboard feels horrible.
