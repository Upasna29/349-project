Anyone who's played Silent Hunter will recognize parts of the interface. I believe they used the SH3 engine for this, or they really loved it's interface.\n\nGoing through the tutorials I've been taught how to maneuver and fire on mostly harmless AI merchant's with a destroyer, battleship, a carrier (it's aircraft) and a submarine. All which play a bit differently.\n\nThe game is turn based and has phases. You have a movement phase and then an action phase. Movement is self explanatory, but action is where you'll fire your guns, torpedoes or ready / launch aircraft (you can only do one action per turn). So, you move then act, then the enemy moves then acts.\n\nIt has an interesting firing system. You target an enemy (with a somewhat clunky targetting system) which gives you an estimate on it's range and the elevation you should set your guns to. Your first volley will more than likely miss,  but the game gives you tools to estimate how to modify the elevation of your guns to get a hit with the next volley. Your aim increasingly gets better the more volleys you fire in a row on the same target. I'll also add that the guns are not totally accurate so even if you have the perfect elevation, your shots might not always hit. There are also options for duds, wind to effect your shots\n\nThe game has a fairly detailed damage model as well. You can hit and destroy certain parts of the ships, knock out their guns, rudder, AA, Radar, etc. It's rather surprising to see so much detail in this. Some times a ship can shrug off dozens of rounds and others can go down with a single, critical hit. Plunging fire seems highly destructive, my first heavy cruiser I bought was destroyed with the plunging fire from an enemy destroyer in the opening volley.. I had to take a break after that.\n\nShips have certain armor values for different parts of their ships. Battleships will have thick belt, turret and deck armor while destroyers and torpedo boats have virtually nothing (making them highly vulnerable to HE ammo). The first heavy cruiser I bought in the Allied campaign was destroyed in the first opening volley by an enemy destroyer.. so,\n\nDestroyers and submarines and yes cruisers have torpedoes which you'll decide where each torpedo travels in a spread. You could decide to have them all in one spot, or have a wide spread guaranteeing a hit on the target. In most cases they require time to target which varies depending on the ship / what torpedoes it's firing. Usually it takes 1 full turn to land CLOSE shots (within 2500 meters or so, I'm not entirely certain yet) which gives the enemy a turn to try and maneuver away from them. They also have a 1,000 meter arming distance, so you can't hug enemy ships for easy torpedoes.\n\nIn the campaign mode, you're given 6000 Prestige at first to purchase your starting fleet, so this is sort of like Victory at Sea. I decided to go with the Kriegsmarine, so my first vessel purchased was a Type 1934A Class Destroyer. So far it looks like there are 19 different ship types for the Kriegsmarine.\n\nFrom the PDF Manual:\n"Campaign:\nIn Campaign mode, you'll take on the role of the Admiral of a Task Force. Your goal will be to sink enemy shipping and use the Renown earned to buy ships and build up your fleet. However your resources are limited. There are over 2 million Renown points to be earned per campaign which makes building up your fleet fairly easy, but any ships lost will have to be re-purchased and battles become very difficult in the late stages. Thus it is possible to run out of Renown and fail a campaign. Campaigns are a series of 50 missions increasing in difficulty and are saved separately for each navy. Games are saved automatically at the end of each battle and whenever purchasing a new ship or releasing a ship from command.\n\nGoal:\nSink enemy shipping to earn Renown points in\norder to purchase more and better ships as well as\nreplace those lost in action.\n\nRules:\nMaximum player fleet size is 10 ships.\nMaximum player ships in battle is 3.\nPlayer ships sunk are removed from fleet (may be re-purchased).\nCannot own duplicates of the same ship."\n\nThere is a weather system and the missions seem to (at random) change between night and day which effects your vision range and accuracy which I find helps the replayability. Not every fight is in bright sunlight with perfect conditions. I'd recommend playing this with as much realism as possible as it seems a bit TOO easy at first.\n\nLike I mentioned, I believe this game uses the Silent Hunter 3 engine, so it has pretty dated graphics. It isn't ugly by any means (except maybe the sprites for crew on aircraft) but it isn't beautiful either. If you've played World of Warships it's slightly WORSE than that. The water actually looks pretty good though.\n\nSo far with only having played the tutorials and a couple single missions I can say you can't go wrong with picking this up. If you're a fan of naval combat, turn based tactical games or a WW2 fan in general you should check this out!\n\nThis has really got me wanting MORE games in the Atlantic..\n\nI'll be sure to update this as I continue playing through this and learn more.\nThanks for reading!","February 25","true","34.2"," 106 of 111 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","106","111","0","8"

Atlantic Fleet on the tablet not only switched the ocean, but improved the mechanics, graphics, and gameplay of an already fun and good looking game. Now bring all that great stuff to the PC. I play on a 1080p 46" LCD TV. It is beautiful to watch. The turn based gameplay style allows you to think about your tactics and relax rather than trying to race against the AI to get commands to all of your units in time. If the game has a flaw, it is its treatment of aircraft carriers. The whole point of carriers is to engage before you get close enough for battleships to make a difference. As this is more of a game than a simulation, its not really a problem as long as you don't mind having your aircraft carriers ripped up by battleships. Mix battleships and submarines, and you can win against just about anything. But you made need fast destroyers with sonar to hunt other submarines, and even then it is risky. I was a submarine sonar technician for 8 years. With patience, I can consistently win with submarines. If the setup is bad, disengage. If the setup is good, line up for torpedo shots and enjoy the graphics of Bismark or other ships sinking beneath the waves. As long as you don't expect aircraft carriers to dominate combat, this is pretty much a perfect game. For $10, I challenge you to find a more fun/challenging WW2 naval combat game that looks beautiful. I suggest playing wiht music enabled. It helps set the tone.","February 25","true","57.1"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","51","55","0","1"

The ship models are realistic, though lacking individual differences between class members and rebuilds, eg all county class cruisers are Berwick style with cut down aft deck and large deck house rear superstructure, London included; all QE class are as QE, Warspite has no faceted bows and Malaya and Barham have been modernised, similarly Repulse looks like Renown, etc.  This would be nice to see, like the different placements of mainmast between Scharnhorst and Gneisenau.  But that is beside the point - this game is a delight!  It plays convincingly and really delivers some of the best battles I've played - looks splendid too.\n\nWhat could be added - well, the extra models as I suggest, I would love a "ship editor" so I could "make or modify my own" - similarly a scenario editor.\nI have tried to get merchantmen to ram subs, but perhaps this isn't allowed?\nI would like more "bridge info" - compass heading, the bearings at the top of screen are always relative to the ship.\nI would like to choose the order in which my ships move and act.\nPerhaps the armour penetration values need tweaking to make sinkings more difficult (more realistic) - in real world, most naval engagements were lengthy and far fewer ships were sunk (or even hit) - but in Atlantic Fleet some heavy armour is penetrated too easily - I guess it is a balance to find between realism and gameplay needs.  Currently there are two difficulty settings - perhaps more settings for "easy" (lots of sinkings), "harder", "difficult". and "realistic" (for die-hard naval enthusiasts like me!) could be given?\n\nHow about a Jutland WWI game with this engine? - I would certainly buy it.  Armoured cruisers, protected cruisers, pre-dreadnoughts, battlecruisers (which really did blow up after a single salvo hit - at least British ones did), the emergeance of light cruiser and heavy, larger destroyers and the great dreadnought battlewagons\n\nSo how about French ships, Italian ships, Russian ships - this engine is worth it (we have Washington in the Atlantic, we should have New York too, and some US destroyers - Mediterranean campaign for both world wars (including Black Sea and Dardanelles?), and yes, integrate the Pacific in with it.\n\nThis calls out for a lot of expansion - because it is brilliant.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it - this is the game I have been waiting for at least 10 years - splendidly executed - well done.\n\nBuchanie\n\n\n\n\n","March 15","true","548.9"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","36","37","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XShadowY/recommended/420440/","XShadowY","XShadowY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XShadowY/","356 products in account","A take on the dynamic campaign\nFirst let me say that I really like the game, in particular for its "gunnery and aiming system". It`s a fresh and demanding change compared to "Victory at Sea" and "Battle Fleet 2". In this game, especially in comparison, experience will not make you too powerful, or the game too easy.\n\nBasically you constantly need to update the direction of your batteries and control the angle of the guns and you have different indicators to help you with that.\n\nHowever, the most reliable source of input is your own experience and the map on which you are able to track where your shots have landed during the past six turns, and how the fleets have moved since then. And after a while of playing you will get a better understanding of how much you need to adjust the range when your fleet is crossing the T, instead of steering head on towards the enemy and therefore drastically reducing the distance.\n\nYou have the option to extend the starting distance of the opposing fleets and add a wind modifier to the battles, so the engagements can get quite demanding and sometimes you will need several salvos to score your first hit.\n\nSo, you keep comparing your own assessment of the situation to the targeting computer`s calculations and making a better choice based on the map recordings than the value the computer is offering is really satisfying and can make the difference of landing the first hit, or watch some nice magazine explosions on your own ships.\n\nThe main and only game mode for me to play (after the "tutorial phase" has been finished) is the dynamic campaign. I want to be suprised by the events and random engagements and build my own fleet which I try to protect throughout the campaign (in the dynamic campaign you have the option to build 30 ships, 10 ships maximum per fleet).\n\nThe dynamic campaign in this game tries to be historical correct, so the engagements mainly happen around merchant shipping. The Axis forces try to sink a pre-defined value of supplies and the allied forces will do their best to stop them.\n\nUnfortunately, for me personally, this historic setting is a little bit too repetitive for my taste. I like clashes of big surface vessels, but, since they didn`t happen for real with Germany trying to avoid Her Majesty`s Royal Navy, you won`t find them during this dynamic campaign.\n\nSure, there are battleships around and you will fight them, but as an escort or rather small fleet. To reach the objective in sinking or protecting the convoys you need to spread your forces and this means you need cheap ships and many of them. ...and this means submarines or destroyers.\n\nAnd this brings me back to my aforementioned point: Submarines and Destroyers are not my particular favourite class of ships.\n...and during the dynamic campaign there`s a lot of Submarine vs. Destroyers. ...I mean... a lot. ... I mean ...a grindy lot.\n\nProbably historically correct, but for me not very thrilling. This also has something to do with the implementation of submarine warfare in this game, which is rather simplistic.\n\nIf you create a wolfpack and an engagement is about to start your submarines will be automatically placed around the convoy. This means a few of them are already in a good spot for firing their payload, but others have no chance of keeping the pace of the surface vessels, at least not when they are submerged.\n\nSince the game takes the "workload" off of you to manually have to destroy each and every merchant ship after you have knocked out the escort (which is a huge plus), you actually focus your fighting on the enemy combatants. Should you be able to destroy them, you are able to stop the battle and all merchant ships will count as "sunk".\n\nSo, there are 1-3 destroyers and (a little bit historically uncorrect I would say) instead of hunting the merchants, you start to hunt them. How do you hunt a destroyer moving in a torpedo-evading zig-zag line? You fan out your payload... and you do this with all of your subs. With a little bit of luck you will hit them badly, badly as in "there won`t be any opposition left" and you just "collect" the merchants...\n\nShould you not be as successful and one of them is even starting to bully you, no problem, you just dive away and are able to disengage from the battle. Hm...\n\nAnd as mentioned before, since you try to sink all merchant ships that have ever been built, these kind of engagements will happen a lot.\n\nAs a destroyer captain you just have to move over a sonar contact marking and drop your depth charges close to it. Hm, also not so thrilling... at least for me.\n\nBut, this is just my personal opinion, maybe the way submarine warfare is implemented in this game is exactly your thing...\n\nFor me the game shines in its surface battles. When you encounter an enemy battleship and can say good-bye to the idea of "I even won`t let them scratch the paint job of my battleship!!!"... Then it`s gloves off and a nail-biting shoot-out will commence.\n\nThings I noticed which give the game a little raw look and feel to it are an unintuitive interface with no tool-tips.\nInstead of dragging a wheel with pressed mouse button to reach an angle of "16.3" why not just let the player enter a value with the keyboard?\nWhen wanting to buy a new ship during the dynamic campaign you have to switch on the labelling of the map, which makes names and ports visible. Then click on a zone in front of a port to get to it. Then, in the harbour screen, you need to click on the "purchase" button...\nWhy not just add a purchase button below the map on the main screen?\n\nSubmarines have no heading indicator above the surface when they are diving. To check where your sub is going you need to move below sea level with the camera and look for yourself.\nAll different ammo types are on the same button, which you have to click several times to get to the one you want... and at the end of the battle you will notice... "Oh, I had 3 air strikes available?"\n\nYou want to check how many torpedoes are available or have been reloaded? Click the ammo button. You realized that you have none available and want to continue to the next turn? Press the same button again until it shows "Done"... Hm, a dedicated "End Turn" button would be smoother and more user friendly...\n\nIt looks like that the sea has always the same swell, unfortunately there`s no difference in visual depiction of rough or calm sea.\n\nI`m also missing some sound effects, like UI/ button sounds or firing of depth charges and torpedoes...\n\n\nI think the game has a lot of potential and I really like it. It is not my intention, if my criticism sounds a little bit harsh. I merely wanted to explain that some things might feel a little bit rough for potential new or interested customers.\n\nThe scenario might not be the perfect one for me (probably a Pacific game will match a little better for my taste), but`s that`s just my personal thing. The same is valid for this completely subjective "review".\n\nThe production value of this game is great and the naval warfare experience is unique nowadays, the developer is very active in the forum and, if you are only a little bit interested in turn-based navy engagements I would suggest you give this game a try.","March 1","true","22.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","16"

Don't even think twice, for this price is a steal and I've never had this fun with a naval game since the old days of Great Naval Battles. It's different than GNB, mind you, as this game has features GNB didn't, and GNB had some features this one doesn't (damage control for instance).  Maybe TF1942 would be a better comparison of what this game is like, but lots more features (airstrike control, submarines, ASW, etc). But the naval combat part is very similar, as you control your guns and aiming. Just not in real time but turn based. And the turn system works pretty well too. It's not "realistic" per se as distances are clearly abstracted and I think ships are a tad too easy to sink, but still it's got the right feeling to it.\n\nNot that is perfect though. I'd like the choice to fire more than one battery per turn (there's no reason to shoot the secondaries on your big battleship if you can fire your main guns...as you can fire once per turn only secondaries almost matter for nothing in most cases), UI is pretty simple (but even being simple, it works pretty well), I'd like a bit more input in the damage control part, etc.\n\nBut other than that, if you like GNB or TF1942 styled combat (that is, immersive, realistic feeling naval combat) seriously, this thing is fun as heck, and a total steal for the money.\n\nBut again, if you think WoWS portrays naval combat in any kind of immersive fashion, forget about this title, and don't downvote it because it's not like your favorite arcade. This is no arcade, and there's no reason to downvote it just because it's not one.","February 26","true","94.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I got really frustrated playing it and gave up. Here is why:\n\n1. The aim is done using an inclination angle. Yet, since ~1800 that people know how to convert an angle to a distance. I don't want to do that calculation on my own, and the game does not do this calculation for me (it recommends a crappy angle that anyone can do better after 1h of gameplay). Therefore, you have no way of mapping shoot inclnation to distance from target, which makes no sense.\n\n2. The ships start too damm close from each other in the beginning. A Battleship e.g. can start at torpedo range from a destroyer, and puff, no longer a battleship on turn 0. This makes no sense. In the dynamic camping, a Battleship can also start a battle with a destroyer, and sink it because the destroyer is not able to flee (destroyers are supposed to sail ~2x faster than a BShip... except in this game where 2 destroyers accept engaging a battleship)\n\n3. The bearing of previous shoots is not saved in the list of previous shoots (which is required for the lead when the wind affects shoots).\n\n4. The bearing of the previous shoot is not "saved" in the gun for the next turn. Conclusion: you need to actually write it somewhere (for every ship in your fleet) in case you want to keep a constant lead on the target.\n\n5. The map does not allow to measure distances (e.g. a compass?) I was actually using paper grid on the monitor to try to infer what was my previous distance from target, the new one, and see if other shoots were already made at this distance (because, from 1, you cannot convert distances to angles, you only have the previous shoots angles, nothing else). Nonsense.\n\n6. The torpedos are extremely overpowered. Here, u-boats eat destroyers for breakfast, and destroyers sink u-boats with torpedos, not deepcharges. I has never able to use deepcharges because u-boat sinks the destroyer while I move torwards them. Often, in the same turn the torpedo is shoot, the torpedo reaches the destroyer (torpedos are 100% accurate). Historically torpedos require a minimal distance to avoid exploding on the u-boat immediately after launched, and that is a reason destroyers approached u-boats as fast as possible.\n\nIn summary, the developers made a huge effort to add very nice models of the ships, make the game pleasant to see, but neglected an important part of the game, the shooting. I got frustrated and uninstalled the game. :/","March 19","false","4.4"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","42","72","4","5"

Atlantic Fleet is somewhat simpler, but it also panders to my long-lasting love with turn based strategy games.\n\nI'd really love some more ships, though. They put in some "paper ships" like the Z-Plan H-class battleships for the Germans or the British Lion-class, but have omitted, for example, the Graf Zeppelin aircraft carrier that was in fact built but later scrapped, leading to a certain degree of disadvantage for the Germans who have NO naval air capabilities whatsoever now. This might be accurate for a historical campaign setting, but for the free-for-all games it really puts the German side on a certain disadvantage (which is somewhat mitigated by their superior submarines)\n\nStill, it is a great game.

It does have a few menu issues here and there otherwise it is an EXTREMELY good port and one of the best I've seen of a mobile phone port. If you couldn't tell from the image and name, you control a fleet from one of two factions (or two as you can control both sides, and for the first time in a while, a game that actually has local multiplayer i.e. the person sitting next to you). The game takes a lot of practice to get a hold of and I highly recommend you go through the tutorial missions as they are A. Not too long and B. You can quit out of them at any time if you think you've understood. They also don't have any spoken dialogue which you can say is bad but it means that the tutorials are not on a set scripted path. You get placed in the sea, in control of the British Battleship Queen Elizabeth, Destroyers’ Jervis and Afridi or Carrier Courageous and told through text at the bottom of the screen what to do in the tutorial.\n\nThe tutorials are very well put together as they tell you what everything does and how things affect everything. The game takes Naval realism seriously and don't expect to hit the enemy ships first time, every time. You may get lucky once or twice, but don't get cocky or mad when you hit/miss. Gun caliber, movement by your ship, their ship and on hard mode the wind can all affect your distance and everything else.\n\nIt is turn based so don't expect RT combat. I think that would just cause havoc. Yes it can be hard to get into because turns can be excruciatingly long and tedious, but its turn based so what do you expect.\n\nThe two factions are:\nBritish and Commonwealth navies. FT. USA\nGerman navy.\n\nPros: (Out of 3 +)\nVery good and well put together port +++\nAccurate ships +++\nHard to get good at, extremely hard to master +\n\nCons: (Out of 3 -)\nOnly two factions ---\nSome graphical bugs with text boxes in the tutorials when playing at a lower resolution and windowed - Excused because that’s just being nitpicky.\n\nThis game is extremely good and a worthwhile pick up even at its full price. Yes it may be a mobile phone port and that may put you off. However it is a really good game, I know surprising there are good mobile phone ports. All this game needs is expansion to its factions and even to the existing factions with more ships or etc. Yes the game is limited to one theater, the Atlantic, (although there is a mission where you are fighting off the coast of Australia so... OK?) However there is room for two more or even four more factions. My idea is this:\n\nAllies:\nUK and Commonwealth Navies * Expanded upon\nUS Navy * Expanded greatly upon\nFrench Navy\nSoviet Union Navy\n\nAxis:\nGerman and puppet state Navies (i.e. Slovakia, Belgium, Netherlands etc.)\nItalian and puppet state Navies (i.e. Yugoslavia, Albania)\nRomanian Navy\nBulgarian Navy\n\nAgain, besides my recommendations, this game is very good and the best Atlantic Naval battle simulator I've seen and more a mobile phone port it blows my mind. A definite must buy.\n\n**SIDE NOTE**\nI purposefully left out the campaign, in my review, as I haven't played much of the campaign and probably wont'. Not because it is bad but just because I just want to blow ships up without having to rank up ships or go through any of that. If you want to you can go right ahead.\n**SIDE NOTE**\n\n8.95 / 10 - So close to a 10, just needs more content to mess around with.

It is leaning toward a sim when it comes to torpedoes solution calculation for submarines. Moreover, torpedoes have gyroscopes now. There is also room for improvement when it comes to damage management. I enjoyed the Aeronaval dimension yet this part needs more improvement.\nFor the price, it is a great game that have a lot of room for improvement, but don't fool yourself you are not shooting zombies here. That game can be tricky and is already a healthy base for something that can be outstanding in the WWII naval warfare genre. Grab it now when it is affordable, because if developed in the right direction, that game could worth three times it's actual price.\n","February 26","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics are excellent, game content is exciting (and historical) and also refreshingingly differant and there is a good tutorial too which is well worth going through as there are some new forms of combat I've not seen before.\nThe setting for this hybrid naval strategy 1st/3rd person shooter, simulation is the Battle of the Atlantic between British/CW naval forces and the German Kriegsmarine. This is a nice change from the Pacific TBH, which has been very heavily covered already, though I'm sure the devs will eventually move the action to the Pacific/Indian Ocean as an add-on, hopefully the Mediterranean too.\nYou get to play either side in single missions or campaign mode, and your forces comprise of every type of surface warship from destroyers up to battleships and aircraft carriers. Cargo vessels and even German commerce raiders that look like cargo vessels are included. The sinking graphics are amazing and you'll see and hear the stricken vessel slowly plummet towards the sea bed by taking your camera underwater as it sinks. Also included is a good range of historical aircraft from carrier planes through to long range maritime aircraft based on land. The types of combat you can expect to perform as the player are:\n\n1. Gunnery 3rd person.\n2. Torpedo attacks 1st and 3rd person.\n3. Depth charge/hedgehog attacks against subs 3rd person (very well done)\n4. Dive bombing with carrier aircraft 3rd person\n5. Torpedo bombing with carrier aircraft 3rd person\n6. Level bombing with multi engine bombers 3rd person\n\nLike the excellent "Battle Fleet 2" the devs have chosen to keep the game from becoming a manic clickfest by utilising a good turn based system whereby there are movement and action phases for each vessel. This works really well especially when you have multiple assets under command, and allows you to plan tactics and strategy.\nI'm currently in the RN campaign and it's a lot of fun. Basically you start off by buying a destroyer with your available war bonds and to add further ships to your fleet you'll need to sink enemy tonnage to be rewarded with more war bonds. In my first try I'd graduated to 2 destroyers, a Fido class cruiser and a light escort carrier carrying Swordfish strike planes. All was going swimmingly until I was ambushed by U-boats and made a mess of my defence and now I'm back at the Admiralty rather sheepishly asking for enough war bonds to start over again!\nEven though the game is not complete yet I definitely recommended AF already.","May 16","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just found out this was on steam. This game is my favorite moblie game of all time!\nSo after playing the PC version, I have to say its strange seeing it blown up on a monitor. The PC version got a nice bump in graphical quaity, particularly the ocean. I do however think the smoke and fire effects look better on the moblie. The smoke particularly; it was much thicker and more convincing.   The controls felt a little akward considering I'm used to swiping, but they work well. If the UI was tweaked, and they got rid of some of the mobile hold overs (2d pilot graphic), this game would be a beast! As it is though, its still a blast and 10 bucks is worth supporting a good game company that doesn't crap out pay to progress junk.

I am not playing this on a mobile phone . I bought it for my PC.\n\nFirst off it is almost (90%) impossible to have a ship survive more than 3-4 missions in the campaign mode. The German ships will in all likelyhood give you the first round, since they almost always miss with the first volley. After that the almost never miss. You will probably never attain enough Renown to purchase the Battleships, since you have to rebuy lost ship to complete the next mission.  Submarines are all but useless if you miss on your first shot, They reload torps so slow, that if you do get a second chance to shoot your target is so far off you will never catch them. Thier movement is dreadfull as well.\n\nI agree with the other Negative posts in this 100%. I tried the Battle for the Atlantic campaign twice, and on both occasions my Battleship was sunk on the 2nd move buy an invisible bomber/torp plane that appeared out of nowhere leaveing me with a Light Cruiser and a Destroyer against a Battleship and his friends.\n\nPros:\nLooks good on my PC\nShips are pretty cool\n\nCons:\nAI cheats like there is no tomorrow\nPlayer ships accuracy is horrible, splash guide will tell you some usefull information but not anough to ballance out.

If they sink a convoy they get 30k+ renown. The germans dont have convoys for the british to sink. If you destroy a group of german ships you'll usually get less than 10k renown.

Putting shots on target is a lot more hit and miss than it feels it ought to be. In-game estimates meant to help you with this are often wildly off the mark, making combat rather frustrating. Also, I find I have a bit of trouble keeping track of the battlefield during night battles, as there are no interface prompts or icons that let you know which of the ships are yours and which are enemies (on the map, yes, but in 3D mode not so much).\n\nI need more time to come to grips with this game, but even as a cheap impulse purchase I am not overly happy. I was hoping for an off-line alternative for World of Warships, but this offers a lot less satisfaction/hour than WoWS.\n\nAt this stage I am neither recommending this game, nor am I saying you should not buy it if you are into WWII naval combat. I will say that it isn't a very intuitive game, and had me frustrated in under 15 minutes. I want to like it, I just don't.

Especially the ships look superb.\n\nAlthough the mobile roots are clearly there it does not really distract/detract from the overal gameplay.\n\nAtlantic Fleet basic controls are easy to learn, yet the variety of options creates an interesting and (excuse the pun) deep combat environment. The player controls ships, subs, land- and carrier based a/c fighting on the surface, below the surface and in the air.\n\nThe decision to go turn-based is what makes this game shine, the player is not forced to enter a click fest, but instead can focus on tacics on multiple levels.\n\nAt the time of writing this I've been doing the tutorial and historical missions. My first play easily absorbing me for three hours. Been quite a while that a game draws my in like that on a first play - which mainly takes me half an hour - but I just could not stop playing Atlantic fleet.\n\nHeavy caliber salvos, torpedo spreads, ASW with both DDs and carrier a/c (challenge), torpedo bombers (love those), a/c with 8" rockets, heavy patrol bombers level bombing (timing). You can do a ton of things. And when the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, you lay your smoke screens to get out of Dodge.\n\nBest WW2 naval experience I had for some time and hard to beat for simple game mechanics yet absorbing and effective tactical game play.\n\nThis game is for people who like WW2 naval combat, enjoy simple game mechanics and are satisfied with effective graphics.\n\nThis game is not for people who expect to control everything in minute detail or demand the very latest of graphics standards.\n\nHighly recommended - will play this a lot.\n\nYes, old GNB fan - still my benchmark game, nothing surpassed it in my book, although the rest of series was good tooo its gameplay shifted away from the original.

And the battles are remarkable with plenty of deep gameplay - I especially love the torpedo plane runs and try to ram the subs which is more difficult than it sounds.\n\nThe custom game on its own is worth the money - had loads of fun pitting a Flower Class Corvette against a U-Boat like in the film the Cruel Sea. And if you want to see what HMS Nelson against the Graf Spee would be like you can do that as well along with practically every type of other ship.\n\nBut the main fun is in the dynamic campaign - kudos to the devs for putting that in! Its really addictive. Yes the missions are great but the dynamic campaign is where the game shines - you never know what you are going to meet - U-boats or battleships or cruisers etc and you get differing weather and time of day. The weather moves in a realistic manner. The game features ballistics, damage control, smoke, torpedoes, Swordfish, hedgehogs, squid - you name it its all in here.\n\nAs yet it never gets overwhelming - managing a sub and firing a spread of torpedoes is really easy, flying a low level torpedo plane attack is dramatic, takes skill but its also scary, but not complicated. Learning to get the range of that distant battleship before it gets yours is similarly nervewracking and exciting - its easy to get to grips with the mechanics but actually doing it takes experience.\n\nBest buy I have made for years. Its a simple game with loads of depth, loads of accuracy and surprisingly deep mechanics, and the dynamic campaign means it will stay fresh for a long time. And for £6 its a steal, it should be at least £20.","March 3","true","43.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azynkron/recommended/420440/","azynkron","BadTrip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azynkron/","282 products in account","It's all it's simpleness, it's very enjoyable. There's quite a satisfaction attached to hit an enemy ship with a full broadside or to sneak up with your subs and sink that flag ship. The controls are quite easy to learn and it's not in the same spirit as the Navy sims out there. There are some "mini games" within the game as well when you do torpedo runs with e.g. a Swordfish airplane. It's quite crude in it's implementation but still you can use it to your advantage when you are close enough to your own airsupport.\n\nWith that said, there are quite a few problems.\n\n1. The enemy subs seems to be able to exit combat at will. Several times I've had them locked on by up to 4 destroyers and suddenly you just get the message "U-96 exits combat". This has to be fixed. I would understand if the sub was able to evade my fleet, but there's no way for it to escape once the sonars have located one. In real life, yes, but in the game no.\n\n2. Air strikes. The problem with these is that you can't freely put a marker on the map to carry them out. They have to be locked onto a target. And if the target is a sub, well, then you have to click on the actual sub and not on the surface. This is quite an issue since the only ships that can target a sub are the destroyers, it means that it's a hit and miss click fest until you get lucky.\n\n3. Targets are not shared among the rest of you fleet. It seems that the Captains wants to keep enemy ships to themselves. Not very realistic. If one ship spots an enemy, of course they would let the rest of the ships know the bearing and distance.\n\n4. The end game is not clear. Not clear at all. I'm not saying that there should be missions as such since it's a sandbox, kind of, game but some things just doesn't make any sense. Take merchant ships for instance. Frequently you get messages that some Nazi sub has sunk some 30000 tons of loot near Greenland but it has no real impact on your game. It doesn't feel very necessary to protect them besides that it gives you an opportunity to sink some enemy ships. As an enemy sub Captain you don't earn any "money" either for civilian ships, only military. Given that the whole Atlantic navy war was about sinking as much goods as possible, this makes no sense what so ever.\n\n5. I've had several glitches with the aircraft carriers where they suddenly become invisible. Invinsible would be nice sometimes, but the camera bugs out and only shows a grey window. You can still command them, but it's pointless since you can't se what they are doing.\n\n6. Ranging. This is also an issue since you have no tools to range an enemy ship. If you can visually see a target, apparently they have hired a flock of monkeys that sits below deck and gives you a guestimate of the range. Now, I know how it works in real life (the same as for artillery on land) that you shoot-correct-shoot, but they did have crude range finders (optical devices that when converged on a target would give a estimation). Luckily, most of the time, the enemy seems to share the same trained monkeys. It would also make sense if your more exprienced crews would give better rangings than a noob ship. It should pay off to keep a ship alive.\n\n7. AA. There should be a way to fire on incoming aircraft. It seems that it's a pure 50/50 now if your ships will be able to hit them with their AA artillery/guns. Some aircrafts, the ME 110s in particular, never seem to miss either with their torpedoes.\n\nThere are probably more stuff that I can't think of at the moment, but these are some issues that leaps to mind.\n\nOverall, yes, it's quite fun and enjoyable. You don't have to be a sim freak to figure it out and once you get to fight with your big Battle ships that fires shells the size of small buses, it's very fun. Beware though, it's more towards arcade so if you are looking for a sim you need to keep that in mind.","March 3","true","50.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And the battles are remarkable with plenty of deep gameplay - I especially love the torpedo plane runs and try to ram the subs which is more difficult than it sounds.\n\nThe custom game on its own is worth the money - had loads of fun pitting a Flower Class Corvette against a U-Boat like in the film the Cruel Sea. And if you want to see what HMS Nelson against the Graf Spee would be like you can do that as well along with practically every type of other ship.\n\nBut the main fun is in the dynamic campaign - kudos to the devs for putting that in! Its really addictive. Yes the missions are great but the dynamic campaign is where the game shines - you never know what you are going to meet - U-boats or battleships or cruisers etc and you get differing weather and time of day. The weather moves in a realistic manner. The game features ballistics, damage control, smoke, torpedoes, Swordfish, hedgehogs, squid - you name it its all in here.\n\nAs yet it never gets overwhelming - managing a sub and firing a spread of torpedoes is really easy, flying a low level torpedo plane attack is dramatic, takes skill but its also scary, but not complicated. Learning to get the range of that distant battleship before it gets yours is similarly nervewracking and exciting - its easy to get to grips with the mechanics but actually doing it takes experience.\n\nBest buy I have made for years. Its a simple game with loads of depth, loads of accuracy and surprisingly deep mechanics, and the dynamic campaign means it will stay fresh for a long time. And for £6 its a steal, it should be at least £20.","March 3","true","43.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The came out with a few versions, but my favorite was the first, which was the North Atlantic. To me there hasn't been a game like that with a good mix of arcade and strategy, until now. I have played other ship battle games and there are good ones and there are not so god ones. I was recommended Atlantic Fleet today, so I bought it and gave it a try. While it's not quite the experience I had with GNB of the NA, from what I played in an hour, it is a very enjoyable game. There is a lot I need to read up on and find out what works and what doesn't, but if you are looking for something that is tactical light but still needing some and arcade moderate to light, this is a good choice. The price is very good as well. I did a few training missions and then played the Bismark/Prince Eugen vs Hood/Prince of Wales. I played twice. I was beat in the first game, light damage to POW and heavy to the Hood. 2nd game I lost the PE and clobbered the Hood and POW. In rotating the camera I was able to see the POW not only slip under the waves, but start her plunge into the depths, while air bubbles percolated from her hull. That is nice detail.\nI say, give it a spin. I think you will enjoy it, I know I did. Great job to the devs!","April 7","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or maybe I haven't got the hang of it yet!\nA wide variety of ships are available for the Royal Navy and the Kriegsmarine plus a few for the USN but there are some notable absences; German 'Wolf' and 'Seeadler' torpedo boats, the disguised raider 'Thor', British armed merchant cruisers and 'Hunt' class destroyers, American destroyer escorts would all be good additions (DLC pack maybe, pretty please Killerfish Games?).\nAlso, Atlantic Fleet could easily form the basis for further games set in the Mediterranean  (Battle of Cape Matapan, Force K just for a start) or the First World War (Coronel, The Falklands, Emden vs Sydney, the Dover Patrol, I could go on but I won't).\nHighly recommended and very addictive.","May 29","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven\'t played a better PC representation of the Atlantic battles. You get submarine, surface, and air action plus two campaigns! This is no arcade game. It is not easy to get your shots on target until you realistically adjust gun elevation and allow for wind.\n\nOne point, the manual isn\'t right about the keystroke for the ESC key to bring up the menu. That is done by clicking the small curly arrow in the bottom left corner. That\'s how you exit the game. It saves automatically after a battle or ship launch. Yes, you can purchase additional ships in the campaign games.\n\nThoroughly enjoyable.","June 1","true","33.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
