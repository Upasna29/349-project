And this one, Moorhuhn X, is probably one of the best in the series.\n\nLong version:While the franchise branched into several genres, most Moorhuhns games are one-level gallery shooters, where you shoot a great number of chickens with your shotgun. Why? There is no real reason. We just loved shooting video game chickens in Europe near the turn of the century.\n\nThe store title is misleading, because this game here is actually a remake of the fifth instalment of the main series, originally called Moorhuhn X. It was sort of a turning point back then, where they introduced a new chicken design and a bonus level (although reaching it is quite tricky).\nMoorhuhn X is also considered to be the best of the series by many, thanks to the fun level design full of secrets to explore in the allotted short time limit. Still, by today’s standards, it is still nothing more than a one-off novelty game made for those who want a little nostalgia.","November 1, 2015","true","0.7"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

Even spending a measly .50 cents on sale was regrettable.\n\nAll the game amounts to is one scene where you shoot with one type of gun (sorry, never saw that special gun in the video up top).  You are given only 1 minute and 30 seconds to shoot a bunch of chickens and a few obstacles.  Then the game kicks you to a high score screen.\n\nThat's seriously all there is to it. No other scenes, no extended time,  no game modes, and no real options other than audio off/on and language-select. Plus, there's no obvious 'win' state - just a high scores screen.\n\nSave your money and play a free shooting gallery game on the interwebs.","April 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","19","32","4","1"

Why don't just shoot it out in one of the most well known games of the late 90's?\n\nCrazy Chicken had an small world wide success while being a big thing in germany with many different versions and it also crossed over to become screensaver or wallpaper for many office desktops. The "Moorhuhn" game series (german title) was  incredible and even today no one knows why. Maybe we germans just got so much suppressed anger in us that we need to kill poor little animals with an shotgun to the face while they smile at us with no fear in their eyes.\n\nAnyway, the game is so simple that an infant could learn how to play it and if the "Trenchcoat Mafia" would have played it before the Columbine Massacre, it would have got blamed like Manson. You aim, you shoot, you reload... that's it. Not very clever or somehow heavy to do and you wonder what all the fuzz is about. Biggest complains came by the german animal-right-society and at that point I started to wonder why they did not complain about the game "Worms", but they got no faces.\n\nFor being an game that was produced as an gimmick to sell an whisky brand, this game has surely come an long way, but is it an good game? To be honest: This is not an good game. It can surely be fun, but only in a kind of retro-feeling-mood when you look back and try to remember all the stupid stuff you did in your life. If you never heard about it, you won't miss it.\n\n\n3/10 Remember, remember - The 5th of November (1999)","May 26, 2015","false","0.9"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","16","27","5","1"

Oh, you did not watch it... Please watch it and keep on with this review.\n\nDid you hate those chickens? No, then move along then, this game is not for you. If so, did you want to kill them for being chickens with persona? Then step this way\n\nYou have short amount of time to kill them chickens for a score. That is all. This game is just for local high score. Or what I call a two minute stress relief from everyday life. Kill the chicken and reload. Do not forget to reload. And shoot them crazy chickens. Does killing chicken make you feel like you are doing the whole world justice? ♥♥♥♥ yes. And do not forget to kill those ♥♥♥♥ing chickens. Now excuse me, I need to hunt for my dinner tonight. It is chicken killing time.\n\nSide notes: What you see above on the top page is what to expect. You shoot chickens, crazy ones at that.

Good memories in mind, I go ahead and purchase the bundle (and paid far less than the $1.99 on Steam) for it.\n\nCrazy chicken is a pretty basic game where you have to shoot as much as chicken possible in 1:30 min.  The control somehow seems to have changed from the .EXE standalone and using the left mouse button for both shooting and moving the mouse is not a good control design.\n\nThe game might be good if you have like 5 min to kill or trying to release some steam at work (assuming you can install Steam on computer at work), but besides that... the game becomes really boring really fast especially the extra funny stuff in the background tend to repeat and are not longer funny (or weird if you caught the sheeps fornicating in the back).\n\nThe only use I could see for this game as some sort of entertainment is for drinking party... Get drunk and see how you and your guesses handle shooting chicken while being impaired.  I am not sure that a valid use to spend $1.99.","August 14, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
