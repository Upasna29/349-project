Buy it now!\n\nLong Answer:  I picked up this game last year from Nyu Media's website, and I'm glad it finally made it to Steam.  Yeah, I've got a few buddies I'm going to corrupt with some Alltynex goodness.\n\nThere's a great sense of design behind this game.  From the way the levels flow into each other, to the progression of escalating boss fights, everything looks in place.\n\nEven the unique bullet colors have consistent meanings; some can be absorbed, some can be reflected, and some can be shot down.  Knowing when to shoot, when to reflect, and when to just let off the fire button and recharge, is the key to victory.\n\nThe scoring system comes naturally.  Use the reflect feature well, and get big multipliers.  It's great fun sending off a mass of reflected bullets and homing lasers, followed by some giant x64 kills.  Or for those who just want to play to the end and enjoy the spectacle, continues are awarded on a regular basis to aid progress.","March 27, 2014","true","3.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/awesam/recommended/281860/","awesam","Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/awesam/","2093 products in account","Finally the renowned doujin Shoot'em up trilogy "The Tale of ALLTYNEX" is getting released on Steam. Starting with RefleX the second game in the series.\n\nGameplay:\nPolished and intuitive, the key mechanic of the game is your ships relfecting shield. When activated the shield reflects bullets, but your ships energy is drained fast and when it gets low enough the shield stops working and even your weapons get weaker. So using the reflector-shield requires timing and strategy, mastering the game requires a lot of pattern recognition, good timing and knowing when to use the shield.\n\nSound:\nThe sound design is spot-on, catchy electronic retro music. With nice sound effect feedback from explotions and hits.\n\nGraphics:\nLooks basically like an Arcade game from the early 90's. But with some modern effects like lensflares and transparencies. It's pretty good looking for a low resolution 2D game, but the animation is somewhat lacking. The explotions and lazer effects look however satisfying.\n\nOverall:\nImpressive for a Doujin game, this could have passed as an professionally produced Arcade game in the 90's. I would recommend this game for any veteran fans of the Shoot'em up genre, the gameplay and music is top notch. But the graphics do look dated, and it is a shame that the developer did not allow making modifications to the game, so it is missing Steam achievements and leaderboards. Also the game lacks configuration options in-game, you have to find the config executable in the steamapps/common/RefleX directory.\n\nFor people completely new to the genre, out of the games available on Steam I still recommend starting out with Ikaruga. The only reason being it looks modern and has a great well polished PC port with full Steam features. However RefleX is likely more fun and easier to grasp than Ikaruga for beginners, but not everyone will accept the dated look.","March 29, 2014","true","8.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

The gameplay revolves around your ability to produce a reflective shield, similar to Giga Wing. If you kill an enemy with a reflected bullet, you get a score multiplier for a little while. If you continue killing enemies with reflected bullets while the multiplier is still active, it goes even higher, to a maximum of x64. You can't just keep the shield on all the time, though, as you have a limited amount of energy for it, which recharges while you aren't using it, and does so more quickly if you aren't shooting. Speaking of shooting, your firepower is tied directly to how much shield energy you have left. As an aside, you don't get a traditional lives system in this game. Instead, you have a health gauge which is fully repaired at certain points. Whether or not you will prefer this to a traditional lives system is subjective.\n\nAs for the presentation, the music, graphics, and story are top-notch. I have nothing more to add there. My only real complaint here is that this version of RefleX doesn't have the Steam overlay (even though ALLTYNEX Second and Kamui will), so you'll need something like Puush if, say, you want to take a screenshot of your personal best score. There are also no online leaderboards (also something the other two games in the trilogy will have). Overall, though, if you haven't bought this yet, go ahead and do so. It's awesome.","March 28, 2014","true","0.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

RefleX features a shield system where your ship can activate an impenetrable shield that not only protects you from enemy fire, but also redirects certain enemy fire back to the enemies! However, energy for the shield is strictly limited, and can only be replenished quickly by not shooting. As such, the game demands that you know when and when not to shoot, shield, and send lasers back, and that demands practice.\n\nThankfully, the game gives you extra continues whenever you get a game over, so you will eventually see the end screen if you persevere. However, we all know that that's not how shmups are meant to be played - and the game will only record your high score if you don't continue, in line with that "one credit completion" mentality. So practice, persevere, go beyond your limits and post that 1CC hi-score for all to see!","March 30, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The excellent visuals, music and enemy designs will lure you in, the intense action will keep you playing. While the patterns are a bit too bullethellish for my taste it ultimately didn't matter - RefleX is an excellent effort and possibly my favourite shmup on Steam right now. The reflect-system that is in place provides a nice dynamic between firing your lasers and avoiding bullets to recharge as well as using reflected shots to score the big points.\n\nI gotta say: I love Stage 3 - it stands out the most for me. It is a massive space battle among many capital ships - it is so epic! Gigantic lasers and all. And it reminds me nicely of one of my favourite shmups ever (Raystorm).

This game is fantastic, most people claim Kamui to be the best of the trilogy but I disagree.  There is a certain style behind all of the Siter Skain games that flows throughout (even if it is less apparent in A2) and I really like the feel of these games but at the same time each game in the trilogy also completely rips off a larger commercial shmup.  The balancing act between what comes from them and what comes from somewhere else is what makes this title stand out to me out of the three since it focuses on the shielding mechanic made popular by Gigawing and made better by Mars Matrix.  Unlike Kamui which takes from a personal favorite of mine, Rayforce (Galactic Attack USA, Layer Section PAL I believe, get it on the Saturn if you don't have it), I don't enjoy Gigawing or Mars Matrix so I was completely open to their take on the gimmick.  To me, RefleX doesn't feel like a copy-cat while Kamui does making this the definitive Skain title (I also don't care for Silvergun and other games like it but A2 still couldn't sell me on the concept).  Keep an eye out for Kamui and A2 soon because despite sounding like I don't care for it I really do think Kamui is a masterpiece but it refined something great for me rather than breaking new ground which is still a great thing and a lot of mainstream gamers tend to dig the Silvergun style of shmup that A2 offers and does pretty well.","March 27, 2014","true","2.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Renders ALL sprites (ships, shots, menu items, explosions, pretty much everything) with large black boxes around them, obscuring nearby sprites, and the developer refuses to allow the game code to be altered in any way, broken or not.  So RefleX is hideous and unplayable for some of buyers due to a simple rendering bug, and Siter Skain wants it to stay that way.  The other two Tale of Alltynex games don't have this issue (nor do any of my other shmups), but RefleX is definitely buyer beware, given the absolute refusal to fix even game-breaking bugs.\n\nPS: To those of you marking these facts "unhelpful", I'm glad you were fortunate enough to receive a playable game, but I can't recommend a game that doesn't work, and buyers should know that if it doesn't work, it simply will not be fixed.

If you're looking for more on Steam you COULD buy this, but there are many better ones to find.","February 29","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Okay, but this can get frustrating to play.\n\n\nThis is a fun bullet hell spacey top-down view late 1980's styled arcade shooter which will be fairly familiar to anyone who's played Crimson Clover or Raiden III. However the various weapons systems of your spacecraft can take some getting used to (they are quite a bit more complex than in most other shooter arcade styled games of this kind) and this game is quite a bit more challenging (and can be frustrating) than many other games of this type. The levels and enemies are fairly creative and the action is intense though.","February 6","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has great shooting mechanics and oldschool SNES style graphics. As you gameover the game gives you more credits and lets you get farther in the game as you improve. Maybe you eventually won't need them. Either way, RefleX is a very tough shooter with great controls and mechanics and I very much recommend it.","May 24","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a straight and clear shmup with bullet hell elements, where you can shield yourself from the bullets and even reflect them with the shield. From the start you have your weapon at maximum strength and already rolling, which is an amazing feat for the game! This game goes straight to the action and you won't spend any time without doing anything.\n\nThe game is also pretty cool, and really hard. You have to master the use of your shield. A good thing is that you have 6 health in a life, and so you won't die instantly (which makes sense for a spaceship). Also, it is hard but it makes easier by , each time you play, to finish the game, since you gain more continues.\n\nI don't have much to say, this game is pretty cool and you should play. If you like shmups you will surely like this game also. You may just think the game is a bit expensive, but you just have to wait for a sale and all is done.","May 18","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
