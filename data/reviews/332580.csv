"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/332580/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","434 products in account","Take a journey with me through a twisted mind; a place where things aren’t quite as they appear, and where surprises await you on every screen. This strange new land is filled with undocumented creatures and mechanisms that are as entrancing as they are dangerous. But these lands are no place for a dog to be separated from its owner, and you will need an eye for details, as well as the ability to think laterally, if you are to return Mimpi to his master. If you can navigate your new surroundings, acquaint yourself with the locals and solve the many tricky puzzles that await you, just maybe he can make it home.\n\nMimpi is an odd creation, like the mutant offspring of Monty Python and Sergeant Pepper, on a mutual acid trip. Its vast sprawling lands are filled with fantastical mechanisms and beasts, all awash with vivid, eye-searing colour and a cacophony of bewildering sounds. Despite its simple, papercraft appearance there is detail by the bucketload, be it in the behaviour of its mythical creatures, the movement cycles of obstacles, or the complexity of the game’s puzzles.\n\nI could never quite pin Mimpi down to just one genre though, finding myself in a complex action platforming set-piece one moment, and a tricky pattern-based puzzle the next.  Progression hinges on your ability to spot patterns in your environment and put them into practice at some point later in the game. So, whilst that pretty design you saw earlier on the wall didn’t look significant, it almost certainly is.\n\nEnvironments are  brilliantly random and destined to raise a smile, and maybe even an eyebrow. Each location is packed with detail, as well as a number of friendly and hostile creatures who can aid or hinder you on your journey. I can’t say I have ever played ‘Simon Says’ with an overgrown jungle flower before, but I think I liked it – perhaps even more than I enjoyed playing volleyball with the elephant/foot hybrid animal. To be a fly on the wall of Silicon Jelly’s development offices would be both an enlightening and scarring event, for sure.\n\nDon’t mistake the game’s friendly appearance as an indication of its difficulty; Mimpi‘s canine odyssey is not for the faint hearted. As aforementioned, if you can’t think outside of the box you won’t be able to make your way to the end of the game. Its puzzles can be brutally difficult if you don’t know what you are doing, and seldom will you be able to fumble your way through them. If you manage to find enough lightbulbs though, you can buy hints to help you progress. For a change of pace you can also give Mimpi a makeover with a variety of different costumes.\n\nSilicon Jelly have done a bang-up job porting the game from mobile to PC, and the gameplay never misses a beat. Despite the action lending itself more to a touchscreen, the keyboard and mouse control scheme is intuitive and responsive, too. My only gripe is the oversized mobile phone game interface. A quick re-jig of the menus for PC version would hae been much appreciated, and given a better initial impression of the game, but you can’t have everything, I suppose.\n\nMimpi is a small dog on a big adventure and you’d be missing out big time if you don’t join him for the fun. It’s a game of joyous discovery that rewards an inquisitive mind with some of the wackiest, off the wall humour curently on the Steam platform. It’s also a generous game, too, with a decent amount of content to keep you scratching your head into the wee hours.\n\nGood dog, Mimpi. Good dog.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWith thanks to  Silicon Jelly and Crescent Moon Games.

You drag me in because you play as a dog, and then betray me with terrible puzzles (if you can call them that) with glitchy and awkward platforming.\n\n14 people said this game was good. DO NOT TRUST THEM. I'll tell ya why this phone game isn't even worth five bucks, and why you should go buy a burger instead.\n\nThe platforming is badly programmed and inconsistent. That's about all I can say for it. As for the "puzzles":\n\n- Multiple instances of simon says memory games\n- That one "switch game" in which you press one switch and it affects the other two or three beside it. Yeah, those are fun, right!?\n- About a million trial and error "puzzles" which require no thought whatsoever- they are just there to annoy you and lengthen the game time\n- The one where you're forced to make a set of rings with openings line up by holding them in place, except it's made even harder than it normally is\n\nNow that alone should be enough to help you steer clear but I'll also share that I had 3, count em' 3, game breaking bugs that forced me to restart the game to continue. This is a two hour game. I shouldn't have to encounter bugs that force me to restart 3 damned times. I don't care how small your indie team is, it's unacceptable.\n\nThis game is lazy, repetitive, and all around annoying to play in every respect.. the couple of hours I put into it felt more like half a day. Oh, and they also stole the don't-pop-the-bubble thing idea from Mario Galaxy and made it less fun! I also encountered a game breaking bug in that segment as well. I won't go into detail, but it'd be nice if people actually playtested their games thoroughly.\n\nI could write a review that flowed better, but Mimpi isn't worth any more of my time. The ONE GOOD thing I can say about the game is that I like the cute idea of a dog's perspective on average things playing into his dreams. Everything else was painful to force myself through. Please spare yourself. This is basically a bad flash platformer with a $5 pricetag on it.  You do not want this.","April 7, 2015","false","2.6"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","22","32","2","1"

The puzzles in this game are fairly easy for the most part, but some made me use hints. In the mobile version you unlock hints via microtransactions. In this version you can collect them in the levels or play a little bit of tetris.\nSadly the tetris minigame is broken as long as you don't have a controller recognized as your main input device.\nAs of 22nd of January the tetris minigame is fixed.\n\nIn a puzzle-platformer you might do something else other than solving puzzles. The platforming in this game is decent: You have quite good control over your horizontal movement, but in terms of jumping you really don't have that much control over your height. That might come from the fact that the game is played with virtual controls on mobile devices and therefore can't be that accurate in that regard.\n\nAfter each level there is a hidden object minigame, which is a nice change of pace.\n\nOne playthrough of the game can be done within about 2 hours. When you want to go for all collectibles though there is a little bit of replayability.\n\nConclusions:\nAll in all I have to say that the game is worth giving a shot, it's 4.99€. It is a very well made mobile port and I'd consider it worth the buy.\n\n\nNote: Apart from being granted early access to the game via a review code, I have been given 5 more codes to give to you guys. You can get one code by commenting on this review until the 25th of January.\nThe giveaway is now over, thanks for your participation.","January 20, 2015","true","5.4"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","12","20","5","6"

The controls are unresponsive and imprecise. Mostly that doesn't matter. I does matter in the two underwater levels. Everybody hates underwater levels so let's make two. Some of the puzzles require perfectly timed precision jumps, these will take dozens of frustrating attempts to get through.  The puzzles can best be described as everyone's least favorite puzzles from any puzzle game you have played. The hint system is sometimes useful and sometimes not. You have to play Tetris to get your hint. When I didn't want to play Tetris I'd watch walkthroughs. All the walkthroughs I could find were people playing the game for the first time. So, apparently, nobody plays this twice.","April 17","false","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hidogs/recommended/332580/","hidogs","hidogs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hidogs/","45 products in account","This game is pretty fun, but also pretty annoying at times. I love the colorful graphics and art, but I feel like sometimes the puzzle is pretty random and not using logic at all. For the rope puzzles, you'll often have to keep trying combinations until you get lucky, though there are a few tricks to make it easier.  I have not yet beat the game, but I will eventually. It takes time. If you want a challenging and sometimes random puzzle, with bright and fun designs.\n\nPROS\n-You can play for hours. It's not something you beat quickly.\n-The colorful art and design add a nice happy background for you to look at when you get upset you can't win.\n-Plenty of the puzzles are really clever and you feel really good when you finally figure it out.\n-Aside from the puzzles, the platforming aspect is pretty neat\n\nCONS\n-Sometimes it's really cleverly thought out and sometimes the puzzles are random. You can't always tell the difference.\n-There are hints, but you have to buy them. If you get stuck you're better off looking for a walkthrough.\n\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game, but only to paitient people. I'm pretty happy with it personally though, I've bought a lot worse for a lot more.","February 17, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That's no bad thing, either. If you found Playdead's morbid platformer too dark for your tastes, this game's bright optimism might be just what you're looking for. It's a game about simple pleasures as you take your little dog on the weirdest walkies ever.\n\nThere are a number of missed opportunities here, notably the absence of Steamworks features like trading cards or achievements, which are difficult to justify, but overall this is a solid port of an excellently eccentric game.\n\nRead my full review here: http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/mimpi/review/article-1400.html","May 28, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I bought it because I liked the art style and the cute dog, but once I got into it I found it fun collecting bones for little comics explaining why Mimpi thinks of cretain things in his dream, also you can find different character skins. The levels themselves are well designed, the puzzles you solve to get past obstacles are creative and the it took me about four hours to finish the game, four hours well spent. How many hours of fun could you get for $5.49? (CDN incase you're reading this from somewhere else) It's a pretty good deal. If you like platformers with puzzles, this is a great game to get but don't worry if you don't like puzzles, because you can find lightbulbs to trade for tips and even if you run out of lightbulbs you can play a tetris-like mini game for more.

The visuals are very interesting, the soundtrack is great.  The difficulty is actually not very high at all, which I think is okay.  This game is more of an unfolding journey.  Players will notice that Mimpi has more of a continuously unfolding flow and development than most platformers because the visuals are contantly changing with each level's theme(s).  Even so, I thought a few of the puzzles, particularly the rope puzzles, could have been more logical/intuitive.  Apart from any faults, the aesthetics and unique quirks make this game a must play (The last chapter of the game is very, very worth playing through).","February 22","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
