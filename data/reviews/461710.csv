The actual stories aren't very original but they're still narrated with enough competence to make them enjoyable: the overarching plot is what I found to be most engaging as it affects the protagonists' lives quite deeply and it made me want to go forward to see how things'd end. Said characters also follow the tropes of the genre quite closely but they're at least given some well written dialogues that gives them some depth and makes you care for what might happen to them.\n\nAs gameplay goes things are quite simple for the most part, you have an AP system that governs skill usage and three different attack options differing in strength. AP recharge rate. Some eras will switch things up a bit but fights are never too complex or challenging: thankfully there's no random encounters and the number of fights seemed good enough to not make things dull.\n\nThe only thing that made me frown a bit was the last boss of the game: the fight itself isn't hard as the mechanics are quite easy but it feels a bit of a chore due to its length and the fact you're simply asked to balance AP usage, healing and skills. It also bugged out the first time I've attempted it, forcing me to close the game using the taskbar and go through all the previous cutscenes.\n\nFor a 3$ game Tales Across Time is truly nicely done and smartly puts its timelines idea to good use providing an enjoyable and quite engaging narrative. Pair this with serviceable combat and a good attention to both its graphics and sound and I'm going to say this one is quite the hidden gem.\n\n","April 20","true","5.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/461710/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Critical Games is an Australian independent game development company that was founded in 2011. The founder of the company, Joshua Hallaran, created the first release title Path of Thanatos, in its entirety. Tales Across Time is the studio’s second title on Steam following the well reviewed 8-Bit Adventures: The Forgotten Journey Remastered Edition. It is a story-driven RPG that has been developed in the RPGMaker engine.\n\nThe story focuses on three different characters across different timelines. Although at first they do not appear to be connected it becomes obvious the more that you play throughout the story that they are intertwined. The narrative is among the best that I have experienced in an RPGMaker experience and rivals the best Aldorlea Games titles that we have featured thus far this year. Even though they are somewhat cliched and the plot points are a little predictable I did enjoy the story that was being told within the game. One of the game’s strongest points is the depth of the characters. This is something that I have often believed is overlooked in these games but it is something that the developers have paid particular attention and care to. Given their significance I am pleased that the developers delivered. Though there is room for improvement with the formulation of relationships and dialogue.\n\nI was also pleased with the art work. This is another area that developers often overlook with the engine believing that there isn’t much that can be done with it. The art work is pleasant to look at, at times giving it as unique an appearance as you can find with the engine and the utilization of the color palette constantly keeps in line with the story being told.\n\nThe combat system is very thorough and I liked the fact that you could retry any battle if you failed without having to visit a previous checkpoint. This is something that I would like to encourage more developers to implement into their games. There is nothing worse than dying in a seemingly random encounter and then having to backtrack several minutes or even longer into already defeated content. The soundtrack was well chosen and again is keeping with the atmosphere of the story. However, my biggest disappointment also effects the combat system. The game has a lack of a leveling system. This means that regardless of how good the combat system is – and could have been – it feels as though it is there for the sake of being there rather than a firm focus and feature of the game.\n\nAt a price tag of $2.99 you’re getting very fair value for money. It’s a good game especially for an RPGMaker game (not my favorites) but this one is good. When Ainslie returns I’ll see what she has to say of the game as she enjoys them much more than I.","May 2","true","140.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It features very nice sprite art and music, and an intriguing fantasy story involving characters in multiple eras facing their own personal challenges as well as a shared supernatural foe. Combat is basic and serves mostly as a narrative device linking story segments, rather than a gameplay hook.\n\nThis is a story delivered by means of a game engine, with some pretty, if low res, visuals and nice music.\n\nI enjoyed it.","April 20","true","9.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","8"

If you enjoy those types of interactive stories, then you may like this, but since it's not really a JRPG, it just comes off as boring.","May 8","false","1.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I enjoyed the concept, and especially appreciated the focus on narrative. My only gripe with this game, and I'd hardly call it that, is that you only experience three different time periods. However, given the price of this game and overall experience, you more than get your money's worth.\n\nHighly recommend!","April 18","true","3.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

Again, not a bad thing.\n\nThe fights were unique, which is good and bad. They were more of an annoyance, but I DID enjoy the resource management in them.\n\nBosses had a limited range of attacks, so it was kind of annoying to see the same attacks so much, but that's not a big deal.\n\nCared very little about the story to be honest. Can't say more; spoilers.\n\nOverall, I'm not mad I got it; it was worth the money. If you have $3 and a free 3 - 5 hours to bang out a small game, do check this one out.","April 26","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
