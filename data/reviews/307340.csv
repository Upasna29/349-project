Nux is fantastically quirky, and Platypus does not disappoint.  Although there is only one method of play in this one (side-scrolling shooter,) it's varied enough that it does not lose its appeal as you play.  The bonus items for weapon upgrades are nicely varied, the game tracks your score percentages per section, and some of the bigger ships that you destroy will drop bonus points... in the form of FRUIT that you need to collect before they fall off of the screen. lol~\n\nYou start off with four lives, and two credits.  When you lose your four lives, you can continue by using one of your credits, which gives you four lives again... Of course your score resets when you continue, but the game will save the highest score you gain for the leaderboard.\n\nIt also looks like a second person can join in and play with you, as there was something on the screen that said to press a button to join.\n\nPlatypus doesn't seem to be controller-compatible, but using the mouse to play gives you plenty of maneuverability.  There's no click-click-click, either; just hold down the left mouse button to shoot continuously.\n\nThere are weather balloons that float across the background giving you hints such as, "Shoot the stars to change weapons," and "Special bonus for passive resistance!"  Hah!  Try not shooting anything and live through it, I dare you!  If you die even once, it ruins your "passive resistance" because you'll usually take something out with you, and you'll get NO bonus. ;D\n\nPlatypus is yet another delightful arcade game by Idigicon, and I've happily added Platypus II to my wishlist.","June 5, 2015","true","2.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.\nIf you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.\n\n(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!)\n\nHow I Found Out About "Platypus"Oh...this goes way back! Years and years ago. When I was very young, didn't know about things like Steam, or retail PC games, I was always playing Flash games online. One site that I would play on all the time, had a little game called "Platypus". This was one of those games you came across that you had to download a free trial that only lasted an hour or so. Of course, I did. I believe the free trial only contained the first level of the game.\n\nI loved the game so much. Over about four or five years later, I went on a search to see if I could find the game's main website (Because Steam didn't have the game at the time). I found something similar to it, the game was around $2-$5. I didn't trust the site, so I did not purchase the game. Now, just last night, I noticed "Platypus" in my recommended on Steam, so I HAD to buy it. Boy, was it a blast to the past, and a nice thing to see Level 2-5, levels I have never seen before.\n\nUnfair First Impressions I tend to see a lot of hate for score attack & shoot 'em up games. I don't mind these kind of games as long as they are fun for me. "Platypus" takes both these genre'. I also see hate for side scrolling shooters which "Platypus" is also.\n\nTherefor, you may here people say bad things about these genre' or about "Platypus" itself. Some people will say that about the genre and not even try the game itself. This can rub off on other people, causing them to do the same thing. Then that can rub off, and keep going like a virus.\n\nReview Of "Platypus""Platypus" is a side scrolling shoot 'em up/score attack game. It uses a rare unique graphic style. It uses claymation which means everything you see in-game is made of modeling clay to add a unique design.\n\nThere are five total levels with about four or five areas in each. In each of these levels you will find a wide variety of enemy types & power ups.\n\nThough the game itself isn't really the 'best' as it is quite old, and it seems that the dev. is no longer supporting it, the game still runs smooth. There are no resolution options, nor is there any audio options other than "Turn Music On/Off". The Steam overlay also does not work while the game is running.\n\nHowever, the challenge in the game is there. It will get harder as you go along. Anything can destroy your ship, enemy fire, coliding with enemies, etc. When the screen gets really full, you'll find it harder to survive. The challenge isn't to much, that I feel over whelmed. It's a really nice fit.\n\nThe game also includes a 2-player option. Player 1 (Yellow ship) plays default with the "mouse", but a second player (Red ship) can join in under the controls of a "joy" or "keys" (Arrows to move, control to shoot). Player 1 can also use the different control settings, but both players can not use the same control setup. What's also neat is if you don't have anyone to play the game with, you can spawn in Player 2 and use it yourself, along with your main ship. This is difficult to master, but will help out along the way. Still better to have someone to play with though.\n\nContent (Enemies & Power Ups)"Platypus" contains loads of enemy types, some generic, some unique. The game also includes a few different power ups to defend yourself.\n\nIn "Platypus" you can come across enemy ships that fly in an "up and down" maneuver, fly straight from left to right, right to left, pull up or go down, etc. Not only that, as the levels go on, you'll notice a lot of the ships to start shooting at you. Now the weapons fired at you could consist of, a single shot in your direction, a fast shot that moves one direction, or other things like "rockets" that follow you.\n\nTo defend youself, you have a few different weapon types. I'll only name a few to avoid spoiling too much. You have your main cannons which are default, and have a slow fire rate. Then you have things like the traditional cannon spread and cannon fire rate increased upgrades.\n\nAlong with weapon types, you also have sort of.....pick ups. That can be dropped from enemies, or crates. These consist of fruit, like grapes, and bananas, which give you score points when picked up. Inside things like crates, you can find items like x2 score which will double your score income, and coins which give off a lot of score.\n\nPro's & Con's (Overall Rating)"Platypus" is a very fun side scrolling score attack shooter. That is easy to play, and very addictive. Despite it's problems, this game is a cheap purchase that anyone can enjoy for hours. Especially with a friend.\n\nPro's:\n+Unique claymation graphic style.\n+Fun & challenging five level experience.\n+2-player available.\n+Catchy soundtrack that is full of nostalgia.\n\nCon's:\n-No resolution option.\n-No custom sound options.\n-Steam overlay currently does not work (Though this does not degrade the final rating of the game).\n\nOverall rating: About a 13/15 (Fun Experience For The Whole Family)\n\nCredits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.\n\nRemember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.","October 26, 2014","true","4.0"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","27","37","3","0"

A rare gem in the world of claymation video games, Platypus brings "FUN" back into "horizontal scrolling shooters". Okay, okay, I know "FUN" is not in those words but let me explain why it's a worthwhile game (weather on sale or full price, that's up to you). All you gamers who played it as child, already know what I‚Äôm talking about.\n\nPlatypus, the beautiful brainchild of Anthony Flack, is the name of the plane(s) defending its home state against a much larger, invading country, and is also the name of the game. The core of Platypus is perhaps the artwork, done mostly (if not entirely) in claymation. From the ship to background to the counter keeping score, you really have a sense that you're in a ‚ÄúWallace and Gromit-esque‚Äù world. The detail placed on creating the world is breath taking and considering the original Platypus was released well over 15 years ago, it is safe to say the graphics have aged beautifully (well, not at all for that matter).\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard for horizontal shooters. You can fly solo (default is mouse) or with friend (default is keyboard; note: co-op/multiplayer is local on one machine), with three levels of difficulty to select from (easy, normal, and hard). During my initial plays I found that the game, both from menu to menu (short loading periods, which does depend on your machine somewhat) and during the actual game was very smooth. Nothing felt choppy and things seemed to mesh together. Perhaps one of my favourite, but very subtle game mechanics is when you move your ship up, the world/camera also seem to move up, and vice versa for when you move the ship down. It give the game a strange, pleasurable feeling of movement and gives it a live-action feel.\n\nThe game does seem a bit simplistic, and linear in nature, compared to some games made today. It would be nice if there was more to the main menu. For instance you have to start a game, die or exit before you see the scoreboard; it would have been nice to access the scoreboard directly from the main menu. The music might be a bit dated by today‚Äôs standards, perhaps, but it does bring with it the nostalgia of the ‚Äò80s/‚Äò90s and synthesizers. Oh yeah, it still has the ‚Äúcredits: #‚Äù which is nice throwback to the days of yore gaming.\n\nOverall ResultsOverall this is a classic, kick-butt game. I have only played it on easy, and it does make for nice, passive, kill-time type game. Would recommend to have either for yourself if you‚Äôre feeling nostalgia/want something to pick up and play, or just for your inner chi‚Äì‚Ä¶I mean if you have kids and want to introduce them to the world of horizontal shooters. (At the very least, give the demo a try).\nScore: 9.7/10","October 29, 2014","true","1.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

It really reminds me of the neverhood in that there's abstract shapes and everything is not super smooth. 5 weapon icons, including a 4 way shot. (Weak but can hit multiple enemies at once), rapid fire shot (my favorite. Doesn't have a scatter effect but does take down enemies quick), a wave (can hit multiple enemies at once but kinda weak.) a rocket (much better if you have the sidearms too. They scatter and it can be tough to hit enemies), and a laser. (Also passes through enemies. Pretty strong, but rare.) You can pick up two sidearms to triple your firing power of whatever weapon you have active, and there's a 2x score multiplier. You get additional ships fairly easily in game, but it's one hit and you're destroyed. This is not a bullethell shooter, and even if you've played games like tyrian 2000, you'll probably find this one on the fairly easy side.\n\nPros:\n1: Very cool artstyle.\n2: I like some of the effects. Level 1 has a long train boss for you to destroy. Level 3 has a volcano that rains rocks and coins. Level 4 is a polluted city.\n3: The music. I can identify the level 1 music as a commodore 64 remix of Comic Bakery with a splash of Jurassic Park NES level 1 music.\n4: Picking up same colored powerup icons extends the time you can use the weapon.\n\nCons:\n1: When you die if you have anything special like the sidearms, you lose them. This can make things like the bosses challenging when you're given sidearms and rockets to shoot the boss with.\n2: No real upgrade system to speak of, or even a in game shop of any kind.

This game seperates itself from the masses by having a special graphics style that looks like everything is made out of clay. It may look like a game for kids but it gets frustratingly hard at level 2. The music is simply awesome and the controls are crisp. Sadly this game suffers a few throwbacks like: Enemies will often enter through the left side of the screen killing you instantly. Bullets will dissappear behind scenery. Enemy bullets will have the same color as the background. And overall your ship is a little too big to dodge most of the stuff in the later levels.","January 17, 2015","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is no reason for a game from 2002 not to run perfectly smooth on a modern PC.\n\nOverall, it isn't a horrible game.

So we got that out of the way. As you probably already figured it out, it's a shoot 'em up game. It feels like the game is made out of plasticine. The graphics I mean. I haven't met anything like this before. It's neat. It makes the game seem fun, which is great obviously. So it's the basic shoot 'em up thing, you shoot enemies who fly towards you and you fly towards them. There are powerups, but the neat thing about them is that you can switch the power-up by shooting at it before you pick it up. There is a "shotgun" powerup, crazy fire rate and few others. Don't want to spoil everything. But the gameplay itself is fun. Graphics do matter a lot, but not how those spoiled brats think.\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUWikn6_3UA","September 5, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is wicked too, it's entirely composed of remixes of old C64 loader tunes and it sounds absolutely awesome.\nI'm probably a bit biased over the entire thing as it was one of my favourite games as a kid, but I tried my best to take of my nostalgia goggles and look at the game objectively, and it still blows me away.

Played these games when I was a kid forever ago. They(Nux, Platpus I and II) do look unique, but IMO Platypus is the only "good" game out the three. Recommending this game mainly out of nostalgia and cards, but with the game being minimized issue, not really recommending it positively yet as I said this game is really the best out the three.\n\nAs a note to the devs- It'd be nice that when anyone has the game minimized the mouse should not be locked to a certain small area, so they can do other things on their pc while the game is minimized without any issues.\n\nAlso- Nux(-90%), Platypus(-80%), and Platypus II(-90%) were on sale for a week.  $2.77=Price of purchasing games individually. $2.99= Price of buying them in a bundle. Usually buying the bundle is cheaper, but in this case it was not.","May 25, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's not a lot to it, it's not particularly long and it doesn't have much replayability (besides getting a better score), but it sure as hell is fun. The claymation graphics really gives it a brilliant charm a lot of shmups lack (MUST HAVE PIXEL GRAPHICS), and to me it really shows how much love and effort was put into the game. The soundtrack is wicked too, it's entirely composed of remixes of old C64 loader tunes and it sounds absolutely awesome.\nI'm probably a bit biased over the entire thing as it was one of my favourite games as a kid, but I tried my best to take of my nostalgia goggles and look at the game objectively, and it still blows me away. It's just so much fun.","June 12, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJonesChannel/recommended/307340/","TheJonesChannel","TheJonesChannel11","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJonesChannel/","101 products in account","Ahh, Platypus. This game has some nostalgia for me. Played this game as a kid and thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nOptions: Nothing much to do with this. Sound and music have an on and off button, no scroll bar or something to make it better. The game itself is really loud, so I have to turn it down in the windows sound panel to play this game at comfortable levels of hearing. There is a 2 player option! Either player can use a keyboard, mouse, or joystick. All you have to do it click through it to find your preference. Game pad is not an option, sorry peasants.\n\nGameplay: You pilot an easily destructible aerial vehicle in a horizontal scrolling game filled with bad guys of various types that you need to destroy. You actually get freedom of choice, if you choose a "non-violent resistance" as the game hints at you in the first level in the back ground, you will get a bonus. But, I've found this to be somewhat difficult, so I don't do it.\n\nYou can die very easily in this game, if you are hit once, you are dead. And you respawn with however many lives you have left. So, if you're into that sort of thing. There you go. You also get rewarded with lives as you earn a certain amount of points.\n\nThere are 4 different types of weapons. These will be dropped from the orange colored enemy's. you have to kill all of them for them to drop a star. There's the default weapon which fires slowly, but works fine and you can defend yourself easily with it, at least in the first levels. As you advance on, the enemy's get more difficult. The second is a 4 shot spread. The third is a very fast rapid fire of your default weapon. My I highly recommend using this whenever possible. It's fast, and it kills fast. Which is what you need. The fourth is this weird wave type weapon. It's like your shooting a right bracket at the enemy that goes only the length of Justin Bieber's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in front of your craft before it magically disappears. I do not recommend using this. The fourth and final weapon is... red rockets. These are cool, but I don't use them. They take their sweet time to exit your craft and launch off into the enemy's direction. And these aren't heat seeking or anything amazing like that. They just fly straight.\n\nGraphics: Everything is in clay-mation. And I got to say, they did a darn good job. I really like the art style. Mainly because I was raised with it. Movies like Wallace and Gromit really helped with that. Other than that, there is a rolling background as you continue flying to your destination, which as it shows in the world selection screen is a big boss at the very end.\n\nI've never beat the game unfortunately, but it is a lot of fun if you want something for fun just to play.","June 2, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
