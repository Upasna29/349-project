But for the fun part you have more air controle and a bigger challange then just staying on the ground.\n\nThere are a few down notes in this game and first off all are the controles... They are pretty wierd and also you can't use them all at once normally. So I changed them to the normal race game setup:\nW - Forward\nS - Reverse\nA - Left\nD - Right\nSpacebar - "Hand"Brake\nShift - Boost / Jet\n\nThat way you can use only the left hand for that part.\nFor the other keys I left them the same due you need to stabelise your car with the Up" and "Down""keys, and basic "R" for restart offcourse.\n\nAlso, It would be awesome if you had a trackbuilding mode. So players can create and share there tracks on the steam workshop page. Maby an update for the future.\n\nFor the rest the game looks good enough for it's goals, so far.\n\nSo simple said: 8/10 Not the best "Race" game but still fun to do for a couples tracks each day.","May 1, 2014","true","25.5"," 61 of 69 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","61","69","0","4"

HOWEVER! My thoughts on this game after playing it for about an hour.\n\nHoly. ♥♥♥♥. Balls. My first thought was "This game is going to be the exact reason why Trackmania doesn't have rockets" but after playing through the tutorial and being amazed at the easy and intuitive controls my thoughts were "Holy ♥♥♥♥!? Why dopesnt Trackmania have rockets?!"\n\nSo yes, that is what this game essentially is. It is Trackmania with rockets. This is not in any way negative as Trackmania is arguably one of the most visually pleasing and intuitive racing games out there.\n\nThe only negatives that come to mind, or simply things I feel the game is missing are:\n\n- The graphics leave a bit to be desired. I understand this is an indi game, and for an indi game they are amazing. But I think if they were a bit better this game would be insane.\n\n- Get the community involved more than just ghosts! Let us race each other, crash into each other in lap races, race against each other in real time in time attack. Add in a track editor that we can build tracks and share with other players.\n\n- I feel like I should be able to control each air brake individually, at least each side, purely for more control in mid air.\n\nThat's it. If these things were implemented I think this game could easily be as big as Trackmania at it's peak. I am THOROUGHLY enjoying this game.\n\n8.5/10","October 7, 2014","true","1.2"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","27","30","3","0"

That's Jet Car Stunts in a nutshell, a game that's about the challenge and precision as you fly your stunt car from platform to platform hovering high in the sky. Its clean aesthetic makes it appealing to play and the game does ease you into challenges before it becomes too difficult. There's a sense of joy to make it through a course on your last try, but be certain this is a game for a select few that enjoy the genre.\n\nEven if your car looks like a red tank on four wheels, its light, which lets the thrust take you flying through the air. When you're gliding through the air, you can tilt your spoiler to control your movement in the slightest way. Other than those two things, it plays similar to a lot of other arcade games that put you behind the wheel and it is easy to control with the keyboard or a 360 controller. You have buttons for forward, reverse, thrust and air brake. When I say air brake I mean the sides of your stunt car go out and you can slow yourself down in the air. Its an interesting mechanic and it does work well to counteract the thrust. There are optional and brief tutorial courses that get you skilled to the game's tricks.\n\nThe boost feels good to use and it gives your car a sense of speed more than almost any other game with nitrous. Maybe you need that speed to lift off into the air. You can also adjust the options to turn off the sense of speed. Even on the ground it feels much faster. Well I say on the ground, even though everything is in the air.\n\nThere are three modes and the main mode is platforming. You have ten tries to make it through each course and there are five difficulties each with five courses. These courses are open circuits, so anything can happen from course to course. One course can be like an upward hill that's floating thousands of meters off the ground. Another course can have you going in a loop, then jump down through rings. Having the courses suspended in mid air does open up a lot of opportunity for imaginative, creative courses. It also allows for a budget, minimal design of colored blocks rather than trees.\n\nYour objective is to make it to the gate at the end. Even if there's a minuet amount of space after the goal, you can still plow through and drive off and its still a victory. If you fall into the abyss below or slam into something at top speed, you will respawn at the last checkpoint. You only get a checkpoint if you drive through its triangular gate, so if you fly over it, then you missed your opportunity. Crossing through a checkpoint refills your boost completely.\n\nYou need to time your boosts and spare your thrust for later sections. Even if you recharge your boost at checkpoints, you can still run out and be forced to respawn at the cost of time. This makes some courses feel like trial and error that you need to get accustom to before you make it through. Other times, there are blind jumps guided by an arrow block that keeps you from over jumping, because you're aiming for rings that you'll never see until you jump. The earlier courses show you the rings before you jump, but its the later courses you need to be wary of.\n\nTime Trial mode lets you race the same courses, but more like a closed circuit where you do laps. So imagine the same tough course that you have to do five times. It does get easier as you do it more often. At the end of each lap, there's a fog bank that puts you back at the start so seamless that you maintain your speed. Its a nice touch. Time Trial more for endurance and it gets dull. A challenge is one thing, racing a ghost or yourself is another.\n\nThere are optional ghosts in the game and I enjoy them being here, because it makes the game feel more alive. Otherwise it feels vacant. I realize that its just white tiles that I'm driving on and without competition, I feel less motivation to exceed and keep playing. These ghosts make mistakes and I have a feeling they are human recordings for the most part. After each successful drive, you get a gold, silver or bronze medal and you get a rank based on an unseen online leader board. My best runs earned around #500 while my worst runs ranked me at #700 - #1,500. I have a feeling there's a player drop off as the game gets more difficult.\n\nThe final mode is the toughest of them all and that's the Collector. This mode has you collecting five stars on only eight of the same twenty-five tracks. You need to search high and low for these stars in places that its questionable how you can get to them, but its mostly extreme precision. After trying a few times on the first level, I assume that you need all five stars, before the goal lets you in. I gave up and ran away. It seemed too overwhelming from the start to even get into it, but that's why this is the third mode rather than the first.\n\nAs for unlockables, I never encountered any hint of any other than completing all five courses on one difficulty level unlocks the courses of the next difficulty level. I would like to play as other vehicles to see a difference in their weight and how they perform, but with this being a challenge and precision based game, that may throw things off.\n\nIn terms of sound and music, its minimal. There is no music during the game itself, just air and light engine sounds. I suppose music would get in the way of anything that takes focus to accomplish. The menus are where the music is and its nothing special.\n\nI'm on the fence about this game really. I had fun for a brief while. The challenges are engaging before they get too difficult for me. The clean look certainly helps it stand out from other games and a lot of times a game boils down to its graphics to sell you. I want to like it and maybe I do, its just tough to recommend to others. It was more challenging and a bit tedious than it was fun. It feels one dimensional, even if it makes good use of that one dimension across twenty-five courses. It should add or have more facets to keep it interesting and engaging. Even having more to unlock would have kept me interested longer.\n\nAs always, the choice is yours, but I feel like even the price is a bit too high, but well there are always sales.","September 17, 2015","false","2.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Do you like to go fast? That's right, the next best thing to a Sonic is here!\n\nUnlike some of the other reviews, I very much like the way the cars control in the time attack and platforming modes. On the ground, the controls are quick and snappy. In the air, their turning/angling is delayed and slower as you would expect them to be (due to less friction). You can even adjust your position in midair slightly by coordinating between boosting and using your air brake. Some of the stunt jumps you will be making later in the game are insane but can be achieved with enough practice and strategy.\n\nOn the downside, there are a few tracks in the game where you will have to jump through several "hoops." These hoops are kind of hard to fit through and the hitboxes between your car and the hoops seem pretty big and hard to avoid. However, with enough practice, it is more than possible to make it. Also, the third game mode, "Collector," seems like a waste of time and is poorly designed. The placement of the stars/collectables you have to drive into to collect is pretty terrible and incredibly difficult. The way the car controls in this mode is a mess - slippery and just all over the place. The camera is stuck in a fixated spot behind the car at all times, so if the car moves on the ground or in the air at all, then the camera moves along with it. Think of it as racing on the SNES with mode 7 all over again (...but in an actual 3D game). This gameplay mode seems to be the least important of the three though since it has fewer tracks.\n\nThe other two modes are great. The time trials allow you to just go all out crazy with boosting and pushing your speed to the limits. Gotta go fast! The platforming levels are really creative and challenging. Towards the end of the game, I couldn't believe some of the stuff I was pulling off and the crazy stunts I had to perform. Simple, yet effective design! If you've ever played ATV Quad Power Racing 2, the platforming levels (and time trials) in this game remind me a lot of the ones in ATV 2... but faster. So if that's something you enjoyed, this game is for you.\n\nAll in all, great game. I am very happy with my purchase since I got it on sale. I love the controls, the game engine, and everything BUT the Collector Mode. In fact, this game has so much potential to be even more than it already is. It would be amazing to see a REAL multiplayer mode, battle mode, bigger/wider tracks with more gimmicks besides just conering and jumping, a whole other mode, a better designed Collector Mode made easier, or even something along the lines of what ATV 2 had to offer with the tournament races or freestyle modes.\n\nStill needs:\n* In-game music?\n* Time Trial Leaderboards","July 11, 2014","true","10.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game is overall fine and worth your time if it intrigues you, but it's not without potentially game-ruining problems depending on what you want from it.\n\nThis game offers an interesting platform for arcade-style-racing speedrunning, although you can play 2 of the 3 modes without being forced to be fast. The closest comparison I can draw would be time trials from Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed and Trackmania. The mechanics present other than steering are, 1) A turbo boost, of which you get a fixed allotment per checkpoint, and 2) Mid-air aerodynamic manipulation, for lack of better words. Properly managing your boost, when and how long for, are key to being fast. Proper manipulation of your flight path and alignment are key to taking the shortest flight from point-to-point while avoiding obstacles and landing without losing speed.\n\nThis is all fun and makes for a pretty decent game, however the developers have left out some of the most basic things. You can't see any leaderboards and there is no way to see your current rank after it's shown on the results screen. You'll never see it again unless you beat your current time record, and then you'll only see your new rank. The only way I can confirm my world records are still #1 is by playing the map and making sure my ghost still beats the other ghost of the #2 player. This prevented any form of competitive community before it even had a chance to exist. All you're ever going to find is the ghost of the person 1 rank above you, or below if you're #1, unless you starting searching names and friending players.\n\nI have to recommend Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed much more than this game to anyone seeking time trial competition, or even just a better skill-based Mario Kart. It's surprisingly deep. Trackmania is also another fine choice.\n\nI also want to point out that the trailer shows a bunch of "cool jumps" that miss checkpoints and basically mean game over, and "cool techniques" that actually slow you down. Makes it look more compelling than it really is.","April 21, 2015","false","7.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Its angle makes it  incredibly difficult to tell if you are going to make that jump or not. Plus, the controls stop working on a regular basis and no, my keyboard is not broken. You also can't change the resolution for some reason.\n\nDespite all that, the biggest dissapointment is that the only thing that they added to the PC version is a ghost system.

Theres like 15 platforming levels, and sometimes the mechanics seem wonky. In parts they want you to flip sideways to turn and land but your control of the car isn't as sharp and good as it should be, you just end up flipping upside down. It is fun to boost and then brake in the air. It is stupid how you only get 10 retrys on each level, even with all the checkpoints. That was a poor design decision, because if a level is hard making me replay the whole thing because I am having trouble with one poorly constructed part makes no sense. You can't unlock play every platforming level till you've beaten the one before, but with the 10 retry limit which makes no sense and has never been used in a racing game, and with some of the poorly designed parts based on control, you may not even be able to beat all the platforming areas. If (big if) you beat platforming you can beat levels where you collect things and beat time trials, but theyre like the same levels and get pretty repeitive.

I really wish there was an option to be able to see through your car.  Often you are aiming for a platform that is far away, and you can't see it because your car's graphics are blocking your view.  I wish the car would go transparent or wireframe in these situations.  After playing for a while, it just kept coming up, I'm trying to hit a target far away, and because it's far away it's small and my car blocks it and I can't see it.  So I end up replaying parts of it but then I feel like I'm only getting it because I've memorized what to do.   Enough times of hitting stuff I would have missed if I could see better and I'd had enough for today.  It's a shame because this one tiny change would take this game from 'might play again later' to 'will play all the stages and 100% this game.'","April 11, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This racing game brings a fun and unique idea into its genre, by adding air brakes on a car. This makes the game just that much harder, since you must now jump off a rampon the map, and then use the air brakes to steer yourself onto what are sometimes narrow paths(without rails so you must be really careful), in order to land and continue on the path. I played only 4-6 hours of this game, but i really enjoyed the game, for what it is.\n\n+new airbraking system\n+fine steering controls\n+graphics are basic, but very likable\n+plenty of challenges, and ghosts so you can race yourself\n-other controlls such as gas and brakes are too close to each other(customizable though)\n-no mod support\n\nOverall this game deserves a  8/10, it's a great game. I recommend you get this on sale, since the price of $8 Canadian feels a bit high, if the game is under $5, i highly recommend it, it's a challenging, and fun game. This game feels casual at the same time, and you can jump on and off of the game, since it really is a minigame. This is a keeper on my laptop for when i get bored in school or at the airport.","February 16, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main differences are:\nGraphics:\nThe Car model is more detailed, and the lighting is better on PC. It also has some pretty offensive motion blur, but thankfully you can disable that.\nGhosting: This is only available on PC. You can race your ghost, as well as that of a (seemingly random) other player.\nControls: This should definitely be played with a gamepad, or something besides a keyboard. And even then, the controls on the mobile versions still feel tighter, especially when you're in the air.\nExtra levels:\nPC: 25 levels, $7\nAndroid: 25 levels, $1.75\niOS: 25 Levels, $2, as well as 25 more levels for an additional $2\nAdditionally, on mobile you can buy Jet Car Stunts 2 (120 levels) for just $5, which also includes a level editor and the ability to play others' levels.\nSeriously, it's just obvious what their main target is and anyone who has a smartphone should really take a good look at their options.","June 5, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Flying a car isn't as easy as it looks either.\n\nIf you're not a fan of Trial and Error gameplay, or Twitch-Reflexes, or piloting a flying brick, then I wouldn't recommend this game for you. However, if you've played many driving games, and want something sufficiently different to challenge your driving skills, then I would recommend this. The trailers don't lie: you will get frustrated quite often, and plenty of BS clipping may occur; so have fun threading a needle in some levels with a flying brick. It can either make or break your scores/times.\n\nEDIT:\nAnd for those of you that play via keyboard (Like I do), I recommend remapping your keys to Accelerate=A, Brake=Z, and Reverse=X, and keep the rocket boost on Spacebar. It should make flying a brick, or even basic driving much more precise to conrol, than the default keys (and should also minimize accidents involving the windows-key and otherwise; I generally recommend this for any racing game configuration, while at it). Keep the arrow keys for directing the car.","December 12, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A mix of Trackmania and Trials.\nThere's 3 type of races;\n-Platformer, where the goal is to reach the end saving boost but while using enough to get to the next platform.\n-Time Trials, fast-paced races where you must maintain boost even in curves while drifting and do crazy jumps.\n-Collector, where you must do crazy tricks to reach the location of the stars you have to collect.\nThe graphics are basic but the gameplay is really cool. Difficulty progression is well balanced.\nI seriously enjoy this game, bought it on Steam, Xbox One and Android! Yeah! It's that fun !!!\n","December 23, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The car handles quite well, there's a lot of fun in just air braking around corners then powering out of it with your jet, it'd make a nice drift game. The levels feel unpolished, and basic, not just because of the low poly design (most of the levels are just an arangement of cuboids). The ramps are particularly jarring, 90% of the time they're just two hard angles. The game modes aren't particularly interesting, time tirals where you just try and beat your shadow, a race mode that's also just beating a shadow.\n\nI'd like to see a game mode that's just getting from point A to B with unlimited fuel, even a hill climb. Maybe some upgrades, campaign mode etc.\n\n5/10 - Buy it if it's under 50c","May 11","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
