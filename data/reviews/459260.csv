The feel of whipping an arrow out of my quiver, slapping it on the rest, and drawing back the string all in a fraction of a second is incredibly satisfying! Makes me think I'm a bona fide archery master :)\n\nMy friends and I have had a ton of fun switching off and just trying to outdo each other with trick shots in the playground mode. When you attach the spectator camera to the arrow and finally peg that apple out of mid air.... mhmmm, such satisfaction!","April 5","true","0.8"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","6"

I am not at all dissapointed. The game is fantastic, and I'm sure it will give me plenty of playtime. It has 5 modes: Target practice, challenge, free shoot, endless, and juggling (where you try to keep apples in the air by continually shooting them). All of them feel great, and the game provides useful stats at the conclusion like accuracy, arrows fired, score and grade. The one complaint I have is that I wish it had some kind of a high score tracker - it doesn't need to be complex, but just some way of comparing your results against previous trials. That beign said, this is a great, well-polished archery game.\n\nEDIT: The dev implemented scoreboards, rejoice!","April 8","true","7.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pandalink/recommended/459260/","Pandalink","Panda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pandalink/","216 products in account","This game has probably the best bow mechanics of all the Vive archery games right now. The environment is pretty simple and the gamemodes are a little limited right now but what's there works really well, mechanically. The high score board keeps you coming back for more, trying to beat other people's scores as well as improve your own. The presentation is charming, the bow mechanics are excellent, and with more content & modes this will easily be the best archery experience for VR.","May 1","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coflash/recommended/459260/","coflash","Phill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coflash/","863 products in account","I think you should replace where you draw arrows from. The Lab does it pretty well. There were more than a few times where I'd go to grab an arrow and grab nothing, then go to shoot nothing. Whereas on The Lab I never miss.\n\nI found the best way was to press the grab button as soon as I let an arrow loose - but as I said, it's not always accurate.\n\nThe game is great otherwise","April 6","true","0.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Feels like a gimmicky game trying to cash in on the new VR market with a 'just finished enough to pass' game.\n\nHandling of the bow and items is wrong, it warps the the hand of the person, you can't move around (walking or teleporting) or i just couldn't figure it, there is only one area/map and you do everything inside of it.\n\nGame modes are basically, shoot targets, shoot targets but with limited arrows, shoot targets against a clock, shoot apples, or shoot anything you want.\n\nI like the Lab version of archery, it has a little subsistence to it where you have to protect a castle. This is just shooting a bow.\n\nI also found out it's not very finished on the gameplay side as i could hold and nocked arrow against the string and throw the bow away from me while still holding the arrow. When you let go the arrow fires as normal through the arrow rest.\n\nI would not recommend this game, I would just play the Lab instead.","April 10","false","0.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Unfortunately, there just isn't much depth to it, and it's boring. Valve has a completely free VR game called The Lab, which includes an archery mini-game that's much more fun, interesting, and replayable than this (in my opinion).","April 25","false","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's got a good bow mechanic (currently the beta has a "two-handed" control model, like The Lab's archery game). There's a placeable (optional) 3rd person camera for the mirrored screen that works well with spectators. It could use some more modes/environments, but it's pretty solid for an indie VR title.","April 25","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bow mechanics feel nice, the graphics are nice, and it's a more relaxed alternative to other Vive archery experiences. The devs seem to be listening and adding features too, which should be encouraged. For £11 you can't go wrong.","May 1","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
