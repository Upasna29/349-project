Crazy as hell but still lovable. It still needs a lot of polishing but I think it has potential to become a very entertaining piece.

It really reminds me of the feeling when I played with my bro. It's still not perfect though, hopefully they will fix the bugs once the game gets out of Early Access.","December 7, 2015","true","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I just need to get into it a little more. I seem to be having some issues with the FPS I try everything possible to fix this. I might just need some help on it. My system is more than good enough to run this game so I dont know what the issue is. I have a video posted below so you can see first hand some of the gameplay. Sorry for the FPS like I said I could not figure out how to fix it.\n\nAlso when I was trying to do the next level it woud not go past the loading screen for at least 3 mins I would wait a few weeks on this game. But I do seeing it being a good game so I am about 70/30 right now.\n\nUpdate: The game keeps crashing on me so I would wait for a few weeks till this has been fixed.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-pXmqaH1BM","October 22, 2015","true","2.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"
