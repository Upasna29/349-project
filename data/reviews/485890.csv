The CSGO joke was kinda cute\nYou're not as clever as you think you are Summer Sale. Do you know what we do with games that make us quit the game as part of a game mechanic *stares at superhot*? We stop playing them. It's not unique, it's aggravating. You need to earn that Summer Sale and you didn't earn that gimmick.\nIt's not visually cohesive at all, yet they somehow still managed to use assets from other mini games they made in the same game (the bus, the character, etc)\nHave you noticed most of these are negatives yet? Good\nIt somehow still managed to crash in a 40 minute experience.\nJust as a reminder, this costs real money.\nThe hud style look was actually pretty nice looking, and the steam knock-off they designed is actually kinda nice looking. Reminds us of some click and point adventure games that allowed you to play on an arcade machine you found (or something similar)\nThe games fall into three categories each with a variance of stupid. You have joke games, you have unfinishable games (they all fall into that category) and you have broken games. We'll let the reader figure out which type is worse.\nThe game forgot the fact that jokes are funny because they have a reference point. Just saying "30 Fps" isn't funny.\n\nJUST AS A REMINDER, THIS COSTS REAL MONEY\n\nSide Note: This would have been funny if this was released in Early Access as part of the joke. Not saying they should have done that, just that it would have at least been remotely funny.","June 1","false","0.7"," 506 of 572 people (88%) found this review helpful 80 people found this review funny","88","506","572","80","13"

I know I only have 0.1 hours, but that is enough to tell me how bad this game is. This game has no point, I was expecting a summer sale tycoon where you maybe buy games for very cheap, maybe earn some money off of cards or something along those lines, but it's nothing like that.\n\nHere is how the game goes:\n\nYou start the game up and you are put in a tiny version of normal steam. You can scroll down to a list of about 30-40 games. It gave me one good laugh, seeing all the names for the games. I bought a game on there, I go to my library to play it, and it's not even a minigame. It just puts you in a world as a character that you get put in as for every other game, and it is just some lame gag. For example, the How to Die game just puts you in between 2 zombies, and one comes to you within 3 seconds and you just die and reset to the exact same thing. It has no purpose.\n\nThis is one of the worst games I have ever come across, even for its price. It claims I can experience the Summer Sale without losing money, yet I lost a dollar to experience sh*t.","June 2","false","0.1"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","20","20","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeeiBreathe/recommended/485890/","LeeiBreathe","Persevere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeeiBreathe/","462 products in account","Summer Sale is a game developed around the idea of Steam's famed Summer Sale. The sole objective of the game being that you buy everything you can from the Steam Store at the cheapest prices. From the first look at the game, it appears filled with unfunny jokes, memes and other pointless things that were funny 2-3 years ago.\n\nUpon loading the game, you're met with a 3 options. Play, Settings and Exit. Having looked into the settings menu, you're able to change a lot of settings to suit your personal needs right down to the colours it displays on the screen. This is a great addition but I feel there should be a colour blind mode for those with poor sight.\n\nOnce you're finally into the game, you're given $30 to buy as much content as you can from the Steam Store before you need to play the Mini Games to amass an amount of coins to buy the rest. This is where the game falls flat for me personally. The mini game choices you have to choose between are; Dragon Erol, a game which doesn't actually work nor does it allow you to collect coins with much ease; Glorious Cannon which premises you of essentially defending some black squares with meme names. It's also the easiest to get coins on if you do not own an auto clicker; Finally we have Coin Train which will delight the players who enjoy using an auto clicker. There really isn't much choice between the games and after a while, you'll get bored rather quickly. It doesn't help matters when you need $150 roughly to complete the game.\n\nThe positive side of the game is that isn't expensive. It's currently just 79p on the Steam Store and comes with 6 rather quick and easy achievements which offers you around 90 minutes of gameplay. If you're just after the quick completion, this game will fill your needs but ultimately it's another Indie game that shouldn't of passed Steam Quality Control.","June 3","false","1.7"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","1"

Gift them this game! You'll soon be rid of them!\nDo you want to break up and show your ex that it's truly over?

It's somewhat alright at the very start of it, but after 20 minutes of being in-game it starts getting very dull, and extremely repetitive, as you play the coins mini-games to farm more money to buy more games with.\n\nIt's pretty torturous to get enough money in your game to buy all the games for the achievements. But the only upside is that you don't need to spend literally hours getting the achievements for this game, and after max 75 excruciating minutes of being in-game and grinding the money for the 'games' in this, you'll finally be done with all achievements, and can finally close down the game and uninstall it and never look back again.\n\nThis 'game' isn't even a game, it's a torture device that should be mandatory for sentenced prisoners to play for 24/7, over and over, and over, and eventually everybody will break down.\n\nSo avoid this 'game' at all costs, it's not even worth the 0.99 cents I paid for it.","June 3","false","1.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","12","13","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arktomys/recommended/485890/","arktomys","Arktomys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arktomys/","151 products in account","Another attempt in cashing in the low-effort meme game wave of Greenlight stuff that has been coming recently. Basically, it's a quote on quote Steam Simulator, but the twist here is that you get money by playing one of the three minigames so you can buy more games. All of the minigames are extremely badly made with no effort put on them.\n\nDragon Erol -  an auto scroller that the only button you use is the Spacebar. Jump over the obstacles and grab the coins. Pointless.\nGlorious Cannon - plays fairly similar to the Atari game Missile Command, but with outdated "PC Master Race" memes and only one turret. The cities from the arcade game are now PCs, but having them destroyed do absolutely nothing. The only way you can lose is if your turret gets hit. Comparing this to Missile Command is a big compliment, considering Glorious Cannon has atrocious controls and gameplay.\nCoin Train - literally Cookie Clicker, but instead of clicking a cookie, you're clicking a coin. That's it. It's probably the most shallow minigame of all those three, offering nothing but a quick way to get more money in the virtual Steam wallet.\nBesides the three minigames, you can buy the games on sale with the money you acquired from playing them. There's a total of 21 games available to buy, all of them being unfunny spoofs of already existing games on Steam, like Left 4 Dead, Rust, Portal, Life is Strange, Hitman, CS:GO, Bad Rats, and so forth. All of them are borderline unplayable with no content whatsoever besides the usual "Press E", "Go left/right then go back" or actually nothing, like "Awesome Rats", the Bad Rats spoof that has nothing but a menu screen.\n\nYou can fully complete this game in less than 40 minutes, and that's very generous, considering I myself spent some time toying around on the "RUSH B AND PLANT" game, which is a bare-bones simulator of CS:GO case opening. Overall, Summer Sale is a game of abysmal quality that isn't worth your dollar.","June 2","false","3.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I knew what it was, and now I have contributed to the insanity. This "game" is lightly a simulator of well, what some steam users do already, but now in stimuli form. The almost non-existant gameplay is what can be expected, the strong grind for cash is boring, and even though I can literally customize every aspect of the game in game, seeing as most of the text jokes go ignored this was literally a waste of a good dollar.\n\nIt has achievements and badges, so that is a plus. It crashes depending on what you do in it, but it is as a farce.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timelesshero/recommended/485890/","timelesshero","Devin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timelesshero/","445 products in account","After hearing about this game I had to see for myself what all the hype/disappointment was about so I bought my copy. For 99 cents how could you go wrong? I attempted to boot up the game and was met at a weird screen that looked like the game was far away. I attempted to restart the game and it still had the game far away. After tons of troubleshooting I looked to my right and saw that my Vive's display was on. The game has Vive support. After unplugging my Vive the game booted up normally. Anyway, moving onto the pros/cons of "Summer Sale".\n\nPros    It's 99 cents.\nHumorous takes on the Steam Summer Sale and popular titles.\nJabs at Windows updates, jokes about downloading RAM/deleting Sys32, etc.\nSomewhat interesting minigames when "buy" titles.\nCons    Old jokes that are stale.\nSome of the minigames are broken. Such as the teleporting game.\nThe game itself is glitchy. It deleted my save progress and I had to start over again.\nNo replay value. Once you get a nice laugh from some of the reference and get all the achievements you'll never boot it again.\nSo in conclusion I'm going to have to say that I don't recommend this game to people that are looking for a serious title that they'd like to spend more than 30 minutes in tops. This is a parody game and as such doesn't have a high replay value. I'm not however going to ask for a refund as I think I've gotten 99 cents worth of laughter for the game and the trading cards are just going to "lessen" the blow of the game's price. All in all if you like "meme" humor, playing a semi decent simulator, and have 99 cents to blow then go for it.","June 3","false","3.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
