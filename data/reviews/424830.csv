"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/424830/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","First, I want to say thank you. Thank you for putting bots into your game let alone bots with ranging difficulty. You have no idea what that means to a player like myself. Steamified has already featured a number of promising multiplayer titles that are local multiplayer only or if they do have online multiplayer that the game is dead on arrival because the developers and publishers don’t have the marketing budget to get a large enough playerbase for their pay to play game. Therefore if you’re going to have a game that is primarily a multiplayer game please include bots. They make a game that could otherwise be pointless to be developed – even if the concept is sound and the gameplay exciting – playable until such a point as your game has an active community or you make a group of like minded friends who are able to party with you.\n\nThis alone gives Bell Ringer a glimmer of hope. It’s not going to be DoA due to the inability to get a game going. However, that alone doesn’t mean that it has a saving grace. The game itself still needs to be good and polished if it is going to gain any sort of community at all. I personally believe that the March 6th release date is pretty optimistic. The game still needs a fair amount of work. For instance, the game will not recognize my Xbox One controller. The game states that it comes with full controller support. I would suggest that that it is partial at best – I have read others who have been able to use their controllers. The keyboard controls are average at best and downright scary at worst. If you want to have the ability for players to enjoy your title local co-op you need to fix the controls all of the way through. I know that the devs are working on this but we shall see how it progresses.\n\nAnother issue that I have to take issue with may be in part because I found the controls dodgy and that’s the difficulty level of the bots. Even the bots on the lower end of the difficulty spectrum tend to kick ♥♥♥. A friend of mine who played the game is a fighting game genius – to the point where he has done extremely well in professional tournaments – and he agrees that the game needs to offer newbies a glimmer of hope and that he didn’t always win as comfortably as he generally would. On the higher difficulty settings this would be a beacon for action players of his level but if you’re new to the game and unable to sniff a victory there is a likelihood that you will give up before putting the time into get to the required level.\n\nI’d also like to see more characters on release. Give the game some diversity. If I play a series of 5-player games it would be nice to see a round where there’s at least one different character in the mix. But that may be a wish list item rather than a realistic one.\n\nThe sound and the graphics are very generic. Too generic. But good sound costs money and it’s clear that this is a shoestring budget game and that a lot of resources would have gone into developing the AI of the bots, etc. to make the game playable which I would argue is more important than the aesthetics. However, I’d like to see them improved. The music on the menu systems is great and I’d like to advise that you incorporate some sort of soundtrack into the game to help hide the generic fighting sounds.\n\nOne final suggestion to the devs is to please reconsider your choice of trailer video on the Steam page. Yes, gameplay video is very important, but I believe firmly that you’re not doing justice to your game or advertising it very well with that trailer. Cut the menu crap out. Get to the gameplay. Add some music or something to it to make it sound and look more exciting. Right now it’s just a few people playing the game – people that we do not know and do not have a reason to care about. Perhaps do a character trailer where you show off each character. If you have an animator then give each character a comic book style story so that we have a reason to know and care about each fighter. Are any of them bad? Are any of them good? Are they anything but generic? What is their background? Why are they in this battle? Which characters are rivals and why? A relatively basic story trailer would add more depth not only to the trailer but to your game. It’s all a little plain and generic right now and you have room to grow.\n\nIf I have to say “yes” or “no” for right now then I’m going to give a cautious yes but that’s solely because of the bots. After playing a number of local multiplayer or dead online multiplayer games it’s a healthy sign to see a developer ensure that their game isn’t going to meet the same unfortunate fate that those games have.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways (generally 3 new ones per day) visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFeel free to join us on Steam at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 28","true","8.0"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","42","50","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comacoma/recommended/424830/","comacoma","that's what she said","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comacoma/","1794 products in account","I read reviews. I expected cheap as dirt worst game ever. People say like it's the worst game ever.\n\nCommunity tricked me again. It's not. It's just mediocre, you jump around and slash some fantasy monsters (or your friends). And that's it.\nIt doesn't crash, I have 60fps on my 5yo old PC with everything maxed out. It's not downright ugly (UE4 makes everything shiny even if it's not supposed to be shiny), it's not downright broken. It's just mediocre, unpolished and low on content game. I've seen worse. Much, much worse.\nCommunity needs to stop overreacting over the smallest things. Yeah, we are buying and enjoying expectations and PR words these days, but can we stop making a fuzz about nothing at very least?\nI mean it's super-cheap and it's not the best game ever. But it could give a stupid hour of jumping around before you idle for cards and delete it. Don't pretend like it's price dented your wallet, you aren't poor african kid. It cost 24 cents for me and I got my hour of not-so-fun. The game is just ultra-cheap 'meh'.\n\nOn the bright side devs are still working on their game, and that's some dedication. I just want to support the devs (GO BUY ORBITAL GEAR, IT'S GREAT GAME, SRSLY)\n\np.s.: I say jump around because stationary moves are slow and useless (and hitboxes are way off). Use downward mid-air moves.","April 29","true","4.7"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","1"

You end up having to fiddle with the options using the keyboard.\n-As far as I can tell changing the resolution does nothing.\n-The font style makes it hard to tell, at a glance, what actions are tied to what keybinds.  In fact the 'x' in game looks like the letter 'e'.\n-To go back to the main menu to start the game I press the "ack" button.\n\nThis feels and looks like a free flash game.\nMost games will give you an explanation of what your different abilities do or how the basics of the game work.  Here you have to figure it all out on your own.  Which is fine, but the game play just isn't fun.  Enemies just run at you, and you either hit them, hit them with a random speacial skill, block, evade, or run away.\n\nI'm sure multiplayer is more interesting, but a button mash game isn't my thing. I'm pretty sure you can find free games that are essentially this or this done well.\n\nIf you can figure out why this game is called Bell Ringer, do tell!  The closest thing I can come up with is a definition off of Urban Dictionary. "A bowel movement so long, that it hits the bottom of the toilet, and topples over forward, hitting you in the balls."\n\nEDIT:\nI acquired this game from a giveaway because it said there were Steam trading cards.\nThere's not actually any cards.\nA week later there are now cards.","April 19","false","8.5"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","31","47","2","2"

There are no combos that can be performed. It's just pushing buttons while moving in a certain direction and hoping for the best.\n\nThe singleplayer is too short and is very easily beated. Nearly every enemy will die in one hit if you hold left bumper and attack (which is some kind of upwards attack). Just repeat this until you win because the bosses are even a joke. Of which the fourth level has none.\n\nMultiplayer is essentially a dead game. I sat for minutes just waiting for a game and only one game showed up, passworded and for two people. No one ever joined him. But what I'm reading from other reviews, the host always has priority in the matches anyways, either dealing superior damage, or taking no damage at all.\n\n\nAll in all, the game looks nice, but it is VERY poorly executed and could have used another several months to a year of development.

I had some small hope that this would be a half decent Smash Bros clone but it's really disappointing. I applaud the devs because they are a small group of young folk and it is quite an achievement to put out a game that works at all. Unfortunately, despite generally functioning it's not a fun or well executed game at all. The art and music assets show some potential but barely approach mediocre at present. Level design is completely bland. The gameplay is just plain broken.\n\nAs others have mentioned, hitboxes are all wrong with some moves passing right through enemies while others seem to hit from absurd distances. The AI is both completely stupid and (without exploiting a glaring bug) sometimes overwhelmingly powerful. An example of the former is enemies who approach but don't actually get close enough to hit you and then keep attacking the air. An example of the latter is the single player "level" where you fight silhouettes of the other playable characters. It's nearly impossible to kill two dozen enemies that can kill you in one hit, especially when they are all on top of each other attacking you all at the same time. The only way I found to win was running away and backing against a wall which apparently stupefies enemies completely.\n\nI recommend against this game even if you see it for free.

It feels like you are using strats on freaking Super Smash Bros and the only strats you'll be using is the power abilities. Then they have the nerve to call it fast-paced. A freaking frozen hot pocket could thaw faster than this; I thought this game was going to be immaculate, and I was wrong.\nBut a free game is a free game!\n\nI had the audacity to try singleplayer.

I cannot believe what I have just played.\nI never like hating on a game with a small team, but the game just isn't very fun. I am going off of single player, since I hadnt played multiplayer and can't see myself ever playing it now.\n\nGraphically, the game looked oddly fuzzy, and  although I was getting around 100+ FPS, *other people have been having a lot of FPS problems*.\n\nThe gameplay was simply not enjoyable. I played as a character called Gallows, and the "special" attacks seemed to do literally nothing but take up *all* of your mana, of which recharges incredibly slow. Your attacks get interupted and you die, your attacks dont get interupted but still do little to no damage and die.\n\nIts the same process and personally I find it unimaginably boring.
