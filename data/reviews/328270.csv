Its spit into five chapters similar to any of the telltale games with three of the chapters currently released in english. Its worth noting that the first chapter is relativley short when compared to chapters two and three and acts as a long intro.\n\nIts a story driven game heavy on text (so put on your reading glasses), the art style is fantastic (similar to Cinders or much of the Darkeye stuff) and the setting is wondefully eclectic. The cast of characters are all well crafted and by the end of chapter three all were very well fleshed out. I wont spoil the story but to say its an investigation based thriller with plenty of character interaction and dialogue.\n\nThe experience contains some light puzzle elements and some side quests which I find unusual for this style of game, seperating it from the linear visual novels also found in this genre. I also felt the decisions I made had consequences and was suprised to discover death or failure was in fact possible. The illusion of choice and "magicians choices" are often a problem for me in these types of games, but I genuinley felt that I was having an impact on the world and its characters. Incidentally the game does have a morality system which I wont go into but rest assured your actions do indeed have "consequences".\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone interested in adventure and or visual novels and considering the amount of garbage that comes out of greenlight its good to see something awesome for a change. The one criticism that I can make is the grammar and typos in the english translation of the game, certainly not enough to dissuade me from recommending it but they are obvious. I personally can overlook such problems and did not find them frequently enough to cause me frustration.\n\nI truly hope this game is a commercial success for the devs and receives the attention it deserves I would love to see more from this studio in the future and eagerly await the release of the next chapter.\n\nLove\n\nArch","January 21, 2015","true","17.5"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","36","40","0","0"

The story is quite good and the campaign will last you anywhere from 9-15 hours! This game brilliantly utilizes choices matter in conjunction with some point and click and exploration elements.\n\nThis psychological thriller isn't for kids; it's a complex, dirty and riveting detective game that unfolds in front of your eyes. You are Oliver, a boy who for the last 10 years has been piecing together clues to track down his mother's murderer; the events that follow will captivate you until the very final chapter.\n\nThere are very little videos or help guides online so make sure to take your time with things, and save every so often. This isn't your typical visual novel and you can stray off course and hit a dead end if you aren't careful!

Leviathan is a point-and-click puzzle mystery set in a Steampunk-esque world. I was really impressed with the amount of lore in the game so far, much of which turns out to be necessary to figuring out the puzzles and mysteries in both the larger narrative and in each episode. The mystery is fairly compelling even if some of the characters are more than a little disappointing, particularly how women are portrayed. I was also fairly uncomfortable with the homophobic tones taken with one character. There's also a few spots with typos and one place where information wasn't actually translated into English yet and a couple of achievements are broken (such as the achievements for completing episodes two and three). Despite its issues with characterization, the narrative is really compelling and I was impressed by the subtly of the moral choices so far. Usually in a game that has moral alignment, the choices are mostly "SMASH! KILL" or "SAVE EVERYBODY" in their obviousness. Leviathan, so far, avoids that trap and allows for more flexibility. So despite the game's issues (again, the major ones being characterization of women and the homophobia), I'm really interested in seeing what happens in episodes four and five.","January 1, 2015","true","4.0"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","28","38","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jalachan/recommended/328270/","jalachan","Jala-chan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jalachan/","347 products in account","Leviathan is a dark, episodic visual novel/adventure game. Your mother was murdered and you were adopted by the killer. Seeking to punish your guardian, you investigate the circumstances around the death and uncover much more than you first anticipated - including your own complex feelings related to the man who both killed your parent and lovingly raised you.\n\nThe world of this game is intricate and richly developed, with a history that is both enigmatic and unique. It is dark fantasy with cyberpunk and even alien elements. The art stands out as both familiar and distinct, with animations which often make antagonists seem appropriately more grotesque. Though there are few tracks, the music is enjoyable and memorable. The characters are familiar personality types, yet as the story progresses you reveal new facets, emotions, and convictions. Many characters are not simply "good" or "evil" but rather a mixture of the two. The society in which this story takes place is filled with corruption, classism, racism, and politics. You commit crimes during your quest, even in selecting the most virtuous path you are offered. The writing depicts realistic situations, which are always a shade of grey (rather than black and white) and more difficult to suss out than is reflected in entertainment media. There are also reminders of your character's age (flirting, going drinking with friends) even as he is working on his investigation. I feel this is not a drawback to the story but rather enhances it, giving the protagonists a more human feel.\n\nThe only issue that some players will encounter is the translation in terms of localization and a few grammatical issues. The story is still very much intelligible and therefore this does not detract from the game to any great extent. Furthermore, Lostwood has advised that a professional translator will be hired after the release of episode 5 to proofread everything. This will likely be released as an update when episode 5 is available in English, or shortly thereafter.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. It is quite easy to see the love and dedication put into this game and I absolutely want to see more of this world - and more work from Lostwood.","July 14, 2015","true","9.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

Do I or do I not recommend this game?  Well I do, but with caution.  Caution not because of the content or even the dark themes but because of the vagueness in places within storyline itself and some plot holes.  Lots of things become confusing, twisted, conflicted and totally unanswered from motives to storylines to character involvement to what actually is going on in the world in general.  Yet at this point, if one just focuses on the main character Oliver Vertran, and stays totally within in his first person point of viewpoint (as a player), the game play makes perfect sense including all the plot holes, unanswered questions, questionable motives, and the choices made for self survival. (Making the best choice does not necessarily include having good options or even really any actual choice.  Which is often the case in this game as well as real life.)\n\nOliver can not possibly know the answers to many of the questions he uncovers or the movitations of those he lives with, is friends with or even encounters. And he certainly does not know or even understand the gruesome truths and cruel tactics of the political world as a young adult (18 years old) he is still sheltered from.  If this were a book it would be the first book and followed by a sequel, a trilogy or even a series about this dark, mad, death laden world of Leviathan.\n\nOh yes, forgot to mention this is an episodic visual novel and as of April 22, 2016 (when this review was written) is complete with all 5 chapters. Personally I do not recommend playing any episodic game until it is complete or unless the episode itself is a complete self-contained storyline (like a TV program).  I mention this only due to the reviews written, many that were written and not revised, after the first episode.\n\nStoryline: At the age of eight Oliver Vertran (from an ancient yet impoverished noble family) witnesses the after mass of his mother's murder at the hands of a shadow creature/demon controlled/or is an extention of a very wealthy noble Kristian Orvood. (Orvoods are one of the five ruling noble families of the world Leviathan.)  This murder occurred on the first day of the Decade.  The Decade is a decade long (10 years) pandemic plaque much like the Black Death (Bubonic Plague) of the 13th century or even the Ebola virus of today, and the death toll among the lower classes is in the millions.  (Only the noble class has an immunity.)  Though not mentioned directly this plague is caused by the Undead King or Plague King reasons unknown and cause unknown.  (Like I said earlier many unanswered questions and vagueness - yet Oliver growing up in this type of world would not question this any more then the air anyone else breathes.)\n\nFor ten years, Oliver grows up under the strict yet loving? tuttelage of Kristian Orvood (who adopted him), while Oliver harbors thoughts of being able to prove Kristian murdered his mother.  The end of the Decade arrives (the day the plague ends can be calculated 10 years to the day, hour, minute from when it began) and Oliver's friend Kael discovers a clue to Oliver's mother's murder.  Oliver's desire to gain proof that Kristian murdered his mother engulfs him.  Most of the visual novel centers around Oliver's investigation of his mother's murder which leads to even more complicated life choices and basically a growing up understanding he knows nothing at all about his own life, hertiage and the world he lives in.\n\nSo my friends as a story it a wonderful, chilling and quite horrific tale about a young man, Oliver, who encounters more then he can deal with and has to discover who he is and where he stands.  (Though do understand it seems that some episodes seem to be written by different people and therefore the focus shifts just enough to get a discord in the story fabric.)\n\nThere are side stories too, which only add to the horror and disjointed feelings of the overall story.  However, the main points of the storyline are concluded, and the rest left for reader speculation being unresolved.  And for my literary friends this is one of those games that can be analysized for a college theme paper due to a world based on death, human nature, survival, morality, ethics, greed and power just to mention a few.  It's all there and more if one looks for it.\n\nPS Spent way too much time on this game trying to be bad, and still could not do it.  I wonder if that is a reflection of me or the game itself?  Update: Finally was bad enough on April 30th 2016, after following a YouTube video of Chapter 5 done by Tha14GR.","April 22","true","30.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

They are complex, they have their own backstories, problems, motives and I was surprised at how much I cared about them (especially the main character's best friend, Ruth and Kael. They are awesome and extraordinarily well written).  The developers obviously put a lot of love in the character designs and dialogues.\n\nOf course, the game also has some issues: the English translation can be a bit clunky and people who play a lot of point&click adventures might find the puzzles in this game a bit too easy.

When I originally started it up, the game froze about two minutes in. Rebooting the game, it runs fine afterwards. However, the second day I play it, the same thing happened. I restarted the game once more, and all was well. I've yet to have it crash on me again. What's helpful, is that the game saved right before it crashed the second time, so I didn't lose any progress.\nThere are spelling and grammatical errors throughout the course of the game, although they are easily discernable, and it doesn't prevent you from understanding what was said. During the third chapter, the errors seemed to have increased (Or rather, it hasn't been looked over too much more as of yet), the fourth containing the worst of the errors.\n\nWhile playing the game, I couldn't help but think it was missing a Back button for dialogue (But it has a Forward button, thankfully), if only because a click too soon during text immediately either finishes the sentence on the screen, or takes you to the next dialogue (And I will admit that sometimes I end up misclicking). Having the Inventory and possibly the Save/Quit Menu available during dialogue would be nice as well, but it DOES auto save, so that was extremly helpful for me.\n\nAll of that aside, I really do enjoy playing this game! The plot and story is interesting enough, and I really enjoy the art. The backgrounds and character style is different and refreshing from the usual anime-esque visual novels usually seen.\nThe music fits the atmosphere and I really like the menu screen (Theme of the game?) background music as well.\n\nOverall, I'd probably give the game a 6/10.

If you're looking for the next Skyrim, this certainly isn't it, but as its own kind of genre it excels. Between mystery and ACTUAL moral dilemmas (@Bioware), you certainly won't feel like the story's lacking anytime soon.\n\nHowever, I feel like this game could have done a lot better. There's so much room for a variety of choices to be made, when really, the only choices that matter are the obvious good/evil ones (and some money-managing). You definitely play as the main character, who has his own unique personality, and I've gotta say, that was a little irritating. He says some pretty stupid stuff sometimes, and only has the option to date one person (*cough* where's my kael romance option). I guess I was looking for more freedom, and this game is very linear (playing out more like a movie than a game).\n\nOn the bright side, the graphics are lovely, and the characters mostly intriguing. I was drawn into the world of Kroistham, and enjoyed discovering its secrets. Only character I didn't like was Ruth (I think they re-named her Darina?), but I LOVED Kael.\n\nTl;dr: buy it on a sale. 6/10, nice small game.\nLooking forward to more by these developers in the future!","July 31, 2015","true","5.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

As a fan of the visual novel genre, I like seeing how a developer makes it their own.\n\nTrying to explain this game to someone else, I described it as "Russian". And while that explains where it was created, it also lends itself to explaining the macabre, moralistic, and generally surreal setting of the story. I will say, be warned that some story bits might bring unease if you're not a gamer that like horror games. Most of this game is fine, but I was definitely thrown off as your guardian tells you the childhood story of how he killed his cute little dog\n\nThat being said, do understand that there are disconnects with the pacing and the tone. I'll be talking, and then, BAM! Crude reference to a girl's t!ts. [That was another thing--boobs are ALWAYS called that. By everyone. And it's odd and out-of-place.] And I get the general translation errors, or odd wording, because that's to be expected. But don't be shocked when things are going well at a steady pace, and then music is changed to a discordant key and tensions are heightened for no real reason.\n\nAlso, I've experienced some bugginess--one with not getting an achievement [not a major deal, honestly] and the other with accessing Episode 5 in English. Since the latter is a brand-new release for English, I understand that there might be a problem or two, and the discussion board led me to a quick workaround.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Yes, I'm enjoying the weirdness of everything.

You actually have to do things to move the story along and there are even a couple of puzzles, so this isn't just a digital picture book like most visual novels.

I believe the creators are Russian, and this gives the game a cultural flavor that I found interesting; however I do wonder if I may be missing something by not being from that part of the world.  The story threw me into a story that I had no context for and little backstory was forthcoming.  I did finish the story, but it didn't really feel complete.

It wasn't a bad game but it went to some weird places that makes me reluctant to "recommend" it.  For example, it is possible to find yourself on a quest to get nude pictures of   your sister and one of your friends.  Your friend is male and your sister is well YOUR SISTER.  After you complete the quest, the pictures of your friend are gone but the ones of your sister are there on your phone forever.  What kind of creepy freak keeps naked pictures of his sister?  (To be fair, the pictures aren't actually nudes but in the reality of the game they are supposed to be and that was weird enough for me)  You have no say in this behavior, by the way, if you are on this quest, you cannot ask a girl who is not your sister and you cannot delete her photos from your phone.  The weirdest part is how casual the game is about these things.  They happen without explanation.  I have 30+ playtime hours because I replayed it to see if you can avoid these sorts of occurrences.  I was able to find an alternate to the above spoiler.  However, I am fairly sure that the game  makes your character masturbate to a picture of his dead mother  before you an advance the plot.    It is also impossible to avoid  seeing your character express a desire to ♥♥♥♥ a woman .\n\nOtherwise, the game has the expected violence and mild awkward sexuality that you can expect in the game.  Qualities that I feel were well reflected in the content rating.  Overall, it's a decent game.

This game has beautiful art that is both appealing and often grotesque at the same time, I've not seen anything else with a style quite like it. The translation is a little rough around the edges, but not nearly enough that it bothered me or made understanding the game hard, I've seen much worse from much bigger game devs. As it's part point and click, part visual novel, the real weight of the game is in the story, and the narrative is excellent, but I will get to that after I cover the art. It covers pretty much all the 'punk' variety of genres with its art at some point, and it also has these very old time-y baroque, medieval elements too - it is a world that is clashing at the figurative and metaphysical boundaries with itself, and this is represented excellently in the artistic presentation.\n\nThe story itself is hard to follow, but not because it is badly written. It slowly unravels a piece at a time, and some  elements will surprise you with how and when they pop up, and if there is any complaint I have against this game, it's that the episodic format is killing me, waiting to find out what happens after part four. That aside, I really enjoyed the story of a very grubby and dark world, that still manages to insert some levity at points, and I really enjoyed how well the writer/s responsibly handled the more mature elements of the game - they show them, often plainly, but never in a completely tasteless way. The characters are all human and have motives and foibles, the characterisation is a little over heavy on some of them, but mostly I found them engaging.\n\nI think the music is worth a mention too, from the gorgeous intro song (that is used in the trailer) to the various background music that does a great job of setting the atmosphere, whether it is kooky and whimsical, or intense and frantic, I feel they did a pretty good job at using music to its utmost utility. While I understand this kind of game isn't typically a broad market appeal, if you think you might like it at all, consider giving it a try.","December 10, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story and characters were good enough to keep my interest, though the gameplay elements were lacking. The choices you make have an effect on the game's outcome, which feels a bit abrupt but was still satisfying.\n\nPros:\n* Decent story\n* Interesting characters\n* Choices affect the story's progression\n* Distinct art style\n\nCons:\n* Very simple gameplay\n* Lots of reading (there is no voice work)\n","January 2","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had little familiarity with visual novel games before this one, and this was a hell of an introduction to the genre. While there were certain elements that I would've liked to have seen expanded upon, like the Decade and the more fantastical elements of the world it's set in, the game still has perfectly complex characters, gorgeous imagery, great music, and a labyrnthine, emotionally investing story that come together to formulate an engrossing world you can easily get lost in. Beautifully done.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2d_eHrOtNg&index=13&list=PLgZc88Lhxhm6uTiR34dI3DS1846puiZbh","February 19","true","12.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Often you have to exit the game to load a save or wait for some long scene to finish first.\n\nThe setting is a unique world where steam technology meets magic. A mysterious city where nobels rule over commoners and a strange plague. You investigate a murder case in five chapters.\n\nThe story is very deep and there's a lot of text, sadly the translation (english, german) isn't too great, they should probably hire someone else next time.\n\nIf you like those type of games and don't mind the negatives you got some good entertainment here and a story that got me hooked. Will watch out for more.\n\nEdit: finished now, was a real rad manga-like story (touches of "deathnote") with some turns and unexpected events.\nBad thing, the story doesn't tie up and ends on a cliffhanger, good thing they are already making new episodes.\nDefinitely recommended even though I'm no fan of visual novels...","February 21","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can see that it took some time for the writers to get the story down, but it plays out quite nicely and your decisions as Oliver (protagonist) impact the outcome. I love the production design (characters, steampunk motif, backgrounds and soundtrack) and the tranlsation from Russian to English comes across really well with few errors. There is one elephant in this room, for me, though; there is an 'almost-sex scene' and I found this awkward as all get out. I think it could have been said without being shown, and it devalued the game a little in my opinion, which is a shame because the rest of it is awesome. ****","June 1","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
