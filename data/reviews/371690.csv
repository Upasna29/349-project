It's the first bullet hell I didn't hate after playing for 15 minutes. I might or might not play the game for a longer period of time but it's looking good so far.\n\nLocked at 30 FPS.\nI'll still recommend it based on its price point, if you like bullet hell games.","July 27, 2015","true","1.5"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","22","29","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaimagi/recommended/371690/","amaimagi","amaimagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaimagi/","309 products in account","Pixel Space is a very simple yet fun indie game for all your spacey-shooter needs. It is games like this that stood out the most among all the others with its simplistic and clean style.\n\nThe game relies on standard WASD and mouse, alongside with 1-5 to control the spacecraft. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt an option to switch up the hotkeys provided within the game for those who aren‚Äôt comfortable with the initial setup.\nRight off the bat, Pixel Space welcomes the player with a small pop up tutorial message that the player could choose to skip over. Once you‚Äôre officially in the game, a small list of missions is available on the left side for you to choose:\nRecovery- Locate the cargo/item within the vast space by paying attention to the distance bar. The further you are away from the object, the more the distance bar would increase.\nRescue- Rescue the gigantic spacecraft and fend off the incoming enemies.\nWaves- Defeat waves of monsters and survive until the end.\nBoss- Eliminate the boss space ship alongside with its ‚Äúunderlings‚Äù to complete the mission.\nStore- The one stop for you to improvise your ship with various upgrades to increase your chance of survival against the bigger baddies.\nThere is a small ‚Äúwarp‚Äù key under the selected mission, which enables the player to fast travel to the specified location in matter of seconds. Although after following the missions a couple of times, it could prove to be quite repetitive, the option to fast travel really makes it up for it by being conveniently accessible.\n\nA game gets old if it doesn‚Äôt offer customizable weapons and whatnots, Pixel Space offers the player a chance to change it up via the store with several color options for your spacecraft and laser beams (it would be great, however, if there is an option to change the model of the ship as well). You can also find different weapons to help you shoot down your enemies (I suppose the enemies would be much better with more diversities and different formations as well to surprise the player).\n\nIn regards to combat, it is rather easy to play with the ‚Äúshoot and dodge‚Äù method. With the asteroids floating around, my first thought was to avoid them, but when I realized my space ship is fine crashing into them, I wanted to use them as shields against the enemies. Unfortunately, the floating rocks didn‚Äôt seem to be able to block the enemies‚Äô laser beams (I must add, it would be really cool if they could block the incoming fire and be able to explode into pieces), so I could only try to dodge the beams as if I was playing Touhou[ https].\n\nAll in all, this game is quite fun if you‚Äôre looking for a casual game to play and I definitely recommend this for those who‚Äôre interested.\n","April 9","true","0.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

Other than that this gmae is a 8.7/10 for me, it has plenty of potential but I would love to see things in future updates, and MORE ENEMIES and DIFFERENT BOSSES the same one is to easy, it just gaining more health come on it's poor in strength but good in protection and maybe add some more overpowered weapons like some kind of cannon instead of just buying a black hole bomb thing and wasting it on a shielded enemy like come on... it's a flippin black hole nothing can escape.","October 8, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

However the game does suffer a lot of repetition, namely the lack of variety on enemies and mission types, five minutes in and I‚Äôve already seen everything.\n\nSure you could grind away the hours doing the same chore over and over, but there is no incentive to do so. It is a shame since the core idea did have a lot of potential. I would have recommended this title if it was under a dollar, but at its current price as of this writing, it would be a no for me.","October 1, 2015","false","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
