No realistic crap, no Call of Duty or Battlefield-type "take cover or die" realism.  This is a BALLS-OUT bad@ss old school FPS.  Did you like (the original) Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake, and Duke Nukem 3D?  If you answered yes to any of these: Buy ths game.  Now.\n\nNow to the uninformed, Serious Sam The First Encounter is a FPS bullet hell with swarms of enemies, no cover, but plenty of bombs.  Just collect guns and shoot, shoot, shoot!!!!  The physics are wonderful and the enemies look hideous and hilarious simultaneously.  Plenty of blood and guts, many enemies, and a ton of weapons (I forgot how many, I'm sure the store page says).\n\nAnd don't forget Sam Stone's comments.  I think he was Duke Nukem's cousin.  Maybe nephew.  Maybe both.\n\nA+ in my book.  I'm a fan of old school bad@ssery, but if you're not, the game may not be for you.

Pure 100% action packed mother♥♥♥♥ing balls to the ♥♥♥♥ing wall holy ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm getting my ♥♥♥ kicked fun.\n\nWhat is Serious Sam The First Encounter? It's an old-school First Person Shooter, you shoot things, pretty simple stuff, right? Well, the thing about Serious Sam is that it does it so well, all you really need in a game like this is shooting. None of that modern military shooter garbage where it pretends to be "realistic" or "tactical" and it takes itself too seriously. Ironically, Serious Sam doesn't take itself seriously at all, it's fairly ridiculous actually. Non of that two weapon limit crap and health regeneration that seems to be the norm nowadays, this game is seriously bat-♥♥♥♥ insane cranked up to eleven.\n\nSo why is the game so good? It's fun, for one thing. It's you against a horde of enemies, you shoot everything that moves and it's extremely satisfying to do so. You have a wide arsenal of weapons to help you take on the extreme amounts of enemies flying at you constantly. Each weapon is so finely crafted and balanced to suit each situation in the game and you'll learn over time to know what weapon to use when and on what enemies. You can't just stick with the same weapon because you also have to worry about ammo conservation and it might not work as well as other weapons depending on what situation you're in. You'll slowly but surely adapt to the idea of switching weapons constantly and you better, or you'll get your ♥♥♥ kicked.\n\nThe insane variety of weapons you get is ludicrous, and you can carry them all at once. You got your shotguns, minigun, rocket and grenade launchers, laser gun, ♥♥♥♥ING CANNON and more. The game also gives you these weapons at a nice pace as you progress through the game. You'll need every single weapon because this game isn't easy, you will always be attacked by tons of enemies and you'll need to use whatever you have. As for the enemies, there's a very large variety of them as well, and some of the enemy designs are fairly amusing; like headless screaming suicide bombers called "Kamikazes", scorpions with chainguns, reptilian creatures that throw homing balls at you and many more.\n\nThe level design is nothing more than serviceable, which isn't a bad thing, it does its job, the enemy placement is occasionally very well and the game has nice pacing. You can also look for secrets which are fairly well placed actually, secrets help you out by rewarding your exploration with health and ammo. But what I like about the level design the most is that it isn't the maze-like level design of some other old-school and classic FPSs, THANK GOD (yeah, I'm talking to you, Doom 2!). All I want in a game like this is to shoot the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of everything that moves and I don't want to spend time figuring out where I'm supposed to go. Occasionally mid-way or at the end of a level you'll be fighting a boss, and these aren't just bosses, they're the size of a building, they're massive and very fun to fight, some of which you will later encounter as regular enemies once you've defeated them.\n\nThe game also has a storyline, rather forgettable and it's nothing more than a setting for the game but the intro to the game sums it up very nicely. Humankind uncovers some advanced technology from another race, eventually they are attacked by aliens and at the point of being entirely doomed, they send Sam "Serious" Stone, a hero wounded countless times but never defeated, through an artifact called "The Time Lock"; which has the power to send a single person back in time, so Sam is sent thousands of years back in time when humankind had a fighting chance to defeat Mental, the evil bad guy who is responsible for all this mess; and thus Sam fights his way through Mental's horde and whatnot. The Protagonist is likeable and quite awesome though.\n\nThe game also has multiplayer. STAY FAR AWAY, besides the fact that the multiplayer is dead, deathmatch is so incredibly unbalanced and pointless. There's also co-op, and it's up to 16 players which is kind of awesome but in my opinion, this game shines the most in singleplayer.\n\nIt's also not a bad looker, while the graphical fidelity isn't incredible, it still has some nice textures and shadow effects, modeling is good but the animations are a bit meh. The game is also very colorful, even though it takes place in Egypt which is always great. Also, the soundtrack is fantastic, it fits the game very well. I also have to mention the excellent sound design in this game. If you listen closely, you can hear the enemies that you are about to encounter and each enemy has its own sound, so you know what to prepare for when you're about to enter a new area or a room. And when you are surrounded by enemies, you'll know which direction they are coming from because you can hear them very well no matter which direction (if you're using headphones, of course).\n\nIn conclusion, if you're into the golden age of FPS, then you've probably already played this game, if you haven't though; definitely be sure to give it a try. I'd go as far as to say that this is probably the best game to start with for people new to the FPS genre. And as a remake, this is just as good if not better than the original version.","October 25, 2014","true","20.1"," 53 of 56 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","53","56","3","0"

Having never played the original off which this re-skin is based I though why not try something old-school when I saw this included in the Serious Sam bundle deal during sale time (although to be perfectly honest I was never much into FPS even when they were old-school). This HD remake gives the visuals a pleasant modern day look as we venture forth with the wisecracking Sam as he tries to annihilate the alien invasion single-handedly whose sole purpose for coming to planet Earth is for the extinction of humanity.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346517497\nI found the game to be rather fun for the first few levels but then it just got insanely difficult as more and more enemies re-spawned making it rather difficult to make steady progress. This rinse and repeat style of gameplay eventually had me pretty bored to tears to be totally honest (one can only take so many assaults before it becomes passé) and deep frustration began to settle in. That is until I decided to cheat just to get to the end of the game as I was fast approaching a point of just giving up on the title completely.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346517782\nIf you like your old-school first person shooters this should be right up your alley (and add + 2 to the score of course) but for those not so ingrained in the genre be prepared for some annoyances. I recommend it lightly and for those with a curiosity in some on-the-rails fun to keep an eye out for it when it comes on sale as you can usually get quite the nice bundle deal with more than just this game attached to it.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","May 3, 2014","true","10.7"," 63 of 82 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","63","82","0","4"

The result was Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter, which also marked the debut of third Serious Engine. (Apparently they wanted to erase the memory of SS2 so much that they released the remake before Serious Sam 3: BFE was finished.)\n\nThe finished product is mostly just a facelift on the original game, where the goal is still the same: use shotguns, rockets, cannons, and everything else in the vast arsenal to kill your way through a seemingly never-ending flood of monsters in ancient Egypt, all in order to stop an alien warlord called Mental before he eradicates humanity in the far future. All while finding silly little secrets and listening to the corniest one-liners any action hero ever spoken.\nThere are a few minor tweaks here and there: some new level secrets, rebalanced difficulty (easiest settings don’t reduce enemy health that much), and a few modified enemy spawn compositions or locations. They are not too large to make new players feel they don’t get the original experience, but enough to give something even for the veterans.\n\nThe graphical update is surprisingly humble. CroTeam touched the levels with respect, only making sure they were up to 2009’s standards, without adding unnecessary effects or any flashy things. This may come off as bad news for those who are used to FPS games being all about grandiose visuals and on-rails gameplay, but great news for those who want to know what makes these games so good but don’t want to go old-school in the graphical department.","January 25","true","16.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","0"

Easily one of my favorite FPS from the Quake era.  Maybe it has something to do with its large single player maps and it's Ancient Egypt theme. This is a very pretty HD remake and I can't wait to play through it again on modern hardware.  When it was first released in 2001 the whole community was sort of in awe at how such a good looking game (at the time) was priced at only $20...well, at least I was.  While Quake was headed in the Arena direction, Sam stayed true to the single player experience.  Secrets scattered throughout all the levels, hordes of monsters spawning in front of you, and lots of tongue in cheek humor.

They are very good games, especial from an independent gaming company. When I heard that my original favorites were coming back, but with improved graphics, I was happy! The game play is mostly the same, there are a few changes to enemy AI, cut scenes, and weapons, some are good, but some are disappointing. It has the same weapons, enemies, and music and sound effects!\n\nOverall, I think the Second Encounter of the HD versions is a better choice, because it contains the First Encounter in it as well, you just don't see the intro, which is a little important if you want to follow the storyline.

This first person shooter is based in the future where the world is about to be destroyed by the monster Mental. All hope is lost until we discover that the way to defeat these monsters can be traced from our past. Further research reveals that humanity has discovered an ancient race the Sirians who had also fought and lost to Mental's might. Humanity finds the ancient Sirian technology known as the Time-Lock which can allow one person to traverse time and space. Our protagonist Sam, who may be very serious, is a champion, a hero, and a legend for humanity. Fighting off every alien he encounters to the end Sam, a true warrior, is given the ultimate task. To use the Time-Lock to travel back in time and to defeat Mental while he is busy dealing with the Sirians.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nSerious Sam is revitalized in HD with a stunning thirteen levels (plus an additional two secret levels) digitally remastered and designed to meet the demand of modern day consumers. The graphics are not going to be anything like your blockbuster games, but that’s because the original was produced in 2001 and this is just a remastering. But the game looks rather clean and plays incredibly well. This game not only has secret levels, but is filled with little secrets for the avid gamer. Mysteries abound and things to find Serious Sam leaves you without want.\n\nResult:\nI played Serious Sam: The First Encounter only a little bit when it was released in 2001. Then purchased it recently because it was on sale. Not being an avid fan of the series I can definitely say this game is a fun purchase even if you never really played the original. There are an abundance of crazy enemies, a wacky story (that makes you keep wondering where all the humans are), awesome weapons, fun boss fights, and lots of crazy items. This game not only challenges you in combat making you feel like a hero, but also puts you to the test by throwing puzzles all over the place. The game requires you to solve puzzles, complete challenges, and defeat enemies in order to progress. The levels are long, the campaign is long, the game is a blast, it’s a must buy. If you like puzzles, you like first person shooters, you want nostalgia, or you just like to be a hero then this is the game for you.\n\nPros:\n+Incredibly fast paced combat\n+Puzzles in every level\n+Secret levels and many secrets within each level.\n+Lots of fun an interesting enemies\n+An abundance of bosses\n+Crazy amount of fun weapons to shoot about\n+Digitally remastered and in 1080p\n+Fun and gripping story that mixes reality with fantasy\n\nCons:\n-There is a limit to the amount fo auto-saves, you will lose older auto-saves in order for new ones to save, but don't worry you can just continually make saves yourself (I had over 200 by the end of the campaign).\n-The sensitivity can randomly spark (meaning it just shoots up and your character can suddenly turn with only the slightest mouse movement facing you the wrong way).","March 3, 2014","true","21.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Things can get rather hectic when you get further into the game with all kinds of different enemies swarming after you but with the wide array of weapons you have available, you'll be able to smash through them with no problems.\n\nMy favourite weapon has to be the Canon, you literally fire a huge canon ball and it just wrecks anything and everything in its path. There is a co-op option available, as well as high scores on each level which makes the longevity of this title larger than most.\n\nDefinitely one of my favourites now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cream-of-Plenty/recommended/41000/","Cream-of-Plenty","Cream-of-Plenty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cream-of-Plenty/","187 products in account","DISCLAIMER:  I played Serious Sam HD: TFE inside of Serious Sam HD: TSE, so I've logged more time than Steam would suggest.\n\nThe first two Serious Sam games were pretty novel when they were first released.  As Sam, players ran through massive levels, fighting similarly massive groups of (often massive) enemies.  It wasn't exactly the most radical idea on paper, but it was executed on a  scale that was previously unheard of in FPS games.  Levels often had over a thousand enemies, with fights pitting hundreds of opponents against the player simultaneously; a few enemies were even larger than entire maps in other FPS games.\n\nSince then, several of the games Serious Sam has (inevitably) been compared to have caught up to Sam's scope--for instance, there are countless Doom "slaughter" WADs that will throw hundreds or thousands of enemies at you.  But whereas most of Doom's arsenal was never really intended to contend with thousands of enemies, Sam's was built from the ground up with mass extinction in mind, and its bestiary was designed for enormous arena battles.\n\nWeapons are your primary means of interacting with the world in an FPS and, in the case of Serious Sam, the arsenal is especially rock solid.  You begin with the typical pistol(s) and combat knife, but it isn't long before you're fielding double-barreled shotguns, miniguns, laser rifles, and even an enormous cannon.  Virtually every firearm fills a niche and will find ample usage--especially on higher difficulties.  Rockets might travel further to snipe distant stationary targets, but the grenade launcher can charge up significantly faster projectiles and shoot around corners; the laser gun doles out tremendous damage up front, but its projectiles take time to travel through the air; the minigun's hitscan shots can mow down faraway crowds, but its ever-so-slight wind-up is a liability in close quarters.\n\nThe guns generally feel great to use, as well.  With an appropriate thunderclap, the double-barreled shotgun reduces Kleer to bone fragments; the SBC Cannon's VW Bug-sized shots blast through enemies like so many bowling pins and wipe swathes of the battlefield clean.\n\nEnemies are well-designed, too.  Unlike later installments in the Serious Sam series, TFE and TSE don't make the mistake of having numerous hitscan enemies.  Rather, most opponents produce a variety of physical projectiles--some follow you, some scatter, some cut through the air in small volleys, and some lazily fly towards their target--that can be seen and dodged.  That one factor is crucial because it means that dodging can keep you alive even when fighting a hundred foes.  Indeed, Serious Sam almost feels like a sort of "bullethell"-FPS at times, and by encouraging fancy footwork over taking cover, the game maintains a higher degree of momentum than many modern FPS games.  The sheer variety of enemies can be a refreshing change of pace from the standard/heavy/sniper trifecta that so many FPS games like to focus on nowadays.\n\nThen there are the levels:  They're huge, and they're especially gorgeous in the HD versions.  While TFE focuses exclusively on an Egyptian-themed mapset, it still includes some beautful setpieces including sprawling palaces, moody moonlit stretches, and Oases.  It certainly doesn't hold a candle to TSE's greater variety, but it does its best.  The maps are packed full of secrets--some obvious and some devious--as well as easter eggs and entire hidden levels.  If you're a completionist, be prepared to spend a lot of time hunting down some of these secrets.\n\nGiven the size and scale of eveything, one of Serious Sam's biggest selling points is (perhaps unsurprsingly) its co-op support.  Up to 16 players can take on the campaign(s) in TFE and TSE, with a wide variety of player skins to choose from.  You've never really experienced everything a classic FPS has to offer until you're bunnyhopping across massive sand dunes, gunning down waves with half a dozen other players who look like cyborgs, neon cowboys, and Santa Claus.  In fact, there are several different co-op modes including a "Coin-Op Co-Op" arcade-style points/lives system that helps strike a nice balance between players having infinite lives and the level being over for a player the moment they die.\n\nHonestly, I played countless hours of the original TFE and TSE years ago and I still feel that I got my money's worth with the HD remakes.  While they run on earlier versions of the Serious Sam 3 engine than Serious Sam: BFE, they're still perfectly capable of squeezing out some fantastic graphics.  And if you're planning to run TFE HD on an older computer, the sheer number of graphics options will let you tweak everything until it's just right.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd happily recommend TFE HD to anybody who has enjoyed Serious Sam in the past, who is interested in taking a breather from modern FPS's, or who is simply interested in exploring what is now widely considered a "Classic FPS".","April 14","true","13.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","11","11","3","6"

Serious Sam First Encounter HD will be a good buy for both new players wondering what the deal is with this thing and why everyone likes it, and the older gamers who remember the originals. It is as true to the original as it can get, with a few improvements.\n\nStorywise, it's nothing to write home over. It's a fairly standard story for a game that relies more on its gameplay than on captivating you with word words and more words. Aliens happened, they're after you, you're in acient Egypt and you have guns. Good luck!\nThere is more to it, if you take the time to read into the story there are just enough flavourful blurbs and explanations around that you can read to figure out where your enemies came from, and parts of the storyline, though it isn't something that will carry you through the game, it's more like an extra.\nThe true power of Serious Sam is in the gameplay, with excellent level design, guns that are satisfying to use, and a very high skill ceiling allowing you to feel like a god laying down devastation on hordes of enemies, moving fast enough to dodge almost all of their fire (Since all but a few enemies use projectiles, this means you can dodge nearly everything with enough practice) yet not too fast to become unmanagable. This, along with plentiful secrets, and a game that won't just say 'no' and throw up an invisible wall if you move slighly off the beaten path means that Serious Sam has an excellent grasp the concept of what great games are about- Freedom\n\nFreedom to choose your own tactics (And most are valid as well! No need to gimp yourself)\nFreedom to move as you please\nFreedom to explore the levels and find all the secrets\nAnd the freedom to handle any encounter in the way you want to.\n\nAlong with this, Egypt as pictured is a somewhat unique setting for an FPS game, with a lot of it lending itself for interesting levels and impressive scenery. The enemies you face are unique and mostly iconic as well, with the beheaded bomber and kleer skeleton being some of the more known enemies. In addition, Serious Sam has a great sense of humour, and you can play with a friend, two friends, or a whole army of friends.\n\nIf you're interested in a great FPS game, this is a game for you.","January 26, 2015","true","7.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OriginSaint/recommended/41000/","OriginSaint","Origin Saint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OriginSaint/","523 products in account","The high definition remake of the original Serious Sam: TFE turned out to breathe some serious new life into the game.  One of the original kings of the FPS genre, Serious Sam does a lot of things right, with a few things wrong, and suffers a tad from being a bit of an old title.\n\nOn the upside, the map sizes in this game are huge, providing a great open-world, fast-paced FPS adventure.  The voice-acting is nicely done with the expected humour and satirical remarks.  The design and layout of the levels are great, and very well-planned and make the game flow very well, but the downside to this game thing, is that if you manage to play for a long stint of time, the game manages to blend it's levels together and it starts to feel a little stale.\n\nNothing about this game is really amazing or innovative compared to todays FPS games, but it does manage to create an atmosphere of non-stop action from start to finish.  There's always something to shoot around every corner, some new tactic to come up with, new enemies to fight and new weapons to pick up.  The old-school secret areas are also a great touch to the game providing secret weapons, armor, health pickups or maybe getting a weapon earlier than you would otherwise.\n\nThe boss fights are pretty fun and in general the game is still really fun, the added benefit of the HD remaster in graphical fidelity and a few new features (autosave, etc...) really gets Sam back in the game.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes new or old FPS games, just give it a try, you might like it.","October 29, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/41000/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a remake of Serious Sam: The First Encounter, as you could guess. It was released in 2009 by Croteam and was also known as the first game to use Serious Engine 3. And yep, as serious as ever.\nIt also came out on X360 through Xbox Live service. The only difference that I am aware of is that it had multiplayer only up to 4 players and aim assist.\n\nMultiplayer community seems to be dead. Okay, maybe not completely, I did get into some match once at one day. But in other times server list is completely empty. And it makes sense, since Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter has Fusion feature which means that owners of SSHD:TFE get to have Egypt levels to be ported into that game. So instead most of people play in SSHD:TSE.\n\nPremise of original Serious Sam is that Sam Stone is sent into past into Egypt to try to stop the Mental forces before they destroy the Earth. And to do this he would need to pass many levels that have sections designed to serve as arenas to lock players inside. You didn't have as much exploration as in Doom or whatever Quake clone game. Instead it was more focused in pacing and tactical choices during combat itself, with encounters lasting few waves, as enemies keep pressuring you to move around. There were a lot of different enemy types and you had a lot of different specialized weapons, so you would have to choose correct gun for each sitatuation, prioritize targets and avoid all the different attacks. It's a classic!\n\nHD is surprisingly faithful to the original. I kinda expected it to change a lot of core gameplay, but Croteam is just a honest indie company and gave a game just a nice graphics upgrade. Gameplay is almost same and the awesome soundtrack is completely identical. It's quite nice! And yep, even included Karnak from demo version, just like original. No technology test though.\n\nAnd yea, it looks excellent, with much more natural looking desert and canyons. And if you take a careful look then you will see that some details that was just part of texture is now actual geometry, for example. Though, environment feels not fully finished, as inner places didn't get any additional details and some models seemed to have same textures quality, like statues, despite having more destruction phases. Just good nice new rendering with new light. Though I do wonder about some changes. For example, Alley of Spinxh levels is always at night and the third level of tomb has a fog changed from nice blue color to some dusty brown. As if Egypt doesn't have enough brown color with all sand.\n\nBut hey, look at all those great shiny weapons. And look at all the remade enemy models, now with ragdolls. Gore and weapons effects just got sexier, as you can now even gib part of enemies bodies, dismembering them, splitting apart, blowing head off with shotgun. It's awesome. Just look at the bull's death, where it would still slide around after being shot, leaving a trail of blood! And heavier enemies now can even be gibbed with a cannon, the heaviest weapon you have. The only strange thing is that Skeleton Kleers and Harpies are always gibbed upon death. For skeletons it looks good. But for harpies it looks strange, even gibs looks like just a few tiny chunks.\n\nIt also got some nice editing on gameplay. Some beheaded have a saw on their heads, giving them a melee attack. Bomberman looks fancy with that head on a spike, even. And heavy biomechanoids only shoot a single rocket when close to player, to let him have it easier, while it almost always was a certain death being very close to one in original. Kamikazes also seem to have smaller radius of explosion too. Flying gnaars seem to be more dangerous, not stopping when attacking. And weapons switch was made faster, which I approve. Though for some reason you can't walk anymore. Not that it ever was needed, just fancy.\nIf there is one thing I am most thankful the most is that new Netricsa messages notification is put somewhere to the side of a screen and doesn't grab your attention so you can ignore it easily. It was freaking annoying to be visually nagged by it everytime I killed each enemy types while playing custom maps in original.\n\nThough, not everything is going perfect and some cuts had to be made. Most noticeably is that some of obscure engine features of Serious Engine 1 weren't implented in Serious Engine 3. Due to this, all the gravity-changing shenagians had to be cut. To be honest, I don't miss them too much, in Serious Sam 1 they were used only as funny thing in a bunch of a secrets, plus once non-secret usage in a secret level. It probably costed more time to reimplent them for something so small. I mean, at least when Croteam was making the first Serious Sam they had plans to make it much bigger game, with futurustic levels which would abuse gravity features. Once they cut it all to be Egypt-only, well, it was pretty much funky leftover.\nIt also doesn't have mirror and sliding surface, which I remember used only once.\n\nThey also seemed to screw up weapon balance slightly. You see, minigun was made to shoot two times slower, but each bullet does two times damage and is supposed to consume two ammo. But it only consumes one. Result: There is no more reason to use Thompson and you effectively have two times more ammo for minigun than in original. Oh well.\nBut hey, at least Laser gun isn't glitched in HD. It would sometimes start shooting only at half-speed in original. So flaw taken, flaw given.\n\nAnd multiplayer is still awesome. Didn't get to cooperative, but I bet it's same spam, with same cutscene-skipping. And competetive part is awesome, still fast-paced. Although I noticed that rocket-jumping got nerfed and jumping off the slope doesn't give you additional height. But you are supposed to use knife to run fast and it still gets you in many places. And yep, still awesome arena-shooter which proves that you don't need some fancy strafejumping to be balanced and fast-paced.\nOh yea, and double shotgun in original was shooting at double speed. In HD it's same as in single-player/coop. Not sure what I think of it, but I think I like it this way. But maybe I need more experience with both ways.\n\nOh yea, and did you know that original The First Encounter was particulary embaressing due to having only a single DM level? Thankfully, HD added a bunch of them, even including Little Trouble from The Second Encounter. Hm, though HD multiplayer doesn't have scorematch mode, only fragmatch. But no one, absolutely no one, was playing scorematch in original anyway, so nah.\n\nOverall, not perfect, but damn excellent HD remake with a bit of balance editing, untouched core gameplay, some environment upgrade and great gore system.\nAnd yes, those who want to play Egypt levels in Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter have to have this game purchased.","April 16","true","16.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Serious Sam HD looks as good as the original did when it came out, but with modern graphics and standards. The gameplay is unchanged and as fun as ever.\n\nFor anybody unfamiliar with Serious Sam, this game is anything but serious. There is pretty much no dialogue and a bare minimum plot. But that's because this is a classic FPS when games involved a character running around with more firepower than an Armored Tank Division. Blast your way through crazy enemies with bullets, lasers, rockets, and...cannon balls.\n\nOne of the highlights of this game is the massive environment. While some maps are contained to the insides of buildings, lots of the game takes place outside in the deserts of Egypt and the maps are impressive. Not because there's a whole lot to see when running around a desert, but rather there's something majestic and awe inspiring to crest a dune and see a massive, ancient Egyptian city sprawled out before you.\n\nThis is a run and gun masterpiece and worth every penny.","May 8","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a lot about quick decisions, rather than pure endurance and conservation, which helps with the afore-mentionned frantic flow of the series.

Featuring dazzling visuals and revamped design, gamers take control of the legendary Sam ‘Serious’ Stone as he is sent back through time to ancient Egypt to battle the overwhelming forces of Lord Mental and the Sirian army.\n\n'This is first person shooting distilled to its purest and most action-packed form. Updated graphics, fun co-op, and a budget price tag join together to put this on any shooter fan's wish list.'\n\n'If you're looking to revisit the Serious Sam franchise, or looking to add to your collection, or even if you've never played it before in your life, it's hard not to recommend Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter.'\n\n'Eight years later, with the modern FPS riddled with faux-military obsessions and regenerating health, the game still feels reassuringly nostalgic. It's just a shame we weren't given a little bit more. With Serious Sam HD, Croteam prove it's possible to remake them just like they used to.'\n\n'Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a great purchase for both fans of the series and newcomers.

What can I say? It's actually the follow-on story to Serious Sam 3!! This story starts exactly where 3 left off . Despite it's age, the game is pretty good! Graphics aren’t bad and the gameplay is lots of fun. Since this game came first, you can hardly criticise it for being too similar to Serious Sam 3, but I would definitely play Serious Sam 3 first. Not only will the story make more sense, but you might find those similarities make 3 a little dull. That would be a shame since 3 is definitely the better game. Anyway, this one is well worth the money. It’s an old-school shooter that fast and furious and lots of fun.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA — Beheaded Kamikaze screaming for no reason (Beheaded Kamikaze Reference) and die horribly violent death by killing yourself. How in hell do those Beheaded Kamikaze Bombers are able to scream without a head it's a paradox I say a Paradox, in reality don't think to hard or you'll find out the hard way what happens of thinking the unthinkble. In truth this is fun game and no kidding it is hard even when the difficulty setting is set pretty low mostly due to being bombarded by enemies after enemies. It’s nice seeing an old classic game become remastered but that is what a lot newer games are becoming nowadays remasters and remasters of 3 or 4 year old games which is pretty foolish and only made for quick and easy cash grab by greedy A-holes. This game has several weapons to choose from and variety of enemies to fight. It’s not a Call of Duty clone it’s more homage to old classics like Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein that pioneered the FPS genre in the first place. You may love it or hate it, but considering there’s just not many games made like this anymore.

Tired of those dumbed down, simplistic, cover based, cut scene esentric shooters that seem to be every where in the market these days? I welcome you too pure carnage, intense action and psychotic stupidity! Granted, this game is only for those that just want a game of homicidal instinct and twitch arcade action. There is a story to all that, but the game knows that who ever is playing it, wouldn't give a ♥♥♥♥. Well balanced enemies and near perfect weaponry. This game will have you juggling your weapons with skill, and dancing with monsters. Narowly avoid getting hit by missles by the skin of your teeth, then swith out your rocket launcher and blast the big dudes in style, while having enough time to finish the rest of the horde with your minigun. I'm talking a billion different monsters coming to get you all at once, ranging from 5ft to 500ft, no cover to hide behind, and a dozen different guns to use at your disposal. This is a game! Not any where will it give you onscreen instructions to hit a series of buttons in order to progress. It doesn't waist your time with having any award winning writers coming up some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story for the sake of having a sensible reason to things. This is for those who've spent countless hours on DOOM II, or spent there entire weekend allowance in the arcade. But, in all farness, the only real downside I have to say about this game is that it's basic gameplay may seem not quite as ingaging after a long period of time. And even to me, every once and a while some hordes seem to get too repetitive, which is a problem more prevelant in the sequels than in the two original games.","March 8, 2014","true","45.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Serious Sam is an old-school First Person Shooter, with all the elements that made classic games great: lots of weapons, no regenerative health, full action without cutscenes and the core: shoot everything that moves.\n\nSerious Sam HD is a remake of the 2001 version, with improved graphics, achievements and online features over Steam. I haven't played the original version before and for my surprise I was astonished on how fun this game is. There are several skill option, ranging from the easiest (Tourist) to the most hardcore (Serious). The game can be quite difficult and overpower at some times, and if you enjoy hard games there are plenty of options to make the game even harder than this. And trust me, this game is HARD.\n\nI would definitively recommend this game to anyone looking for  some old school action and nice HD graphics.","February 19, 2014","true","76.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simple as that haha. I first played this game when I was in around 8 and I remember thinking then, "This is the best game ever !" And 13 years later I'm still believe that is true ! Using the Serious Sam 3 engine, Serious Sam: The First Encounter get's a whole new make over that makes that 8 year old in me happy. If you have never played Serious Sam, the throws waves upon waves of enemy keeping you on your toes as you progress throughout the levels. Going back to old school FPS mechanics, all you really have to worry about is shoot anything that moves. Story? Well monsters are attacking, You are Sam, and ♥♥♥♥ is getting serious, thats about it haha. So if you feeling a bit nostalgic and/or just wanting to find a game thats pure fun then definitely buy Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter.","March 31, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The HD graphics look great, but there are many areas too big for nothing, so they look rather plain, and travelling across them is a pain, taking too much time. The story could have been better told in cinematic form rather than a large paragraph of text.\n\nI know this is an old game, but this was my personal opinion. It is a rather good game for an old one.\n\nMy Rating: 6/10\n\nIf you love old-school shooters, then this is definitely 9/10 for you.","January 13, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I swear it's like someone put something like this to try and force competition with everyone. I really don't see any story or why people seem to love this game so much.\n\nUpdate: going back and accepting I don't have the mad (or Serious) reflexes needed for this game I lowered the difficult from Serious and found I had a lot more fun with it and have advanced through many different temple stages, though difficulty still amps up quite high, especially with Kamakazis attacking you!\n\nHonestly though, this game is pure gold. I love it's humor, I love how it's never static where creatures spawn. If you try being smart like I try to be, you get attacked by that damn Kamakazis so I suggest headphones or decent speakers as you will need to listen for the "AAAAAHHHHH" before it's too late and you get blown to peices.\n\nThere are many things to love about this game with it's design and the design of some of the strange otherworldly creatures who see you as an immediate threat and attack you in their own ways, the monster logs making this more fun to learn about these creatures and where they come from.\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone who wants to play an old-school FPS. No school like the old school with FPSs imo. Especially on the PC where we've had classics like Doom and Wolfenstein back in the day that invented the genre.","August 31, 2013","true","4.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

However, this game has already earned a review in my opinion.\n\nAt first, I was not very impressed, and saw this as a fairly mediocre game. Simple enemies, not a whole lot going on, boring maps, and some okay-ish weapons. I was considering quitting there and just never going back.\n\nI am glad I didn't do this, however, and instead pushed on past the first few levels to find a very enjoyable experience. This game offers a challenge, while giving you the chance to massacre entire hordes of enemies at the same time. Going from a mediocre toss away, to a very entertaining barrage of gunfire.\n\nIs this game for everyone? No, I can easily see that there are things that would turn away most people, especially those that seek a truly realistic game. This game is not realistic whatsoever. This is a game where you can run around with a Thomspon that never has to reload, with 1,000 rounds, and just unload on everything in sight, while taking missiles and bombs to the head, without a care in the world, because you're some random guy in a T-shirt who decided one day that he felt like slaughtering an alien invasion.\n\nNone of the weapons in this game seem to be better than the others, each one has a purpose, and fits a different playstyle. Which adds a lot of fun to the game, as you experiment with different weapons, or combos, on different enemies, to find out what your favorite way of doing things is.\n\nIf you like games where it's all about the fun of shooting the heck out of everything in sight just because you can, and love the old school shooter style, BUY THIS GAME.\n\nIf you like games that focus on realism and dying after just a few hits, you may or may not like this game, but it'd be worth a try just to see if you like it.","June 11, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If I didn't know it, I'd say my enemies were flat. (That's a good thing, trust me.)\n+Runs 60 FPS on every system I've tested on, no matter what the graphics settings were\n+Lots of customization in settings (Basically, you have the options to change what color/kind of blood you see, and how the atmosphere of the game looks like.)\n+Database system encourages researching enemies, and quickly identifies the foe you are fighting\n\nx Level design, it can be really good at times (Puzzles, mild parkour), but otherwise, it's straight and forward or it's an arena\nx Lots of difficulty settings, but they feel really poorly designed (I'm playing at normal, and it seems way harder than normal. I've played easy, and it's way too easy. There's at least 6 different difficulty setings. :B)\nx Saving! You can save, great right! Not really. So, in the game, you can press F6 to quickly save your game. Otherwise, if you die, you are set back to the start of the level. This sucks when you forget to save or are too busy getting blown up to save.\nx Sound quality. First off, Sam is hilarious. He says some super-generic puns that'd you'd expect from a cheesy action movie or Duke Nukem. But, the enemies sounds... Well, you got the Kamikaze who screams his a** off when he charges, Scorpion bosses sound like someone taking a sh**, and the Bone Horse-thingies are too loud. The game's music isn't that great, but you can't really mute it, because sounds play such an important role in knowing when you're going to be attacked\n\n-SUPER REPETITIVE, I kid you not. Combat doesn't change, it just gets harder because the enemies have more health, fire more bullets, or are more plenty in numbers. The combat is basically just jumping and shooting, avoiding enemy charges, or tearing down hoardes.\n-LEVEL DESIGN! (I know I said this already, but...) There's this one level that was just agony. You start off with your pistols and shotgun (Only the shotgun does good damage) and you have to go into a large field with enemies. Once you kill them all, you have to fight another wave. Then, another wave of harder enemies come. Then , you fight a boss. Then, another boss, and then another, much larger boss. Again, this all takes place in the SAME FIELD.\n-Plot doesn't justify the game. Why am I fighting? How did I get here? Why are these enemies spawning? Why are there so many? Why do they look the same? What am I looking for? Isn't there a much easier way? What do you mean I have to read about it? It'd be so much easier to explain if it took place in hell.\n\nIN CONCLUSION[/b]\n-Well worth the $1.50 I paid for both of the games\n-A lot like old games like DOOM or the original Serious Sam\n-You could probably get much more enjoyment from another game, but this game does have its perks\n-I'd say it's NOT worth the Steam price (14.99 for the first game, 30.00 for both.)\n-Good if you're looking for an easy-to-run game to pass the time","February 6, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

New levels have been added and technically a new weapon, The Grenade Launcher, but this weapon was originally featured in Serious Sam: The Second Encounter.\n\nThe Graphics have been enhanced to a certain degree that someone new to the Serious Sam franchise will be able to jump right into it. Basically everything in game received the HD treatment, Weapon texturing and enemy texturing has vastly improved. Sound effects and music are pretty much still the same however.\n\nGameplay is pretty much identical to the original iteration so nothing much has changed. However this comes to the first part that REALLY gets on my nerves with this game. Enemy spawns are damn near AWFUL. I lost count of how many times I died due to a Kamikaze spawning literally right on top of me. Enemy placement sometimes getting downright frustrating at times with for example Kleer Skeletons basically camping doorways and you get double "clawed" from two angles getting heavily damaged if not outright killed from such a attack. "Trap" Enemies are usually the work of lazy map designers. This same trap rule has been applied to ammo and health pickups as well adding on to the sentiment of being punished for picking up items which are supposed to help you.\n\nWhile the game was enjoyable there are many aspects which make it feel cheap and lazy. My recommendation is to either stick with the Original games or get Serious Sam 3.\n\nFinal Score: 65/100","November 7, 2015","false","24.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","4"

You only have to kill, you can't level up, there is no sense of rewarded-challenge- The difficulty level increases as more and more mobs appear in specifically hard spots where, to aim, you have to ignore all the melee attackers and guess what? melee will continue spawning until you kill those big mobs far away.\n\nIts a thumbs up what they did with the graphics, but it sucks that mods usage doesnt count for challenges, for example, What would be the problem with my steam badges if i choose to play as a Patrick Star (SpongeBob friend) character?\n\nIn conclusion:\n-Play only with friends with microphone\n-Dont rush\n-Dont play the whole game in one stand (is even more boring)\n-Buy only if you like shooters\n-Its very repetitive, and gets harder each 100 meters you walk\n-You are going to die a lot of times\n-You are going to curse some challenges\n\nWould i recommend it?\nOnly if you have lots of friends with microphone playing it at the same time AND/OR if you played it as a kid and you plan to play it again.","May 26","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Like with SS3, the gameplay is quite similar, although I prefer the feel of these to the new game, and these are much, much easier. Serious Sam is about facing dozens, even hundreds of enemies at a time, all while learning their attacks and planning what to do ahead of time. You don't need cover to have strategy. Besides having a kickass soundtrack, I wasted hours of my childhood on this (the classic, not the HD obviously) and it still holds its gameplay quite well. Although this game is still a cut above say, COD, or Crysis's difficulty, you can still jump in and have a good time on the easy setting. Croteam is a small, 12 man team, and as you can expect from an indie company, you will be treated like a person. *cough* EA *cough* Bethesda *cough*. The game has probably around 10 hours of content on one playthrough in single player if you look for all the secrets.

So this isn't about the game's age. Problem is this game failed as a shoot'em up, because of shooting feel. It feels  exactly like virtua cop 2 (gamer dinosaurs unite!) which is a very bad thing about fps games(not for arcade games). Just click and shoot, you can't feel any thing (hit or being hit). Like shooting clouds. By the way, I can speak about other annoying things like spawning enemies, similar levels etc. But i don't, cause it's useless. Everything about single player is coming short. And i think the devs probably know that, cause above the %80 achievements are about multiplayer deatmatches. And guess what, multiplayer is dead. Surprise(?) i don't think so. Well for the final i can say, if you like this game (or nostalgia) and have friends like yourself, you can buy it (on sale of course).  Otherwise i don't recommed it, even on sale. Especially new players, look for other games friends, this game was all about hype and hype was dead long ago.","October 9, 2015","false","17.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

You jump. You shoot. You jump. You shoot. Sometimes you solve a puzzle. Looks better than classic.

You probably won't be paying attention since you are going to be too busy circle strafing.\n\nOne curious thing I found about this version of the game is that the level with the upsidedown enemies has been modified so that this feature is completely gone. I would say that there was some issue with the limitation of the engine, but I think they used the same one. An oversight perhaps?\n\nThe multiplayer is completely depopulated.

A very well done port with all you could wish for in your options menu, 60+ fps, very easy  addicting gameplay. The only downside is, that it only takes place in egypt, which you might find boring on the eyes after a few levels, but, since its a shorty, I dont think its too much of a problem. On its own, this game is great, but keep in mind, you get all the content this game has and even more in The Second Encounter.

The game itself is amazing, with every minute being filled with non-stop action and shooting. Best part is, there are no objectives. 1 mission for every level: Make it to the end! Now i should note, if you want to start at the very beginning, play Serious Sam 3: BFE first, (BFE = Before first encounter).\n\nThe achievements in this game are insane, and serious dififculty almost made me ♥♥♥♥ing quit this game. Even on normal this game is tough as nails, but very fun and enjoyable. Another thing i love are the secrets. The secrets are so useful and cool, that even sometimes are surprising because of how much effort are put into 1 mesely secret. Now one of the BEST parts about this game are the enviorments. The grassy and sandy enviroments are so amazing, each level has its own unique enviorment, from sandy egypt-styled enviorments to grassy enviorments, the enivorments are one of my favorite parts about this game! Just look at these enviorments!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545805986\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545805953\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545805998\n\nEspecialy in the later levels, like Metropolis City. Hell, even the Sewer level didnt fail to give me a damn good level design!\n\nThere are 13 levels, (15 including the 2 secret levels), and each level is filled with monsters to gib and kill! There are also a lot of puzzles in this game too, mostly levers, pressure pads, etc, but these puzzles give the game a bit more to offer than just killing enemies. The 2 secret levels can be unlocked by doing certain things, but im not telling you how! :3\n\nNow i must say, the game did give me some glitches, not game breaking glitches but otherwise minor glitches that were still noticable. I also thought that sometimes even on Normal that some parts seemed like i was playing on Serious, but then i remembered that this is an old school shooter, and that this is what an old school shooter is all about: Shooting and killing! Overall, Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a blast to play! I highly reccommend it to anyone who loves a great old school shooter!\n\n~~~\nFinal Verdict:\n\n8.5/10: Amazing!\n\n~~~","June 23, 2014","true","125.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Don't bother with this game if you want a good single player game, I can see you'd get more playability out of this if you do multiplayer.\n\nI'd rate it 6/10","May 31, 2015","false","25.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenGuy/recommended/41000/","GoldenGuy","GoldeFish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenGuy/","253 products in account","NOTE: This game is FUN HOWEVER, I just don't recomend it to people like me, who are looking for a frantic single player experiance. Dang I wish Steam had a "MEH" buttonIs this game bad? NO\nIs this game great? NO\nIs this game heavily flawed? YES\nDo I recomend it? Eh... I am going to have to go with "NO"\n\nWelcome to the world of Serious Sam, a strange world where you goal is to kill anything that moves. Sound fun? It is! A ton of unique diverse levels for your crazy brain to plow through. Tons of enemies and great satisfying levels make for what should be a phenomenal game! Why isn't it then? Simply put the levels have some of the worst design choices I have ever seen in any game I have ever played. Sure some points the levels can be a blast, like the first half of City of Memphis - Metropolis where you have to go around a city styled maze and collect the 4 scarabs while avoiding the waves upon waves of different enemies that are searching for you in the maze, and City of Memphis - Sewers with some original designs and very generous enemy placements which make for a unique intense experience. However, 2 MAJOR flaws bring what should be a great game quickly down to some of my least favorite games of all time.\n\nFirst MAJOR FLAW: Unfair Padding/ Poor Level Design:\n\nRed signs of these problems start to appear however once you start playing the second half of the level City of Memphis - Metropolis, there is a pit with spikes with a chaingun that is supposed to spawn across from it to signify that you should go over there, although the first time I did it, it didn't spawn. A bull comes barreling across the pit and of course in classic game fashion it saves right as it is about to hit you giving you exactly 1 second to respond once you load up the save which is a whole different can of worms. Once you cross the pit you hear more bulls, a few dozen come flying at you and it shouldn't be a problem until those freaking skeleton running things come running at you and guess what... there are well over 100 of them. Earlier I did say how waves and waves can be fun... but only in well designed arenas like the one previously mentioned. However at this part it is just a straight hallway leading to a double door where they are spawning.They even continue to spawn even when you get on top of their spawn point making them practically impossible without rare or even unfair luck. Prior to this the level Oasis is entirely padding. From the first part of the level with the outside madness of hundreds to enemies to the "boss encounter". Why is it in quotes? Because, frogs... They decided that whenever creating a game, if you want to pad a level over 8 minutes without putting in any effort is spawn hundreds of small enemies that kill you easily inside a small square room. GENIOUS! It's not that I am against difficult games, because I am not (just look at my achievement list that includes Cave Story + Blood Stained Sanctuary which is one of the HARDEST levels in video game history). This happens more than once throughout each levels, some more then others which makes the game very hard to enjoy. From what it seems, they took a lot of time designed the first part of a level (excluding everything in Oasis) and then just decided "Man I took way to long on that level and it's not even up to the adverage length! Lets spawn 1000000 enemies!" which is most unfortinute.\n\nSecond MAJOR FLAW: Enemy Spawning\n\nAs I stated above briefly whenever you get near where an enemy spawns it does regardless, making for a practically instant death. An example is in Oasis in the first room you have the ability  to grab health on the edge of the valley. Once you get over there, enemies have the ability to spawn and can spawn directly on top of you which lead you directly to death. This happens a lot of the time in the game and really bogs down the experience.\n\nConclusion\nAnd those are my main problems with the game. Does it make it terrible? No. Does it make it unenjoyable in every sense of the word? Yes. Unfortunately what Croteam fails to see is that when designing a level one should design it well and not but one hallway with a few hundred of the same enemies spammed to be sure to kill you artificially lengthening the level, and expecting a player to know where an enemy spawns before it spawns which leads to an almost instant death is just cruel. I did finish the Demo Level on Hard difficulty and I had a blast. But I played on the 5th level of this game on Normal and I felt like I was being killed just for the sake of padding. Again, NORMAL what most people start playing a game on. Overall I recommend this game for friends. But as it stands this is one of the most unenjoyable single player experiences on Steam.\n\nPros:\n+ Fantastic graphical style\n+ Fun setting and level styles\n+ Fun and uniquely satisfying weapons\n+ Fun and diverse enemies\n+ Fantastic Multiplayer\n\nCons:\n+ Absolutely atrocious level design\n+ Abysmal enemy spawning mechanic\n+ Very Very Poor singleplayer experience leading to no fun at all.\n\nOverall: 5.8/10 "Major flaws that bring what should be a great game down low"","February 16, 2015","false","6.0"," 14 of 34 people (41%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","41","14","34","6","2"

Gameplay is way too finicky and reminds me Duke Nukem where each level has to be played perfectly just to survive. The main reasons I liked Quake & DOOM was because of the great sense of speed and freedom of movement. Meanwhile, SS takes the complete opposite approach with you crawling through levels and spending the majority of the game backpedaling while holding down M1. Tedious gameplay, bland graphics & sound, and boring map & game design round out this unnecessary "remake". Nothing new or noteworthy here and not worth picking up for anyone.","January 3, 2013","false","4.4"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

Lag-stuttery performance because of either poor coding, poor optimization, or both. This game has one area, egypt, and the second encounter is the exact same game with egypt in it but also a few more areas, so I basically got ripped off and did not need to buy the first encounter because it is useless. $2.50 wasted. Only a cult set of people enjoyed these turds back when they came out long ago and nowadays nobody really cares about them and for good reason. Giant, open, lifeless, contentless, boring, repeating, ugly, lonely levels are each entirely the same color (tan or green or whatever) with a few props and of course thousands of boring enemies with poor shooting mechanics from seemingly 1992. It is too bad the cool art direction of the enemies could not have been used for a better game because a few of the enemies are pretty cool.\n\nTake Doom, Quake, and Half-Life, take away every single thing that made them all so great, and you have this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage of a game. One of the most generic, watered down fps games I've ever seen. It is not fun.\n\nThe weird thing is that the only decent game out of them all is Serious Sam 2 and Serious Sam DD XXL.

To summarise, the game's an arcade focused FPS where you success is driven by fast reflexes and ability to chain points. Besides some glossy modern day improvements cosmetically including: a new physics engine, gore, some destructable environments and DX9c quality visuals, this edition is no different now as it was nearly ten years ago from release. It's fairly upsetting, and actually the game's flow still never manages to be as fluid or smooth as I remembered from all those years ago. Perhaps Serious Sam HD's biggest fault lies in that it hasn't taken advantage of any major gameplay improvements made in it's sequels, like Serious Sam: The Next Encounter on Gamecube even. The presentation is fairly average with below average menu navigation and poor multiplayer lobby support. It's an easy game to run, and supports the Xbox 360 controller but this release is tough to endorse otherwise.","October 17, 2011","false","9.1"," 4 of 20 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","4","20","0","1"

More like Serious ♥♥♥♥. That's all this game is. One big ♥♥♥♥. A steamy pile of doo doo.\n\nSerious Sam at its core is a mindless run and gun with no heart or soul. The main character tries so hard to be Duke Nukem for no apparent raisen. Sam himself is an idiot amongst idiots. Every enemy you fight is just a faceless thing throwing itself at you in waves. The developers must have been really confused with character design for the enemies. They just toss in whatever random crap they can think of. From what little story there is, most of the enemies don't really fit the genre of the type of enemy you're supposed to be up against. Which is aliens, I guess... but most of the time you fight weirdo ♥♥♥♥ like feral screaming idiots without heads trying to suicide bomb you. There's a scorpion man with a machine gun attached to his arm... some sort of flying harpy... a skeletal demon thing.. the stupid bull creature from Star Wars Episode II... Oh, and the final boss is Satan.\n\nAnyway, the story makes little to no sense at the best of times. The egypt setting is kind of cool, but little is known as to why it takes place in egypt... I know it's an older game and I shouldn't be so hard on it.

What's that? You want to do it in large open beautiful spaces. You get both with Serious Sam. Most of the gameplay consists of you in a large area fighting endless hordes of enemies. It might sound boring to stay in an area for a long time but it's not. You'll fight so many tough guys that the weaker enemies will seem like allies since your only companion in the game is a text computer. Serious Sam also has great visuals. You can see tall buildings like you were as if you were seeing the San Jacinto Monument up close and personal. Music is also great too and kicks up when an enemy encounter occurs. Even if there are only a couple of boss fights the bosses are gigantic (as big as Godzilla).

Originally I completed these games on the console and I was excited to find out that there was more content in the PC version. These versions are a lot of fun on Normal difficulty but becomes horrifyingly difficult on Hard. There are two more difficulty modes I would never attempt. I highly recommend Serious Sam: First and Second Encounter, it's a satisfying Wave FPS with some comedy tossed in that gives the player a great feeling of progression and accomplishment on each playthrough. You can choose any levels already completed which is excellent for casual replay. Really this game is a classic for any library and if you haven't played it you are missing out.\n\nI believe the trick to enjoying the Serious Sam games is to set up keybindings for your weapons and learn them well as it will add alot of depth to gameplay.","March 9, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just spent time reading all the negitive reveiws and man are they some Sirian Werebull $#!%, people complain about the basicness and the fact that the game isnt "SERIOUS" and thats the point its supposed to be mindless, and the games too hard, game saves and i die, now yeah i have consecutivly played this series non-stop over the past 14 years and have a keen skill of doing 360s and blowing Kleers and kamikaze's to hell the one enemy that people seem to loath but to me are litterally cannon fodder easy as pie if you learn to play, plus im sure you can figure out how to load saves and i think you can disable auto saves F6 quick saves, the point is the game isnt serious, its super fun yet challanging if your new, its no f***ing Call of Duty,(sadly 3 took that route and it kinda ruined it but hell its still fun.) the single player is great, hard crawl from start to finish, but the gold lies in the CO-OP, like jesus christ its 16 players, it always has been and it gets crazy if the server host adds a enemyhealthboost% per player (ala borderlands {post borderlands of course}) you start it at normal dificulty and by the time you hit 16 with a 50% boost per player its harder than Serious dificulty and its great fun. dont listen to the negitive reveiws its fun, it may not be your game if you were raised today but as a kid in 01' this game was awesome i remember coming home from school sitting down jumping on a server and playing start to finish with 15 diferent humans somewhere in the world, its something i still enjoy today wether it be HD or Classic.","January 12, 2011","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I can make your decision a little easier. Short version is, get Serious Sam HD: TFE. Long version is, get Serious Sam HD: TFE, maggot. Better yet, get the TFE/TSE bundle. TFE is a game about Sam "Serious" Stone killing massive loads of alien creatures in ancient Egypt armed only with his wits. As well as a cannon, a chaingun, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher, a laser gun, a tommy gun, a big knife, two shotguns, akimbo Colt .45s, and a neurally-implanted computer system. Because he didn't want to overdo it, you see. Logically, I can assume that this has already convinced you. Thus, I'll leave you with this advice: set your color options to "Vivid". Trust me on this. If the default colors are pretty, then Vivid is BEAUTIFUL. Now get out there and tear a Werebull a new one. ...Oh, and do tread lightly.

Of course there is pretty much no story, all you need to know are the basics, which are for some reason you need to find some things, and do some stuff, which requires you to kill a whole lot of things (easy enough!).  The best moments though are the prolonged fights and their difficulty levels.  This game has no problem throwing, 20,30,40,50+ enemeis at you at once and the best part is you know you've got the firepower to handle it and every fight gives you a sense of accomplishment because they throw lots of enemies of every type at you.

In certain respects, it is even harder than Serious Sam 3: BFE.  It entails blasting enemies level after level getting from point A to point B.  If you are a 'nit picky' guy or a mainstream FPS player, then you would be disappointed by the nostalgia.  The plot is esentially primarily written and, yes, it involves the Egyptians and aliens and, yes, the ideas are cliche/ farfetched.  Given that those same 'aliens and Egyptians' kind of mentality actually gives this game its own identity.  Most people complain about the game because they may not be reading the plot before completeing the level.  Here's why this game is harder than Serious Sam 3:  no sprinting, the enemies can block movement, the enemies block each other (a positive and a negative), the enemies will literally bounce off of structures (i.e. trees, corners, statues, etc.; this is especially prevalent with sirian werebulls, marsh hoppers, and kleers), the kamikazes appear to be faster in this game, as opposed to SS3:BFE but that may be due to the lack of sprinting, enemy ambushes will tend to surround you out of nowhere, you can't always go back for extra ammo, health and armor for most maps (if not all), and the Tommy gun uses the same ammo as the minigun.  Unfortunately, all of the Serious Sam games have an extremely small online community.

What's that? You want to do it in large open beautiful spaces. You get both with Serious Sam. Most of the gameplay consists of you in a large area fighting endless hordes of enemies. It might sound boring to stay in an area for a long time but it's not. You'll fight so many tough guys that the weaker enemies will seem like allies since your only companion in the game is a text computer. Serious Sam also has great visuals. You can see tall buildings like you were as if you were seeing the San Jacinto Monument up close and personal. Music is also great too and kicks up when an enemy encounter occurs. Even if there are only a couple of boss fights the bosses are gigantic (as big as Godzilla). Serious Sam gives you a unique experience.","October 23, 2014","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's not to say that it's a bad thing, on the contrary, it's a benefit. Serious Sam throws so much insanity, anger and general chaos at you that you're missing out if you don't have someone else to act as a human shield. Secrets are a lot easier to find, cooperation is fun and overall I'd say you should get it. Between the friendly fire, weapons and general adventure, it really is the more the merrier.\n\n\nThere are some cons though:\nBoss battles that'll catch you off guard and don't always make sense initially. (Trust me on this.)\nSecrets can sometimes be unfairly hidden or require a great deal of work or searching to find.\nEnemies warp in, they don't have proper spawns or doors they walk through.\nNo regenerating health. (Get good scrub, this ain't Call o' Duty.)\nThere is a secret level that you will go the entire game without seeing. You might be able to guess where the entrance is, but it's going to take a while to get to it. If you're good, you won't cop out and look it up online. Yes, that means you.\nThe last boss is just... insane. I won't spoil it for you, but you won't be ready for it.\n\nSo, that being said, I'd say get the game. Great with friends. Unless you don't have friends, in which case find some you sad, lonely depressant.\n","March 7, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fast movement, blowing away tons of enemies, and maze-like levels are the norm here.\n\nThis HD remake seems to be exactly the same game as regular Serious Sam The First Encounter, just obviously with increased model, texture, and animation quality on everything.  It is also running in an updated engine, but just playing through casually I dunno what benefits there are to that specifically.\n\nAnyway, I recommend, though maybe not at full price unless you really like old-school FPS games.","June 29, 2013","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjst9/recommended/41000/","jjst9","Doktor Egg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjst9/","1081 products in account","Serious Sam, the character, is a time traveller sent back to ancient Egypt to fight aliens for reasons. Serious Sam, the game, feels more like it came from another dimension, a dimension where shooters never turns dust brown and clothed in ridiculous pretensions of militaristic realism. It is bright, colourful, imaginative and wilfully shallow and stupid.\n\nTo my mind the most pleasantly surprising thing about Serious Sam is how simultaneously thoughtful and mindless it is. The mindlessness is obvious, you shoot all the aliens with the big guns. The thoughtfulness springs from varied nature of the enemies and weapons combined with how refreshingly fair and open the designers were about their scripting.\n\nThe scripting is simple but brilliant. This is a game that will shamelessly spawn enemies directly in front of you if that is what the scripting calls for. This is game that doesn't give a damn about real world physical possibility so if it clashes with their level design then it can take a hike. On the other hand it also never appears to use infinite re-spawning of enemies. This allows for the player to play with the scripting, triggering a wave of enemies and then retreating slightly to deal with them before progressing. This might sound shoddy but it isn't, it really isn't, it is actually great because it allows the player to fully play the game rather than just experience it as a rollercoaster. This is a game that is made to be played rather than merely taken as some sort of an interactive cinematic experience. I won't spoil it but if you pay attention you'll notice the game even establishes an informal convention regarding some optional waves of enemies where the trigger can be identified and avoided by the play if they just want to continue.\n\nHonestly, this isn't the sort of game I love. I was never a fan of old school shooters. I like to sneak about and take things slowly rather than charging in all guns blazing and all guns blazing is Serious Sam's thing. I can't deny that this sort of thing has its place though and this is perhaps the best game I've played of this type of shooter. If you've just had a stressful week and just need something loud and stupid to comfort you then Serious Sam might be just the thing.","December 19, 2013","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing is more satisfying than mowing down dozens in front of you while dodging the other truckloads at your flank. The game's story? Pffft.

The upgraded graphics is still smooth and clean, with more realistic shaders and water effects. The soundtrack is also one of my videogame favourites, up there with the likes of Jazz Jackrabbit 2 and Max Payne.\n\nCo-op is still fun as ever, and leaderboards are integrated with the Steam Community which is a nice touch.\n\nThe only criminal move Croteam has done with this release is the removal of their team's theme tune at the intro.

But, not only you can blast off monsters in it, but it contains some puzzle that you kinda solve for yourself. Thankfully there are hints to know where they are and you just wen through it.\n\nThe monsters are a bit cheesy but there are some that are hilarious, especially with those kamikaze bombers, whose are headless and come and say "AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" and it explodes you up. Creepers from Minecraft won't touch that one.\n\nDespite the fact it is made by Croteam, I can honestly say that this game was good. I've haven't seen any international game publishers who can sucessfully made a good game out of it (though Japan makes ALOT of good games and some bad games).

But don't be fooled; your foes, though seemingly lacking both beauty and wisdom, are still capable of advanced and cunning tactics. Among those are spawning behind your back or right in your face, remaining immobile indefinitely in a shadowy corner waiting for you to walk into the room, or - when all else fails - running directly into gunfire in hopes that your supplies will vanish sooner than their ranks.

Because when I was growing up graphics didnt affect me. But nowadays graphics are getting better every year and serious sam was getting left behind. This brought back good memories.\n\nAnyway, serious sam is a good shooter game. It has the chance to has a good story if you read the level desciptions before the levels but before now i just skipped them. Though as long as you know generally who Sam is you will be fine but no big if you dont.

First, even though it was not developed in a time where graphics were at their best, its makers really managed to pull out the best of what the graphic can be at that time. Second, it is a fun game and killing hordes and hordes of enemies and dicovering secrets never becomes boring with every level presenting a new challenge and a new way to overcome it. Last but not least, the producers of this game gave a lot of time and effort in designing every level, with the areas looking amazing and well detailed.\nHowever there is a single flaw in this game.

The action and everything bring me back to  games like the original Doom.  Everything just feels right about the game.  From the art style, the weapons, and even the enemies.  Of course there is pretty much no story, all you need to know are the basics, which are for some reason you need to find some things, and do some stuff, which requires you to kill a whole lot of things (easy enough!).  The best moments though are the prolonged fights and their difficulty levels.  This game has no problem throwing, 20,30,40,50+ enemeis at you at once and the best part is you know you've got the firepower to handle it and every fight gives you a sense of accomplishment because they throw lots of enemies of every type at you.

That's not to say that it's a bad thing, on the contrary, it's a benefit. Serious Sam throws so much insanity, anger and general chaos at you that you're missing out if you don't have someone else to act as a human shield. Secrets are a lot easier to find, cooperation is fun and overall I'd say you should get it. Between the friendly fire, weapons and general adventure, it really is the more the merrier.\n\n\nThere are some cons though:\nBoss battles that'll catch you off guard and don't always make sense initially. (Trust me on this.)\nSecrets can sometimes be unfairly hidden or require a great deal of work or searching to find.\nEnemies warp in, they don't have proper spawns or doors they walk through.\nNo regenerating health. (Get good scrub, this ain't Call o' Duty.)\nThere is a secret level that you will go the entire game without seeing. You might be able to guess where the entrance is, but it's going to take a while to get to it. If you're good, you won't cop out and look it up online. Yes, that means you.\nThe last boss is just... insane. I won't spoil it for you, but you won't be ready for it.\n\nSo, that being said, I'd say get the game. Great with friends. Unless you don't have friends, in which case find some you sad, lonely depressant.\n","March 7, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Saving the Earth of Ailens trying to take it over. And that's all the story you need, Sam is every single badass from the 80's rolled into one. Though not as ego induced as Duke Nukem, he still just as awesome. Every single one-liner will make you laugh (even out loud).\n\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay of Serious Sam is like Duke Nukem 3D, see something, pump lead in it. But what makes Serious Sam differ from Duke Nukem is the enemies and how they work. In Serious Sam, enemies are more aggressive in nature and will come at you from every direction. While in Duke Nukem enemies stay in one place and wait for you to come. Serious Sam takes the FPS to the next level being tough as nails and it doesn't care if you're ready or not. It will throw everything at you.\n\nLEVELS: Levels are large and open, giving you more room to run around and avoid thousands of enemies. The most you'll see in TFE is deserts and some jungle areas, even though the visuals don't change the layoout does, Making every level feel different from one another.\n\nOverall I give Serious Sam a.... 9.8/10. Great levels, great gameplay, and a great main character. The only thing I would highly recommend is wait until the game's on sale. Because you can get TFE and TSE for only two dollars.","March 20","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is about a man who´s really SERIOUS! He must save the universe (mainly the Earth) from Aliens creatures from Mental´s Army (Yes, its really his name). Actually this game is the second. Because this is: Serious Sam: First Encounter and the "new" Serious Sam 3 has name "BFE" which means "Before First Encounter" When I was a child I really didn´t liked the part in sewers. I was little scared of it. It was dark and you were swimming in the water and then some weird sound and electricity from behind... It is the electric piranha. Game is actually pretty funny and for the oldschool gamers the one of the best choose. :)\n\n9/10 (Because its great game and because I play it when I used to be a little kid with dad)\n\nBuy it definetelly! :D","February 18","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I first discovered the demo on a CD I had, and loved it. Sam's one liners, etc, It was/still is mindless shooting fun, and that's what gaming is suppose to be. Some enemies in the game are quite tough to deal with, for instance the werebull, which is a cross between some kind of cattle, and a bull. save your more powerful weapons for those, along with The Kleer Skeletons, etc. There really is nothing bad to be said about this game;Some have said on the forums that b/c the game is the HD Edition, it's ladened with rich and heavy graphics, they could not get it to run;Lucky for me though, this was not the case.

You have a set of weapons which consists of a knife, dual revolvers, a shotgun, a double barrelled shotgun, a Thompson, a mini-gun, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher, a laser gun, and a cannon which is like a cannon of a ship but it fires cannon balls the size of boulders which will run over anything smaller than it and explode within contact of anything larger than it. Certain weapons work better on certain enemies and different situations since a lot of the time when there is a horde of enemies charging at you, you’ll be using the rocket launcher but when you are in too tight quarters for the rocket launcher and enemies are too close to you, you’ll want to switch to the mini-gun, and when there’s not that many enemies you might want to switch to one of the two shotguns.\n\nThere aren’t really any problems with serious sam but this game is very frustrating especially on the higher difficulties because this game is extremely difficult and it has some of the most annoying enemies in any game ever made and when you have a 100 of them bee lining towards you it’s just overwhelming. There’s also this one point early on in the game where the difficulty spikes completely, but none of this stopped me because I finished this, the second encounter and 3 all on serious mode.\n\nThis is one of the best old school shooters ever made and you should definitely get this if you like old school shooters.","January 3, 2015","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Serious Sam has a lot to do with knowing how to react to the different enemies, their movement, their attacks. And because of the large enemy variety, one not only has to decide what enemy is the most dangerous at that given time and which weapon suits that particular situation the most, one also has to move in such precise ways so that he escaped all those different projectiles and melee attacks, at the same time being aware of his surroundings - this could be called 'Dancing with the enemies' : constantly and precisely moving, jumping and shooting amidst enemies, rockets and whatever the game throws at you. It requires skill, decision making and just general knowledge of the game- so Serious Sam is not a mindless shooter, contrary to the popular belief.\n\nTalking about The Second Encounter, it does so many things so well :\n-the pacing of the campaign is very fast;\n-extensive, varied and beautiful enviroments with a lot of secrets/resources;\n-once again, a wonderful soundtrack that fits the game perfectly;\n-more weapons compared to TFE, yet most guns are still very useful;\n-loads of new well-designed enemies to tare apart with your SBC Cannon (The Mighty Cannon FTW!);\n-even bigger enemy variety than its predecessor - to the extent where it's probably the best I've seen in a shooter.\n-even better at that whole 'Dancing with the enemies' thing, making the game even more interesting and challenging.\n\nSeriously, what else can you ask from a shooter?","December 5, 2015","true","36.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The humans fight bravely, but braveness turns to deperation as the humans are defeated again and again. Sam "Serious" Stone, noted for his bravery, becomes a legend, but one legend is simply not enough to defeat the aliens. Eventually, the aliens make there way into our solar system. On the verge of defeat, the humans try one last thing. The humans had in their posession a technology capable of sending a single human back in time. The plan is to send someone back to when the aliens first came to earth, thousands of years ago, in an attempt to defeat them before they become to powerful. The choice of who to send is obvious...\n\nThis is an amazing game. The weaponry is powerful and feels incredible. The enemy's can be a nightmare to kill. Though indervidually the enemy's aren't incredibly strong, the game will positivly POUND you with wave after wave of enemy's. The game feels great and it WILL challenge you, pro gamer or not.

You have a set of weapons which consists of a knife, dual revolvers, a shotgun, a double barrelled shotgun, a Thompson, a mini-gun, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher, a laser gun, and a cannon which is like a cannon of a ship but it fires cannon balls the size of boulders which will run over anything smaller than it and explode within contact of anything larger than it. Certain weapons work better on certain enemies and different situations since a lot of the time when there is a horde of enemies charging at you, you’ll be using the rocket launcher but when you are in too tight quarters for the rocket launcher and enemies are too close to you, you’ll want to switch to the mini-gun, and when there’s not that many enemies you might want to switch to one of the two shotguns.\n\nThere aren’t really any problems with serious sam but this game is very frustrating especially on the higher difficulties because this game is extremely difficult and it has some of the most annoying enemies in any game ever made and when you have a 100 of them bee lining towards you it’s just overwhelming. There’s also this one point early on in the game where the difficulty spikes completely, but none of this stopped me because I finished this, the second encounter and 3 all on serious mode.\n\nThis is one of the best old school shooters ever made and you should definitely get this if you like old school shooters.","January 3, 2015","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a classic arcade first person/ third person shooter. Overall it's just really entertaining, and has difficulty settings for any players. The game also requires very little graphics. I highly recomend this game.","July 29, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
