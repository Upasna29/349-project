Also of note is the Vendettas campaign. There is a 4 player online co-op that intertwines with the single player story filling in some back story. Overall Vendettas is a fun diversion with friends but a little repetitive. You don't get to play as the main character Jackie, instead one of a set of four mercenaries that each have a personal weapon infused with Dark Essence.\n\nNow for the gameplay. The Darkness II finally disproves the theory that developers have to leave the main protagonist as hollow as possible in first person shooters so that the gamers can fully immerse themselves. This is just lazy storytelling and don't let anyone tell you differently. The Darkness is a game of two parts. Light and dark. Players experience the tender heart of Jackie when he is around Jenny and Aunt Sarah. But then players go out and start shooting guys and flinging fan blades at them with one demon arm while decapitating them with the other demon arm. In The Darkness II you quad-wield and your survival depends on it. At first it can seem a bit much to keep track of, grabbing things and throwing things and slashing and shooting all at once. But once you learn to multitask you will feel like a God. It's intoxicating. The Darkness becomes an extension of your will and soon you are slaying rooms full of enemies with gleeful abandon. There is an upgrade system to tailor the combat to your preferences and the point system that pays for your new abilities will encourage you to perform gruesome executions. The game is bloody. But due to a smart move on the developer's behalf, the cell-shaded comic style graphics make all the gore less disgusting. This time around the enemies have their own supernatural weapons at their disposal, a noted improvement over the last game.\n\nInside all of us there's a violent beast that needs to be sated, lets it bleed over into our real lives. This game does just that. Incredibly violent, and intensely satisfying. My only wish is that it were longer. Great fun; A must have.","December 9, 2013","true","9.0"," 289 of 323 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","289","323","0","12"

And I'm not a fan of super power/super heroes/action games. Add to these that the game is short and linear. It doesn't look ugle but its picture is not modern even for 2012-year-game at the same time. And yeah, it's buggy. And, please, take into your account that it is almost the end of the 2014, November, almost 3 years since the game release.\n\nAnd I've finished it. And I liked it as this game has the most interesting part that beats others weaknesses - its story line. It keeps you to the end like an addictive movie. Like a movie you want to recommend to your friends after all. It's almost 3 years since this game release and it still can be recommended.\n\nI also like this game has skill trees. You won't be able to get all skills but, well, you don't need all of them anyway =) Are you tired with shooting your enemies? Smash them with snakes, throws a chair or grab somebody by his leg. Despite of serious story and bloody scenes a gameplay can be very funny and relaxing.\n\nLast thing I wanted to mention is characters. They are well-made. You won't meet a lot of dialogs but you will feel each character as individual with its own identity. Many games have NPCs you pass like strangers and never come back or remember them. I remember all characters from this game and they supplement the plot and the gameplay.\n\nThank you for your time and have a good play!","November 9, 2014","true","7.6"," 147 of 164 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","147","164","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/67370/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","n a strange coincidence I started playing The Darkness II at about roughly the same time I started Alan Wake. The plots in each game revolve heavily on light and darkness, which is really just a play on the classic good vs. evil conflict. In Alan Wake the protagonist uses light as a weapon to destroy and evade evil, but in The Darkness II the protagonist depends on the darkness to literally envelop himself in evil to defeat enemies, becoming the monstrous “host” of the Darkness.\n\nJackie Estacado, Don of the Franchetti family, has laid low with the Darkness bottled up for two years following the death of his girlfriend Jenny. After a failed attempt on his life, Jackie is ready to unleash the Darkness once again, to exact revenge and to continue fighting for Jenny. His new enemies have been tracking him for years, and their leader, Victor Valente, is after the Darkness for himself. Jackie also faces a reality problem, not knowing if what he is experiencing is real while having several brief visions of a psychiatric ward throughout the game.\n\nBefore I continue I’d first like to include a precautionary note. The Darkness II is definitely what I’d refer to as an adult oriented game. The entire thing revolves around harnessing evil for violence, has many demonic themes (eating hearts of dead enemies to regain health, collecting dark relics for points, etc.), includes adult themes, and is not something I’d ever buy for a kid. With the appropriate rating there’s nothing wrong that. I’m not discounting the game for this at all, but the “dark” themes turned me off a bit, and I’d guess that reactions to these themes among FPS fans would be mixed.\n\nWith that note out of the way, I’d like to continue with an annoyance. Game assistants, such as Wheatly in Portal 2, seem to be popping up more and more these days. The inclusion of the Darkling in The Darkness II was fine functionally, but it seemed like the character was intended to appeal to a younger audience, which didn’t make much sense to me. For example, there were several times where the Darkling would run up to an enemy’s body I had just killed to pass gas or urinate on it. If you’re making an adult game, I just don’t quite understand why you would include something like this. The Darkling just seemed too offensive to me; I wasn’t able to appreciate the character at all. I also feel like the horror element to the game would have been enhanced if the player were forced to play alone.\n\nOn the positive side I’d say that despite playing on rails, The Darkness II is a fairly solid and intense first-person shooter. I didn’t encounter any bugs or gameplay issues, and there were plenty of enemies to kill. Locales were mixed, and even though I found it a bit cliché, the vacant carnival level was definitely an enjoyable setting. There weren’t exactly a large variety of weapons, but the inclusion of the ability tree, in which new abilities can be purchased with dark essence points, helped. The abilities tree seemed like kind of an afterthought on the whole, but it’s better than just having generic weapons. Items such as extended gun clips, a swarm distraction to stun enemies, and better weapon handling can be purchased in the abilities tree. The Darkness itself is really the most powerful weapon, which can destroy enemies in a couple of swipes if they’re close enough. When things got crazy and I was surrounded by enemies the Darkness always seemed to allow me to break out; it was pretty incredible to use.\n\nAnother strong point of The Darkness II was the voice acting. It wasn’t all great, but I was especially impressed with David Hoffman’s portrayal of the half deranged occultist Johnny Powell (example trailer linked) and Brian Bloom as the new voice of Jackie. The loading segments in which each of these characters reveal more of the storyline were some of the most memorable portions of the game. Voice acting in video games can vary quite a bit, and it’s not usually very good; this game is definitely an exception. Sound effects and music were also decent.\n\nVisuals were also a positive, but you shouldn’t go into it expecting total realism. The Darkness II was developed using cel-shaded animation, which is different from the first game. The cel-shading was different than what I have seen before in that it was subtle and at times almost unnoticeable. There was definitely a nice balance between realism and animation, which really made it seem as if I was experiencing the graphic novel on which the game is based.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, I’d have to say that I didn’t find The Darkness II overly challenging. The AI was easy to avoid and fool for the most part, but there were a few portions that I had to replay several times to finally move forward. Being equipped with the Darkness felt as if I was much more powerful than the majority of the enemies.\n\nIn addition to the single-player campaign The Darkness II also includes a Vendetta mode in which you can carry out missions for Jackie as one of four characters with special powers. These missions can be played alone or in co-op mode, but the Vendettas are definitely not the main attraction. It’s one of those extra things thrown in that you try once or twice but to which you never come back.\n\nOverall, I’d say that The Darkness II is a decent shooter, but there is nothing in it that is amazing; it’s respectable but mostly predictable. Playing a more or less “evil” character felt different compared to all the other standard “save the Earth” games, but other than the Darkness it doesn’t include much that hasn’t been done before. The story and voice acting is a big plus. The main campaign isn’t that long, and the AI isn’t the greatest, but it is intense and still enjoyable if you’re an FPS fan.","June 27, 2014","true","254.3"," 151 of 170 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","151","170","0","5"

The gameplay feels both familiar and fresh simultaneously, while the characters and story keep the player engaged and interested.  Also, the addition of an XP system and skill-trees allow the player to continue to work towards new goals and to customize their character according to their preferred combat style.  All of these elements mesh together to create a very enjoyable game that I feel all but the most extremely discerning gamers should appreciate.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of The Darkness II is the story, and the characters that make it.  The twisted and confused thoughts of the main character set the tone of the game from the first level, and evolve as the story progresses, in a similar fashion to games like Max Payne and Alan Wake.  The auxiliary characters are diverse and interesting, enticing the player to initiate optional conversations. The narrative is a perfect blend of mafia drama and psychological thriller that should enthrall anyone who enjoys being told a good story.\n\nThe actual gameplay experience is also exquisite.  The combination of familiar FPS aspects with some well-integrated novelty goes a long way to make the game downright fun.  There are various guns and abilities to use to wreak havoc on your enemies during action-packed fight sequences.  Additionally, the XP and skill-point system will keep you goal-oriented and allow you to unlock new abilities as you play to keep things fresh.\n\nFor those itching for more after beating the main campaign, there is also an entirely separate Co-op Mode, which expands upon the universe of The Darkness II and allows for multiplayer gameplay.  Fortunately, all the missions in the Co-op Mode can be completed in solo play if you don’t want to spend time trying to find others to play with.  While not quite as pristine as the main campaign, it adequately provides some supplementary gameplay to a game that would otherwise be only medium-length (in terms of total hours).\n\nIn summary, I posit that The Darkness II is a superb all-around game with many positive elements contributing to its overall quality.  I would say it is a pretty safe bet for most gamers who have a broad taste for games, and a definite safe bet for those gamers who enjoy FPS games and interesting narratives.  Expect about 6-18 hours of gameplay, depending on how much of a “completionist” you are.  If you can get it for a price you are comfortable with, it is definitely worth the pick-up.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","August 1, 2015","true","24.4"," 117 of 132 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","117","132","5","9"

The Darkness 2 does a great job of immersing you into the feelings and thoughts of the main character, which is a rarity in modern day gaming. Often you are very disconected from the story and the emotions of the characters. Lately, the only other game I have played that did such a great job of pulling you in, emotionally, was BioShock Infinite.\n\nBeyond the story, which while nothing especially impressive, what is there is enough and is well orcestrated. The most impressive feat is the game's ability to put you in the shoes of the main character and really doubt what is real and what is not real (in the game).\n\nThe gameplay is top notch though and if you enjoy shooters where you run from one area to the next and have to clear all the waves of enemies, then this is a game for you. The gunplay is fun and has impact and the tentacles are well implemented so that they are not overpowered and yet are still very fun and exciting to use.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304584465\nI found myself using primarily guns but definitely had to use my powers frequently to stay in the fight. I was glad though that the powers did not dominate the gameplay so that you simply use the powers when you feel the need and are not forced to constantly use the powers. In some games where you have powers they dominate the other gameplay mechanics to the point that you find yourself only using the powers and nothing else. Fortunately, this is not the case in the Darkness 2.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304361429\n\nThe graphics are not impressive or special, but they make up for what they lack in the style, which once you've played the game to completion the style will make sense. A lot of people were surprised when they first revealed the first gameplay video of The Darkness 2 because of the art style they had used. But there is a definite reason for it and it only further helps immerse you into the world of confusion that the main character is living in.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304361384\nThe soundtrack is great and the voice work is top quality. All in all, it is a very fun game with a decent story that manages to pull you in and leaves you desiring more.\n\nWould definitely recommend giving this game a spin! It is a great purchase and a great experience to play through once or even twice! In addition there are even some co-op missions to further the experience, so if you have a friend to play it with it will add a few more hours of quality gameplay.","March 28, 2015","true","12.4"," 98 of 109 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","98","109","6","6"

Although the plot itself is pretty basic the developers did a great job of presenting the story. The characters may be stereotypical of what you would expect in a mafia however it doesn't take away the fact they are believable and expertly voiced.\n\n+ The game features a variety of guns which is what you would expect from any first person shooter however the twist in this game is that you have two demonic arms, one for picking/throwing objects and the other as a high powered melee weapon. You can also execute enemies in some pretty horrific ways.\n\n+ Speaking of gratuitous violence, it works well in this game. Most games have over the top violence just for the sake of it yet I feel this game really nailed this particular aspect, it really sells the notion that you are possessed by dark forces.\n\n+ Killing enemies and collecting relics in the levels allows you to level up different skills among 4 skill trees.\n\n+ New Game + allows you to replay the game with all your acquired skills\n\n+ Easy Achievements, minimal grinding required.\n\n+ Great voice acting\n\n+ Good soundtrack\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nOn the one hand the game is short, roughly 5-7 hours in length. On the other hand the game isn't bogged down with pointless filler either, the game does what it wants to without over extending its welcome.\n\nAfter you complete the main story, you can try the vendetta campaign, an add on to extend your playtime. You can choose between 4 characters, each with their own weapon, skill trees and powers. You can also play co-op with friends. The problem however is that every level becomes very repetitive of killing wave after wave of enemy. The formula wears itself out very early on. This mode is also very short , roughly 2-3 hours in length.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Multiplayer is dead\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIt was a sequel that didn't need to be made but in the end it turned out to be a great game to a very underappreciated game franchise. A fun distraction while it lasts and nothing more. Strongly recommend at a discount price.\n","September 23, 2015","true","12.3"," 65 of 68 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","65","68","6","0"

Basically it's like playing a horror game but YOU ARE THE HORROR!\n\nWhat I love most about this game is the story-telling, the narrative of the game. All the characters in this game have their own personality, even the crazy ones! The person who voiced Johnny Powell is a genius!\n\nThere is a multiplayer mode called the "Vandette". It has a number of co-op missions that you can play solo or play with up to 4 players online. Each playable characters have their own personality and their own dialogues as well! The multiplayer campaign fills in the holes in the single player story very well. This is one of the rarer games where the multiplayer mode actually adds value to the single player story-telling.\n\nThe artsy graphics adds a lot of nostalgic feel to the game environment. This type of graphics rendering method also brilliantly mask away a lot of disgust from the bloody violence where it would be gross if rendered too realistically.\n\nIf you are the reading type and like to understand as much of the game world as possible, you can learn a lot from reading the relics origin. The game universe is based a lot closely to our real world religions, with a little fictional element added into it. And it makes a lot of sense! (On top of that, it has the funny narration from the crazy genius!)\n\nIt has moderate replay value. Once you are done with the single player campaign, you can replay the campaign with new game plus to learn more about the game setting and to hunt for collectibles. But it's only worth 2-3 playthrus before it gets repetitive. Multiplayer have quite a number of maps but since multiplayer characters have very limited skillset, it gets repetitive very soon.\n\nAll the achievements are quite doable in single player, 100% completion is not difficult.\n\nMy Score: 10/10 (Highly recommended!)","September 26, 2014","true","22.3"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","58","63","3","0"

I couldn't make that one up) of the same name, so let me tell you a little bit about the unpopular The Darkness II.\nOr The Darkness 2 if you don't know your Roman numerals. If you don't, shame on you.\n\nIn The Darkness II you play as Jackie Estacado, a member of the Franchetti crime family. He was adopted by the former Don of the Franchetti's, Frankie Franchetti at the age of six and matured quickly; he lost his virginity to a female officer durning an investigation at the age of fourteen and killed his first victim at the age of sixteen. His presence in the Franchetti family helped it to expand, as predicted by the mysterious Sonatine.\nWhen Jackie turned twenty-one, he revieved the powers of the Darkness, a timeless power allowing the Host to form basically anything out of darkness (for example, the Arms) that will crumble to dust in the light. To keep it short, lots of sh*t hit the fan in a short period of time, causing his true love Jenny to be killed.\nYears passed since then, and Jackie forced himself to keep the Darkness locked up inside of him after blaming it for Jenny's death.\nThat's where the second game begins and the Darkness gets unleashed again.\nSound interresting? Well trust me, it IS interresting.\n\nThe Good:\n· Very solid shooter mechanics.\n· An upgrade-system that will make you feel more powerful as the game progresses.\n· You can control Jackie's sentient demon arms to grab enemies and objects and perform brutal finishing moves. (For example splitting a guy clean in half or ripping someone's spine out of his sh*tter. I know. His f*cking sh*tter. They just rip that open harder than Kim Kardashian's c*nt.)\n· A surprisingly personal and meaningful story that will keep you interrested until the very end.\n· The Darkness 2 plays with light in a unique way - standing in light will blind you and make you more volnurable, but being in the darkness makes you brutally strong.\n\nThe Bad:\n· The co-op missions can easily be forgotten.\n· Besides tha campaign, collectibles and co-op the game offers too little content to keep you coming back to it.\n· Unfortunately unsuccesful, meaning that the chances of a third installment is highly unlikely.\n\nThe Ugly:\nWhile the comicbook-esque and gore-filled visuals are a joy to look at, there's nothing too stunning about it. It never looks bad, but it doesn't look as good as it could have.\n\nFinal verdict:\nThis is a title I will always remember for its dark and unique setting, plus it's one of the forgotten "good comicbook games" out there that needs to be played, simply because it's an thrilling experience. 8.5/10","February 24, 2014","true","12.3"," 154 of 211 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","154","211","0","0"

The graphics are bright and cartoonish, similar to 2K Games' more popular game Borderlands, and don't tax a modern gaming PC overmuch. Unfortunately, there is no option to disable depth of field, which is not to everyone's taste.\n\nThe gameplay is varied, enabling you to deploy different tactics ranging from brutal executions using your extra demon snake arms and impaling people with thrown parking meters to channelling the darkness into your guns as you shred the enemies stunned by your swarms of demonic flies.\n\nControls are fair, but your demon arms suffer from a complete inability to multitask, preventing you from, for example, eating the hearts of fallen enemies to regain health while simultaneously holding a makeshift javelin or a shield at the ready, because such petty concerns are beneath your right hand, which is only used for striking. The game also assumes that if you have a gamepad connected to your PC, you will only be using it, refusing to stop vibrating it and displaying gamepad-centric button prompts even if you play the game using the keyboard and mouse exclusively, so be prepared to have to unplug or disable your gamepad if you prefer keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe story is a little on the short side, but the co-op enabled side missions called "Vendettas" make up for it. The world is well-designed and some of the dialogue is very funny if you take the time to listen to it. The game gives you the ability to skip most cutscenes and dialogue, enabling you to replay the campaign without having to wait for things you have already seen.\n\nAs for bugs, there is a couple annoying ones: turning vertical sync on will sometimes cause the screen to blur for long periods of time, while turning it off will prevent you from moving through a few tight spaces. If you're affected by either bug, toggle vertical sync on or off.\n\nGiven that the game often goes on very deep sales (85% off), there's little reason not to buy it if you enjoy FPS games.","November 2, 2015","true","37.6"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","0"

I've yet to finish it, but I'm thoroughly enjoying my second playthrough from the beginning. It feels even better with a gamepad too, as it feels like a more natural way to control the Darkness powers, rather than a mouse and keyboard. Overall, excellent story and characters and visceral gameplay that revels in its absurd levels of violence. The first time you impale an enemy with a pipe, or slice them with a car door, if you don't giggle with glee, you just might be a robot. ;)","January 13, 2014","true","7.7"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","35","43","0","2"

It's unique, fresh, fun, beautiful and content packed.\nIt has two separate campaigns, hit list missions, 5 playable characters etc etc...\n\nSingle-player: You play as Jackie Estacado, head of the Franchetti crime family. You "wield" the Darkness. Darkness allows you to slash, grab, throw and execute enemies. It also allows you to grab different objects and throw them at your enemies.\nJackie has 5 different skill trees that allow you to unlock and acquire new executions, abilities/skills and upgrades.\nYou can also dual wield different types of weapons. An example: You can carry and fire a Desert Eagle and an MP7 at the same time - Darkness 2 gives the word "badass" a whole new meaning.\nEverything you see can be used as a weapon tho. Just grab a pipe and throw it at your enemies!\n\nThe single-player campaign is only 5-6 hours long (don't worry, there is enough content in the game) but that's a good thing. It doesn't drag it out. The story is great and it never gets boring. A lot of games make the mistake of dragging the game out just to try to be a bit longer. Not this one! You're always focused on the main goal and the story is addictive and interesting.\nThere's also New Game+ that allows you to play through the game while keeping all your unlocked abilities. A good way to unlock all five skilltrees.\n\nCo-op: Co-op adds another 2-3 hours long campaign (1-4 players, can also be played and finished alone in offline mode), 6 solo and 2-player "Hit List" missions and 4 new characters: Shoshanna, Inugami, JP DuMond and Jimmy Wilson.\nEach character has different and unique special weapons, one-liners, executions and 3 different skill trees - you can tell that developers put a lot of time and hard work into making these characters...into making this game!\n\nShoshanna wields a super-shotgun that never misses. Inugami carries a katana with him (felt like playing Shadow Warrior), Jimmy has an axe and JP carries a magical staff that lets him lift enemies. Each also has 3 different skill trees, executions and one-liners.\n\nYes, there are one-liners in this game! The single-player campaign is rather dark and serious but the co-op campaign takes itself a lot less seriously. It's a bit silly, funny and with all these one-liners it feels like playing Duke or Shadow Warrior! It's a lot of fun!\n\nThe gameplay is unique and makes this game stand out from the others. It has an awesome story, an interesting setting, a great artstyle and the graphics are quite good aswell. It has a lot of content and in my opinion it's well worth the full price.\n\n8/10 - A must have for all FPS fans! Especially if you can get a friend to buy and play the co-op with you.","July 15, 2015","true","15.5"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","23","24","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackhitman/recommended/67370/","jackhitman","Mad Jack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackhitman/","532 products in account","The gameplay on The Darkness is pretty good. It's fast paced and the "4 arms" gimmick will feel confusing at first, but it'll grow on you as you start ripping people apart (the game is pretty graphical that way) and getting new powers with the skill system.\n\nThe story is pretty good and moves at a nice pace, but then again, the game is easily finished in about 5 hours, wich is pretty bloody short, even by "modern" FPS standarts... However it does offer a New Game+ option, witch is always nice. You get to keep all the collectibles you found and skills you purchased so that your second time arround is even bloodier and more violent (if something like that is possible). However, the original ending was a bit of a dissapointment, so here's hoping for an alternate ending on NG+!\nAlso, the characters are pretty well presented, especially the Darkling, who helps us during most of the game and serves as a comical relief.\n\nIn addition to the single player campaign, there is a co-op campaign with 4 different characters, all with a specific set of skills and limited use of weapons and the Darkness (you know, those 2 devilish arms). It sounds good enough, but it actually takes away the biggest part of the gameplay that makes it great: the "quad-wield"... and of course, the story. Still, any co-op mode has potential for fun!\n\nI'd recommend this on sale or included in a bundle (like the current 2K one, go check it out, for 1$ you get this, Bioshock and The Bureau), since for 30€ you won't get your moneys worth in terms of lenght...","July 10, 2014","true","6.1"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","37","48","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DTAltair/recommended/67370/","DTAltair","DTAltair","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DTAltair/","665 products in account","After getting 100% on it, I should probably make a review of it.\nThe Darkness 2 is an extremely violent FPS with a storyline that twists and turns and gives you even more addiction at the end game. This is one of the better storylines that I have ever played and it gives you all the feels in all the right ways. You get joy, revenge, sadness, vengance, longing, and all those other characteristics to be able to relate with everyone in the game.\nThe Darkness was an interesting concept because it isn't a voice that is just narrating you or such. It is a part of you and influences you. It doesn't tell you to go here or there, it screams at you that your will obey it and it taunts you with a lost soul it controls.\nThe boss fights in the game are pretty solid, the bosses have enough mobility to where you can't just stand there and shoot at them in one direction. They move a lot and most of the time you have to be moving as well.\nThe light concept is very well done and brings more aspects of thinking ahead and getting priorities out (especially in the harder difficulties). If you are under a light source your screen goes white where you can barely see and being in the light removes your powers and any buffs that you have acquired that only apply when you are in the dark. So when a van comes crushing through towards you, you should probably shoot out the headlights first before trying to fend off the enemies.\nThe execution moves are super brutal. There are 4 different executions that you can do and each results in a different buff and also a different execution style. You can either use the execution to restore health, restore ammo, gain a demonic riot shield, or shorten you skills timers. Each I believe have 3 different executions resulting in 12 total executions which all have their own amount of brutality for anyone to enjoy.\nThere is enough of a talent tree to make you play more than one run through and probably just move on to Don difficulty at that point. You can do New Game+ to keep all your talents and such, which makes a considerable amount of Don difficulty pretty easy, but bosses still can be hard to beat.\nI know that some people didn't really like the graphics of the game, but I believe they probably made them that way because of the Borderlands series, both are made by 2K games, so I think that is what they did, but in my own opinion I love the graphics as do I love Borderlands, so it was enjoyable for me.\nThe NPCs in the game all have a certain human flair to them where they aren't just NPCs, you can relate to them easily and they become much more than just NPCs.\nYou collect relics throughout the game that will give you essence (which is gained by killing people, getting relics, and is used to buy talents) and they aren't that hard to find. Some are easy to miss but generally you won't have problems finding them.\nThe weapon selection through the game is pretty small, but they made it for a good reason. There aren't any snipers or rocket launchers or big weapons like that, no grenades either (unless you count throwing propane tanks XD ). with the smaller weapons, you can either weild one at a time, or dual weild. The choices are for single shots: Desert Eagle, Cobra, and M9. The choices are for automatics: UMP5, MP7, and Micro UZI. The choices are for the main weapon: Carbine (M16 Burst Fire), AK47, Sawed Off Shotgun, Model 1887 (?), and a Stiker.\nThe powers you have through the game is also limited, but they are super powerful so it doesn't really matter at that point honestly. You have two activated abilities, The Swarm and Gun Channeling. The Swarm goes out and swarms around people effectively stunning them (and sometimes even killing them), you can get upgrades for it to last longer, recharge faster and affect more enemies. Gun Channgeling gives you infinite ammo and super powered shots for a limited time. The upgrades consits of longer lasting, faster recharge, auto shooting towards targets and shooting through walls. So as you can tell, turning a corridor full of enemies you can just activate both and blow through them both in two seconds.\nI didn't really find any bugs in the game. The only real problem I had is that sometimes the screen goes a little blurry, like the beginning of being of barely stepping in light and it just causes some depth of view problems. It doesn't really last long if it happens, but it can and when you are trying to fight people it messes with your vision a bit.\nSo all in all to say: 10/10 hands down. Would love to have harder achievements though.","January 3, 2015","true","13.7"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","1"

Spiced up by powers of Darkness, flying bodies, torn corpses, severed limbs and tasty headshots. Great voice acting (all chars, but the main hero [Brian Bloom] and Darkness [Mike Patton] especially. The last scream of the main character is so freaking real.), excellent music (listen to it for a while) and graphical style. Graphics and sounds are nice as well. Gameplay - well... no sane person wants to be your enemy - quad wielding allows for 2 weapons and 2 hellish tentacles to massacre the enemies. You plow through the bad guys. Wiping out baddies is very satysfying. SP story is good (it is weird as well at times, but in a good way). There are few "WTF" moments. There are some emotional moments which I found to fit the atmosphere perfectly and I loved them in game. They did not feel\nout of place for sure.\n\nCoop is great - 18 missions for max 4 players. There are 4 different chars, each with his/her own skills and weapons. Coop takes place in paralell to story which is nice since they overlap in events. I sank in this game. I played and maxed every character I could. Gamplay is fluent and very satysfying. Underrated and underestimated game.\n\nShame.

So my review can't compare the two games, I have however read the comic and know what happens, so my knowledge of the story is pretty decent.\n\nA fan of The Darkness comic book, I picked up this game a while ago in a humble bundle, and really just didn't like the idea of having the demon arms and everything in the game. In fact, I would have ended up never playing it if I hadn't felt a commitment to the comics.\nI decided to just play a single level this morning and actually found it fairly boring at first. The gameplay just seemed to be far too easy and the storyline was not what I had hoped for considering the excellent comic it was based on. I decided to play another level just to see if the game would pick up.\nI ended up completing the game without stopping. It's amazing.\nThe gameplay works far better than I imagined. The demon arms are not tedious to use, and are not as overpowered as I felt they were in the first mission. Even without the demon arms, this would be a pretty solid FPS. However these of course add a unique twist on the game to seperate it from the countless other first person shooters available right now.\n\nThe storyline is fantastic for a AAA game. (I don't know if its a ''AAA'' game as it's release wasnt absolutely huge...Let's call it a ''AA''.)\n\nIf I am completely honest, the gameplay does get slightly repetitive. However this combined with the other flaw which is that the game is far too short, mean that you don't get bored of the game that easily as it's finished before you can get tiresome.\nI don't feel like there's much replay value here unfortunately.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n+Fantastic storyline.\n+Entertaining gameplay\n+Interesting use of demonic powers at the same time as guns. Something completely refreshing.\n- Game is far too short\n-Can become slightly repetitive towards the end. (However storyline gets more intense towards the end so you don't notice this so much.)\n8/10","November 9, 2014","true","6.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/67370/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nThe Darkness II is a FPS with a lot of unique mechanics that I've only experienced for the first time in playing a game  with this  genre (grabbing stuff with tentacles, using them to heal yourself, I can hear a bad hentai joke coming...)\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You play the game as Jackie, a gruff, angry, imposing man whom has a dark power that he inherited from his father. Tormented by his memory of his girl friend Jenny he struggles to try to get revenge for an attempt on his life.\nI found it amusing that the game basically makes Jackie a crime boss, it game the game and the story an interesting tone. And the game carried it very well. The story was extremely well executed down to the very end of the game. I don't want to give anymore away, I will say that the game lets you select an introduction that explains what happened in the first Darkness game, if you (like me) never played the first game.\n\nGame Play: while I was playing I was confused at the key mapping from the start of the game, but I picked up on the controls really quickly, like I've said I've only played the easiest difficulty so I just hack and slashed my way through the whole game and didn't die once.\nThere are a few main combat mechanics: 1) you use guns. Hence why I categorize it as a FPS 2) You have two shadow arms that wreak havoc with basic swing attacks 3) your shadow arms can grab and throw objects 4) your arms can grab other humans and mutilate them to gain ammo, health, amusement, etc.\nBy combining these various moves and abilities you can create some really awesome combination attacks. If you're aware of your surroundings and have good reflexes the game is really fun to play. I get tired of playing the same type of game over and over, but this game takes a great spin on traditional FPS's and gives it interesting mechanics to make the game just that much more interesting and engaging.\nOne more note on game play: Progression. I find that just killing hundreds of npc's for the sake of killing npc's isn't very interesting *cough cough* Brutal Legend *cough cough*. Anyway, the game has a level system that you can spent points to get new abilities, making that mass slaughter I had, actually have a purpose.\n\nAchievements: As usual this game has the standard "you beat the game" achievements. The "beat the game on this difficulty" achievements. there are also a few multiplayer achievements (which I haven't worked on yet), And then there are the "do this special thing in the game".\nThe achievements seem straightforward. But I haven't earned them all yet (08/09/14) so I don't know if there are any really note worthy achievements at this time. but so far the achievements look very straightforward.\n\nPrice: The Darkness II is $29.99, at this time I've only put 5 hours into the game, but I can see myself  playing this game for about 10-20 hours. I really enjoyed the game, but I don't know how high the replay value is for someone whom isn't going for achievements.\nI really enjoyed the story, and don't have anything really negative to say about the game (other than at time the gore was a bit much, but that won't bother most people), as I usually say at this point, is that I'd recommend getting this game in a Humble Bundle or waiting for it to go on sale. I personally purchased mine in a Humble Bundle.\n\nConclusion: to recap,  the story was excellent, the game play was engaging and interesting, the achievements were alright, the price was kind of high but the quality in the game was good.\nI recommend this game to anyone who knows they know FPS's, don't mind gore, like a bit of a darker story (pun not intended), and likes a good story.\n\n\n\nEdit/Update 08/16/14\nI have a few things to add about the game. I've all but earned all the achievements on this game. So in a way I've given a bit of a preview of how much work it takes to get the various achievements. The game has actually gotten better.\nI played through the Vendetta's, which is a multi-player element to the game. But you also have the option of solo-playing through the whole thing. You have access two 4 new characters that run a "side quest line" parallel to what is happening to Jackie in the main story. This element gives the game more replay-quality, which for me is great! I love continuing to work through a game after I've beaten it, and have a different experience.\nA quick updated note about the achievements: Most of the achievements aren't very difficult, but actually require you to try out different things in the game. I didn't find myself particularly frustrated with any of them. This game actually had an almost-perfect balance in their achievements for my tastes.","August 9, 2014","true","22.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The main character is Jackie Estacado, head of the Franchetti crime family, who must face the Brotherhood (dangerous organization) that wants to control The Darkness. In our game we will have to visit the various locations in which we will use the different kinds of weapons such as assault rifles, submachine guns, pistols but also special powers of darkness.

The only flaw this game has, in my opinion, is that it seems to have been cut short - it won't take you too long to finish it and it ends with a cliffhanger. I think they could have completed the story in this one and not waited for the Darkness 3, which, judging by the things I've read while googling it, probably won't even get made.

But when a mysterious organization, The Brotherhood is planning on eliminating Jackie and his organization and take the Darkness from him, he has no choice but to use the Darkness again to save himself. Sounds cheesy, I know.\n\nThe game features a quad-wielding system, which means you can wield 2 different weapons, while the 2 demonic tendrils can be used to grab objects to shield yourself, or throw, or to execute enemies.\nAs the host of the Darkness, Jackie has access to large variety of demonic abilites, however becoming vulnerable and blinded when exposed to light. This adds interesting elements to the gameplay: as you kill enemies you gain darkness essense, which can be used to learn new skills, becoming extremely strong. While Jackie's weakness to the light still forces the player to take cover and take out light sources constantly.\n\nThe game has good looking cel-shaded graphics, and there's enough variety in the level designs to keep the player entertained throughout the story. Although the game doesn't have huge levels, hence not much exploration and the secrets can be found fairly easy too.\n\nOverall The Darkness II is a good FPS game, with solid gameplay and an interesting story with some psychological elements and a nice plot twist in the end, that imply a possible sequel.\n\nPROS\n- Nice looking cell-shaded graphics.\n- 2 parallel campaigns: a single player storyline and a co-op campaign, showing the plot from different point of view.\n- Psychological aspect of the story.\n- Memorable characters.\n- Good variety of abilities.\n- Excellent voice acting.\n- Large arsenal, ranging from firearms, through various projectiles to Darkness abilities.\n\nCONS\n- Extremely short, and sometimes painfully cheesy story.\n- Not challanging enough: game can be beaten fairly easy even on highest difficulty.\n- Execution animations are glitchy sometimes.","July 30, 2014","true","15.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game guides you into the sequel via short monologue, explaning the plot of the first game thus getting you right on board. Gameplay is very easy to pick up and fun throughout; utilising kill combos, dual wield gun play, special active skills or your darkness "tentacles". The enemies vary for about 3/4 of the game so just when you start getting a little tired of them, it's mostly over. The replay value comes via New Game+ mode as well as several online/offline co-op side missions. The side missions aren't anything special and killing the same enemies gets a bit tiresome, but the characters have their own talent trees and voice acting, which somewhat makes up for it. All in all it's a good shooter romp that has good replay value (as you can see by my 50/50 achievement score). It doesn't bring anything ground breaking into the shooter genre but it doesn't try to and knows its strong points. 8/10 for me.","October 4, 2014","true","16.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

The story was really well done and the game had an atmoshpere of darkness and despair that really matched it. While this sequel is a decent game it didn't quite live up to it's predecessor for me.\n\nFirst of all the game's cel-shaded looking visuals while not bad looking, just didn't seem to fit with this game. What should be quite a dark game ends up looking cartoony and it just isn't the right fit. It also makes the game feel a bit more arcadey instead of the visceral feel the gameplay of the first game had.\n\nThe story while interesting didn't reall captivate me as much as in the first game either and Jackie is also less likeable (though you could argue this might be to reflect the effect of the experiences in the first game on him.)\n\nThe gameplay and combat isn't too bad. There's a bit more variety with combat in this game and your darkling follower can be quite useful and adds a bit of comical relief. There's also more variety with enemies which require different strategies to deal with.\n\nOverall all it's a decent game but nowhere near as good as it's predecessor. If you enjoyed the first game i'd say maybe give this one a go if you can pick it up cheap but but be prepared for the fact that it's not as good. If you didn't like the first you probably won't like this either. It's a 6/10 for me.\n","February 1, 2014","false","8.0"," 45 of 82 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","45","82","0","0"

It’s a rough life fighting it from taking me over completely but man does it have some sweet powers. There has been some bad consequences though like losing the love of my life Jenny. I’m dealing with that and now some brotherhood wants to take the Darkness from me. Not going to happen on my watch.\n\nIn the Darkness II you are still suffering from the loss of Jenny from the first game. You have held the Darkness at bay for a while but now some group called the Brotherhood wants to take it from you using a device called the siphon which will suck the Darkness out of you. Well you aren’t going to let this happen because it’s just bad news for everyone.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to play through the levels fighting the Brotherhood. You can quad-wield now unlike the first game which gives you options like rip a car door off and use it as a shield while still being able to carry two guns and whip people with you other Darkness tentacle. Special executions can be done by grabbing an enemy with the tentacles, while he is stunned, and rip them apart for more health or ammo. You can also upgrade your powers via a skill tree wheel to add more possibilities like an execution that makes a shield from the enemy or had a Darkness swarm which stuns enemies for a short time.\n\nUnlike the first game you only have one Darkling to help you but he has more of a personality than before. He adds a little humor to everything which lightens the dark mood a bit. Guns are your standard fair ranging from pistols, smgs, assault rifles, and shotguns. You can upgrade you guns to buy adding bigger clips, faster reloads, and shooting Darkness essence through them.\n\nThe game does look good most of the time with its comic book pastel art style. Environments seemed to be pretty bland though and felt like I was just going through a reskinned map each level. Enemies were also basic with pretty much the same five skins all the time.\n\nStory wise I wasn’t too impressed and sometimes felt like I was just pushing forward to finish the game so it was no longer in my backlog. I just felt like it was just missing something the whole time. The endings, there are two choices, were both mediocre and not fulfilling. Expected a bigger finish than it was. You can replay it again in new game+ which lets you keep all your unlocked powers. I just didn’t feel the pull to do it though.\n\nDarkness II also has a co-op campaign mode called Vendetta you can play with up to four players. It’s basically a side story to the campaign where you can control your choice of four different characters who have their own special Darkness powers. All these characters also have skills you can upgrade to make them more powerful. There is another mode you can pick through Vendetta called The Hit List which is basically shorter missions using the Vendetta campaign levels. Both these modes are cool to play with some friends but doesn’t really add much to the game.\n\nOverall if you’re a fan of the comic and enjoyed the first Darkness then you’ll want to check this one out. It could have been much more without the co-op stuff and just focused on the single player portion of the game but it is still a decent game to play.\n\nBear Rating 7.0/10","January 12, 2014","true","14.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Not that it's good or not-bad, just unpopular.\n\nYou play as Jackie, an twenty-something who tries to avenge and save his girlfriend (?) Jenny. Other than that, I honestly cannot tell you what happens, it's just a sloppy and boring story.\n\nThe game heavily relies on staying in the darkness/shade as the title implies. Jackie is infested with some sort of demonic being that "helps" him in finding Jenny. The demon can only manifest itself in the dark during which you can have many special skills and abilities involving guns and long tentacles. These abilities are used to kill various out-of-this-world devilish foes. I would say that it's a FPS run and gun by all means with a very creepy story.\n\nIt's a very unique game by all means.\n\nThe only problem I can really say is the shortness. You can finish this game in about 3 hour's time. That's very steep for a $30 price tag.\n\nThe Darkness II runs very well on my PC too, the best of any large game I've tried. It's extremely smooth. Autoaim is always enabled, which may be annoying or a godsend however way you look at it.\n\nObligatory score: 7/10","July 23, 2014","true","11.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Do you want a game that mixes fps goodness with super powers and actually pulls it off? Well you've found your game. The Darkness II has awesome graphics, hilariously gorey death scenes, and a very interesting storyline. The game is VERY immersive, ESPECIALLY IN- (Slight spoiler ahead) Especially when the game brings you into a mental hospital where you are a patient. You really feel the fright and terror of being an actual patient in a mental hospital as your insanity grows stronger and stronger\n\nThe combat is VERY smooth from the fps to the use of your "darkness" powers. There is a co-op mode where you can play with your friends in a storyline that runs parallel to the singleplayer storyline, extending the lifetime of the game. However the singleplayer campaign itself is pretty darn short (about 5 hours) and doesn't have much replayability due to the fact of how linear it his.\n\nHowever this game is quite the experience and I would recommend it for anyone and everyone looking to have a good and comical time. I'd also recommend it to anyone looking to have a serious and exciting time, as this game pleases many audiences! Definitely worth picking up!\n\nFinal Verdict- 8/10.

Some characters, including the protagonist, are interesting and well voice-acted.\n+ Technical graphics are a bit dated, but artistically, they're pretty unique and relishable. Some real cool set-pieces and enviornments.\n+ Your options are immense. Decent array of guns, "Darkness" demons allow for varried melee, special attacks, executions, and thrown projectiles.\n+ Neat skill system that lets you tailor your play-style to execution, melee, special attacks, guns, or a bit of all four.\n+ Weapons and Darkness weapons have brutal impact. Did I mention quad-wielding?\n+ Enemy variety forces you to change tactics.\n\nCons:\n\n- "Avoid/destroy enviornmental lights, they hurt you" gets old and dissorienting really quickly. Your screen is often blurred trying to find a light to shoot, disabiling your darkness powers and letting enemies tear you apart while it happens.\n- The mafia tone to the story is horridly stereotypical. Good thing it shifts to the supernatural pretty quickly.\n- Some enemies are annoying or blatantly unfair. Flashbang throwers, whip-carriers that steal your guns, shield carriers.\n- Some actions can conflict due to the same button being used for them. The E key eats enemy's hearts to replishing your HP, but also picks up guns. I've swapped plenty of guns on accident and died because I didn't get my health pickup.\n- Too short. Main campaign took me 5 hours on second hardest difficulty.\n- "Vendetta" missions do not use Jackie. They're co-op missions with a new crew of marauders, but you'll miss a lot of Jackie's abilities.\n\n\n^ Cons are nit-picky for the most part, but some really tear you out from the action too much. This game is worth buying if just for the main campaign alone, but know how short it is. Too unique and too fun to dismiss.","November 29, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The Darkness II is NOT that type of game. The first game however, is definitely that type of game. After a slow start and what seems to be a big nuisance -the maze of connected levels through the New York subway- it starts to grow on you, it feels like you are right there with Jackie Estacado, a betrayed hitman for the mafia, helping him travel from the one rotten place to the next forsaken hell (literally) all the while thinking about your sins and the losses you had to suffer. And all of this because a evil force is helping you fulfill your vengeance but by every heart taken from the bodies of fallen enemies it takes you one step closer to the darkness and its goal to ultimately take complete control of your mind, will and body. There develops and plays out a story that’s gruesome and poetic at times, you will remember it, it will haunt you.\n\nLet's spill the beans right now for those not interested in reading a lengthy piece. It's not easy to follow up Starbreeze's gem but Digital Extremes (DE) did a good job for a sequel. While it does not satisfy as much and does not answer all the burning questions you have after playing the first one (how did Jackie return?) they at least took over most important aspects and characters from the first one that made it memorable and continue on those. That also has it's flip side, when a sequel focuses on the most memorable aspects it forgets the subtle details that made the first great. The new york subway as a game hub is no more and therefore the unique pacing of the first game is also gone. This game capitalizes on the action and creates a big deja vu of the first story and works towards a way too obvious end. As such you will feel for the characters only because you went on the dark journey with them in the first, not from what you experience in the Darkness II.\n\nBut the action, that it does good. While I personally enjoyed the more realistic style of the first, the cell shaded look of the second game will not throw you off that much. It's still gory and it still has many themes that could be deemed controversial for a game and I guess because the game did not became that much of a hit that these moments have gone unnoticed. The gun game play is improved and you get more darkness powers to play with (damn you stupid skill trees, choices, choices...). DE was also smart enough to leave out some overpowered skills out of the game or downgrade them a little bit to make the playing field more fair. The enemies are also much aware of the Darkness and it's powers and flaws and are much tougher then the unknowing mobsters from the first game. Flash grenades and portable lights will certainly give you a fight to find a spot of darkness and to unleash your dark powers.\n\nIn the end I enjoyed the darkness II very much for its game play and rehearses of the first games story. However, I play a game for it's story and hoped for a different direction, a story arc the same as the first is a bit of a let down. If you have your heart set on playing this then play the first game first and then decide if you want to play the Darkness II. If you do you will at least play this game with more passion for the characters and you will already have developed a love/hate relationship with one of the coolest voices featured in a game and the gravely twisted mind that is the Darkness.","June 20, 2014","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You play the current Darkness wielder Jackie Estacado - young mafia mobster.\n\nThe story is very well build, and has more depth in it, that you would expect, and surprised me very positively. Characters arent just place holders or fillers - the dialogues are written most excellent - even all the smaller NPCs have a very believeable motivation/story. Voice acting is excellent casted. Cool: Mike Patton (Faith No More, Fantômas) speaks the darkness!!! And he does his job with a passion - you can feel(hear) it!!!\n\nThere are some mental asylums scenes, which gives The Darkness 2 - kinda philosophical depth (whats true - whats an illusion, a dream). Its very great, to see such details/love in a huge triple A product - instead of the usual similar plots  - but then, I guess, it has already a solid ground to build on, with the comic books.\n\nGameplay is just awesome. The FPS mechanics work very well, everything plays very smoothly and fluent. You feel, always in charge of the controls. I played with keyboard & mouse - but the controller worked too, to my fully satisfaction. Its a FPS shooter - but, I would say not a "pure" - because its also very much of an action game - think best on the Riddick series - but, the Darkness 2 is "more" FPS - than Riddick (you get the idea :) because, you have the abilities to use your demonic arms of "the darkness" to mutilate & dismember the enemies in many gory and brutal ways, at the same time you can use guns - even akimbo! - makes you theoretical use 4 potential attacks the same time. That plays sometimes very exciting sometimes even a bit confusing - but always a great (gory) fun!\n\nAs its called The Darkness, you as its host, have to stay out of light sources, most possible - best to destroy 'em all, - gives the game a tactical note, because in lights, you cant use any of your "dark" powers - the tentacle arms and the special abilities hides from the light and arent available - On the opposite, in dark areas, you are getting even a boost, if you upgrade some abilities. The game is getting more diverse, as you progress, unlocking more powers.\n\nThe game is uber brutal. Mostly, you see on the screen Gallons of gore, viscera, dismemberment, limbs, heads. You name it. You can throw "javelins", and other surroundings, to kill the enemies in many ways. There are some verys brutal executions - showing in very bloody detail, how you tear men apart in many ways (Daisy Pop = Head dismemberment - you see the games dark humour) Oh, and there are some sex scenes and harsh stuff. So Its definitely for a mature audience, and not for the squemish. Be warned.\n\nAnother positive aspect of the game, is the save system. Its very fair, many checkpoints, even during boss fights. In some missions, every enemy you have killed, will be "saved" so in case you die - enemies stay dead - when you restart checkpoint. Well done. This helps with some parts, that could getting annoying. Rarely seen.\n\nIf you 're a hound for FPS/Action games, havent a problem, with lot of (virtual) blood and gore - and wants a good mature story, then "The Darkness 2" is your choice.","March 31","true","20.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It also offers some multiplayer/co-op options, where you have\nthe availability to play a different campaign than the one you play solo,\nwhich is nice.\n\nThe story is loosely based on The Darkness comic series, and takes\nplace two years after the first game.  You play as Jackie Estacado, the don\nof a crime family that posesses a supernatural power called The Darkness.\nWith this power, you have extra arms, or tentacles, that can pick up enemies,\nthrow objects, and  other options that are added as you progress through the\ngame. The story is very narrational based and entertaining, and connects on\nan emotional level to the player.\n\nThere are a variety of weapons that are offered;  the recoil on even\nthe most basic weapons are very well done, as well as the aim and reload time.\nThey don't ever feel like they are too weak.  The combat is also done well,\ngiving a sense of urgency as you progress through, and a fluidity during\nbattles.\n\nThe darkness has powers and abilities that you can unlock and upgrade\nas you progress through the game.  There is a decent variety in the selection\nof abilities, and they do run on a cool down time.  I felt that the combat\nwas fair, and rewarded me appropriately as I went through levels.\n\nAs for level design, the game is very linear, but it does compensate\nfor that with a strong fluidity of the combat.  As you progress through\nthe levels, the story as well as the fluidity of combat helps break up the\nlinear feel of it.  The game is consistant in its' aesthetic and atmosphere,\nand everything flowed very well.\n\nThere were a few minor issues, which I detail in my video review, but\noverall this is a good game with well done combat and a compelling story.  The\nlevel design is basic, but I never felt my time was wasted, and I can easily\nrecommend this game.\n\nThis is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a Blogger\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","October 26, 2014","true","30.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

About halfway through the plot your character is killed and is then resurrected by The Darkness, which makes you realize that dying during gameplay really shouldn't be that big a deal if your inner demon can just bring you back to life following the subtle plot twist of getting shotgunned in the face.\n\nI have some minor gripes with the controls; you'll want to remap them or else your attempts to aim, shoot, and flail around with your demon arms basically results in you stumbling and haphazardly firing your guns into the ceiling and walls like a drunken redneck.\n\nThere is a variety of enemies to encounter who make the combat a lot of fun and interesting.\n\nThe plot and it's overall theme of sanity and evil versus absolute evil were quite enjoyable, and I liked that the game had at least two different endings.\n\nI haven't played the 'vendetta' content yet, but considering the "Main Story" lasted less than six hours I feel justified reviewing the game without playing all of its content.","August 23, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While many allusions are made its way, The Darkness II has you covered with a concise recap.\n\nThe first Darkness was a mess of a game, marred with terrible voice acting, animations, controls, gameplay, and numerous other bugs. The Darkness II, a product by another team of developers, is fortunately an exemplary sequel, fixing nearly every flaw and adding major improvements in ways unimaginable.\n\nGraphically, The Darkness II's cel shading is simply beautiful, fitting right in with its comic book counterpart. The animations are smooth and the over-the-top violence is a blast to watch. Controls, especially during combat, flow extremely well, even in the face of the overwhelming number abilities available.\n\nWhile the single player campaign isn't too lengthy, the game doubles its duration with the inclusion of a cooperative mode offering 18 missions and 4 new, unique characters.

The 'monstrous' controls feels rather good and the game did not disapoint me on the unique aspect and feel it promised and delivered. The only sad part about the game, IMO is that the main storyline is too short, you play through everything wanting more and poof, you only have the vendetta (MP) and hitman missions left to do. I cleared it twice and do not regret my purchase, definitely recommended.

Boht on mobster (medium) difficulty)\n\nThe story is my opinion very well written and exciting, allthough linear and short. The gameplay was fast paced and exciting. I was worried the two extra "arms" would be hard to use, but using a gamepad it quickly started feeling natural, and the controls all in all worked very well, and were easy to learn. The key to victory in combat is combining firearms and darkness powers (some learned through the skilltree), and it's easy to learn - and honestly not particularly hard to master either. That's not to say it's a particularly easy game though, even though your darkness powers allows you to tear through some parts of the game.\n\nThe co-op campaign has a story that runs next to the story of the main campaign, focusing on 4 mercenaries hired by the "protagonist", Jackie Estacado, to shoot people, fetch stuff, shoot people, rescue hostages and occasionally shoot people. Each of the 4 mercs have access to parts of the Darkness' powers (like regeneration, super helpsome), and they each have an unique weapon as well as an unique skilltree. The co-op campaign is even shorter than the main game, the map-design isn't as exciting, but designed for bigger battles. I played through it alone, so I don't know how well it works with more players,  but I found it entertaining enough, even though the difficulty varied wildly, allthough I think that may have been because I was alone.\n\nThe graphics are pleasing, and made in a comic-y style, which also makes the constant gore a little less realistic, making the game feel a bit less graphic than I had expected. The animation is for the most parts good, though some characters feel a bit stiff. The quality of the voice work varies a bit, but is for the most parts good - the screams of terror from the enemies seem convincing and such.\n\nAll in all I think this is a good game with fair graphics, it is however quite short. The current price, 30 euro, is a bit more than I feel it's worth. Catch it on sale some time, and tear up some gangsters and ♥♥♥♥.","July 31, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

AND DO NOT READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH\n*****************************************************************************************\nI had very good memories with the first Darkness and it was a great experience. I loved the game so much that I finished it 3 times. It had a unique atmosphere. Well the game was really dark and serious with main character, "Jackie", going through a lot, trying to fight the darkness while it was taking control of him. It was a part in the game, (first one) that Jackie sees his girlfriend, and I remember that I feel bad for him. Felt that this poor guy deserves love and happiness but then again everything changes.\nThe second game is really a different experience, This time you feel strong. You feel like a god. for the fans, I really suggest to buy this game, specially once it has been out for a while and it always gets big discounts.

I did not experiece any bugs or crashes which was also nice for a older game on a current PC. I still find at the full price of $32.99 CDN I would have just put it on my wishlist for a cheaper price. It is not really worth $30 for only 6 hours of gameplay.

I really like the story, gameplay, just everything about it. The only think I dislike, however, is the game's ending(s). It's really unfortunate a game like "The Darkness"(First game of series) is only on console, I would have loved to play it on PC. Another the chances of there being a 3rd one for this series is low, which really sucks. The ending is SO unsatisfying and leaves you wondering. The co-op campaign is really cool because it relates/connects to the single-player story. It sucks that it's also fairly dead, however if you have friends that have this game. It's REALLY fun.\n\nI rate this game a 9/10.

Yet with the stark differences in art-style and ultimately approach to the structure itself  in The Darkness 2, Digital Extremes also wisely fixed the cumbersome combat of the original Darkness with much better shooting mechanics and much better implementation of the titular demon itself during fights. Additionally, the co-op heavy Vendettas game mode is a nice surprise and a lot of fun both online and off. Performance is neither an issue here or there with this one, The Darkness II can be maxed out smoothly on modest DX10 video cards and budget Dual core CPUs although it doesn't quite have proper full-frame support, squashing the picture similar to Digital Extreme's previous work on Homefront. Otherwise, aside from the occassional cheap enemy chokepoint, you're more than likely to enjoy what you get out of The Darkness II, especially if it is less than £5.","August 13, 2013","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Solid, unflinching combat mechanics, great graphics, cool story, and a lot of fun to play. Not only can you dual wield weapons, you have two demon arms that come out of you to slash and grab enemies and do gruesome executions, and you can grab items and throw them at enemies. The ultra-violence in this game knows no limits. Another big plus: the story is easily one of the best video game stories I've ever seen. Simple to grasp yet very well written and well acted, even sad at times. The graphics are also very well done and hold up well today even as of 2016, with a almost Borderlands-ish comic style. But things look more human-like and the game is much more serious than BL games, and it manages to feel like its own style of art.\n\nIf you like well made FPS games that feel nice and tight when you play them, like a young, hot, 18yr old super-long haired red head prom date with a quiver in her panties that you can feel on your leg while dancing, quit waiting and go for it.\n\nGameplay 9/10\nGraphics 8/10\nEffects 8/10\nPerformance 10/10\nSounds/music 9/10\nStory 10/10\nLength 9/10\nReplay value 7/10\nLevel of Violence 10/10\nTechnical problems: none for me/10\n\n8.5/10 one of my fav fps games","December 29, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The major drawback is that the main campaign will only last for 5 hours tops (it took me 8 hours with a NG++ game) ,and the vendettas will give you 2-3 more hours.If you decide ofcourse to play the extra campaign or the vendettas with all the charactes (I doubt you will :P ), the time will be multiplied.So here comes the critical question : Are you able/willing to give 30 $ for a game it will only last 12-14 hours tops?Yes the story will be great and Yes the powers and abilities of darkness will be unforgetable but will it worth for the so little time it will last....?In my opinion NO ...buy this game like a did at a steam sale (80%=5$) and you will not regret it.","November 14, 2014","true","18.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I liked having to hide in the dark and using the shadows to my advantage. the guns were pretty insane and the story was pretty intriguing too. I never played the first Darkness game, so I don't know that one's story but I can say that I was pretty hooked all the way through. If you're a fan of gorey first person shooters and slashing people with magical demon arms and voices in your head telling you to kill people and eat their hearts, then don't wait (or wait for a sale and then don't wait) to get this game and hack, slash, and shoot your way through an evil Brotherhood determined to cause chaos and destroy the world all the while learning more about the interesting world of the Darkness and it's version of history. It was only an 8-12 hour long campaign depending on difficulty setting and skill of the player as well as whether one wanted to find all the hidden collectables in the game's stages, but it was intense, action packed, and fun the whole way.

I also own a copy on Xbox 360, and this is the copy I completed.\n\nThe Darkness II is a phsycological horror first-person shooter sequel to The Darkness, a console only game released back in 2009. The original game was interesting despite its flaws, and was a highly enjoyable game in terms of story and gameplay. Its sequel, The Darkness II, goes above and beyond to deliver an absolute gem of a gaming experience, and a masterpiece of the art form.\nYou play as Jackie Estacado, the head of a feared crime family, who is the host to an ancient evil known as The Darkness - this evil resides inside Jackie and gives him supernatural powers. Jackie constantly wrestles for control, and The Darkness forced him to stand by and watch as his girlfriend, Jenny, was murdered.\nJenny's murder is the driving force of this entire game. Throughout the game, Jackie experiences hallucinations of Jenny, and interacts with her as she if she never died. These moments are the soul of the game; Jackie and Jenny are beautifully acted, and you can genuinely feel the emotion in these scenes. This made the story a compelling and enjoyable one, and I felt personally compellled to stick this game through to the end.\nIn between cutscenes and interaction with Jenny and other NPC's, Jackie will engage in numerous combat situations. This game uses a unique and innovative combat system, in that the player is able to 'quad-wield'; the player is able to dual wield one handed firearms in combination with the demon tendrils produced by The Darkness. These tendrils let you rip, slash, throw, tear and stab your enemies in a variety of highly entertaining ways, but be warned that these kills are extremely gory and not for the faint hearted. In fact, the entire game is extremely dark, and contains very dark subject matter beyond the usual video game. The player also has to avoid street lights and other artificial lights and shoot them out where possible, as you cannot regenerate health or use Darkness abilities whilst in the light.\nThis game is beautiful in every aspect. The game engine employs a distinct comic-book inspired aesthetic like the Borderlands games, and it really helps make the game look and run nice at the higher settings. Substantial effort and polish has gone into the production of this game, and it really shows; character models look and move realistically, and environments are dazzling to look at.\nIn addition to the perfected single player campaign (which I have been careful not to spoil) there is a mini co-op campaign, which allows you to play with 3 friends and use a wide range of guns and abilities to kill enemies. This mode emphasises fun and action, and lacks the depth of the single player campaign. However, it was certainly fun, and I didn't feel like it detracted from the campaign in any way.\nOverall, The Darkness II is a masterpiece of the gaming industry. A brilliant, well constructed tale of love and loss and eventually redemption, this is a game for the ages. I can't recommend it any more than I already have, which is why this game earns a 10 / 10.","March 2, 2014","true","4.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","9"

You're a Don now, leading a crime organisation that seems to feel smaller than implied.\n\nYou go to a restaurant and get attacked by a bunch of janitors. Almost intently, they force you to survive by releasing the Darkness, which Jackie had locked up ever since last time.\n\nWhat follows is a path of revenge. First to retalliate, then avenge your Aunt, then recover a plot-vital artifact... you're basically on a railroad of motivations, which feels artificial.\nNo surprise that the story really isn't engaging.\n\nBut the surrounding side characters are a redeeming factor. NPC's are often in pairs and have some funny banter. And spamming talk to hear them out leads into a long strain of comments about their own backstory. They may be somewhat shallow characters, but there's a sense of personality to them.\n\nIn particular, the Darkling seems to be filled with it. He slowly starts to play a big part in the story, and is generally a hoot to listen to. A major improvenemt over the first game.\n\nGameplay wise, what's changed isn't per se for the better.\nYou still have your whip, but it feels much shorter and riskier to use to whip out lights. It relies on your input to see what direction to swipe, which feels counter-intuitive.\n\nYou can grab a car door or anything shield-like to carry in front of you as protection while you shoot. A great idea at first, but impractical over time, as eating hearts removes the shield and you can't use the whip. Not to mention that the smallest light drops it.\nNot much of a problem at first, until you start encountering the Brotherhood...\n\nCorpses still carry hearts to consume, but living ones serve a different purpose now as well.\nInstead of four awesome Darkness powers, your powers now largely revolve around stunning an enemy, then grasping him.\nUpon which you can then decide what to do with them.\nMainly, they can serve as a quick health refill, an ammo refill (yep), a shield creator or a cooldown reducer.\n\nYou also have two active cooldown-based abilities.\nOne is swarm, which briefly blind/stuns your enemy, making them vulnerable.\nThe other briefly infuses your guns with the Darkness, giving you infinite ammo and raised damage. But it's not really a lifesaver.\n\nAll of this fancy stuff however has to be unlocked first, using points you earn in combat. The fancier the kill, the more points you get.\nIn general, the upgrades are okay. They're nothing spectacular. Although the Darkness armor does look mighty nice. It seems based upon the armor from the comics.\n\nIn the end, I felt like the Darkness was more of a crutch that slowed me down. I was constantly juggling with my Gunplay and my Darkness powers, annoyingly so.\n\nThe Brotherhood, which past halfway will be your mainstay enemies, often carry light-beams, which will just annoy the hell out of you. Whenever you are in light now, your screen goes black and white and drop any non-weapon you are holding (such as shields). It's quite disruptive.\n\nNot to mention the Whip guys.... These guys will snatch whatever weapon you are holding.\nOr the shielders who knock you around, while requiring either swarm or multiple whip slashing to be knocked away.\nOr the Heavy guys that, for some reason, blink around the place whenever they are hurt.\nThese guys get my vote as most-annoying ever.\nThankfully you're done with the story in about eight hours.\n\nVendettas seems to largely be a redeeming feature.\nYou can pick one of four that each have one Darkness ability.\nThis is a good thing, as the focus seems to be much more on the gunplay. You still get the annoying light effect, but you feel much less disabled.\nQuite frankly, I feel like I'm having a much better time in Vendettas.\n\nThe Darkness 2 is like a bad sequel to a good movie. You cringe, but you can still see what you liked about the original.\n\nGet it while it's on sale, play the Single Player on Easy and try and make the best out of it...","August 8, 2013","false","15.8"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","0"

A decent story, although not the best around, is also a huge part of this amazing game. The power that is given to you almost makes you feel invincible, but doesn’t take away from the challenge. Although I will admit that this game is not very long, giving you maybe 6 hours of game play on the single player campaign tops, and the fact that there isn’t much of a reason to replay the single player again unless you want to use the amazing abilities you gain. But to counter that statement, if you have another friend that can get this game, there is a very decent coop experience with new characters with new abilities to play with, giving the game a lot more hours of fun to experience. It’s a decent game and its very fun, although probably not worth the 30$ price tag, this game is still a must own, and if you can find it on sale for $10~$15 or less, you should definitely get this game.","November 2, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyway i would give this game a 8/10 overall. i wish the game was longer but if you get a chance you should definently try this game out!","November 28, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it's okay. Story is nice. Still hate Adam Sandler movies, so this game didn't change my mind about the actor. I just feel that he plays as the same character in every film. He's a wierd guy, who pisses someone off, finds a girl, beats some people up, and then him and his girl seperate and he goes off somewhere, but then he comes back to her and they get back together and they fall in love. In every Adam Sandler movie this happens. I swear to god. The movies he plays in have awful plot lines, and the jokes are very mediocre. This game is fine though, but it does not live up to the developers words, because they specefically said that it makes Adam Sandler look cool again. That was their slogan for the game, and the soul reason I purchased the game as well, and it never lived up to it! It is fun, but as a warning; it will not make Adam Sandler look cool.","December 12, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I was somewhat worried about the new Cell Shaded style but it turned out to be one of the best things for the series; especially considering it's comicbook roots. Not only was the aesthetic drastically improved, but the arcade style shooter alterations, quad-wielding mechanic, new voice actors (with impeccable delivery), and INCREDIBLY paced and executed story all came together to create a real gem.

Gunplay is solid, if a little uninspired. Story was gripping throughout and very well paced: people have complained about the length, but I felt I got more than my money's worth. This game is lovely to look at, and despite its age, still holds a candle to any modern shooter thanks to its expertly rendered cell-shading, which maintains a perfect comic book vibe throughout, and allows the graphics to remain essentially timeless.\n\nTwo places the game falls down, to differing extent are the atmosphere and level design.\n\nAtmosphere is largely absent from this game unfortunately, despite offering a mythos that could easily be exploited for spine-tingling vibes. The soundtrack is completely forgettable and generic, and the ambient sound design extremely lacking. While we're on the topic of the mythos, I found myself not caring much. The game makes many attempts to engage you with the mythos, but such attempts felt only about three-quarter-♥♥♥♥♥. Perhaps this is a problem with the source material, I'm unsure. I normally dive into mythos pretty heavily, but despite my best efforts, I couldn't engage with this game's beyond the initial veneer. Something was lacking.\n\nAs to level design, while I wouldn't say it was atrocious, or even bad, it was thoroughly uninspired. One often has the sensation of moving from room to room, both figuratively and literally. Not only is the design linear, but it offers little opportunity to exploit level features to one's advantage. With that said, many of the sets look goregous, although just as many are enither here nor there.\n\nI've begun rambling here, so I'll just say, if you can get this game for $5 you'll have gotten more than your money's worth, and I'd even happily drop a tenner on it. At the time of this review, full price is $40, and there's simply no way this game is worth that when one considers what else is available for that kind of price, however it regularly goes on sale for large discounts. I regularly see it at ~80% off, so if you can get it at that kind of discount (and you can if you're patient) I recommend it.\n\nGame ends on a cliffhanger and no sequel announced thus far, so keep that in mind. However that this bothered me at all speaks to how much I ended up enjoying the story of this game. I give it 3/5 stars.","August 22, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will often find yourself wading into enemies, shooting and tearing your enemies to pieces all around you. Health and cover are not a huge issue as you can tear the hearts out of fallen/staggered foes for a health boost on the fly.\n\nThe game also boasts what they call "quad-wielding"; allowing you to use your demon tendrils as an extra 2 hands. This lets you actively grab items and enemies, hold shields or use the tendrils as a close range whip; all while keeping your actual hands free to fire your guns. The combat is fast and furious and feels very satisfying.\n\nAn interesting mechanic is the fact that your Darkness powers don't work in the light, and your enemies in the mid-late parts of the game know this. Enemies will come at you with shoulder mounted spotlights and employ flashbangs to try and slow you down. It keeps it interesting as the enemy with the light instantly becomes your priority regardless of the armored shotgunners 10 feet away from you.\n\nThe story is engaging and fun, but is not too long. You play the head of a mafia family with powers known as "The Darkness" as your organization engages in all out war with an ancient dark cult intent on stealing your powers and killing anyone in their way. Definitely not a plot you come across often! Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who thinks this sounds interesting as I had lots of fun with it!","February 5, 2013","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was somewhat worried about the new Cell Shaded style but it turned out to be one of the best things for the series; especially considering it's comicbook roots. Not only was the aesthetic drastically improved, but the arcade style shooter alterations, quad-wielding mechanic, new voice actors (with impeccable delivery), and INCREDIBLY paced and executed story all came together to create a real gem.

It has skill trees, so for all of you rpg lovers out there, this game is for you. you can build up your character, and make him a flesh tearing demon.

The story (while short) is an absolute blast to play through and I absolutely enjoyed the world that Digital Extremes ended up creating here. The characters are all interesting and entertaining in their own ways with all of their own quirks and colorful personalities. The game runs very smoothly and the cell shaded look really adds to the atmosphere of the game. My only gripes are that Vendettas mode is absolutely boring and a pain to play through without friends and even then it is really forgettable when compared to the main game, and that I ran into a couple of bugs in which I became stuck somewhere in the enviornment while moving through an airduct or some small crawl space and couldn't proceed until I just kinda jumped around a bit. But these 2 things didn't ruin my experience with the game whatsoever and I will definitely be going back through this game on New Game Plus mode to unlock all of the darkness abilities and just have a fun ♥♥♥ time playing this amazing game. I seriously highly recommend buying it if you love good and fun FPS games with good stories.","March 4, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I consider the storyline immersive and up near bioshock infinite / The Last Of us. It confuses your brain, it gets you thinking, and wanting to play more. One demon arm slash at a time. And with this new perspective of first person, where you literally have four weapons at the same time at your disposal. It is extremely gorey, and a joy whenever you rip someones head off, or get a new execution. It has skill trees, so for all of you rpg lovers out there, this game is for you. you can build up your character, and make him a flesh tearing demon. You see your character evolve over time, from normal jackie estano, to something else. I rate this game 11/10. If you dont play this game, then your not a gamer. Pretty much the best game i have ever played. Amazing storyline, gameplay, graphics , visuals, aswell as voice acting. Everything is perfect about this game, and you should buy it.","March 7, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, so far, the only game that I finished AND unlocked all achievements. The atmosphere, characters, comic-like graphics, dialogues, cutscenes, voiceacting (especially Jackie, Jenny and The Darkness are amazingly voiced)... there're so many good and only a few bad things - the game is really short, it takes around 8 hours to finish on easier difficulties (it's pretty easy on any difficulty, though). After you finish the game, you have the option to start over with New Game+, which preserves all your talents and skills. There're 4 difficulties, 2 of them are a joke, the 3rd one is what you should choose if you play for the 1st time. The 4th difficulty called "Don" is the most challenging and I recommend playing it in New Game+, though it's still pretty easy, since your endgame abilities are really overpowered (just use Gun Channeling which you should max out ASAP, dual-wield and hold both mouse buttons). Sadly, I literally flied through NG+, took me around 3-4 hours to complete. There's also some kind of multiplayer, you can choose one of 4 unique (unique weapons, some new talents) characters and play co-op with your friends. Yeah, only with your friends, because the multiplayer is quite dead. Anyway, multiplayer is not the main catch of the game. All achievements are achieveable in singleplayer since you can play even those multiplayer maps alone, just choose a character, one of 18 maps (6 original and playable in singleplayer, some more are cut out of campaign and some are solely multiplayer). Apart from the lenght... it's really an awesome game. I had so much fun. Some might argue that it's repetitive, the truth is.. it's not long enough to actually get repetitive. So in the end, you get 10-15 hours of really fun gameplay and maybe even more, if you invite your friends.","August 14, 2013","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story really draws you in. Make sure you collect as many artifacts as possible and later go through and have the paranormal expert guy there tell you about them, they're gruesomely hilarous.

The Darkness 2 follows the story Jackie Estacado a mob boss who inherits a peculiar ability which is wielding the Darkness. The game uses cell shading similar to borderlands which compliments the game world well. The gameplay is quite original and lets you “quad-wield” which basically means you can wield a gun in each hand while also controlling your two darkness demon arms. The controls feel a bit fiddly when using a mouse and keyboard, if you own a controller I would recommend using that instead. This game has some of the most gruesome kills I have ever seen in a game. Using your demonic arms you can rip your enemies in half, slice of their head or even pull out an enemy’s spine from his butt the list goes on. The single player campaign took me about 6 hours on my first play through and left me wanting more, not because the game was bad but because it was so darn good. There is also a co-op campaign which was fun to play with friends but got boring very quickly. In summary, I really enjoyed this game and its unique gameplay but found it was bit to short.","May 13, 2013","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will often find yourself wading into enemies, shooting and tearing your enemies to pieces all around you. Health and cover are not a huge issue as you can tear the hearts out of fallen/staggered foes for a health boost on the fly.\n\nThe game also boasts what they call "quad-wielding"; allowing you to use your demon tendrils as an extra 2 hands. This lets you actively grab items and enemies, hold shields or use the tendrils as a close range whip; all while keeping your actual hands free to fire your guns. The combat is fast and furious and feels very satisfying.\n\nAn interesting mechanic is the fact that your Darkness powers don't work in the light, and your enemies in the mid-late parts of the game know this. Enemies will come at you with shoulder mounted spotlights and employ flashbangs to try and slow you down. It keeps it interesting as the enemy with the light instantly becomes your priority regardless of the armored shotgunners 10 feet away from you.\n\nThe story is engaging and fun, but is not too long. You play the head of a mafia family with powers known as "The Darkness" as your organization engages in all out war with an ancient dark cult intent on stealing your powers and killing anyone in their way. Definitely not a plot you come across often!

Now my review is warped by me spending only £3.99 for the game while it was on sale and of course if I paid full price for the game and bought it closer to its release this review would be totally different.\n\nPros;\nThe game is action packed and the centre of the game, the combat, feels amazingly smooth. The idea of having the likes of 2 guns in hand along with the snake like tentacles ripping people into a fine paste while going rambo is alone a good reason for purchasing the game. Graphically its not all that bad and there is little to complain about the game in this sense as it isnt all that demanding. The storyline was slightly dull at the start of the game however as the game progressed I was getting more and more into it and in the end it wasnt all the bad of a story in comparison to some modern games. The gore in this game on its own needs a special mention because OH MY LORD was it beautiful with a whole variety of different executions which seem to get more and more enjoyable with each kill as all who stand in your way squirm to release themselves from the grasp of your tentacles.\n\nCons;\nThere is very little replay value here in my opinion from this game. The singleplayer isn't all that long either with a single playthrough on the hitman difficulty taking around three to three and a half hours maximum with figuring out controls etc. There is still a bug in the game with a certain section where you go into the ventilation shaft which cannot be passed without V-Sync enabled without it you just run into invisible walls. Boss fights are extremely boring consisting of the boss teleporting and standing still for 10 seconds while you rain hell on him and then teleporting again to form a dull sequence with no real challenge. The AI for the normal grunts and even some of the specials you meet during the game are to put it plainly below average and with them all looking so similar there is a strong sense of Ctrl C + Ctrl V.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid however I would only recommend it for buying during a sale as you may feel disappointed with what you are paying £19.99 for. To put a number to it;\n7.5/10 on sale\n5/10 full price","March 21, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After hearing average reviews of this game, I went to it expecting the average, run of the mill FPS that we've recently become accustomed to. Not only was it above average and exceeded what I was expecting, it killed it. Almost everything in this game was done well, and even some of the stuff that missed still wasn't that bad.\n\nPlot: The Darkness 2 is about Jackie Estacado, the protagonist from the first game that you may remember, if you played it. That being said though, you don't have to have played the first one to understand the story of this one. It's been a few years since the events of the first game, and the death of Jenny. Jackie's been keeping the darkness under control, but after a hit is put out on him, he can't control it anymore. You'll learn about ancient artifacts, a secret society, and two different endings, which offers a bit of replay value.\n\nSetting: This game has many different set pieces, and while the first hour or so is repetitive in terms of the stages, the rest of the game has much more creative level design. Even in the hallucinations he has, the asylum is one of the most interesting and also tense settings I've ever seen, providing a frightening reality of being trapped and unable to escape. If you choose the ending to fight the darkness and save Jenny, you'll have to fight in Hell, which is in my opinion, one of the most beautiful levels I've seen in a game, ever.\n\n\nGameplay: On its surface, The Darkness 2 may seem like a bog standard shooter, and at some points, it is. But Jackie gets all sorts of awesome and violent powers to wield. With many skills you can level up using "essence" (a sort of xp you get for doing various things, including killing enemies and getting collectables), you can do "executions", which include ripping someone in half for health, or pulling someone's spine literally out of their ♥♥♥ (creatively called an "assecution"). That being said though, after you do each execution a few times, it gets old. And if you're playing on the harder difficulties, you need to do them to keep getting health and ammo. Luckily though, enemies can't damage you while they're being performed.\n\nHowever, one fault that the game has is that the main story is a little too short. It can be beaten, if you dedicated, in about 5-6 hours, maybe a little longer if you go for relics. There is a "New Game +" mode, where you get to keep all your power ups and essence, but it's the same game, only slightly harder. The game does offer "Vendettas", which allow you to play as a different character than Jackie, each with their own ability. These vendettas will take you about 3 hours or so, depending on what difficulty you choose, and there's also bonus missions you can do. Online multiplayer is there too, but it seems that nobody is playing it.\n\nVerdict: Overall, The Darkness 2 is a good game. It's not ground breakign, but it's a fun ride that will keep you occupied for at least 5 hours. With two endings, one of them that was heartbreaking, at least for me, and a fun, brainless, Vendetta mode, this game should offer some good, violent, and disgusting entertainment. I reccommend it strongly. Check it out.","December 30, 2013","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know of no other Digital Extremes. Beside them you also have 2K so you really have everything you need to make a really good game.\n\nI never played the first one as it was never released on PC. But from what I understand the story takes place a couple of years after the events of its predecessor. You play the don of an infamous crime family who is attacked at the beginning of the story. One of the rival gangs almost eliminates Jackie, our protagonist, who eventually gives in to the Darkness which saves his life.\n\nAnd this is where the game gets interesting: Jackie has two tentacles protruding from his body and you can use them to crush, dismember or simply slice up your enemies. Oh, and of course you have your good old pistols, machine guns and shotguns to annihilate all the bad guys approaching you. Jackie did not want the Darkness to return - under the circumstances, however, he needs to rely on them and throughout the game you need to find out who and why attacked you in the restaurant.\n\nWith the tentacles you can also pick up objects - e.g. the door of a vehicle - and throw them at your enemies. And as you can do some dual wielding with the firearms you can practically say you are doing quad wielding with the two tendrils. How cooler can a game be, am I right? With the killings you can collect what the game calls essence; a substance that eventually lets you purchase new powers or the upgraded version of the ones you already have. It should also be note that as the title refers to it darkness is also Jackie's ally - if you are in an illuminated area the tentacles immediately retract.\n\nDarkness II is a fast-paced action horror game that utilises a cel-shading technique to give the game a comic book influenced visual style. Multiplayer is limited to cooperative gameplay that does not really add anything to the story but lets you enjoy quad wielding with your friends.\n\nI highly recommend it - for 30 EUR it's a bit too much at the moment but you should definitely pick this one up if discounted.","March 9, 2014","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Obviously, it wasn't that slow, since you get ambushed during your dinner with some ladies of the night at some deago food spot within the first 10 or so minutes of the game - BUT - at least the devs eased you into it instead of the begining of TD 1 where your flying through traffic, shooting at people. The steady introduction of the darkness powers and influence was pretty neat, as well.\n\nSo time moves on and I start noticing things like the full axis control of the demon arms and the RIDICULOUS executions you can do and I start to think, "This reminds me of my last relationship".\nThen I think, "Wow, this is really well made!" The game, albiet, was shorter than I had hoped for, but still, its the Darkness irregardless.\n\n(TBCNT)","August 8, 2013","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

It appeals to me both as a game and as a piece of art.\n\nThe  gameplay is as fluid as can be, with great gunplay and supernatural powers courtesy of the demonically mystical "Darkness". There are  twists and turns throughout, both heart-warming and devastating.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game, and it takes it's place among the few games  that I've finished on the same day; that may be a result of the story being short, but no shorter than the average single player of today, and not so long it drags things out.\n\nWith New Game + and "Vendettas" which I believe to be extra missions, there is still plenty of replayability. Hell, I'm going to replay it just for the story.\n\n8/10 - A must buy.","August 15, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Want the Darkness!  Honestly, it's a very good cell shaded type game.  It takes what looks like an old page out of a comic book and implements it into a cell shaded world.  Honestly the game does it well.  The levels have a pretty even split and playing as the Darkness is just plain fun.  Eating human hearts, decapitation, splitting the soul, and testing out an Iron Maiden.  Honestly, the game has only a couple of little flaws.  The story line is, ok.  It lacks a really epic story line, and it gets old somewhere in the middle and picks up again towards the end.  Gameplay is very good and the game requires you to learn to implement and even combination of darkness powers and gun totting.  If it's on sale I definitely recommend picking up a copy.

I know of no other Digital Extremes. Beside them you also have 2K so you really have everything you need to make a really good game.\n\nI never played the first one as it was never released on PC. But from what I understand the story takes place a couple of years after the events of its predecessor. You play the don of an infamous crime family who is attacked at the beginning of the story. One of the rival gangs almost eliminates Jackie, our protagonist, who eventually gives in to the Darkness which saves his life.\n\nAnd this is where the game gets interesting: Jackie has two tentacles protruding from his body and you can use them to crush, dismember or simply slice up your enemies. Oh, and of course you have your good old pistols, machine guns and shotguns to annihilate all the bad guys approaching you. Jackie did not want the Darkness to return - under the circumstances, however, he needs to rely on them and throughout the game you need to find out who and why attacked you in the restaurant.\n\nWith the tentacles you can also pick up objects - e.g. the door of a vehicle - and throw them at your enemies. And as you can do some dual wielding with the firearms you can practically say you are doing quad wielding with the two tendrils. How cooler can a game be, am I right? With the killings you can collect what the game calls essence; a substance that eventually lets you purchase new powers or the upgraded version of the ones you already have. It should also be note that as the title refers to it darkness is also Jackie's ally - if you are in an illuminated area the tentacles immediately retract.\n\nDarkness II is a fast-paced action horror game that utilises a cel-shading technique to give the game a comic book influenced visual style. Multiplayer is limited to cooperative gameplay that does not really add anything to the story but lets you enjoy quad wielding with your friends.\n\nI highly recommend it - for 30 EUR it's a bit too much at the moment but you should definitely pick this one up if discounted.","March 9, 2014","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A fresh air after playing so many crappy indie productions.\n\nPros:\n- the plot is kind of nice if you know something about Image Comics and the Artifacts series - reading the story of hidden relics and immersing in the whole Darkness backstory is really fun\n- graphics are well fitting into comic book stylistics\n- playing with the Darkness tentacles is really fun\n- the whole concept of destroying light sources in order to be able to use the Darkness is an interesting idea, well fitting into the whole concept of the Darkness\n- character development system is not overwhelming the whole game - there is no point in maxing out character except for pure fun\n- some abilities give a lot of tactical advantages and possibilities - black holes can be of great help and autoaiming provided by one of high tier abilities, even while lasting about 5 seconds, can make the difference\n- last levels in hell are very nice and atmospheric\n\nCons:\n- the plot is kind of dumb if you're not into The Darkness comic books - Darkness says something, blablabla, Angelus blablabla, Brotherhood blablabla, vengance yadayada, Jenny hurrdurr, so on and so forth\n- you cannot skip some cutscenes - this is really bad\n- well, considering this is a shooter there aren't many different weapons - pistol, revolver, desert eagle, two different shotguns, winchester (you have it for about 15 minutes), two or three smgs, two or three different assault rifles and that's all\n- guns can use ammo really fast and there are not really that many ammo boxes laying around so you can find yourself in a situation where you don't have any bullets to shoot\n- I think that the games relies too much on the finisher mechanics - need to replenish health? Use Finisher #1. Need to get some additional ammo - guessed it, Finisher #2. Considering that uzis and other guns do use ammo pretty fast you may find yourself in a situation that you try to finish enemies with Finisher #1 or #2\n- special abilities are fun to use, but recharge slow and you don't really need them - they help, true, but they are not game changing abilities like for example slow motion in Max Payne 1.\n- this game is short (about 6-7 hours)\n\nAs you can see I have described many cons so you may think that this is a mediocre game. By any means no, this is a really good game, I had a lot of fun playing it. There is New Game + option after beating the game, which adds some playtime if someone would like to go for the second run and max out character abilities. In the first run I think you can get 60-70% of all abilities so there is just enough reason to play the game for the second time.\n\nI just pass this option because I don't like to watch the same long cutscenes over again.\n\nAnyways... you can try Demo. Go and try it.\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","January 16","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After hearing average reviews of this game, I went to it expecting the average, run of the mill FPS that we've recently become accustomed to. Not only was it above average and exceeded what I was expecting, it killed it. Almost everything in this game was done well, and even some of the stuff that missed still wasn't that bad.\n\nPlot: The Darkness 2 is about Jackie Estacado, the protagonist from the first game that you may remember, if you played it. That being said though, you don't have to have played the first one to understand the story of this one. It's been a few years since the events of the first game, and the death of Jenny. Jackie's been keeping the darkness under control, but after a hit is put out on him, he can't control it anymore. You'll learn about ancient artifacts, a secret society, and two different endings, which offers a bit of replay value.\n\nSetting: This game has many different set pieces, and while the first hour or so is repetitive in terms of the stages, the rest of the game has much more creative level design. Even in the hallucinations he has, the asylum is one of the most interesting and also tense settings I've ever seen, providing a frightening reality of being trapped and unable to escape. If you choose the ending to fight the darkness and save Jenny, you'll have to fight in Hell, which is in my opinion, one of the most beautiful levels I've seen in a game, ever.\n\n\nGameplay: On its surface, The Darkness 2 may seem like a bog standard shooter, and at some points, it is. But Jackie gets all sorts of awesome and violent powers to wield. With many skills you can level up using "essence" (a sort of xp you get for doing various things, including killing enemies and getting collectables), you can do "executions", which include ripping someone in half for health, or pulling someone's spine literally out of their ♥♥♥ (creatively called an "assecution"). That being said though, after you do each execution a few times, it gets old. And if you're playing on the harder difficulties, you need to do them to keep getting health and ammo. Luckily though, enemies can't damage you while they're being performed.\n\nHowever, one fault that the game has is that the main story is a little too short. It can be beaten, if you dedicated, in about 5-6 hours, maybe a little longer if you go for relics. There is a "New Game +" mode, where you get to keep all your power ups and essence, but it's the same game, only slightly harder. The game does offer "Vendettas", which allow you to play as a different character than Jackie, each with their own ability. These vendettas will take you about 3 hours or so, depending on what difficulty you choose, and there's also bonus missions you can do. Online multiplayer is there too, but it seems that nobody is playing it.\n\nVerdict: Overall, The Darkness 2 is a good game. It's not ground breakign, but it's a fun ride that will keep you occupied for at least 5 hours. With two endings, one of them that was heartbreaking, at least for me, and a fun, brainless, Vendetta mode, this game should offer some good, violent, and disgusting entertainment. I reccommend it strongly. Check it out.","December 30, 2013","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the eve of his 21st birthday, Jackie is targeted for assassination by "Uncle" Paulie Franchetti (voiced by Dwight Schultz), a New York Mafia boss, following a failed task to retrieve money for the latter. While hiding in a cemetery bathroom, the Darkness (voiced by Mike Patton), an ancient demonic force that has inhabited his family for several generations, awakens within Jackie and slaughters the remaining mobsters, with the benefit of Jackie becoming the possessor of seemingly unholy demonic abilities that work only in the dark. Using these powers, Jackie proceeds to destroy Paulie's business by killing his biggest drug peddler, Dutch Oven Harry (voiced by Richard Leighton), and burning down the slaughterhouse where he stores his money. In retribution, Paulie and his main enforcer, Captain Eddie Shrote (voiced by Jim Mathers) of the New York City Police Department, kidnap Jackie's girlfriend Jenny Romano (voiced by Lauren Ambrose). They take her to the orphanage where Jackie and Jenny grew up and murder her in front of a powerless Jackie, who is unable to save Jenny due to the Darkness deliberately restraining him.\n\nJackie then commits suicide out of sheer emotional stress, finding himself in the Otherworld, the realm of the Darkness, which is home to patchwork undead beings in World War I outfits fighting each other and physical manifestations of the Four Horsemen. He meets his great-great-grandfather Anthony Estacado (voiced by Kirk Baltz), who reveals that it was he that brought the Darkness into the family and tells Jackie how to free himself of the Darkness by invading the castle in the Otherworld and facing the Darkness there. Jackie is interrupted in his journey through the Otherworld and brought back to the living.\n\nOnce he recovers, Jackie determines that he must dispose of Captain Shrote before he can face Paulie. After failing to kill Shrote at his apartment, Jackie steals a briefcase containing illicit goods in Shrote's ownership from a Turkish bath that is used as a front by his corrupt police officers. Jackie rigs the briefcase with an explosive and sets up a meeting with Shrote at Trinity Church. Jackie heads to the meeting to kill Shrote, but he is instead captured by his men following a shootout. After overhearing about a shipment of drugs that a Chicago mob is entrusting to Paulie to handle from one of Shrote's officers, Jackie triggers the explosive, killing Shrote and his men along with himself. Jackie re-awakes in the Otherworld and lays siege to the Darkness's castle with Anthony's help. Anthony is mortally wounded in the attack, but before he can tell Jackie the last steps needed to free himself from the Darkness, the spirit pulls him away.\n\nJackie faces the Darkness and surprises it by willingly being taken by the Darkness's power, allowing him to fully control the spirit back in the real world. However, the Darkness tells him that while he has control now, each time Jackie takes a life, he will become more consumed by the Darkness. He lays an assault on the drug shipment, causing Paulie to flee to the safety of a lighthouse mansion for fear of retribution from the Chicago mob. Jackie takes advantage of a solar eclipse to raid the mansion and finally kill Paulie. The Darkness revels in Jackie's murderous spree, and fully envelops Jackie.\n\nIn the epilogue, Jackie finds himself in a dream, lying on a park bench in Jenny's arms. Jenny explains that they are only allowed a few minutes to be together one last time to say goodbye. Jackie tries to ask how, but Jenny just quiets him, allowing them to enjoy the last moments together before Jackie wakes back up with the screen fading to black.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Darkness_(video_game)\n\nThe Darkness 2 on the other hand takes you into the New life of Jackie Estacado.","March 21","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here we are again, back together reliving memories of the times we were molested at summer camp.\n\nWait.\n\nOh, we're doing a review?\nWhoops.\nSo, The Darkness II!\nIf you played the first Darkness, you must have been left wanting more. I know I was, especially when Jenny says, "Wake up.", then it cuts the credits. I don't think I've been that anxious since I was waiting on a pregnancy test to show results. The first game was awesome. The elements of free-roam/sandbox the developers so graciously added, the voice acting, the level design and coloring....it was all just so enveloping!\nI personally really like the No Mans Land levels where you were thrown into the war between the Germans and the British - that was some terrifying ♥♥♥♥.\nAll that to say, The Darkness laid excellent ground work for The Darkness 2 with the story, color schemes and voice acting.\n\nUnlike BLOPS 2, TD 2 didn't completely destroy the gameline's reputation. That is to say, unless you're one of those pretentious and picky ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who nitpicks about with the changes in graphics or things like that.\nThe first thing I noticed that I really liked about this game is the slow intro to the main theme of the game. Obviously, it wasn't that slow, since you get ambushed during your dinner with some ladies of the night at some deago food spot within the first 10 or so minutes of the game - BUT - at least the devs eased you into it instead of the begining of TD 1 where your flying through traffic, shooting at people. The steady introduction of the darkness powers and influence was pretty neat, as well.\n\nSo time moves on and I start noticing things like the full axis control of the demon arms and the RIDICULOUS executions you can do and I start to think, "This reminds me of my last relationship".\nThen I think, "Wow, this is really well made!"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/67370/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Download size: Less than 10 gb\nPlay time: About 6 hours for campaign\n\nThe Darkness 2 is based on a popular comic book that I haven’t read, and the first Darkness game never made it to Steam/PC. Fortunately, I found the story strong enough to stand alone so I didn’t feel like I was missing any important backstory. There’s a “previously on the Darkness” cutscene that you can watch upon starting a new game, and there’s actually some “talking head” scenes between game chapters where the protagonist Jackie talks to the player as if he’s narrating his autobiography, so you should be caught up pretty quick.\n\nYou play Jackie Estacado, a kind of Mafia boss who has sworn off using the Darkness, a demonic entity that inhabits his body and gives him superhuman powers at the cost of his soul. Too bad for Jackie, a powerful mysterious group comes to town determined to reclaim the Darkness, which they used to be caretakers for. Since the Darkness can only be given up willingly, the only way for them to get it back is by turning Jackie’s life upside down and torturing him into giving it up. This means war.\n\nThe Darkness 2 is a first person shooter with the gimmick of having 2 Darkness tentacles that you can use to grab objects or slash at enemies with. You can also dual wield many one handed guns, so essentially you have 4 limbs to kill people with (2 guns + 2 tentacles). The Darkness also gives you a few powers that you unlock through purchasing in darkness “shrines” found throughout the world. You get dark essence by killing enemies and finding special artifacts, then spend the essence at the shrines on skills and upgrades. It’s not an open world game, you just find the shrines all over the place along the way. There are 4 skill trees to spend your essence in, but you won’t find enough essence in one playthrough to purchase everything. You’ll need to use the New Game + option and grind for more essence.\n\nOne of the key game elements is the need to destroy light sources (lamps, street lights, etc.) since bright lights will inhibit the Darkness, causing your screen to lens flare out and go black and white. Your powers and Darkness tentacles are also disabled when this happens so if you’re playing one of the higher difficulty levels you need to snipe out lights before you get too close. The Darkness 2 uses a regenerating health system like Gears of War or any of the Modern Warfare games so if you’re taking too much damage, get behind something for a few seconds to recover.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent story with some twisted enemy bosses. The boss battles aren’t spectacular, but you’ll probably really hate those dudes by the time you get to fight them.\n+Pretty good graphics, which kind of remind me of the Borderlands games but with more detail. There are a number of death animations for various ways that you can use the Darkness to execute weakened enemies. The tentacle arm executions can be gruesome.\n+The game has a long co-op campaign called Vendettas, though I have only tried a few of the missions (they run parallel to the single player campaign with 4 new characters). The Vendetta missions have their own bosses and you can build up character specific skill trees with dark essence gathered in multiplayer games.\n\nCons:\n-There are a ton of characters and even though I’ve played through the game twice, I only know the names of 3-4 of them. I’m sure most of them were in the first game so they’re just making appearances in part 2. They aren’t all that important though, so no sweat.\n-The game is very short at under 6 hours for your first playthrough, but this doesn’t include the Vendetta campaign. It means you probably need a co-op partner to get the full experience. For your second/third playthrough (with all your maxed out powers) if you skip the cutscenes you can probably finish the single player campaign in less than 5 hours.\n\nAll in all, the Darkness 2 is a great game and well worth the low price you can find it at. It was even in the $1 tier of a Humble Bundle a few months back so you can probably get it cheap. The game’s highlight is the single player story, and you probably won’t find many people playing multiplayer nowadays.\n","January 28, 2015","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the beginning of the game, the Darkness is dormant within Jackie, the Darkness being a supernatural extension that has transferred itself on the Estacado family line. The story of The Darkness II follows Jackie surviving an assassination attempt in which he awakens the Darkness and hunts down those who attacked him. Unbeknownst to him, someone had set out to kill him or take him alive in order to obtain thd Darkness for themselves. Basically, Jackie uses his resources and his mafia friends to hunt down this group of people, not going to go into to much detail, crazy spoilers on that.\n\nThe plot was pretty good, but a bit repetitive. There wasn't too much of a story arc, as it really is rather straightforward; that is until you start to hallucinate yourself in an asylum and much later in the game, hell. Stuff does get bizarre, such as Jackie hallucinating Jenny while in the middle of missions. Even though the Darkness is making him go mad and wants to believe she's real, he understands that he's not exactly in control of his powers.\n\nWell, anyway, the story was good, but it had it's flaws. Onto the technical side of things, like gameplay. Rather simple as far as shooting goes, you've all probably played FPS games so I'm not gonna bother getting into detail. I do want to talk about the tentacles that extend from Jackie's body. They're awesome. I mean, they're evil, but they're great as weapons. You can slice people apart, hold them in the air and flay them, eat their hearts for health (which by the way does mean there's a health bar), you can also control how you slice based on what direction you swing the right stick in, or if you're using a kb/m, it would be the mouse. Graphics were interesting, they using cel shaders for this one to get that comic book style as the game is based on a series of comics, while the first game went for a more realistic look. There are, at points, where the stuttering was bad, mainly in Jackie's penthouse. Otherwise, the framerates were good. A few other bugs here and there, but not enough to say the game is buggy.\n\nAnyway.\n\n8.3/10\n\nOh, and stay for the post credits scene.","August 14, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can use that essence for new abilities or upgrades.\n\nThis game has an interesting story of Jackie Estecado ( you ) trying to take down a society called "The Brotherhood", who wants The Darkness from you. Jackie is desperate to get her old girlfriend back who was killed by Jackie controlled by Darkness.\n\nThe game also has "Vendettas" mode.

You don't want to get frustrated.\n\nYou should buy this game, if you love slashing and mutilating AND shooting people to complete slush. The Single Player is not  long. If you take your time looking around, it might take 8 to 10 hours. If you speedrun the game, it takes about 3 hours. Achievements are fun. They are easy and bit challenging, they still come eventually. Great voice acting and art-style is lovely.\nThis game was entertaining, I completed it 4 times without even noticing ( because of achivements )\nThis game deserves 9/10\nEDIT: The Darkness II is really linear","July 13, 2014","true","23.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jeroentje13/recommended/67370/","Jeroentje13","Jero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jeroentje13/","543 products in account","The Darkness II is a surprisingly good first-person shooter albeit a bit too basic for my tastes. It's a very linear game with the same old experience points and upgrade system which seems to be how most first-person shooters are doing it nowadays, but at least there are a couple of interesting ideas to save it from monotony.\n\nThe Darkness is based on the comics of the same name. I've unfortunately never read them so I'm not informed enough to make comparisons between it and the video game adaption. I also can't point out any improvements it has made over its predecessor as I don't have any experience with the first game. I'll be treating The Darkness II as its own entity.\n\nSo it's lucky that beginners are offered an optional recap of the first game. No need to play catch-up, to play the game. The Darkness II stars an Italian-American don of the Franchetti crime family, Jackie Estacado. Good ole' Jackie has had some problems ever since his girlfriend, Jenny Romano, died in the last game. On top of that, he wields the Darkness, an entity with a mind of its own that has given him supernatural powers. So everything seems to be going well as he has finally gotten the Darkness under control, but then a secret society randomly shows up to try and take this power away from him. As luck would have it, it turns out Jenny is alive somehow and you'll need The Darkness to save her. AND If that wasn't enough, the main character also suffers from hallucinations which may or may not be real meaning that Jackie was a mental patient this whole time and that all of the first game and some sequences in the second game never even happened to begin with.\n\nSo it's basically your average comic book plot. It's only a bit disjointed as there are certain elements in the story that really don't go anywhere. Like the fact that you're the head of a crime family, but don't do any mafia-related activities and the gang doesn't really seem to be very helpful except for telling you where to go next. Or the fact that you keep having these visions when time is of the utmost importance and really shouldn't be wasted staring at a wall like say during a chase. There are lot of little things like that, but to its credit the game does wrap up very neatly with every loose end connected.... Well mostly...\nI only have two major gripes with the story. One is that the villain is weak. A secret society doesn't sound very interesting to begin with, but their leader fails to impress. You'd think looking like Quasimodo's deformed even uglier cousin would at least make for an intriguing backstory or a good motive, but very little comes of it. Even though he's portrayed as the main villain, he also comes off more as an inconvenience than anything else because his timing really couldn't be worse when it comes to deciding when to steal the Darkness. Secondly, It ends on a cliffhanger and we still haven't seen or heard anything of The Darkness III. The Darkness II came out in 2012 so you can imagine how infuriating it was to see the very last cutscene in the game knowing that they still haven't followed up on it. Sure, there are still the comics, but I don't have easy access to these because I'm a European. Game developers, can you please not end your games like this unless a sequel is guaranteed. Signed, me.\n\nI probably wouldn't have cared a lot about the story if it weren't for the characters. Some of them are very played out with its stereotypical mob characters with the same Italian accents you swear you've heard in ten other games, but it's surprisingly well-acted. Jackie sounds great and you really get the feeling that he really cares about Jennie. In fact, a lot of the characters just sound very human, very convincing if you will. There's a lot of quiet time where characters can develop and reflect on certain events making even the basic grunts a lot more three-dimensional characters than what you would see in most games.\n\nSo like I said the before the game is very basic. You get a very limited amount of guns that you could count on one hand and you've got the standard upgrade system in which you spend your experience points. You can sadly only hold three guns at the time. Two one handed guns you can dual-wield and one two-handed gun like a shotgun or a machine gun. What distinguishes The Darkness II from other first-person shooter is obviously the Darkness itself. For one thing, you control an (adorable?), little, British imp called the Darkling. He's practically invincible, able to revive himself an infinite amount of time and will aid you in battle by distracting mooks by hitting them in their stupid faces and then proceeding to urinate on their burning corpses. With later upgrades, you can even throw him at your enemies and causing him to self-destruct after launch. You also have access to two giant tentactles with mouths that come out of your back. These have a lot of useful abilities making the game a bit more interesting. You can swipe them at your enemies, you can grab certain objects and throw them or use them as your shield or you can perform unique execution animations to gain ammo, health, a shield and meter for a special moves (like fusing your gun with Darkness). These animations can sometimes be annoying because they can be very long and occur in quick successions as you'll need all the health and ammo you can get especially in harder difficulties. This can potentially drag out the game.\n\nThere's also an interesting dynamic going on related to the light. You see, the Darkness is weak against it. If you find yourself subjected to something that can even be vaguely construed as a light source (like say a street light, a cars headlight, Agent 47's bald head or anything that J.J. Abrahams can somehow turn into a lens flare) then you'll be weakened by it. The tentacles and Darkling will disappear, you can't regenerate health and you can even be blinded by it. In the first part of the game, it comes down to mostly being affected by lightbulbs, but later on enemies will actually use the light against you by either carrying gigantic flash lights or just using traps involving the light. I'm also not sure if this was intentional, but sometimes enemies holding light sources will hide behind enemies with shields making them very hard to fight against as you'll need the Darkness to remove said shield. It's a very interesting mechanic to see and I hope it gets fleshed out in further... oh....\n\nMy only real complaint with the game is that it's too easy. I recommend going after the hard difficulty as normal makes the game a bit too boring. I also recommend eventually transitioning to the hardest difficulty "Don". I managed to beat Don in my first playthrough, but it's probably not the best setting for your first time.\n\nThere's also a seperate cooperative campaign called Vendetta which explains a couple of things the main campaign left out. It allows you to play as four different hitmen with unique, but very limited capabilities especially compared to Jackie. It's a bit more boring as the enemies are limited to "guys who shoot at you" and the light is also underused. I suppose it's not too bad when you play it with a buddy, but if not it's a waste of time. The characters on the other hand are very consistent with the main story in the sense that they are once again really good. One of my personal favourites being the Scottish, Football-loving, English-hating Jimmy Wilson voiced by David Shaughnessy. It also has a very diverse cast of characters if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nSo that's all I've got for the Darkness II. It's a surprisingly good game and would have had a lot of potential for future installments if it didn't disappear from everyones radar. If you like simple roller-coaster first-person shooters then I recommend you check this one out. It's a very fun with a really good story and interesting mechanics.","May 25, 2015","true","14.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

This is a prime example of what the Darkness is ripping spines through ♥♥♥♥'s tearing legs apart, impaling them to walls. The list goes on but there is one major negative to be brought to light and that's the fact 2k refuse to create DLC because they didn't get enough sales now what absolute BS is that please anyone that completes or has completed the story knows 2k need to give us more, more blood, more gore, more Jenny and lies and deception (not to forget more co-op play) but sadly no there is not and probably no the Darkness 3.\n\nI hope this little review/rant helped :) thumbs up maybe some day the dlc will be released","May 15, 2015","true","13.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jeroentje13/recommended/67370/","Jeroentje13","Jero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jeroentje13/","543 products in account","The Darkness II is a surprisingly good first-person shooter albeit a bit too basic for my tastes. It's a very linear game with the same old experience points and upgrade system which seems to be how most first-person shooters are doing it nowadays, but at least there are a couple of interesting ideas to save it from monotony.\n\nThe Darkness is based on the comics of the same name. I've unfortunately never read them so I'm not informed enough to make comparisons between it and the video game adaption. I also can't point out any improvements it has made over its predecessor as I don't have any experience with the first game. I'll be treating The Darkness II as its own entity.\n\nSo it's lucky that beginners are offered an optional recap of the first game. No need to play catch-up, to play the game. The Darkness II stars an Italian-American don of the Franchetti crime family, Jackie Estacado. Good ole' Jackie has had some problems ever since his girlfriend, Jenny Romano, died in the last game. On top of that, he wields the Darkness, an entity with a mind of its own that has given him supernatural powers. So everything seems to be going well as he has finally gotten the Darkness under control, but then a secret society randomly shows up to try and take this power away from him. As luck would have it, it turns out Jenny is alive somehow and you'll need The Darkness to save her. AND If that wasn't enough, the main character also suffers from hallucinations which may or may not be real meaning that Jackie was a mental patient this whole time and that all of the first game and some sequences in the second game never even happened to begin with.\n\nSo it's basically your average comic book plot. It's only a bit disjointed as there are certain elements in the story that really don't go anywhere. Like the fact that you're the head of a crime family, but don't do any mafia-related activities and the gang doesn't really seem to be very helpful except for telling you where to go next. Or the fact that you keep having these visions when time is of the utmost importance and really shouldn't be wasted staring at a wall like say during a chase. There are lot of little things like that, but to its credit the game does wrap up very neatly with every loose end connected.... Well mostly...\nI only have two major gripes with the story. One is that the villain is weak. A secret society doesn't sound very interesting to begin with, but their leader fails to impress. You'd think looking like Quasimodo's deformed even uglier cousin would at least make for an intriguing backstory or a good motive, but very little comes of it. Even though he's portrayed as the main villain, he also comes off more as an inconvenience than anything else because his timing really couldn't be worse when it comes to deciding when to steal the Darkness. Secondly, It ends on a cliffhanger and we still haven't seen or heard anything of The Darkness III. The Darkness II came out in 2012 so you can imagine how infuriating it was to see the very last cutscene in the game knowing that they still haven't followed up on it. Sure, there are still the comics, but I don't have easy access to these because I'm a European. Game developers, can you please not end your games like this unless a sequel is guaranteed. Signed, me.\n\nI probably wouldn't have cared a lot about the story if it weren't for the characters. Some of them are very played out with its stereotypical mob characters with the same Italian accents you swear you've heard in ten other games, but it's surprisingly well-acted. Jackie sounds great and you really get the feeling that he really cares about Jennie. In fact, a lot of the characters just sound very human, very convincing if you will. There's a lot of quiet time where characters can develop and reflect on certain events making even the basic grunts a lot more three-dimensional characters than what you would see in most games.\n\nSo like I said the before the game is very basic. You get a very limited amount of guns that you could count on one hand and you've got the standard upgrade system in which you spend your experience points. You can sadly only hold three guns at the time. Two one handed guns you can dual-wield and one two-handed gun like a shotgun or a machine gun. What distinguishes The Darkness II from other first-person shooter is obviously the Darkness itself. For one thing, you control an (adorable?), little, British imp called the Darkling. He's practically invincible, able to revive himself an infinite amount of time and will aid you in battle by distracting mooks by hitting them in their stupid faces and then proceeding to urinate on their burning corpses. With later upgrades, you can even throw him at your enemies and causing him to self-destruct after launch. You also have access to two giant tentactles with mouths that come out of your back. These have a lot of useful abilities making the game a bit more interesting. You can swipe them at your enemies, you can grab certain objects and throw them or use them as your shield or you can perform unique execution animations to gain ammo, health, a shield and meter for a special moves (like fusing your gun with Darkness). These animations can sometimes be annoying because they can be very long and occur in quick successions as you'll need all the health and ammo you can get especially in harder difficulties. This can potentially drag out the game.\n\nThere's also an interesting dynamic going on related to the light. You see, the Darkness is weak against it. If you find yourself subjected to something that can even be vaguely construed as a light source (like say a street light, a cars headlight, Agent 47's bald head or anything that J.J. Abrahams can somehow turn into a lens flare) then you'll be weakened by it. The tentacles and Darkling will disappear, you can't regenerate health and you can even be blinded by it. In the first part of the game, it comes down to mostly being affected by lightbulbs, but later on enemies will actually use the light against you by either carrying gigantic flash lights or just using traps involving the light. I'm also not sure if this was intentional, but sometimes enemies holding light sources will hide behind enemies with shields making them very hard to fight against as you'll need the Darkness to remove said shield. It's a very interesting mechanic to see and I hope it gets fleshed out in further... oh....\n\nMy only real complaint with the game is that it's too easy. I recommend going after the hard difficulty as normal makes the game a bit too boring. I also recommend eventually transitioning to the hardest difficulty "Don". I managed to beat Don in my first playthrough, but it's probably not the best setting for your first time.\n\nThere's also a seperate cooperative campaign called Vendetta which explains a couple of things the main campaign left out.

It's a bit more boring as the enemies are limited to "guys who shoot at you" and the light is also underused.

Well then this might be the game for you.\n\nThis is an awesome first person shooter. The gameplay is top-notch, responsive and heart pounding. Each of the guns that you can acquire really packs a punch and you get to see the joy on your enemies faces as you literally blow them away with furious anger and harsh language.\n\nOf course the huge arsenal is not the main attraction of this game. That comes in the form of your two tentacle friends and the terrible powers they grant you. First off the tentacles themselves really pack a punch allowing you to execute some very gruesome and disgusting executions; I think there are at least ten, all of which look really cool… If you happen to be a sadist, which we all are. Then there are the powers, eating hearts to gain health, rapid fire explosive bullets and lobbing black holes just to name a few. You will have a ton of fun tearing your way through the city.\n\nThe creators were going for an art style that was reminiscent of a graphic novel and they really hit the nail on the head. The game is beautiful in its own dark way. The environments were nothing too special but each one had its own feel and lent to the overall bleak atmosphere. As for the story, it was pretty good, nothing too amazing but it allowed the player to exact bloody vengeance and tug at the heart strings as well.\n\nBesides the main single player campaign, which only lasts a few hours, there is also a second game mode that can be undertaken in single or multiplayer. In it you get to play as one of four new characters all with their own dark weapons and powers. It added a lot more longevity to the title and with the unique storyline it is well worth a play. I had a go with all the characters to see which one suited me best before blasting my way through everyone who looked at me funny.\n\nThis game is awesome and frankly it is very underrated. If you pick this up you will find a very enjoyable and bombastic adventure that will have you want to play through a couple times. Even at full price it’s a good title but on sale you would be mad not to pick it up.\n\nHave fun  ^_^\n","May 18, 2015","true","30.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The gameplay is fast and engaging , cuting and gunning down hordes of goons while also executing them with your 'Creeping Dark' power is extremly satisfying and brutal at the same time. The story and the game is fairly linear although you have the freedom to upgrade your skills as you want. There is also a fully flesh out Co-op (up to 4 people) campaign with uniqe character/powers which story is follow closely the main campaigns story (Sadly , no one is playing online anymore so you need a friend for this or you could play it alone as well). This game is not for the faint hearted , thats for sure. - Highly Recommended","February 24","true","7.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The result is a masterpiece, placing it as the best game of 2012 for me.\n\nYou control Jackie Estacado, a mafia lord who has the power of Darkness itself. The atmosphere of the game and graphics really makes the world vibrant, while the characters are all amazing. From the dialogue to the story, it goes beyond just being solid and keeps you in the whole thing through. A must experience.\n\nGameplay wise is shines just as well. You can control the darkness, represented by 2 serpent heads, through your mouse and keyboard. Between grabbing enemies, blowing them away, beating them down, throwing them, or performing the gruesome finishers you always feel like it's a fun experience. You start off feeling like a god and progress to the more difficult enemies. It works out really well.\n\nThe biggest downside to the game is that it's very short. You can beat the main campaign in a few hours, but you'll end up going through it a couple of times for the fun achievements and maxing out all of the ability trees that carry over to New Game+. You can play in side missions with other characters that lets you experience a parallel story (ie, While Jackie was doing so and so, these guys were doing this to help). They also have dark powers that are all unique. This can be played in single player on lower difficulties or in co-op on higher. The story is the same for all of them, but it's still a great additional mode.\n\nWhile this game has multiplayer, in my opinion it shines best as a single player experience. The weapons are fun, the enemies are great, the storyline is a masterpiece and the game looks and feels amazing. It's something I feel everyone owes it to themselves to get. The only gripe I could have is that there's no announced sequel or dlc. 10/10 - Get it. It goes on sale for such a low price that it should be a sin not to pick up a copy.","July 20, 2013","true","23.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","4"

Playing as Jackie Estacado, head of a mob family you weild the power of the darkness to tear your way through your enemies in pursuit of the culprits behind a sudden attack at a resturant. It may sound like your typical mob family story, but its anything but. Not to mention this game has probably one of my favourite sidekicks of all damn time.\n\nThis game throws guns at you to use at yoru disposale but let me tell you this, you should rarely be using them as a primary weapon, with the power of the darkness which takes form as two demon serpents which you control as you see fit, you can brutally rip your enemies, pull their spines through their *ss and eat their hearts out, why would you use a gun.\n\nThe gameplay and combat is smooth and at later parts of the game really require you to use your surroundings to your advantage. No matter what difficulty you play on there will be that challenge and that satisfaction of your success.\n\nNow thats not to say this game is without its flaws. The voice of the 'darkness' tries to sound menacing but in all reality, its a little bit dull for a voice you expect the ultimate evil to have. On top of this you can't use your demonic powers in the light, which is a nice touch, but when your getting constantly told by the darkness to 'stay away from the light', especially in places where it can't be helped, it gets really, REALLY annoying.\n\nI also encountered a couple of times where I couldn't actually activate a button or trigger an event because the prompt wouldn't show up, I fixed it by restarting the checkpoints but it took several attempts.\n\nSo yes, a fantastic game coupled with fluant gameplay/combat mixed in with an intruiging, albeit irritating ally, the Darkness II is well worth its price. Best part is though? Its only a dollar on humble bundle right now so there is no excuse not to give this a try.","July 10, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apples90/recommended/67370/","apples90","Appz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apples90/","281 products in account","I'll give the developers credit for one thing. The combat mechanics have been vastly improved over the original Darkness game. Everything else however, is a massive disappointment. The original game had an amazing atmosphere and style. It didn't just apply cell shading in a cheap attempt to make it feel more like the comic. Oddly enough, some of the best moments in the original were when nothing was really happening. Sitting down to watch a movie with Jackie's girlfriend, reuniting an old couple in the subway hubworld, or even spotting an old Warner Bros. cartoon on a TV in game. Sadly moments like that are no where to be found in The Darkness 2. Tossing those moments aside, developer Digital Extremes have gone as far as axing most of the original voice cast, with the exception of Mike Patton, who still delivers an amazing performance as The Darkness entity.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, The Darkness 2 is pretty much another mindless shooter with a Darkness paint job. It's a really good paint job mind you, it's just missing all those things that made the original game special. So if you, like me, have a lot of love for the original. You're probably not going to find what you're looking for here. For those who just want another gore ridden corridor shooter, there are better alternatives, Painkiller: Hell and Damnation for example.\n\nCan't recommend this game.

You're never pitted against female enemies though, I don't think, if so they're treated exactly the same as men; if there HAD been women antagonists, the kinds of things these demon arms would do to them would no doubt get the game banned. Its a double standard that I'd think about when I wasn't doing all kinds of crazy demonic ♥♥♥♥, the story was fairly predictable so the mind would wander sometimes ^^\n\nAs an aside that has nothing to do with gameplay, the guy you play as seems a perfect balance between caring family guy and viscious monster.....granted, its pretty clear that Jackie Estacado is NOT a good guy, but has redeeming qualities (not unlike past GTA protagonists) to keep him palatable to the masses; given the nature of the circumstances your character has been through, honestly I think it would be more fitting if your guy was THE bad guy, and somewhere out there "the good guy" was always trying to stop you. This game STARTED to do that but then the "good guy" in this scenario is just as evil as The Darkness. Again, I reiterate, one of the executions involves anal ♥♥♥♥, and the source of your powers is basically Unicron or something, an entity from before time begins that, along with its opposite, provides some sorta balance toBLAHBLAHBLAH a dude with demon snakes coming out his ♥♥♥ is not a guy who cries over his dead girlfriend, I'm just saying...its not a criticism so much as a preference though, there are reasons both in the comics and in the first game for Jackie to be the man he is. I just think it'd be interesting to take it in a Prototype-kind of direction where Jackie is less human than monster (in lack of a better term). He's already kinda there anyway, especially given the game's ending. Besides a theme across both games and the comics (which feature separate but similar story arcs) is the question: does The Dartkness controll Jackie or does Jackie control The Darkness, he's hardly a hero and thus there's no real need for him to be triumphant.\n\nMore likely though, I sense that if they do make a third game, Jackie will most likely be the antagonist, the setup for that twist is already in place.","August 2, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This Co. used to be part of Sega, and that quality shows, the game looks, sounds, plays, and runs awesome, PLUS unlike lots of games it is FUN to play.\n\nPersonally I purchased this game because I know 2K games don't make junk, AND because I wanted to play the online 4 player mode, and it's UTTERLY cool, but I was so suprised by the story mode that I'll surely finish that too. The online "Vendetta" modes are great, if you pick the story 1, it's like playing through Saints Row IV (don't hate Me), with the most stereotyped 4 chars from Saints Row 2 (ALL good things), in a city that's cool, and realistic looking, you can revive your team-mates if they die, you get powers, and buffs you purchase with skillpoints you gain from killing mobs, the mobs and feal of the game is also reminding Me of the latest Devil May Cry game, Yes the Co-Op modes are short, but if you turn the difficulty up they last longer, & gives you a better sense of accomplishment.\n\nPersonally I hate the "We're to lazy to make a conformant texture clamp that works well on the player model skins, so We CARTOON-OUTLINED them", but it's only on the player skins, and not the world, so you hardly notice, The contrast is so high it'll make your eyes bleed with the awesome job they did on the lighting, & overall feel/look of the game. It'll run on any old PC, and even looks good with everything turned on low, in the lowest rez. So If you like games to just chill awhile, N blast through a Co-Op that ROCKS, or a cool story mode that's VERY entertaining, this game's worth it at normal price, so get it on sale ☺","December 13, 2013","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You're never pitted against female enemies though, I don't think, if so they're treated exactly the same as men; if there HAD been women antagonists, the kinds of things these demon arms would do to them would no doubt get the game banned. Its a double standard that I'd think about when I wasn't doing all kinds of crazy demonic ♥♥♥♥, the story was fairly predictable so the mind would wander sometimes ^^\n\nAs an aside that has nothing to do with gameplay, the guy you play as seems a perfect balance between caring family guy and viscious monster.....granted, its pretty clear that Jackie Estacado is NOT a good guy, but has redeeming qualities (not unlike past GTA protagonists) to keep him palatable to the masses; given the nature of the circumstances your character has been through, honestly I think it would be more fitting if your guy was THE bad guy, and somewhere out there "the good guy" was always trying to stop you. This game STARTED to do that but then the "good guy" in this scenario is just as evil as The Darkness. Again, I reiterate, one of the executions involves anal ♥♥♥♥, and the source of your powers is basically Unicron or something, an entity from before time begins that, along with its opposite, provides some sorta balance toBLAHBLAHBLAH a dude with demon snakes coming out his ♥♥♥ is not a guy who cries over his dead girlfriend, I'm just saying...its not a criticism so much as a preference though, there are reasons both in the comics and in the first game for Jackie to be the man he is. I just think it'd be interesting to take it in a Prototype-kind of direction where Jackie is less human than monster (in lack of a better term). He's already kinda there anyway, especially given the game's ending. Besides a theme across both games and the comics (which feature separate but similar story arcs) is the question: does The Dartkness controll Jackie or does Jackie control The Darkness, he's hardly a hero and thus there's no real need for him to be triumphant.\n\nMore likely though, I sense that if they do make a third game, Jackie will most likely be the antagonist, the setup for that twist is already in place.","August 2, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This Co. used to be part of Sega, and that quality shows, the game looks, sounds, plays, and runs awesome, PLUS unlike lots of games it is FUN to play.\n\nPersonally I purchased this game because I know 2K games don't make junk, AND because I wanted to play the online 4 player mode, and it's UTTERLY cool, but I was so suprised by the story mode that I'll surely finish that too. The online "Vendetta" modes are great, if you pick the story 1, it's like playing through Saints Row IV (don't hate Me), with the most stereotyped 4 chars from Saints Row 2 (ALL good things), in a city that's cool, and realistic looking, you can revive your team-mates if they die, you get powers, and buffs you purchase with skillpoints you gain from killing mobs, the mobs and feal of the game is also reminding Me of the latest Devil May Cry game, Yes the Co-Op modes are short, but if you turn the difficulty up they last longer, & gives you a better sense of accomplishment.\n\nPersonally I hate the "We're to lazy to make a conformant texture clamp that works well on the player model skins, so We CARTOON-OUTLINED them", but it's only on the player skins, and not the world, so you hardly notice, The contrast is so high it'll make your eyes bleed with the awesome job they did on the lighting, & overall feel/look of the game. It'll run on any old PC, and even looks good with everything turned on low, in the lowest rez. So If you like games to just chill awhile, N blast through a Co-Op that ROCKS, or a cool story mode that's VERY entertaining, this game's worth it at normal price, so get it on sale ☺","December 13, 2013","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My only problem with the game is the bullet sponge enemies towards the end of the game that are very annoying to fight because it takes more then 10 headshots to bring them down. I also often found myself running out of ammo in a lot of situations it breaks the fast paced flow of the shooting because you are constantly looking for more ammo and looking at the ground for a weapon to switch it can get pretty frustrating expecially on the harder difficulties. The game is short and linear but it works in it's favour, its well handled.\n8/10 (Great)","February 11","true","5.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninivanna/recommended/67370/","ninivanna","Vanna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninivanna/","851 products in account","This game it is not a complete disaster, even though I do not personally recommend it.\nIt's not recommended only if you've played the original The Darkness on console.\n\nIn any case: this is what I call a missed opportunity. The Darkness II tries to continue the adventures of the unlucky Jackie Estacado, tormented by the death of his girlfriend Jenny, with The Darkness itself to spice the things up.\nAs written in the comic books, Jackie is the carrier of an antique evil force that humans passed on from generations to generations constantly fighting its counterpart, the Light. In this chapter we'll se a mysterious cult who is pursuing him to steal his mystical power. Unfortunately, the plot is the weakest part of the experience, and it is a shame, because the gameplay is satisfying. Being the Darkness is a good experience, you can feel like an overpowered creature who can slaughter and kill everything it breathes. Although there are few powers that  you can play with, they're fun to use. Also the environment interaction is pretty good, in fact you can take various object with your demonic limb and throw them to your foes with enjoyable and squishy results. The game encourages you to do so in many different ways, as you can earn Dark Essence (XP) to unlock powers and abilities.\nThe gunplay instead, it's sufficient: no recoil, the weapons sound and feel all over the same. The only difference you can tell about them is the fire ratio. It suffers from the modern FPS syndrome: high difficulty = enemies have lots of health points, so going further with the game usually is just trying and failing with a poor challenge. At least there's not regenerating health because you have to eat hearts from dead enemies in order to replenish it.\nThere is also a limited multiplayer coop mode with 4 characters to choose from with different skills and abilities, but it adds nothing to the experience, it's just another excuse to shoot everything. Maybe this mode was built in order to extend the game length, because the singleplayer campaign is very short (about 6 hours).\n\nDo yourself a favor: if you own a PS3 or Xbox360 go and grab a copy of the first game. You won't be disappointed.","April 12","false","14.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

This game is a flawless console port and it runs great.

The only negitive thing I can think of is that it's linear, but I don't mind at all. This is how to do a single player first person shooter.

The visual style. Depending on your preference this is either a good or a bad thing. Personally, I preferred the more realistic style in the first game, it just made it feel much darker and gritty (which is what you'd expect out of a game called "The Darkness"). I can see why they did it, as the franchise is based on a comic.\n2.) The music. Remember the epic metal-orchestral soundtrack that featured when you were ripping everything apart? Well, that's not there any more. Compare this: http://youtu.be/-JWZAqza27E with this: http://youtu.be/6OE4oDR3K5U and you'll get what I mean. It's good, but it just doesn't have enough "oomf" behind it for my liking.\n3.) Very linear. The pseudo-free-roam that was present in the first game is gone too, everything narrows you down a linear path. Sure there are some "choices" that you make that effect some things, but that's pretty much it.\nIn summary: fun gameplay, iffy style.","July 13, 2012","true","7.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Looking totally different this time trying to get the look, touch and style of the comic books. This time you can use your darkness tentacles for much better use and with superior combat. Game rides an interesting story but it doesn't out do the original's though. Keeps up the top-notch voice acting from the original, introducing new voice actors or voices from the original voice actors. This game had quite a decent bit of replayability. A pretty decent co-op campaign, vendettas and hitlists. The only thing that let's this down is it's generally short campaign, though it's not that bad "6-7 hours" but with the co-op campaigns it adds "3-4 hours" so altogether it's around "9-11" hours which is not bad at all. This game was so much kickass fun, I just have to reccommend it. This and the original are some of my favorite games of all time.

That being said, my time with it was a joy in both multiplayer and singleplayer.  Dodging the light to stay in the darkness is an interesting and unique mechanic.  The fact that you essentially have another arm with your darkness powers adds a layer of depth(you can duel weild guns while holding a shield with the darkness).  It's a gruesome game and you feel like a dark god of vengence as you go through it, you feel powerful but challenged which is an interesting blend.  You have to eat hearts with the tentacles for health but it doesn't impede your movement in any way, just a cool thing to watch the tentacle reach out and do it while you are shooting.  Oh and your guy is a good guy.  One of the main detractors that kept me from buying the game for a long time was I thought he was this super evil guy that was just killing people for fun, he's a good guy that is getting revenge, like the punisher or max payne. Overall great game.","July 19, 2014","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At the time of writing I have 8 hours play time and I've finished the storyline which shows how short of a game it is, especially since I didn't rush it.\nThe only two issues I have with this game as a whole are that (again) the storyline is extremely short and that it is relatively easy. I played through the game on the second highest difficulty and I encountered no problems with any levels. The game is extremely gorey which I personally didn't find an issue but it won't be to some people's tastes.\nHowever the gameplay is solid and the story is brilliant with plenty of depth and makes you want to continue playing to find out more.\n9/10, would strongly recommend (also remember to watch right to the end of the credits, there's an extra clip that adds a lot to the story)","July 17, 2014","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a game that's linear and typical in terms of envrionment design, but oh so fun to play when it comes to story and gameplay.\n\nThe Darkness is the ultimate weapon, you can use it to melee, grab, and literally tear apart enemies. I love the idea of relying on the dark to access the darkness abilities. You can upgrade your powers using points gathered through kills and finding collectibles. The weapons are awesome, quite a few to choose from and they all sound great and make a great addition to the darkness powers.\n\nThere are several choices throughout the story as well. The character animations bring the characters to life and the enemies act like living breathing people rather than dull AI that just tries to kill you.\n\nThe cell shaded graphics are something I'm not a fan of, but they still pull off a good looking game world.\n\nOnly two things I don't like about The Darknesss ll:\n\n1.) The small scale levels.\n2.) Its short single player campaign.","April 6, 2012","true","15.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story of Darkness 2 pulls you in very quickly. The cut scenes are in first person, so you feel like you’re right there in the middle of everything. I truly did want to progress in the game because of how involved I got with the plot.\n\nI will preface this review by saying I would VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING A XBOX 360 CONTROLLER More on that later…\n\nLet’s start with gameplay. Being able to control 2 guns and 2 deadly serpents attached at your shoulders at the same time makes for some killer combos and devastating enemy deaths. The game is very brutal with serpent deaths. Tearing off heads and ripping in half is just a taste. Being that the game is called Darkness, you need to stay in the shadows as the light will disable your serpents and make it difficult to see to fire on your enemies. This effect is truly disabling and you will not survive fighting in the light for long. You can collect various amounts of essence by killing enemies which you can trade in for various skills that will improve your character. There is a “skill reset” option so in case you find some skills are not good, you can reset everything for a small essence fee.\n\nGraphics and environments are stylized and really nicely done. It’s a split between comic book and real looking graphics. It fits right in with the story.\n\nSound and voice acting are top notch. The Italian mob voices are fantastic and each character is unique. It was always a pleasure to hear dialogue back and forth between everyone. This game has a lot going on for in-game sound. It does get fairly noisy at times but that’s just an observation, not a complaint.\n\nControls…they take getting used to. I tried this game using a mouse and keyboard but I found myself struggling. Switching to a 360 controller instantly corrected everything BUT the learning curve is still moderate. Stick with it and it’ll eventually become pretty natural.\n\nStability and FPS are rock solid. Never crashed once on Windows 8.1 and got a solid 60fps throughout the game.\n\nCorrect blurry view bug\nMany times during the game my view would become slightly blurry. Like the game forgot to reset back the focus. The simple fix when that happens was to take a screenshot. It fixed it instantly each time. It did get annoying as sometimes it would happen during intense battles and I’d have to take a second to reach the screenshot key.\n\nPros\n+Graphics, environment, story, gameplay and sound are all very well done\n+Solid 60fps\n+Brutal enemy deaths\n+Solid variety of enemies\n+Slight replay value with new game +\n+Vendetta missions\n\nCons\n+Controls take getting used to (use 360 controller)\n+Shouldn’t be so many unbreakable lights.\n+Some erratic graphical glitches throughout the game. But didn’t take away from anything\n+Combat can get somewhat boring\n+Darkling and Darkness tips can be repetitive\n\nBottom line is that Darkness 2 is a great and seemingly underrated game.\n\nFinal Score:\n7.5/10","May 3, 2015","true","17.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And by 'special skills,' I am of course referring to the ancient demonic entity that lives within his body.\n\nBut when a bunch of cultists show up and try to steal the power away from him (because if an ordinary guy can use it to become king of the Mafia, imagine what someone with actual ambition could do with it), Jackie must use his eldritch abilities, and a veritable ♥♥♥♥load of increasingly large guns, to defend himself and prevent the power from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nI'll be honest, I was surprised by how much I liked this game. I picked it up expecting a standard shooter with a vaguely gothic design aesthetic. What I wasn't expecting was a genuinely inventive and unique game with solid gameplay and some smart ideas bubbling under the surface. There are some very creative moments throughout the campaign, first as Jackie explores some strange locations, and then later when the demonic presence starts to drive him insane. The ending also qualifies for the 'Holy ♥♥♥♥ing Christ' award of totally unexpected story turns.\n\nThe gameplay is the standard gory shooter, but with the twist of dark and brutal abilities. You have two demonic tentacles which can pick up and throw things independant of your two gun-hands, which led to several situations where I was fighting two battles at once- a mid-range skirmish with a pair of SMGs, and also a long-range stand-off in which I was lobbing sharp objects and spikes at snipers.\n\nYou also get health by eating hearts that you tear out of dead bodies, which means the only way to get your way out of a tight spot is to use progressively riskier tactics to kill enemies and regain the upper hand.\n\nOverall, it's a surprisingly enjoyable game with some creative uses of mechanics to craft a campaign that is not only fun to play, but fun as an experience.\nFinal score: 8/10.","February 13","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I opened the game with kind of low expectations because it just look liked Hatred with a bit more of a story behind it with demons and ♥♥♥♥.  Little did I know that I would be hearing a lot of familiar voices from Mafia II.  I'll start it off by talking a bit about the controls in this game, I assume the game was meant to be operated with a controller because the attacking with darkness via the mouse is very clunky, but not clunky to the point that the game is made easy, otherwise it controls like a typical FPS.  The integration of The Darkness made the gameplay more interesting than the typical FPS luckily.  The graphics aren't even bad considering the 2012 release period.  Getting more into the story element part of the review, I have to say that the storyline took me a bit by surprise, it's not as emotional as it could be given the situation but otherwise the dialogue is well written and is even at some parts, humorous.  The little sidekick you get is probably one of my favorite parts of the game, aside from the intense gore which isn't even really that intense but it's definitely what drove me through the game.  One part in particular which is after you finish killing a boss.  Now to the one but small point that kind of bothered me, turns out this game is super short.  I beat the whole main story in one hour, there is side coop stuff you can do with friends and ♥♥♥♥ but I, a friendless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, really don't care about that now do I?  Eh small complaint, still a good game worth checking out.","February 1","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The writing is absolutely excellent, though almost entirely skippable (as I do so often appreciate), the graphics look much like a comic book, a la borderlands, and the gameplay feels good.\n\nI only have three real gripes with the game.\nFirstly, and most importantly: the game ends on a cliffhanger, and a sequel is entirely unconfirmed. One can hope that there is one in development, but it's equally probable that The Darkness III is an "HL3 confirmed!" situation.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay feels good, but isn't exactly mind-blowing. The game isn't long enough for you to unlock all of the different skills in the available skilltrees, so you never really get to experience all the different powers in one playthrough. The gunplay is satisfying, but repetetive. The Darkness powers are awesome, but repetetive. The game is around six hours long, and thank god for it.\n\nThirdly, and most importantly, the game has some hardcore vsync bugs. If vsync is turned off (as I like it,) you can sometimes get stuck in vents. If this happens, you just flick it on and off, of course, but having to go through menus just to pass through a door is obnoxious to say the least.\n\nAll things considered, buy this game on sale for six dollars like I did. It's more than worth the six hours you'll get out of it, and you'll thoroughly enjoy them. The game may not blow you away, but you'll have fun nonetheless.\n\nFinal Score: 7.5/10\nLetter Grade: C\nVerdict: Worth slightly more than a "Venti Caramel Frappucino, extra caramel, and make it snappy, I have places to be in my pathetic, meaningless existence full of poor patronage and fake milkshakey coffee."","April 4, 2015","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As most of you know, the first Darkness was an Xbox 360 exclusive and never came to PC but was a pretty good title. The Darkness II came out maybe four years afterwards? I'm not sure. Review away!\n\nThe game starts out not ♥♥♥♥ing around, an instant shootout from nowhere, albeit it's an on-a-rail segment. Then the villain comes into play. The antagonist is not all that interesting, just a random hobo that seems to run a worldwide secret society hellbent on taking Jackie's special ability.

If you have 6 hours to kill and this is the only thing between you and boredom... and you've finished mirrors edge 3 times.. and the walls in your house have all dried.. its plausible that this is worth it during a 75% off sale.\n\n*Spoilers*\n\nIf your looking for a game like the first one.. go get a bunch of gangsters to hammer in your head till you forget anything about the first one and replay that because the concept of hell in this game is unimaginative and come across more like "Dante's cousin Jeff's playground of slate next to the doctors" rather than the war torn never ending torture of "Dante's Inferno" the first showed us. Emotional connections in the game cease to inpsire and while torture scenes of the first evoke feelings of empathy and terror as you fight your way out, the recent equivalent is a long dialog with a crap single button quicktime event.\n\nIn summary, if this was a free DLC to finish off the last part of the first game.. i wouldn't download it because it would have completely ruined the imagination that was poured into the first.","August 24, 2014","false","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And by 'special skills,' I am of course referring to the ancient demonic entity that lives within his body.\n\nBut when a bunch of cultists show up and try to steal the power away from him (because if an ordinary guy can use it to become king of the Mafia, imagine what someone with actual ambition could do with it), Jackie must use his eldritch abilities, and a veritable ♥♥♥♥load of increasingly large guns, to defend himself and prevent the power from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nI'll be honest, I was surprised by how much I liked this game. I picked it up expecting a standard shooter with a vaguely gothic design aesthetic. What I wasn't expecting was a genuinely inventive and unique game with solid gameplay and some smart ideas bubbling under the surface. There are some very creative moments throughout the campaign, first as Jackie explores some strange locations, and then later when the demonic presence starts to drive him insane. The ending also qualifies for the 'Holy ♥♥♥♥ing Christ' award of totally unexpected story turns.\n\nThe gameplay is the standard gory shooter, but with the twist of dark and brutal abilities. You have two demonic tentacles which can pick up and throw things independant of your two gun-hands, which led to several situations where I was fighting two battles at once- a mid-range skirmish with a pair of SMGs, and also a long-range stand-off in which I was lobbing sharp objects and spikes at snipers.\n\nYou also get health by eating hearts that you tear out of dead bodies, which means the only way to get your way out of a tight spot is to use progressively riskier tactics to kill enemies and regain the upper hand.\n\nOverall, it's a surprisingly enjoyable game with some creative uses of mechanics to craft a campaign that is not only fun to play, but fun as an experience.\nFinal score: 8/10.","February 13","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The writing is absolutely excellent, though almost entirely skippable (as I do so often appreciate), the graphics look much like a comic book, a la borderlands, and the gameplay feels good.\n\nI only have three real gripes with the game.\nFirstly, and most importantly: the game ends on a cliffhanger, and a sequel is entirely unconfirmed. One can hope that there is one in development, but it's equally probable that The Darkness III is an "HL3 confirmed!" situation.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay feels good, but isn't exactly mind-blowing. The game isn't long enough for you to unlock all of the different skills in the available skilltrees, so you never really get to experience all the different powers in one playthrough. The gunplay is satisfying, but repetetive. The Darkness powers are awesome, but repetetive. The game is around six hours long, and thank god for it.\n\nThirdly, and most importantly, the game has some hardcore vsync bugs. If vsync is turned off (as I like it,) you can sometimes get stuck in vents. If this happens, you just flick it on and off, of course, but having to go through menus just to pass through a door is obnoxious to say the least.\n\nAll things considered, buy this game on sale for six dollars like I did. It's more than worth the six hours you'll get out of it, and you'll thoroughly enjoy them. The game may not blow you away, but you'll have fun nonetheless.\n\nFinal Score: 7.5/10\nLetter Grade: C\nVerdict: Worth slightly more than a "Venti Caramel Frappucino, extra caramel, and make it snappy, I have places to be in my pathetic, meaningless existence full of poor patronage and fake milkshakey coffee."","April 4, 2015","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And there was those creepy lookin' guys there: all dressed up in black, huge guys, I didn't know'em, but I knew they was hitmen of some sorts. With tatoos all over the place and some wicked cross upside down I could see one the sleeve of one of em. I knew the other guys saw 'em, too and THEY saw us. I had no idea man, they was watchin' us all the time and we was gettin' ready for a fight. And they sure as hell would bring one down on us.\n\nThe priest goin all fire and brimstone today. Like hell wasn't a made up story to keep us in line, but a REAL place, where each of us could end up. Finally we were gettin up for singin when all of a sudden BOOM! the church doors crashed open! Next thing you know some crazy hail of bullets was rainin all over the place! And before anyone had any ♥♥♥♥in' clue what the crap was goin on, those huge guys, they was droppin' like flys. Just like that! They went down like rocks in the river. So we thought it was some kind of hitman, you know, from another family, crashin the party. But then I saw IT!\n\nAll of us was takin cover behind the curch benches and between the screamin deaths of two of those giants there was some...some kind of tentacle, a snake, hell I don't know. It had glowin' eyes! Black skin and big ♥♥♥♥in teeth! And it was rippin them apart like some crazy anaconda-cobra from hell. I thought I was goin crazy. Everyone was screamin, like their ♥♥♥♥in soul was on the line! The priest shouted: "IT IS SATAN! IT IS SATAN!"\n\nThen Rodrigo got hit! I was tryin to get to him, but out of nowhere the whole room got filled with one mean swarm of ♥♥♥♥ed up bugs. Huge, disgusting monsterbugs! Everyone got stung and stunned. And then...this THING jumped on Johnnys back! Poundin him like a ragin gorilla. Laughin while it did it. First thing I did as soon as I could move again was runnin for my god damn life! I crawled and hid behind the altar. The priest was dead: lied there in his own blood, the robe  wrapped around his shredded face. I looked for side exits, or a ladder, anything! But then...then IT jumped right at the altar!! I tried to scream, but couldn't. It was a demon, a fallen angel, a beast, it was...THE DARKNESS!!\n\nAs I was gettin ready to die, I screamed: "WHAT ARE YOU!?" Deadcertain those would be my last words. But then, out of this cloud, appeared a face! It was a man...! And all cool, like death itself, he said with a smooth voice: "I...am the hero! And you will not die today." I was starin in his face, unable to say a single word. Suddenly I could hear another boomin voice, like it was in my own god damn head, I thought it came from his tentacles. And they raged: "WE WANT ITS HEART! FEED US! FEED US ITS HEART!" And that was when I passed out into a pitchblack abyss, knowing for sure I would never return from it.\n\n\nSo...would I recommend this game?

As most of you know, the first Darkness was an Xbox 360 exclusive and never came to PC but was a pretty good title. The Darkness II came out maybe four years afterwards? I'm not sure. Review away!\n\nThe game starts out not ♥♥♥♥ing around, an instant shootout from nowhere, albeit it's an on-a-rail segment. Then the villain comes into play.

Guns and shadowy demons? That sounds awesome, and it was.\n\nThe Darkness 2 is a hallway shooter but with a twist--you've got the power of Hell on your side! And the story keeps you interested the whole way through--especially the characters. The voice acting and writing is on point. From the first cutscene, I was hooked. From the first firefight, I was having fun and enjoying this game.\n\nYou shoot guns--quite a few, actually. You use demony magic to fight bad guys. You upgrade your weapons and powers which is fun and satisfying when you learn a new ability and become more effective at killing.\n\nThe boss fights are fun, the combat is solid, the story is great. If you love to shoot guns, want a solid story, and like to just see chaos and gore, The Darkness is for you.\n\nThe game is a bit short, and it ends on a cliff-hanger, and there are a few "Oh this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t" moments in the game, and maybe the combat gets a little repetitive, but overall, it was a great experience and I was able to enjoy the game as a whole.","April 15","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's visceral fun in the moment but beneath the gore and the flashy gunplay there's linear 5 hour shooter sporting with none of the scope or variety of the original game and a bare-bones multiplayer mode.

The comic book origins of this title really come out in a positive way in that regard. Sadly the gameplay does not live up to the presentation aspect of this title.\n\nAt the very best you can call The Darkness II an above average shooter. It does nothing special which might sound weird considering how you basically are a semi-god demon monster with tentacles coming out of you ready to rip enemies and the envinroment alike apart. It's just very basic under the shiny shell. You're not really encouraged to utilize your demonic skills and when you do it just doesn't feel very cool.\n\nNaturally darkness is weak to light which brings us to a very frustrating gameplay mechanic. Remember how everyone loves getting hit by flashbangs in shooters? Me neither. The Darkness II manages to take this to another level. Light makes you incapable of using your demon skills which in practice means whatever plan you had with impaling an enemy with that spear-like object you can forget. The real pain starts when enemies start using light against you. This results in many chaotic moments where you just have no idea where to shoot to regain some level of control over the game. The blinding effect of light is way overdone and will make you feel frustrated. When you being the badass mob leader demon you are have to stop every time coming to a new area to snipe off lightbulbs with your pistol you know something is not done right. To top this off the game has a bug which frequently makes motion blur "reverse". What this means is that everytime the motion blur should be off it's on and vice versa. It's not enough to destroy the experience but it's annoying.\n\nThe story is The Darkness II's best part. It's not magnificient but it will keep you interested. Characters are solid with a few really standing out. That said I felt very unsatisfied with the ending. As a stand-alone product it doesn't really work.\n\nAfter about 7 hours of singleplayer campaign you don't have much to do. You can hunt down relics (with some really interesting descriptions as a reward I have to say!) or try a harder difficulty level. The game also features the "mandatory online element" where four of your friends take on separate missions from main story. With no real story I had absolutely no motivation in trying my hands at those the gameplay being mediocre. If you want a multiplayer co-op shooter I'm sure you can think of better ways of spending your time and money.\n\nAfter all the complaining you might think I hate the game but this is not the case at all. Beyond the presentation it's just not anything special. Mediocrity is not a crime and I'd say The Darkness is definitely worth it if you can find a great deal. At anywhere close to the full price I wouldn't consider it.","December 11, 2013","false","10.7"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/67370/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The Darkness II is emblematic of so many of the worst narrative and design concepts of gaming as a medium.\n\nIt’s a game so obsessed with its own mythos, so completely devoid of self-awareness, and so appallingly misogynistic that it is often actively painful to witness. The entirety of The Darkness II seems designed around alliterative bullet points: “guns, girls, and gore.” In many ways then this isn’t terribly different from so many shooters, but where The Darkness II sets itself apart is in how much it revels in its own stupidity and filth.\n\nIt’s going to be important later on in this review, so just so we’re all caught up let’s quickly run through the basic premise behind The Darkness II: brooding protagonist has nothing to live for; girlfriend gives him purpose; girlfriend is killed to get back at protagonist; protagonist has nothing to live for and decides to kill everyone. Somewhere in there is also the fact that our protagonist, mafia kingpin Jackie Estacado, has a demon (the eponymous Darkness) living inside him which gives him superpowers and mostly makes him invincible. From here on events unfold as they typically do, with the introduction of a cult hell-bent on taking Jackie’s darkness (because that’s what cults do) causing all sorts of chaos, as Jackie all the while holds up inside his head lamenting the loss of his girlfriend and showing emotions™.\n\nThough its stereotypical setup might lead you to believe otherwise, The Darkness II’s biggest problem isn’t in its rudimentary plot (though that’s definitely one of them) but in how its only means of creating conflict and motivation for its characters is through violence toward women. Jackie’s girlfriend, Jenny, is fridged before the prologue is finished (a carryover from the last game) and from that point on The Darkness II kills literally every single female character in the game for the sake of motivating Jackie, all while neglecting to give them even the smallest bit of personality, as ultimately their only reason for inclusion (beyond to be fridged) is to be objectified and tortured.\n\nWhat’s possibly even worse than the way The Darkness II treats women is in how it attempts to mask its misogyny under faux-emotional maturity and narrative sophistication. Developer Digital Extremes dedicates a not-insignificant amount of time to attempting to humanize the relationship between Jackie and Jenny, but because Jenny exists merely as a narrative prop with all the personality of a perverted body pillow these segments feel like little more than gross reminders of how one sided and shallow their relationship actually is. It doesn’t help that Jackie is something beyond unlikable with a penchant for juvenile philosophy, as he sits in the dark gun in hand and recites odes to his own amorality. The Darkness II was never a game with a penchant for subtlety, but its writing is so horrendous and convenient that it can’t even scrape by as merely clichéd, but instead doubles down on its tropes, on its misogyny, on its pornographic love of meaningless violence, and then tries to sell it to you as mature storytelling.\n\nSome might say this is just staying true to The Darkness’ comic book roots, but justifying The Darkness II’s narrative disaster through its mirroring of another work does little but damn them both. And to that point there is little about The Darkness II that speaks to its awareness of the tropes it’s employing, as it is so abundantly self-serious that it is impossible to enjoy it as knowingly dumb or comically grotesque the way one might enjoy a B-movie. In the few cases where The Darkness II tries to introduce some levity to its proceedings it predictably punches down, with sexist and ableist jabs that are neither clever nor shocking, but just as cheap and untasteful as the rest of the game.\n\nAnd low and behold if this isn’t as exceedingly routine a shooter as its narrative deserves. The Darkness II’s main mechanical hook is using your two demon arms in conjunction with more ordinary guns to create a sort of synergistic ultraviolence, but in application your demonic appendages are little more than glorified swords and grappling hooks. There was a lot of room for The Darkness II to create interesting encounters focused around forcing you to think creatively with the one thing that sets this apart from any other shooter, but The Darkness II is wholly and unapologetically married to its power fantasy mundanity, and so you are left with room after room of decidedly uninteresting grunts to tear your way through as if the thrill of watching your demon arms rip a man in half is enough to make combat interesting.\n\nThe Darkness II’s demon arms reminded me a lot of Bioshock’s plasmids, but where Bioshock used its plasmids to setup interesting dynamics between you and your enemies, The Darkness II is focused on nothing but accommodating as aggressive a playing style as possible. And that’s not inherently bad, but there is nothing about how The Darkness II plays that makes that aggression satisfying. The shooting is loose, your arms are overpowered, the enemies are tedious and ordinary, and you’re constantly being funneled down the tightest of corridors. The Darkness II tries to counteract this by implementing a kill based scoring system reminiscent of Bulletstorm, but it lacks the depth and creativity that made kills in that game so entertaining, settling here for a narrow range of possibilities which mostly serve to distinguish between gun and darkness kills.\n\nThe Darkness II’s mechanics would feel like a missed opportunity if the entirety of the framework surrounding them wasn’t so unsalvageable. The Darkness II is a game reeking of the worst sorts of narrative based sexism, marrying its violent tendencies with misogynistic conveniences, and the sort of discriminating carelessness that video games so often try to pass off as a sign of their maturity. To the contrary The Darkness II is one of the least innovative and sophisticated games I have played in a very long time, seeming to exist for the very sake of regressing videogames back to a time when nobody questioned why every female character has enormous breasts or why they are constantly getting kidnapped.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 7","false","4.7"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

It's style has been completely revamped, sporting a much more "cartoony" look that resembles the comics well. However, this style change is not just skin-deep.\nSee, the original Darkness game was unique in the sense that it actually managed to be better than it's originial content: the comics. It ditched the more ham-fisted aspects of the story that were introduced far too quickly (conveniently evil cults, an overly obvious antithesis of the Darkness, and many more things that made it far more "fantasy" than anything else. The first game changed all of this. The story was far more dark and grounded in reality, and you truly felt as though you were the the most powerful person in the world because half of the time, you were fighting low-life thugs and corrupt cops.  Enemies cowered in fear when you unleashed your demons because they had never seen anything like it. This time around, you are fighting a great deal of enemies who seem to be more aware of what's going on than you do (just less powerful), and that takes away a great deal of the thrill. Fighting terrified mobsters was easily my favorite part of The Darkness 2, but as soon as the evil cult shows up with all of their mystical weapons and hardware, I lost interest. I was just in another comic-inspired game.\nThis change of style also poses continuity problems because altough the tone of the game has changed COMPLETELY, references to the first game are made constantly. This tethers you to a universe that looks and feels completely different, and the story experience thus feels less cohesive. It's a sequel, but it's not. It is it's own game, but it's not. (this is ofcourse assuming that you played the first game).\nThe gameplay is where the fun begins and eventually commits suicide. The gunplay is tight and responsive; you can use your demon arms to cut apart enemies (sometimes clean in half); and you can even tear doors off of cars and use them as a shield, whipping it at unsuspecting enemies when you're bored. You can even pick up construction poles and pin enemies to walls with them. To make this even BETTER, you can actually do most of this in a matter of seconds if not all at once.  Sounds fun, right? Absolutely. So where does it all fall apart?\nIt falls apart when the game introduces a scoring and execution system.\nRemember Bulletstorm? In case you didn't, Bulletstorm introduced the concept of rewarding players for finding creative ways of killing enemies. This ranged from pulling off headshots to literally kicking them into environmental hazards riddled throughout the area. The Darkness 2 mimics this minus the environments............kinda lame.......\nEither way, straight up shooting enemies to death (even if you pull off a headshot) doesn't reward you with NEARLY as many points as performing an execution does. As a matter of fact, executions are easily the best way to get points. On top of this, you are rewarded even further depending on which of the three TYPES of executions you performed. These can reward you with extra health, ammo, or a darkness shield. This essentially translates to: if the game gets too tough; shoot some guy in the nuts, perform a health execution (that you can't be hurt during), rinse and repeat. But I honestly think the extra points from executions is the worst offender. I loved experimenting with all of the potential options for carnage that I had access to, but I innevitably found that the point system pressured me into a playstyle that prioritized points over fun.\n\nThe COOP? It's a tacked-on piece of ♥♥♥♥ maranated in stale beer and the tears of young orphans.\nReally. Thats all I have to say about the coop.\n\nBottom Line: You a goreaholic and need to see some people torn apart by demonic powers? Wait till this game goes on sale, and I assure you that it will not dissapoint in that regard. However, if you are looking for an experience that rivals that of the first game, you may find yourself as dissapointed as me.","August 15, 2014","false","5.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Three main points spoiled this game for me. I won't go on about graphics, they're fine. Decent engine, decent artists etc. Game mechanics were fine. The menu system was a little annoying but you get used to that. Music was typically horrible but thankfully you can turn it off unlike some games(yes Halo 4, I'm talking about you) So what didn't I like? Read on.\n\nFirstly, cinematics...lots and lots of cinematics. The annoying kind where you can't move and the characters talk seemingly forever when all they have to do is say, 'go out the door and shoot everyone you see.'. You can hardly travel 100 meters without being dragged into some scripted action sequence or some long boring dialogue. Judging by the amount of positive reviews this game receives I assume most people don't mind this. I don't understand. I find it very tedious. Don't get me wrong, I like storylines. I'm happy to sit and watch little cinematics every now and then. I just hate the game being interrupted every 5 minutes just so someone can tell you to walk down some stairs or whatever.

Oh, and apart from their basic intrusiveness, they're just silly. A gangster with tentacles, spare me please.\n\nThirdly, the sidekick. Again, some people obviously like annoying little halfwit sidekicks running around saying annoying half witted things. I just happen to not. The last half hour of my abortive attempt at playing this game was spent shooting it. The only joy I had in this game was discovering that you can shoot the sidekick, though regrettably he does regenerate.\n\nSo there you have it. I wanted to like this game. I loved Sandman and Hellblazer and other stuff back in the day. I knew it would be silly. It's graphic novel/comic book type horror, of course it's going to be silly. Unfortunately excessive cinematics, non-retractable tentacles and a sidekick modelled on a brain damaged teenage metal head made this game unplayable for me. Sorry Digital Extremes. I tried.","December 11, 2013","false","1.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

First off the FOV slider doesn't go high enough for me but I like to play on a FOV of 90 or higher so that is most likely not going to affect you. Secondly the amount of dialogue vs combat feels like 50/50 due to it being quite lengthy and often unskippable when it is not a cutscene. Thirdly one of the mechanics in the game is that bright areas remove your supernatural powers. This would be an interesting mechanic except it makes the game often annoying due to you being in the middle of a firefight and then lose your tentacles so you have to look up and take out the light while being shot. Also there are lights which you can only take out when you follow the wiring to a generator which is annoying as you often have to pass through the light to get to it.\n\nThese problems I could handle and are only minor mistkes but it was when I reached the vent crawling part of the game which I stopped. What happened was there was some glitch where you could not fit through unless you jumped at a specific angle. After about five minutes of this I stopped out of frustration.\n\n\nOf course I advise you to also read other peoples reviews so that you can get a better view of this game to see if it is for you.","December 2, 2014","false","2.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It hurts my eyes fighting with that unfocused camera for hours. Managed to figure out changing the aspect ratio fixes it, for only a minute or two.\n\nThe story is acceptable, the concept of the game was there.

This game has hidden collectibles and while playing through this linear crap game killing the same enemies since the start of the game i really couldn't give a crap about the collectibles.\n\nThe shadow executions, there are four categories and three scenes each category. Discerning weapons from hearts is done in a way that any horrible than it already is must be impossible. Every minute i played this i wanted it to end. But i gotto get my money's worth. I paid for torture.\n\nYour shadow powers, you only got two attacks with one add. One is slashing, horizontally or vertically. The second attack is grab. The add is that you can execute once you grab your victims or throw them including objects. Thats it. Two attacks, grab and slice.\n\nI'm gonna do you a favor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/67370/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","Please note: I have never played Darkness 1 nor read the comic books that the series is based on, so this review is going to be written from that perspective.\n\nDarkness 2 is a sequel to Darkness 1 that was only released for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and the franchise is in turn based on the comic book of the same title produced by Top Cow Productions.\n\nIt tells the story of a mob boss Jackie Estacado and his tormented life living with a dark god / demon known as "The Darkness" which basically grants him immortality but slowly draining his humanity.\n\nThe main problem with Darkness 2 is that being a sequel, the player effectively loses alot of backstory about how Jackie came into being. Sure, there is an optional skippable prelude story narration that briefly summarizes his story, but it still feels rather empty because some of the later story elements (Such as Jenny) would have been more emotional and powerful if you have played the first game.\n\nGameplay itself is fun, and although primarily a FPS, you are given 2 tentacles that lets you eviscerate enemies in the most gruesome manner possible. Because the tentacles are so powerful, i find myself using tentacles most of the time and neglecting to use guns.\n\nIt also makes use of a light and dark mechanic where your character will be more powerful when in darkness, and the tentacles will not be available when there is light.\n\nSo the general gameplay goes like this:\n1) Use guns to shoot out any light source\n2) Use tentacles to eviscerate and kill\n3) Repeat.\n\nGraphics has a unique graphic novel look similar to a toned down Borderlands look and while not too bad, has a very jagged and rough look and bad frame rates even when put on the highest settings on a decent above recommendation computer. I suppose its a result of being a direct console port.\n\nWhile the story is entertaining, it is rather short at about 7 hours. There also isn't much actual gameplay, and close to 70% of the time, you are either looking at cutscenes or scripted events.\n\nJust a little observation i've noticed.\nI also find it strange that every enemy would be so gung-ho to charge at you even after seeing what you've done.\nExample: If you were to see your friend getting ripped apart at the spinal cord by a guy with 2 evil looking dark tentacles, would you still try to attack him? I know i certainly wouldn't lol!! I know games aren't meant to be realistic, but still....\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode available. Unlike other similar games which offers this, somehow Darkness 2 multiplayer mode feels absolutely tacked on and unnecessary and is quite possibly the worst multiplayer mode ever made. There is absolutely no story, no thought gone into it and absolutely no entertainment to be gotten from it.\n\nI've tried the multiplayer campaign with 4 friends and none of us knew what the heck we had to do except to just shoot everything that is not us. I would've rate the multiplayer mode 2/10 if it were a standalone product. Absolutely disgraceful addition and they should've just dropped it to make a better single player experience.\n\nIn closing, it is a pity that Darkness 1 was never released on the PC, as im sure the whole game series would've felt much better when played back to back.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.0 / 10\nActually, just for the story alone, its worth 7/10. Gameplay wise, its 5/10. Buy this game if you enjoy a heavily scripted FPS with a decent single player story. Not worth full price, but not a bad deal if on a cheap sale.","May 25, 2013","false","7.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It has an amazing story, especially for a more or less Mafia tale, the characters are all top notch, and all the lines are well preformed. The graphics look pretty good, with some bad textures from time to time, but its all cell shaded, which makes it look a lot like Borderlands. But that would only be if Borderlands was bloody. No joke, there was less gore in saving private Ryan. Limbs get torn off, people get impaled, and its all in this bloody mess. Which is good, by the way. Anyway, the gameplay is very arcade like shoot em up, with your demon arm to help impale people. Even on the lowest difficulty setting, its still a hard game, coming from a seasoned DkS2 vet,and well, ya. The only gripe I have with the gameplay is that ammo is semi-scare in early game, which well, just feels weird in an FPS.\nOverall, if you find the game on a sale, pick up up without hesitation.\nIf you dont, well, here comes one of my only gripes. Single Player length. It will last only about 6 hours on Med.

But now he has to use the darkness again to defend himself from mysterious orgranization known as "The Brotherhood". Game delivers breathtaking strory of love and tragedy, amazing gameplay, and comic book style environment. You can litteraly decapitate,slice and dice, everysingle human being, apart from using different kinds of super powers like Swarm or Black hole. As you progress through story and kill a lot of enemies you earn Essence which you can use to buy different upgrades. Apart from main storyline there is also 4 player coop which tells the story from different perspective. All in all a great game to enjoy. Definately worth your time and money so go grab it, and embrace the Darkness.","February 11, 2012","true","15.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game is dark, gory, and exciting. The combat flows well and makes you feel empowered purchasing various upgrades to further brutalize your enemies.\n\nAt one point in the storyline I actually had to pause to collect my thoughts and make a decision. I really had to question everything I had seen so far.\n\nThe biggest cons are a lackluster ending and a slightly short storyline.

I finally took the time to play the game through.  End review.  Schmeh.  It's ok, by no means excellent.  In all, the gameplay, story and graphics are a little cheesy.  It's also short--Not to mention that it starts part way through a plot line and ends before the whole story is over.  There's too much purple (yeah, it's a stupid criticism).  Finally, the cinematics in between levels are awful.  They are just one long main character monologue.  I usually don't do this with games, but I just started skipping them after a while--that and all the dialouges.  The border rendered graphics are pretty cool, but overall the game falls way short.

Good graphics.\n2. Good physics.\n3. Good voice and animated acting (the mental-patient who thinks he's adolf Hitler comes to mind.)\n\nBut seriously, games (and movies and TV shows) that takes the road of sex, violence, and swearing to appear mature are getting really really old.\n\nViolence: you get to rip your enemies in so many ways - vertical, horizontal, pull their spines and skulls out through their ♥♥♥. Geez. Tone it down several notches and instead give its atmosphere (and the music) a boost. Ever heard of Alan Wake? There's Darkness there too and man did I feel that one.\n\nSex: There are scenes of oral sex, sex from behind, moaning ala porn stars, and beating up women in the sexual context. References of snorting drugs from private parts of women I mean seriously.\n\nMusic: Eh, so-so. Its ok. Does the job.\n\nStoryline: Pffft. Like, yeah right. Basically, the premise is - Light and Darkness are entities in an eternal battle. Great concept. Execution tries too much to be "cool". Too much in fact that it is the "thing" that makes it feel "immature" in its attempt to be "mature." If Light (The Angelus) is the opposite of The Darkness, then that means its as good as The Darkness is evil. Why then does it look like a cosplay hooker?\n\nGameplay: The gun-combat is pretty ok by today's standards. Dual-wielding pistols and tactical assault pistols/rifles is awesome. Don't expect to dual-wield high-caliber weapons here though. You're a mob boss, not a mech.\n\nAtmosphere. The feeling of being too much indoors, even if you are outside, is too much in my opinion. Did I "feel" the darkness? I felt it when I played Alan Wake. Here, not at all. Even with the voice of The Darkness eerily speaking through my 7.1 surround gaming headset. Would The Darkness like some losenges? ^_^.\n\n\nI'm glad its a short game.\n\nYeah, just when you thought that you cannot be desensitized any further...you know what I mean?\n\nCONCLUSION: Take away the sex, violence, and cussing, and this game is ziltch.","August 9, 2014","false","13.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","4"
