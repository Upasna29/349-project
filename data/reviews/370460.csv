Very unique, doesn't really play too much like Arcsys fighting games like GG/BB. Very deep, there is a lot to learn about it. The game feels a little clunky at first until you get more used to the homing button, but after that it feels great.\n\nIf you can look past the art style and are looking for a breath of fresh air in the fighting game genre, this is it.","October 3, 2015","true","464.3"," 74 of 89 people (83%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","83","74","89","68","7"

The game runs great and is a huge step above ASW's last release with Battle Fantasia. Let's get this minor thing out of the way right off the bat. There is something odd that makes the game backgrounds, menus, text look more pixelated at 1080p. Keeping it at 720 looks crisp on a 1080p monitor. What ever it is that is upscaling the image and making it look that good must be black magic.\n\nI've just hit up training mode and had a few online matches and the game is running without any hitches and the online matches that are of decent distances are played pretty damn good. I don't know if there is a region select in the menus, but that would probably help with people finding smoother matches. That's probably asking for too much since that would fracture the already small player base that this is going to have. Even so, the matches I've found so far have been from tolerable to excellent. The netcode is more than adequate, the problem is finding people who don't live 2,000 miles way from you.\n\nI will update this review later with more gameplay and mode impressions after spending more time with the game. Those worrying about performance and connectivity should purchase this without any worries.","September 29, 2015","true","4.4"," 66 of 79 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","66","79","0","0"

The $30 price tag seemed pretty steep for a 2-D fighter. It definitely proved itself worth the money after I started playing.\n\n-Maybe it's just the style, but the sprite work definitely doesn't seem very HD. I tried a lot of different resolutions to see if I could get a more smooth sprite, but it wouldn't work. However, everything else seemingly matches the chosen resolution.\n\n-A large variety of characters and Arcana (kind of like "assists" or "extra moves"), as well as stages to fight on.\n\n-All characters are fully voiced (in japanese, of course), and I have not yet spotted any translation errors. The story is rather generic.\n\n-Full control or keyboard support that allows rebinding of keys, as well as adding additional buttons for combinations of keys.\n\n-The combat system itself feels very "right". It seems solid and does what you want it to. The movesets for each character are very balanced, and therefore the gameplay is very enjoyable.\n\n-Online, as is typical of many 2-D fighters, is full of people that are actually really good at the game, along with some average players and a few discouraged novices. However, as with any game, practice makes perfect. Don't fret if you find yourself having troubles playing online.\n\n-Online play, from my experience, has not been very laggy or sluggish, aside from only one of my fights.\n\n-Replays are almost a joke, they seem to be very de-synced from the actual match they are supposed to represent, and I even had a replay where the two of us just stood still until the time ran out, even though we fought the entire time realistically.\n\n-The story mode will unlock you extra stories, gameplay, and stuff for your gallery","September 30, 2015","true","15.0"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","41","43","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rafaelmorais/recommended/370460/","rafaelmorais","Rafael M.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rafaelmorais/","444 products in account","Behind a silly title, there’s an innovative and exciting fighting game for enthusiasts of the genre. This is Arcana Heart 3 LOVE MAX!!!!! in a nutshell. The game lives up to its hardcore reputation and brings new mechanics and a lot of depth to the table. If you can pass the “cute girls” aesthetic, you’ll find a lot to enjoy here.\n\n“But what makes Arcana Heart so special?”, you might be thinking. Two things: the homing mechanic and arcanas for the characters. The homing mechanic consists in a command to fly directly to your enemy from anywhere in the stage. You can throw your opponent up in the air, press the homing button and start a combo there. Arcanas, on the other hand, offers 23 elementals choices to complement your movelist. Add this to the cast of 23 characters and you have a total of 529 combinations (!!!!!) to try out.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that Arcana Heart is heavily focused on air combat, like a good air-dasher should be. Ground based combos don’t have much impact here. With a screen up to about four times vertically, the matches generally get extreme on the air, flying up and down, with each fighter following each other, performing fast inputs and cancelling combos.\n\nIs Arcana Heart 3 LOVE MAX!!!!! worth the price? In my honest opinion, totally, but just for experienced fighting games players or enthusiasts. There’s no tutorial, and even if you’re a veteran of the genre, you’ll need to look some guides and wikis to learn its depth and its unique mechanics. There’s a lot of modes to keep you occupied and having fun.\n\nPROS:+ Innovative game with original mechanics\n+ Exciting and fast paced gameplay\n+ 23 unique characters with 23 arcanas, resulting in a total of 529 combinations\n+ Tons of stages and great soundtrack\n+ Challenging and almost unpredictable AI\n+ Hidden “VS CPU” mode – Just play VS without selecting the second player/controller\n+ Works with a variety of controllers, fighting sticks and keyboards (all options have rebindable buttons)\n+ Devs keeps improving the game with regular patches\n\nMIXED:> Netcode is delay based and it's great only with people near you\n> The aesthetic (cute girls theme) can make some people miss a great fighting game. It’s a love or hate kind of thing\n\nCONS:- No Arcade Mode. Really…The closest option is Story Mode\n- The last boss from Survival Score Attack (Kamui) is the cheapest boss of all time. You can barely move. SNK’s bosses looks like child’s play compared to her\n- No true widescreen option (without sidebars). Vanilla Arcana Heart 3 had this feature\n- The fantastic soundtrack is not included with the purchase, unlike the majority of Steam releases published by Arc System Works","October 10, 2015","true","14.2"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","32","33","2","4"

No slowdowns, crashes, or anything for me. Game natively recognized every controller I threw at it (x360, ps3 stick, even a gamecube controller), and I was able to rebind everything. And I highly reccomend using some kind of controller for this game.\n\n-Okay, so the game runs. What about the gameplay?\nSo far so good. Game is REALLY fun. REALLY REALLY fun. Especially when you get the hang of the homing system. I've had multiple times when playing something happens, and I just say "You can do that? THAT'S AWESOME!"\nAll the characters are really unique and feel fresh, and all of the arcanas are really neat. (I can stop time? Yes please)\nMusic is pretty good.\n\n-Now: The netcode.\nFrom my experience so far, it works very well. Matches have ranged from BUTTERY SMOOTH to slightly rough. Sometimes the worse connections can take a few seconds to get going, but once they do it's completely playable. You can't expect to to have smooth matches with people from out of the country, or if they just have a bad connection. No amount of netcode wizardry will fix that.\n\nOh yeah it's also got cute girls\nYou like those, right?\n\nTL;DR\nIt's good.

The cast of characters and arcana is diverse enough to have a lot of different strategies and tactics, and the smart use of the arcana gauge and how it builds tweaks the formula enough for it to feel fresh. It's a shame that it falls into the same trap as other rereleases of this type do for a new platform: not having a player base to work off of, which limits network play despite what seems to be strong net-code overall. It could have used some HD visuals and polish for the game, because despite good character design and artwork, the sprites have shown their age at this point. In the end, a great fighting system and fun and quirky story mode helps bring the game worth a look despite the multiplayer downfalls, and was something that was fun throughout my experience, all be it a bit frustrating at times.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/8B9P9L5LzVM\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nGood core gameplay experience that doesn't focus on one play style in particular, and let's the balance of the game speak for itself.\nGreat character variety that's only enhanced by the choice of Arcana's to customize for play style. Experimentation is a strong element of the game.\nGood pro-ration of the combos so that it doesn't result in one hit kills, but does reasonable damage.\nLike the Trial mode, a sucker for modes that help you do specific actions and focus on specific objectives.\nNetcode seems strong, and is even able to tell if connection would be too crappy to allow for matches.\nSmart use of the homing mechanic to keep the action up.\nExtras in terms of Story and back stories help give reasons to do extra missions and what not. There seems to be a strong lore here that's worth digging into.\nCharacter designs are fun, and good homage to particular games and famous movies within it (hurray for The Wizard of Oz character).\nStory mode is silly but in that typical fighting game fashion. Expect silliness and some cheese, and some groan inducing laughs. But all in all, fun.\nOverall a good collection of modes.\n-:\nIt's hard to hold against the game, but the player base in the network play isn't there at the moment, only consisting of high level players. It's a problem ports have to live with sadly.\nThe visuals, in particular the sprites, don't live up on to the modern day standards and equivalents at the price point.\nCould have done a better job in teaching the player the unique mechanics of the game. This is a common problem in the fighting genre, but with the nature of the arcana gauge and in particular homing, I thought it was even more then usual.\nDifficulty in Story modes are too all over the place. Too much variance within a story mode where you perfect the start of the mode, but horribly struggle at the end.\nThe end boss suffers in the fact that it's mechanics don't allow for a fair fight on every character, as in particular grapple characters suffer horribly as their moveset is basically crippled. Also, I hate the end boss with all fiber of my being.\nLack of polish around the corners. Some menus don't take in the controller inputs while others do, and it could have used some testing here and there regarding certain information showing up on screen.\nSome voices in the game will cause some people to cringe at the high pitched nature.","October 5, 2015","true","10.2"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","20","24","3","0"

With 23 fighters and 23 Arcanas to choose from, the latter further customizing and adding depth to your chosen fighter, you will have a lot of fun experimenting and finding your own fighting style.\n\nThis game's mechanics share some similarities with those of other air dashers, such as Blazblue or Melty Blood, with a unique twist to it: the homing mechanic, which allows you to home in on your opponent with the press of a button, which in turn allows for extra defensive and offensive options, along with fast-paced mind games.\n\nThe game launched with a few bugs, but most of them were quickly addressed with a couple of patches. I won't say it's perfect now, but personally my experience hasn't been negatively impacted since then.\n\nI highly recommend this if you're into fighting games but haven't yet tried Arcana Heart.

If you can put aside the theme (take my word for it, it's tolerable in game), you are in for a treat.\n\nThere are three main reasons the game sticks out as a 2D fighter:\n- Homing button\nYou can use it to jet yourself towards the opponent, delay your attack, fly around projectiles, extend your combo, dodge attacks. No other fighter allows you to be this mobile in the air. It's something that you will keep finding ways to exploit, it's pretty great.\n\n- Huge hand drawn stages\nThe stages are massive, especially vertically, and its incredibly enjoyable as you and your opponent fight it out practically everywhere in the air. It just feels massive.\n\n- Arcanas\nAn Arcana gives you a bonus to your character and you can summon them to do an attack (like MVC assists).  The bonuses are quite different, like allowing you to float in the air to giving your attacks superarmor to making your character fall faster and less vulnerable combos. You can combine any arcana with any character which gives you a lot of options to try out.\n\nBalance wise its pretty good. While there are a couple of really strong characters, they don't feel unbeatable. Everyone has an arcana they can use to keep them in the fight.\n\nThe netcode is pretty nice. It starts off quite laggy, but it should smooth out by the time the match starts. Overall, haven't had issues with playing people from completely different regions (EAST/West/Europe). It's still not great as it's not using rollback like GGPO, but overall quite playable.\n\nMy main complaint is that the game doesn't have high-res character sprites. This is largely unnoticeable in the match because you are moving around so quickly, but it makes a bad impression in the beginning. Also the single player is quite lackluster although you do have a story mode, time trial etc.\n\nAside from that, this is a great game. You might need to grab a friend though, the online playerbase is quite small.","October 30, 2015","true","22.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

I think I've spent more time reading Mizuumi's wiki than I have actually playing it. Just reading up on what each Arcana is capable of and what they could possibly add to a character is important stuff you should look into, but if you're a scrub like me, you can just pick Love and enjoy all that lovely meter gain and slow homing projectiles and do your own thing.\n\nI don't think there is a fighting game out there with as good of character diversity as Arcana Heart, every character is so extremely different and their gameplay styles and attributes can be made even more unique depending on your choice of Arcana. Every character is worth a look and finding an Arcana that compliments them well. I play Catherine with the Love Arcana and I just love buildin' meter so I can possibly land huge damage with that sweet command grab super that involves rotating my arcade stick like a mad man.\n\nThe most important feature in a new fighting game this day and age though is the netcode... it's your typical Arc System Works fare, syncs prior to the intro, with some slowdown, then speeds right up and plays mostly fine. It helps to not skip the intros from what I've been told, but I don't feel any difference really. Also unlike the console port of the game, it's not region locked from what I heard, so that's good, ya?\n\nI can't comment on any of the single player content in the game since I've yet to bother with it, all I've been doing is spending time in practice mode and enjoying some online matches with friends. But if you bought a fighting game, it's not for that single player fluff, right? You aren't getting your silly Mortal Kombat X movie storymode fill here, but at least there's cute art and stuff. Besides, unlike MKX, Arcana Heart 3 Love Max!!!!! is actually playable online!\n\nHopefully the Six Stars update will be released as a free DLC update or something... but I'm not getting my hopes up for it or anything.","October 13, 2015","true","2.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

It's not as "on-point" demanding like in Guilty Gear or others that require (Roman) canceling to be done only with certain moves with very specific frames of attack.\n\nThe clash system will also keep you on your feet and help give you a fighting chance in times you'd least expect it. Clashing is when two characters hit each other in their hitboxes and their attacks stop in their tracks. You are then given the option to try and get another attack in before your opponent does during the clash animation.\n\nThe supers in this game are fun to abuse. Heck the Arcana Eclipses are basically a free super attack. You have to go into Extend Force to use one but extend force refreshes very quickly. (Like a few seconds) and also your character's own super meter recharges fast too. Remember the effort it takes to get a level of super in other games like street fighter and when you lose that level it takes a lot of effort to get it back? In this game you can just turtle for a couple of seconds and you can get it back. With 23 characters all completely different from each other and 23 Arcanas to choose from you can mix things up and have fun working around seeing what works and what's just plain gimmicky. (Brawlers that zone with long range pink lazors? WTF....surprisingly it's highly effective.)\n\nThere are some other things to do:\nSurvival(which really needs to be changed to Score Attack. That's what it is. You're still allowed to keep trying on the same fight you lose so it's not really survival which you must defeat as many as you can while given only one chance.) Time Attack, and Trials for the characters.\n\nThe trials pit you against CPU opponents that ENCOURAGE you to use the game's mechanics. Like teching/jump cancels/etc.  It helps give players that don't have much experience in fighting games to actually try some of the more advanced stuff instead of just giving them a dummy to pound and a command list of the special moves and leaving the players with no clue how survival in games like this works.\n\nHowever this game isn't without some really bad serious flaws.\n\n-CONS-\nObviously fighting games never offer much in the realm of rewards. Your best reward is defeating tough opponents online, I'd imagine.\n\nThe unlockables are just anime artwork/visual stuff and the after story is just some anime episode shoehorned into this game that has nothing to do with what is really happening in the main plot. There isn't even much fighting in it it's just a lot of dialog. It's almost as if it feels the girls' main life outside of conflict is more important the catastrophic events that took place beforehand. Pretty stupid ♥♥♥♥ but it has those warm cute moments.\n\nWhen you're doing stuff outside of story mode, you're going to hit stuff that is scaled incorrectly with respect to difficulty curve.\n\nI know that sounds greek so I'll spell it out.\n\nWhen you're doing the Time Attack/Survival/10th trial gold medals  you're going to hit broken CPU opponents that are going to pit you against odds that are impractically doable or just downright borderline impossible to combat. Some of which is said to even be tougher than King of Fighters bosses, or so I've been told. If you're already more than familiar with this game...you know who I'm talking about. The primary reason this is horrible is because these are your final bosses that you must beat to place your score. You could clean sweep your way to the end and have to fight something horribly broken compared to everything else you had to fend off to get to the near end. It's not so bad in the 10th trial because that's a purely optional thing to do but for Survival and Time Attack that was an awful idea to put stuff like that at the very end.\n\nSummary\nOverall the game is fast paced and fun and gives players many options to combat with so whether you want to play on your own with a friend and goof around seeing what does what it's great. If you want to go competitive the adrenaline from the insanity is worthwhile. I do recommend it but 20$ would've been a better price. I felt like I was paying 15$ for a nice fighting game and another 10$ for some anime stuff as an feature buying this on it's prerelease discount of 10%(or whatever it was.)","October 19, 2015","true","195.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Its really hard to explain, but it feels like if you took Guilty Gear, Gave it a speed close to Marvel vs Capcom 2 and Naruto's dashing system, this would be the game.\n\nNice sized cast with multiple ways to change up how each character plays with the Arcana system.\n\nInteresting Story provided for each character and the After-story is really neat too!\n\nCons:\nVery Very VERY Unfair Bosses.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/370460/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Arcana Heart 3 Love Max is a 2D Fighting game featuring an all-female cast of 23 fighters. Set in the country of Japan it is up to you to choose one of these fighters and find rare objects known as Celestial Stones that are used to power a giant robot. Each character has very slightly different dialogue so playing through the Story Mode once and skipping everything but the ending results in no real loss as long as you don't skip the unique ending. Story mode is the nonsensical bare-bones set up one would expect from a fighting game with nothing even remotely interesting about it. None of us are likely to buy a Fighting game expecting a well told narrative however, so luckily the combat in this is very enjoyable. It's a one on one fight but you also choose from one of 23 unique Arcanas (support character) for slightly different powers at your disposal.\n\nThe difference between Arcanas is very minimal like some poisoning your enemy or boosting your power. Without a doubt the stars of the show here are the characters themselves. It has demon nuns, living paintings and dolls, dead little girls and a wolf riding catgirl to name a few. They are all very unique and memorable minus the main character Heart who is as cliché as can be, strangely enough. It's not just appearances that differ, each one controls and fights in very distinct manners such as some characters needing to reload their guns, some having limited mana to unleash magic and your more traditional 'punch your enemy into submission' type of characters. This huge difference between characters also means it is typically a good idea to train with them a little first before plunging straight into one of the modes as button mashing won't get you very far in this title.\n\nYou have three bars at the bottom which allow for three special attacks or one huge one depending if you have them filled up of course. Special attacks always require you to press both your light and heavy attack buttons simultaneously along with a certain combination so you are unlikely to accidentally waste a bar in the heat of the moment. Certain Arcana attacks also require a bar of energy to pull off. What may be even more important than your energy bar is your arcana percentage meter located at the top of the screen right under your characters portrait. Once it is at 100 percent you can activate it for a boost in power with the added benefit of knocking your opponent to the other side of the screen if you activate it while she is near. Another equally important function of that meter is that you can activate an “arcana burst” at any time that allows you to interrupt a combo and giving you enough breathing room to get back into the fight. Bursting out of a combo causes your meter to refill far more slowly than usual so it is more of a one off emergency move than something to be relied on.\n\nArcana Heart 3 has a rather unique gameplay mechanic that allows you to dash towards wherever your opponent is, at the press of a button. Whether she be at the other side of the screen or mid-air, a single press of the button will put you face to face in no time. It helps keep the pace of the game fast but is also not detrimental to range based characters as it is rather easy to put a stop to someone making a mad dash at you.  If both of you are dashing at each other it is a matter of who strikes first that will be at the advantage or if you both strike at the same it will cause a brief moment where you can either attempt another attack, block or just get out of range. All characters have a double jump and having that dash button at hand it can lead to some really cool mid-air fights. Being defensive is just as dangerous as being very aggressive since blocking an attack does little to no damage to you and creates small openings where you can counter-attack.  You do have to predict whether it's a low or high attack though and grabs cannot be blocked so it takes skill whichever way you fight.\n\nStages are really bland to look at unfortunately and often have very little detail in them. Each level does change into something more interesting when someone is using their arcana meter but that is just a very brief time then its back to the bland backgrounds. It is rather cool each stage has two looks to them though the problem is the one you look at most is sub-par. Another problem is that the camera is very zoomed in to focus on the characters so not much of the background is shown. That issue could have been fixed by allowing us to play in 16:9 aspect ratio though sadly it's stuck to 4:3. One thing I do like about the stages is that they all have a ton of vertical space to jump around in.\n\nSince it is stuck at 4:3 only the middle of your screen will be for the game itself the rest will be for the rather cool character animation portraits on each side. While fighting your character will be shown on the corner of your screen in a battle stance, squirming when taking damage and various other movements while performing special attacks. It adds nothing to the gameplay but I really liked that small touch nonetheless. The animations on the side of the screen may distract some players from the fight in which case there is an option to turn them off and have them be static screens. If you have a monitor over 60hz the game will run far too fast in which case you must go into your graphic cards menu be it Nivdia's Control Panel or AMD's Catalyst to turn on Vsync since there is no in game option to do so.\n\nNow onto the game modes, aside from Story Mode you have “Trials” that challenges you with a certain task each day, Survival that has your health carry over between matches with only a bit of it refilled and Training which is exactly what it sounds like. There is also Versus, Time attack, Network and After Story. There are a ton of modes to choose from and strangely enough you may not want to actually start off with the Story Mode. It is the only mode with a Street Fighter 3 like feature where you can choose from a couple of characters on who to fight next match but the sub-boss is a massive difficulty spike that will destroy you if you don't know how to properly play as your character. It's not an insurmountable foe but it is quite a challenge whose difficulty seems to not scale regardless of your difficulty setting. Once you are decent with a certain character it is an exciting battle even if she does love to spam her giant mechanized turtle. The real problem comes afterwards. You will be facing a giant skyscraper tall robot. Sounds cool right? Well the bad news is that it is not a fight at all but a glorified version of the car smashing bonus round of SF2. In here you must attack small portions of the stage which can range from easy to a real pain depending on your characters range, air fighting skills and move set.\n\nAll you gain from story mode is a unique ending so I don't even bother with that mode due to that robot. Simply fighting regardless of mode will unlock stuff like that character's mini story and sub-stories which are a cool way to know more of your favorite characters personality and an enjoyable read when they are not being serious. It has very good humor but on occasion it tries to be serious and falls flat on its face. Speaking of story you may remember me mentioning an After Story mode. This is basically a Visual Novel with a few fights thrown which have the characters look for a hot spring. It is exactly as boring as it sounds and after suffering through that I can confirm there is nothing other than an achievement to be unlocked. This being the third game in the series they expect you to be familiar with the lore and don't explain anything like the characters background or factions. This is the first game to be released on PC so you will be totally lost if you didn't happen to play the first two on the PS2. Regardless, if you value gameplay above all else Arcana Heart 3 will not disappoint.","May 23","true","17.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

In particular, the use of a guard cancel instead of near-frame-perfect blocking to turn defense into offense is something I wish more airdashers had, as this does. It also doesn't require long combo strings to do well, though learning them will secure victory 2 or 3 touches sooner.\n\nThe Arcana system is interesting, but as a fair warning, while every character seems viable, and nearly every arcana seems to be viable, not every character/Arcana pair is equally useful. However, most characters have a few Arcanas they will work well with, and each Arcana seems to have it's place with at least a character or two.\n\nNetcode also feels solid, at least as far as input delay netcode can take a game. Part of this is the actual code, and part of it is the lack of timing sensitive mechanics (such as instant blocking or FRCs) frustrating one's practice time. The only issue I've found so far is that the game will slow down a bit when connections are poor, which I'm guessing is more due to packet loss. As always, try to play from a computer wired into the internet.\n\nOverall, as fighting games go, it's an enjoyable airdasher with a deep movement system, and without the reliance on strict timing on the defensive and long combos on the offensive.","October 4, 2015","true","18.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/braindig/recommended/370460/","braindig","Brain Digger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/braindig/","192 products in account","TL;DR - Great game for offline with controllers, bad port and netcode.\n\nArcana Heart 3 innovates on the fighting game genre with it's flight mechanics, Arcana strikers and constantly refilling Arcana gauge. The homing flight button allows for crazy aerial menuvering and in the right hands can become a deadly weapon. After selecting a character, the player has to select an Arcana, which is similar to Stands in the Jojo universe. Pretty much a beast that the player character summons to cast different spells. Different tactics can be formed by matching different characters with different Arcanas.\n\nThe STORY isn't very interesting and is not delivered very well. Either the game doesn't stand well on it's own or it just lacks proper character introduction. I'd often end up skipping all scenes of dialog.\n\nThe GRAPHICS aren't all that great. It's a low res pixel art type 2D fighter that came out back when it was acceptable for big companies to make such games. The animated side bars are pretty cool, though and the dialog scenes contain high resolution graphics as well.\nThere's a "character effect" option in the graphics options menu which blurs the character sprites. I don't know why anyone would ever turn that on.\n\nThe NETCODE isn't great either. I've only played one match so far... but it took me quite a while to find and when I did - it ran in slow motion. Full frame sync just isn't the way to go. It was not an enjoyable experiance.\n\nIn terms of PORT quality - the game falls flat on it's face. Menu controls can't be rebound at all, meaning that if you press space then you must navigate the menu with WASD and if you press return then you must navigate the menu with the arrow keys. The confirmation button changes too. And it's not something obvious like Enter or Space... it's "I" or Numpad 7 or some other silly option.\nRedefined controls are in effect only when in a fight. Even during dialog scenes - you can only press the default controls - better memorize them before changing.\nIt's impossible to set a high resolution windowed mode in the menu. Windowed and fullscreen have different supported resolutions. I have a 1920 by 1200 pixel monitor and my screen resolution isn't supported at all. I can play fullscreen at 1920x1080px. I can't, however, use Borderless Gaming because I can't crank the resolution that high in windowed mode.\n\nI'd expect such a late release on PC to have some candy like a tutorial mode or some unlockable art gallery or improved netcode... But nada. The game is no better than the console version in any way. It only came out much much later when it's pretty much irrelevant. I realize Aksys are finally giving us PC gamers their wonderful creations following the PC release of Guilty Gear Xrd -Sign- but I would have expected tweaking them up a little, considering the immense delay after the original console releases.","May 4","false","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

The Homing mechanic is pretty simple, you can easily follow an opponent--and cancelling is as smooth as butter (but then again, I main Saki)\n\nProblems though:\n- No Arcade Mode, Story Mode is the closest.\n- Good luck finding anyone online if you live outside the US.\n- Small community. Its Dustloop section is pretty much dead. Still bigger than UNIEL's, at least.\n\nit's more balanced than CSE so that's pretty good","January 11","true","14.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I decided to post my motivation for it as a review, for it might help inform people as well.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am not a fighter nut. I cannot name all BlazBlu's, nor do I have some acade-like controller enshrined at home. The only fighter I played much was touhou 12.3, at wich I was "good" or "decent". Your mileage might vary, and if you are a pro at fighters like these you'll probably laugh at my feeble attempts at beating the game. In which case, read other reviews to decide.\n\nWhile I am no prodigy at fighting games, I can easily beat the AI in story mode without losing any health... Untill I get to the last day/level. This "scharlachenrot" character is way harder than the rest of the AI, constantly spamming long range attacks and using that godawful cannon. So either I have to crank the difficulty way down and have the other AI so dumb that they just stand still for 5 seconds mid battle, or I do fine but get trashed by this cannon at the end. That is not challenging gameplay, neither good game design.\n\nI put the "Game difficulty" setting at 1. The story mode AI became, well, downright mentally defective. I got "scharlachenrot" down to 1-3 pixels of healthbar... when she did her "finisher" (huge lasers from cannon) TWICE IN A ROW. I still died. Might be my skills, but not fun. Not fun at all. It really feels like someone on the enemy team is cheating.\n\nOn a different note, there is no way to remap half of the controls, and it does not recognize my gamepad. I am quite tech savvy and know how to map my gamepad to keyboard buttons, but that I spent ~40 minutes of the 2 hours I played on getting my controls to work does not do my impression of this game any favors. It lists "full controller support" which is a downright lie, for you cannot map "TAB" to any controller button and have to press it on your keyboard, unless you use an external program to do gamepad to keyboard mapping.\n\nLastly it offers 1920x1080 "Support" but the sprites are horribly upscaled. Blurry and pixelated. There exists algorithms that scale old GBA sprites up better, look it up on wikipedia. Downright inexcusable for a game that costs 28 euros.","November 3, 2015","false","1.9"," 6 of 32 people (19%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","19","6","32","2","10"
