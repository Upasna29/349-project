I mean, do you truly know the incredibly visceral, powerful and satisfying feedback that is crunch? Now go into Nuclear Throne and smack a maggots nest with a sledgehammer. Go on, I don't mind. Being inanimate text that a person typed and then abandoned, I have no sense of time. It'll be like kicking good vibes across a punch bowl (I'm also hit-and-miss with simile).\n\nOkay, you're back! How was it-- Ohhh, I know that look! Your eyes have the enlightened glint of one who has tried the good stuff, the real deal, the prime reserve. You can't go back, now. Now, you know crunch. The real crunch. This is Nuclear Throne, and it's appeal cannot be simply summed up in a few words. It's referred to as an "action roguelike-like(-like)" because it is difficult to put into a genre. Because it is its own genre. If I were to call it anything, it would probably be "Randomly-Generated Action Crunch with Permadeath", which I am predicting will be a cereal by 2019 (sans permadeath, unless we don't have randomly-generated cereals by then, in which case I WANT to die).\n\nEverything about this game is crunchy. There's a power-up based leveling system (further referred to as they are in game, "mutations"), a charming and variant cast of playable characters, tons of weapons (about 73 as of this writing, but I was just in on a stream where they rather liked my suggestion of adding nunchuks), crazy enemies, b-skins, rule-altering pickups and even local 2-player! And the art and music-- Ohhh, the art and music! The beautiful and detailed pixel art, the energizing (sometimes haunting) tracks and impeccable sound design frankly shocked me. Such character and atmosphere I found myself immersed in!\n\nThe game is so easy to pick up, and yet the way you develop your character is incredibly deep. The developers waste none of their time (and consequently, your time) on anything that doesn't feel just awesome. Sure, "Mutation A" doesn't seem very good, at first. But once you learn more about "Characters D and E" and how they synergize splendidly with "Mutation A" when paired with "Mutation G", you get an "Aha" moment! Like a challenging, yet ultimately rewarding puzzle, Nuclear Throne holds a plethora of "Aha" moments for those willing to scratch past the surface and experiment with the MASSIVE number of possible character builds. And you need no mutation to love a samurai chicken! C'mon.\n\nThe developers are two guys, who comprise Vlambeer, and four others who handle the art, music and sound. They're the most down-to-earth, approachable and generally cool guys to ever make a game, probably (permission to put that on the back cover = granted). They generally update the game every Saturday with new characters, baddies, weapons, difficulty balancing and bug fixes. They even stream themselves developing said changes every Tuesday and Thursday on their Twitch channel (http://www.twitch.tv/vlambeer)! And they take feedback like pros! None of this "bleuuu, you don't like my game, banned and deleted" business. They're good people.\n\nOh, and you'll be dying a lot. I didn't "beat" the game until I had already logged around 100 hours (there's an end-boss, but you loop back to the beginning with higher difficulty upon defeating it), but that didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying every minute up until that point and after! This is a fantasticly addictive game, with a fantastic community and fantastic developers that is already easy to recommend. The fact that it promises to only get better is just gravy!\n\nAnd yes, I did a "let's play":\nhttp://youtu.be/2c36sZuTyOM","July 30, 2014","true","417.8"," 224 of 256 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","224","256","5","11"

Yes, my currency sucks) and I recently exprienced most of the content, meaning I can finally review it.\n\n\nNuclear Throne is a hard(and I mean HARD. at about 9 hours you'll be just getting used to the third area) roguelite top down shooter with a huge variety of weapons(above 140 I believe), a roster of 12(and a few secret) characters, 7 main areas(split into levels) with secret equivelants of most of them, and full of content.\n\nEvery session is quite short, and there is no end unless you choose to end the run.\n\n\nEvery enemy drops EXP upon death(rads), and when you level up you can choose 1 mutation(modifiers) out of a selection of 4 every time for 9 levels, and get a special choice on level 10. Mutations vary from trivial things such as faster move speed to kills reducing reload time.\n\n\nThe devs are extremley helpful and active on the forums(at least during the early acces period and until they finish updating the released product) and the community is the last one to be called a toxic community.\n\n\nThe game's lore was told partly through little references in-game, lore bits and pieces from twitch streams of the dev and more, and is worth a read on the wiki(Also run by a great guy). Nobody knows all of it(except for the developers), but what we do know is pretty damn good.\n\n\nAfter defeating the first final boss, if you do a thing the community will eventually notify you about(or wiki), you will loop. Looping is going through the entire game all over again and will never end until you die/get either of the 2 endings.\nIt includes new exclusive content and so much more. The loops are late game, and since they can last forever, the game has to become even more brutal with each loop, and on loop 1 already, without spoiling, you will notice a difficulty spike.\n\n\nPros\n-Full of areas to explore, enemies to shoot and die to, weapons, synergies and more.\n-Will keep you playing for a good amount of time, but still is fit for short sessions if you're just passing time\n-Amazing and helpful community\n-Fantastic soundtrack(Personal favorites are Frozen City's B-Track(Ode on the official soundtrack) , and The Nuclear Throne)\n-Great pixel art that is just beautiful to look at.\n\n\nCons\n-It takes a while for RNGesus to make some good weapons become common in the pool after the first time they drop\n-Sometimes the game would do flat out unfair actions, such a certain telefragging enemy\n-Inconsistent difficulty curve. Its smooth until the third boss, spikes, stays that way, lowers down a bit in the 7th area's boss and on loops spikes up again and goes through the same curve\n-Sometimes you just get screwed(even on spawn). RNGesus may not have mercy.\n-Some secrets that without a wiki/datamining no one would have found.\n\nTLDR: NT is a great game to sink hours into, as well as to play in short sessions, is hard, but rewarding and fun, as well as full of content to exprience.\n","December 24, 2015","true","256.2"," 120 of 123 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","120","123","9","4"

It's a game that captures the sinking lows and heart-pumping highs of an arcade game extremely well. Nuclear Throne just FEELS fun to play. With many other games, I find myself having to think hard to justify why the game is fun or worth my time. With Nuclear Throne, it's very simple. Playing this game is fun as hell. This game wants you dead, and picking it up always feels like a fresh challenge; you vs the game. This game WILL kill you eventually, but you're always given a fun, challenging opportunity to go down swinging.\n\nNuclear Throne is a game that balances chaos and elegance near-perfectly. The characters, weapons, enemies, and upgrades appear very simple at first. An upgrade that gives you +4 HP, so what? But as you progress in your skill and your runs, these simple elements get mixed together at larger scales, and you'll be presented with a unique set of challenges based on your skill and the choices you've made in the run. As you get further in your run, you're given harder enemies, uniquely challenging bosses, and more traps. But you're also given bigger, deadlier guns, and that +4 HP will be your best friend when it saves you from death after you mess up a tight dodge. As the game scales upward and the chaos ramps up, the strength of the simple designs really shines, and when you finally die, it rarely feels cheap, and it's very difficult to not say "alright, one more run".\n","December 5, 2015","true","295.2"," 76 of 80 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","76","80","5","1"

They told him to stop looking for it.  Maybe it's for the best that they stayed behind.\nThe Throne is even more glorious than he had ever imagined.  It speaks of hope, of power unlimited, of rebirth, of restoration.  It could save him.  It could turn back all of this.  It could give him everything he wanted.  It could put him at the pinnacle of the new world.\nHis reverie is interrupted by a sound from Crystal, shifting uncomfortably on her stubby feet.  In an instant he knows why, his heart sinking into his stomach, feeling like it's about to herniate.  Of the six of them that set out toward the Throne, five made it -- and there's only one seat.\nHe admits, they had joked a little about that along the way, about the possibility that only one of them would get to sit on the Throne, about whom the honour would go to.  They had all laughed when Robot weighed in: "SELECT MUTANTNAME FROM TEAMMATES WHERE THRONEBUTT_QUALITY = (SELECT MAX(THRONEBUTT_QUALITY) FROM TEAMMATES);” But nobody's laughing now.  Fish knows what everybody's doing, before he even looks around.  Every one of them is a trained killer, and they’re all evaluating former friends, making up minds about whom to kill first.\nCrystal's tough on the exterior, but she's likely to crack once she sees her family start killing each other off.  It was hard enough for her when she wasn't able to save Eyes from the Horror.  Rebel's got thicker blood flowing through her, though.  Fish knows she'd kill him just as easily as one of her minions if it tried to jump on the Throne.  Y.V. is a wildcard; Fish doesn’t even know why he'd bother with going for the Throne in the first place or what he intends for it.  Robot's the biggest worry -- it's made clear time and time again that the Throne is its greatest priority, but not whether it needs to sit on it.  If it does, there's no question that it'll eliminate all of them once they’re no longer of use.\nIs Fish or the others of any further use to Robot?  All of them are staring at it now, hands tensed, drifting instinctively towards gun belts.  Crystal's eyes catch Fish’s, and he nods -- then a sudden crash almost throws fish off his webbed feet.  Instantly everyone is facing the Throne again, as ports around its base start to open, and... Something... starts to unearth itself.\nThe team moves as one again as they back away, drawing weapons simultaneously, as the throne lifts slowly up from the floor, looming down toward them.  Green lights blaze forth from it as guns swing into position, a dozen giga-capacitors whining, charging up for the Throne's first volley.  Automated defences, they should have known.\nCrystal takes a dash forward and holds her arms out to either side, but fish grabs her and pulls her back before she can harden, warning her not to throw herself away on the Throne's massive claws.  She nods, and her feet fuse to the floor anyway, as she hefts her minigun and begins firing alongside the rest of the group. Now singing a melancholy dirge, Fish fires hot plasma into the thrones hull. There's no telling which one of fish’s teammates is going to survive this fight, but he knows he’ll lay down his life for any of them. As long as it ensures that one of them -- any of them -- makes it onto that seat...","August 6, 2015","true","218.7"," 117 of 140 people (84%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","84","117","140","25","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/devilazite/recommended/242680/","devilazite","Devil Azite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/devilazite/","480 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(scroll down for tl;dr)\n\nI love this game. I love it so much that I have nearly 500 hours into it. I wouldn't so much call this a review, just some (hopefully) objective experiences I personally had for the game I love so much while explaining a bit of the game in general.\n\n*Characters*Nuclear Throne sports a roster of 12 playable characters, diverse with their own unique passive and active ability. From shielding to bullet-time, to air strikes to rolling, every character offers up a variable play-style each go around. The art for the game suits the game's overall direction and is generally nice to look at. Remember this is still early access: We've had some hilarious placeholder ms-paint stick-figure art that would be redrawn into worthwhile, lovely pixel portraits. You can watch the developer stream to see just how great the art assets become as it's being done live.\n\n*Mechanics*Despite its seemingly very simplistic design, the game coddles a sinking depth in terms of mutation selection, weapon diversity and character synergy that overlaps well with one another.\n\nMutations\nThe core component of your journeys in the wasteland. I'd categorize mutations in the following categories:\nWeaponry - Mutations that give certain weapon types added benefits\nUtility - Mutations that directly or indirectly buffs your character through various means\nSurvivability - Mutations that increases the players lifespanMutations are randomly generated out of a mix of 4 (5 for a specific character) which can provide you with a mixed variety of mutations. Each mutation handles, generally, fairly better or fairly worse for every character and finding a good synergy is key. Aside from the regular mutations, each character that reaches Level 10 (Ultra) gets to choose from 2 (3 for a specific character) Ultra Mutations. These are generally better than regular mutations and, generally, are a power spike to the character.\n\nWeapons\nAs of now, there are over 100 weapons in the game, categorized in 6 different weapon types, with multiple subcategories:\nBolt - ex. Crossbow (Bolts, Splinters, Seekers, Disc)\nBullet - ex. Machinegun (Bullets, Pellets)\nEnergy - ex. Plasma Minigun (Laser, Plasma, Lightning)\nExplosive - ex. Grenade Launcher (Launchers, Cannons)\nMelee - ex. Sledgehammer (Non-ammo, Hybrids)\nShell - ex. Shotgun (Flaming Pellets, Slugs)Many weapons perform differently under many circumstances and get better by taking the mutation for the specified weapon. Weapons are tiered and drop according to how far you have progressed in the game. To go into the details of every weapon would be exhausting and I will not do that for the sake of this already wall-of-text-y piece. (but we all know there's only one true energy weapon)\n\n*Gameplay*At its core, Nuclear Throne is a rogue-like, twinstick shooter bolstered by the accompanying variants and mechanics the game brings to the table. It's a really fast paced action shooter  with split-second decision making keeping you on your feet. Unlike most games with randomly generated variables, you don't totally live and die by the RNG. It does indeed factor into the game and what weapons, mutations, etc you get throughout a run, but usually player skill will often trump in a nerve-wracking circumstance.\n\nNuclear Throne is a game about trial and error. That is, in order to get better at the game, you will need to lose. A lot. Like I mean it, a LOT. I can recount a fair number of times I have died in situations similar to my 5th hour in the game in my nearly 500 hours of it. Half of your first few hours with the game will be spent looking at your post-death stats screen. That is how often you will be dead. You have to realize and understand how everything went wrong and learn from it.\n\nBut that's it for this review, I've spent more time than I originally planned typing this up. I hope something in this post inspires you to try the game out despite it being in early access. It's a game that is really worth the money.\n\n(tldr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(the less dishonest review)\nLightning Cannon is Jesus\nRami is RNGod\nShielders are bull ♥♥♥♥\nNecromancers are bull ♥♥♥♥\nMaggots are OP\nMultiple gold scorpion spawns is Rami showing dissatisfaction with you living\nIf you die, Rami was dissatisfied with you living.\n\n100/10 game, would be sodomized backpedaling into an assassin again.","May 17, 2015","true","273.6"," 72 of 76 people (95%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","95","72","76","31","0"

There's an incredible amount of variety in the weapons and abilities that you can find, and they get crazier as you go on!  Revolver.  Sledgehammer.  Laser rifle.  Minigun.  Energy sword.  Auto grenade shotgun.  Lightning cannon.  Each character is also completely unique, and plays very differently.  One revolves around spawning minions to assist you, while another can dual wield, an yet another can explode the corpses of defeated enemies!  You can become absurdly powerful, but you're still always vulnerable, and it's PERFECT.  If you have played some of the modern action-roguelikes that are so popular today (Binding of Isaac, Crypt of the Necrodancer), you have likely noticed that you become nearly unstoppable after a while.  In Isaac, you get Brimstone, tammy's head, and holy mantle?  You can't die.  This is not the case with Nuclear Throne!  You can launch nukes into crowds of enemies, you can spawn an entire army of allies to protect you, you can use telekinesis to push away projectiles, and yet the slightest misstep leads to a yeti hurling a car at you, putting your rampage to an explosive end.  And that explosion is going to look good, sound good, and feel good, because the visual and audio design is extremely on point.  You can really feel the power in a gun when you're shooting it.  The only reason I can think of to pass up this game is if you're just not into the challenge of it.  As I said, you can die in an instant at any moment.  You'll generally have 8 HP tops, and a standard bullet does 3 damage.  Many things deal more than that.  You do not get invincibility frames upon being hit (I THINK.  If you do, it's like 2 or 3 frames tops).  If that sounds like a dealbreaker to you, I guess this isn't your kind of game.  If that sounds exciting to you, get the game NOW!  I honestly can't recommend it enough.  Have fun!\n#VerifyVenuz\n\nEdit after full release: I'm still playing this, and it's still glorious fun!  Lots of content and tweaks have been added over the last several months, and I think it lead up to an incredibly solid final product.  If I was told right now that I could only play one game for the rest of my life, I'd probably pick Nuclear Throne.","April 2, 2015","true","570.4"," 63 of 65 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","63","65","3","2"

My playtime aside you may be wondering "Well what kind of value can I get from this game that looks like a bullet hell kind of game?"\n\nA lot.\n\nSo first off, the game is endless. That's a big score there, next off is that the game gets harder each time you go through, most of the time getting far too ridiculous by loop 6. So for the most part it lasts a very long time. Recently they've done up the co-op so that it works properly, and while my friends are scrubs and can't handle the game very much I can revive them by picking up health, which makes it playable as a couch co-op game.\n\nI don't know my exact hours on this game, but so far I'd say it has to be in the 40s so 13/40= 0.325/hour+ So for it's value it's really well worth it and still playing itself out.\n\nExactly what is this game? Bullet-Hell-rogue-like-top-down-shooter-bit-graphics game with a fair system and an artificial difficulty slide, along with a slew of good unique playable characters, complete with daily challenges/leader boards and Co-op playing.\n\nSo now the standard game rating:Story: 3/10 You and your mutant buddies have to go find the nuclear throne, on the journey there you become more and more mutated and then you do stuff like shooting things (spoilers) The story is not the very deep kind.\nGameplay: 10/10 I already explained what type of game this is, but it's both satisfying and has a high skill cap to it. You can play it to perfection and at the same time you could get royally ♥♥♥♥ed over or on the other end gifted by the gods at Vlambeer.\nPresentation: 10/10 Nothing to complain about. At all. the game looks how it should, it plays how it should and it acts how it should. I haven't come across any game breakers be it by immersion or by engine failures. Not only that but its fairly cheap on system use.\nSoundtrack: 10/10 Memorable, lovable soundtrack. I love it. Plain and simple.\nReplayability: 10/10 This is the sort of game that you play when you feel like setting a new record, or when you feel like shooting up a bunch of aliens, or when you have a friend over and you want to show them ur skillzzz All of it is worth playing over again.","May 2, 2015","true","7.9"," 59 of 62 people (95%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","95","59","62","12","0"

It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy "bullet-hell" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish "mutants", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game.\n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.","November 26, 2013","true","398.4"," 54 of 56 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","54","56","0","0"

It's a very punishing game and small mistakes can lead you to death.\n\nABOUT\nwhat is this game all about?\n\nNuclear Throne is an action shoot em' up roguelike game made by Vlambeer, where your objective is to reach the Nuclear Throne, your main enemy in the game.\n\nSTORY\ndoes this game even have a story?\n\nSome people might not know this, but this game actually has a background story. But, since this is not the main "star of the show", it's okay for the game to have a lack of detailed storyline.\n\nHumanity messed up with things and the world is nearly destroyed, although things still managed to live in such conditions. Along with creatures being mutated (and a human as well, this being Steroids), portals started to appear and those started teleporting mutants around the wasteland.\n\nA mutant called "Proto Mutant" discovered a place called The Palace, a place that is set to keep the world's balance, to keep it stable and we all know that's not the current case. Whenever a mutant stands up and gains strength enough to be able to do something against this mess that the world is, it gets sucked into a portal and disappear.\n\nOther mutants heard about this myth and about the Nuclear Throne as well, which if destroyed, the world will get stabilized again, thus the game begins... .\nThere are some more details, but it could be considered a spoiler at some point. If you're interested in knowing more about it, you could simply check the game's Wikia and find out yourself.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nwhat do I do in this game?\n\nNuclear Throne is a game with a big focus on gameplay and it would be a shame if it weren't good, right? This game has playstyle similar to the well-known Binding of Isaac, but way faster. The controls are easy to understand and are really responsive. At first, it will be a little bit boring because of the lack of things happening, but as you progress through levels, things get better and way faster! Fun and challenging.\n\nIn a nutshell: You shoot things. Things die. Get weapon upgrades and new mutations to power yourself up. Progress to the next area. Repeat until you reach the Nuclear Throne.\n\nThe sad thing about this game is that it lacks an online Multiplayer, only a local Multiplayer option, which is not that bad, but since this game requires a lot of precision and quick responses, using a gamepad to play with someone else is a pain in the ♥♥♥, unless you manage to use two keyboards and two mices.\n\nSOUNDTRACK & SOUNDS\nhow's the music and sound effects?\n\nVlambeer did an awesome job with the soundtrack the same way they did with GUN GODZ and their other games, the musics and songs fit really well. Boss battles, areas and everything else. And the mutants' voices and sound effects, like weapons and such are really well made as well.\n\nGRAPHICS\nwow, next gen. graphics plz!1!\n\nYou can probably tell that this game has pixelated graphics and, if you're a fan of super detailed and realistic graphics, this is not for you. The sprites in the game are well-made, the scenarios are great and suit each enemey very well. Also, their promotional art is awesome!\n\nDIFFICULTY\nhow difficult is this anyway?\n\nOkay, so, if there's a negative review out there, it probably is because of the difficulty and learning curve on this game. This is a really punishing game and little mistakes will make you get to the start of the game within a second, you must be cautious and think fast. As mentioned above, if you're a person that gets mad really fast or dislike games that are really difficult, you should probably avoid this.\n\nREPLAY VALUE\nhow many hours can I put in this?\n\nIt's a "short" game and you are going to die A LOT, I assure you, if this game didn't have a great replay value, it would be absolute sh*t. If you enjoyed your first runs, you're probably going to enjoy the rest of it, since you're always progressing through the game, learning new things, trying out other mutants and mutations, yada, yada.\n\nPERSONAL OPINION\nwhat do you thinka 'bout the game after all?\n\nMore like a TL;DR, I guess. It's an awesome game with fast gameplay, charming graphics, responsive controls and incredible replay value, I highly recommend it if you're a big fan of the genre, and, since it finally released, there's no need for you to be hesitant about the early access part. Vlambeer will probably keep updating the game, so, there's much more content to come and much more to enjoy. Also, if you know and enjoyed the abovementioned Binding of Isaac and want to "spice things up" and have a more "breathtaking" experience, give this game a shot.\n\nThere are also some other aspects of this game that might be a turnoff to some people, such as: no widescreen option and 30 fps cap. Just wanted to point it out, since some dislike this.","February 5, 2015","true","77.4"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","54","58","3","9"

I promptly checked it out and was not impressed at first and thought "Why buy this game when I can just play Binding of Isaac?" The answer to that question is fairly simple. Nuclear Throne takes the charm and bullet hell fun of BoI and adapts it (or mutates it) into a whole nother experience and game.\n\nI was gifted the game but for a while I did not play the game simply saying "I don't have time for a BoI clone". After putting in 11 hours over 2 weeks I can safely say that I was wrong and I honestly enjoy this game very much.\n\nThe Community is very active and very kind to everyone and honestly one of the best gaming commuities I have seen. They're all very excited about the game and very active. Some people have made mods for Nuclear Throne but I have yet to download one.\n\n\nStory:\n\nThe lore is currently in the wiki but has not been applied to the game yet. However, the story does not take/give any enjoyment to the game so that is a huge plus. You can load into the game and not have to worry about advancing in the story or missing dialogue.\n\nCharacters:\n\nThere are a wide assortment of playable characters, currently at 12. Each character has unique passive and actives so that playing each character is like playing a new game. Each characters active is gamechanging and are useful in their own ways (except Plant's. Because ♥♥♥♥ you Plant. I don't need your stupid snare in my life all you're doing is holding me down)\n\nFor the sake of simplicity I'm not going to list each character out but I can say that I have played each character over 20 times and even then I feel as though I only have a basic understanding of how to use them.\n\nMy current favorite character to use is Rebel, her healing when you enter portals is one of the most useful passives if you are as reckless as me when playing. Her active ability allows her to sacrifice health to summon a minion who will aid you in your battle before exploding dealing more damage to surrounding enemies.\n\nSome fan favorites are Steroids, Y.V., and Crystal and there are so many well drawn fan art of the game to show people's love for all the different characters.\n\nSound:\n\nThe music in the game is definitely one good thing amongst a lot of good things about this game. Each level has a unique song that plays while you desperate shoot your way to the throne. Each song fits it's level well and when I first started, I found myself hating the music because at times I find myself being pressured by the music and dying. But now when I play I find myself humming along as I shoot enemies in the face.\n\nMutations:\n\nEverytime you kill an enemy they drop something called rads (radiation). Each rad you collect goes torward leveling up. If you level up once you finish the level (aka enter the portal) you can pick a mutation (they're like perks). There are weapon based perks (homing bolts, shotgun shells bounce farther, energy weapons deal more damage) and there are basic mutations (more health, enemies have less health, move faster, chance of ammo on kills.\n\nEach mutation will help you get to the throne but like most games there are some mutations that are better than others. Currently, it's advised not to take the weapon mutations unless you are 100% sure that you're going to keep that weapon for the rest of the game.\n\nThere are also canisters that give you a lot of rads.\n\nWhen a character reaches level 10 you can choose a Ultra mutation that are a huge power spike to the character.\n\nWeapons:\n\nAt the time of writing this review, there are 104 weapons able to be found in the game. The devs have promised to add more which is incredible. The basic weapon classes are Bullet, Shell, Bolt, Explosive, Energy, and Melee. There are subcatagories in these ammo catagories and each gun feels different to use.\n\nMy personal favorites are the Assault Rifle (there are a lot of guns that "outclass  and outdamage this gun but I love the 3 bullet burst) and the Heavy Auto Crossbow (the heavy cross bow is pretty much a 1 shot on all enemy minions and it takes down the bosses in a few shots. The auto portion makes it so that you can kill them faster).\n\nSome weapons are known to be bad such as the smg (too much ammo is being wasted in a non accurate fire) and the laser pistol because the damage feels minisicule and it takes far too long in between shots. You can find ammo and weapons in chests.\n\nMechanics:\n\nThe game plays like a Rogue-like, top down shooter. You're expected to die a lot and the game is simple enough to play over and over again in short bursts. When I first started what I used to do was cover shoot from afar. I soon found out that this was not a good tactic because it led to me being able to be swarmed and I could not collect rads/ammo/guns.\n\nThe tactic that works best for me is to run around and don't be afraid to get too close to the mobs because most of the time you can dodge what's coming at you and you need to collect all the rads. It's better to find your own playstyle and the game is all about trial and error. Make a mistake once? Don't do it again.\n\nThere's also a daily run. Meaning once a day you're given the same seed as everyone else and see how you rank against them. It's pretty fun to wait to play your next daily and see yourself go up the ranks.\n\nCons:\n\nThere's very little that I can complain about the game. It's fairly polished looks great. However, little does not mean none.\n\n4/10 times you're going to die/get really injured because you spawned in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ place. I once had a run where I spawned in the middle of the map surrounded by scorpions.\n\nThe game is on the border of becoming a bullet hell. Enemies will fire at you from halfway across the map often times cornering you.\n\nSometimes the framerate will go to ♥♥♥♥ (mostly during explosions) and might cause you to die.\n\nYou can't really change the resolution. I have a 1366x768 monitor but the game does not play in that. The highest resolution I get is 1920x1200 and even that looks a bit meh.\n\nThe game looks to have a low learning curve but the first 10-20 runs are going to be you staring at the post death stats screen. You need to push yourself not to give up at first but once the ball gets rolling Nuclear Throne becomes a game that you'll definitely look forward to playing often.\n\nWrap Up\n\nOverall, I think that Nuclear Throne is definitely one of the best rogue-likes I personally, have ever played and it is definitely worth the $15 that the devs ask for. Especially since on release the game will cost more. I highly reccomend you pick this up even if you played Binding of Isaac once and thought it was ok. This game has the potential to become as popular if not more than BoI (not that BoI isn't amazing too). The problems I had with the game were minor and did not take me away from the game.\n\nThe devs have promised the community many things and I see them going through with their promises so I think that's really cool of Vlambeer (nearly all of their games are fun to play)\n\nAgain, I found myself very pleased by the game and will definitely be playing more of it.\n","June 4, 2015","true","33.1"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","45","46","4","3"

Different characters (more still being added), randomly generated levels and random mutations as you progress make each playthrough different, and allow you to experiment with different playstyles, though there are different 'areas' that keep consistent style over the course of a few levels.\n\nJust to give you an idea of how different each game can be/how awesome the designs are, these are the current mutants you can play as:\n\n-Fish, who gets more ammo than the other characters, and can use his roll to dodge bullets.\n-Crystal, who has more health than the others, and can become an invulnerable shield which deflects bullts.\n-Eyes, who can see in the dark and can use his telekinetic powers to pull enemies toward him and push projectiles away.\n-Melting, a skeleton with melted flesh hanging off, has the lowest HP, but mutates faster and can blow up corpses.\n-Plant, a sentient plant that can move faster than the others, and snare enemies with his roots.\n-Y.V., a weird looking illuminati pyramid with an eyeball, can shoot faster than the others, and use his ablility to shoot twice with one pull of the trigger.\n-Steroids, a beefed up dude that starts with two fully loaded pistols and the ability to use both of the weapons he can carry at once.\n-Robot, who can find better weapons, and recycle found items into ammo for another weapon he carries, or health.\n-Chicken, a mutant chicken that starts wielding a katana and can slow down time. Chicken's other ability allows her to live a few seconds after death, and gives you a little time to go berserk, a headless chicken with a katana, hacking frantically, hoping for a health drop to bring her back from death.\n-Rebel, an ex-bandit who can sacrifice her health to summon allies, and blasts in all directions when hit.\n-Horror, a radioactive mutant dog(?) that can use radiation collected to launch a wave of destruction at his enemies.\n\nThe designs are creative and fun, the art is great, the music and sounds keep things frantic and intense, the gameplay is solid, and most important of all, it's incredibly fun. This is one of the best games to come out this year, and if it looks interesting to you, grab it right now.\n\nThe throne definitely exists.","December 11, 2013","true","58.4"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","46","48","0","4"

Fish can Roll.\n\nThe gameplay is simplistic, it's sort of a bullet hell, having a low amount of HP and enemies attacking you from every direction. Some enemies charge at you, other attack you from a distance, others spew fire and others blow up. The game is separeted in 8 areas, having 4 areas with 3 levels in a row and other 4 with 1 level, and each of them having a respective secret are and 2 areas having a special Crown Vault with modifiers for your playthrough. Fish can Roll.\n\nThe mutants are each specially made for a special type of player. Fish is mobile and gets a lot of ammo, Crystal is a Tank, Melting is a Glass Cannon, Steroids is a ammo-hose, Rebel is a summoner, and Rogue is hard-mode. They're all built for different players and different playstyles. Each character has a special passive and a special active (right click) and there are 2 secret characters and 1 of them isn't available from the start. Also, if you're playing Y.V., pressing B will give you a golden version of your current gun. Also, fish can roll.\n\nThe game has very simplistic controls, WASD and shooting with left click. That's it. The graphics is classic and beautiful pixel-art. The music is very atmospheric (I love Y.V.s Mansion's theme) and puts you in the place of the mutant you're playing. The game has a special seed for each day to compete agaisnt other players and a special seed with restricted starting character and crowns. Press right click as fish to roll.\n\nThe bosses are unique and have a "charm" to their areas. For example, the wasteland boss is a bigger and more powerful bandit with a machinegun. The wasteland boss is a giant 3-headed pitbull mutated dog. The game has a leveling system where you collect radiation to get mutations, and after 8 mutations you get a specific "Ultra" mutation for you character.\nThe game also encourages ammo management, as it is a issue on the wasteland. Rolling can be done as fish.\n\nAfter the game is beaten (you reach the Nuclear Throne and things happen) you can do something special at the final boss to "loop" the game, where you can beat the game again, but a lot harder and with 3 special new bosses and police going after you like crazy. This is great for highscorers, since the game has no end and you get a very high score depending on your skill. All in all, great game and should definately be played.

The community is amazing, and Vlambeer is heavily involved. They update the game every week, and they are significant updates each time! It is exciting to be a part of.\n\nThis game rivals Spelunky in both difficulty and replayability. And that is while it's still in beta.\nWhere it already has a leg up, however, is the insane amount of playstyles and builds that you can find while playing, due to a variety of unique characters, (9 so far) unique weapons, (~40 so far) mutations for your character (24), special unlockable "golden" weapons, and special unlockable crowns that alter the way the game rules work.\n\nIt is the best bullet hell game I have ever played.

Nuclear Throne is another great game by one of my favorite developer teams, Vlambeer. You're a mutant stuck in the wasteland with all of your friends, and you've all heard the tale of the Nuclear Throne. Some think it's a bunch of baloney, others think that it really exists, and a few mutants are going to go out of their way to get to it. You are one of those few mutants. One of those few mutants, who is also really well balanced with the other mutants in terms of power.\n\nNOTE: If the character's name has a star (*) next to it in the list, then it means it's one of my favorites.\n\nFISH*: Once a police officer, now turned into a scaly fish-man on the last day before his retirement. He gets more ammo from all sources of the stuff, and can roll out of danger.\n\nCRYSTAL: An okay mutant for the new players, Crystal gets more HP and can briefly shield herself to block almost all attacks. After all, "Crystal can handle this." Though, don't get too attached to her shield, or you might not be the best at dodging.\n\nEYES*: He has a deep backstory, according to the devs, but he doesn't have a mouth to speak about it. He can see much clearer in the dark levels like the Sewers, and he can use telekinesis to drag enemies towards him and projectiles away from him. He is super underrated.\n\nMELTING: The wind hurts. Everything hurts. Melting is tired. Melting starts out with 2 HP (keep in mind, most projectiles do 3 damage), but to balance that out, he gets more radiation (in other words, experience), and can blow up corpses for immense damage potential. You should really get acquainted with the game before you try him out!\n\nPLANT*: Assuming you've gotten pretty good at this game, Plant is basically the anti-bad RNG character. He's extra fast, and can also trap enemies with vine snares. KILL KILL KILL.\n\nYUNG VENUZ*: Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Gun God! He has a faster rate of fire, as well as being able to fire two shots at once (with double the reload time, of course). Also, he doesn't even die. Whenever you reach 0 HP, he just gets frustrated with himself and goes home to his mansion.\n\nSTEROIDS*: He was the only human who came prepared. He predicted the apocalypse and pumped himself full of steroids to survive. Every weapon he holds is fully automatic and he can dual-wield, but he has less accuracy to compensate.\n\nROBOT: An automaton straight from the future. He finds better weapons earlier, and can eat guns if he doesn't like 'em (robots can digest anything, according to the game).\n\nCHICKEN: A samurai chicken. Enough said. She's another good mutant to start with (yes, SHE), as she starts out with her good ol' sword and can throw her weapons! If her health reaches zero, she simply becomes beheaded and you will need to collect a medkit within 3 seconds! During this time, the screen does not move and you can kill everything you'd like to. Upon getting beheaded, you'll have two less max HP, and lost max HP can be restored with the mutation "Last Wish" or by getting a big medkit.\n\nREBEL: A bandit who detached from the group, she's found home around the campfire of mutants. She's probably one of the most fun to play as if you can get her late game. She heals when she goes through portals, and she can spawn allies to help her.\n\nROGUE: Similar to Rebel, Rogue is a cop that, as her name says, went rogue and left the Interdimensional Police Department (I.D.P.D). As a result, she is constantly being hunted throughout the adventure by the po-po. To combat them, she comes equipped with a weapon she stole after leaving, the Portal Strike, which has potential for immense damage.\n\n[CLASSIFIED]: A living blob of [CLASSIFIED], [CLASSIFIED] can fire a beam of [CLASSIFIED] to kill stuff. He also gets an extra [CLASSIFIED] to choose from. He's a secret!\n\n[CLASSIFIED]: Basically the worst character in the game. He's a super secret that you get while playing as [CLASSIFIED] if you die inside of a [CLASSIFIED]. He starts out with less health, speed, and accuracy, and his ability allows him to [CLASSIFIED] with a chance of taking 1 point of damage.\n\n[CLASSIFIED]*: One of my favorites, he is immune to [CLASSIFIED], and can fart out the stuff he's immune to! Sadly, he can never stop [CLASSIFIED]. You get him by damaging [CLASSIFIED] at least once with a golden weapon, keeping that golden weapon to the end of the fight, and picking up the [CLASSIFIED] that the [CLASSIFIED] drops. Take it to a [CLASSIFIED] and put it in a [CLASSIFIED], then go to the same [CLASSIFIED] with a different character and open up the [CLASSIFIED] to get a [CLASSIFIED]. Keep it to the next level and you will be able to play as [CLASSIFIED] once you select the [CLASSIFIED]!\n\nPROS:\n-Replayability is off the charts!\n-Graphics, gameplay, and music are all really enjoyable.\n-Good variety of... everything!\n-Nice team of developers.\n\nCONS:\n-RNG can screw you over, and does so way too often.\n-Has a chronic disease of NEVER TELLING YOU WHAT ANYTHING DOES (I.E. snipers are OBVIOUSLY suicide-bombers, obviously...)\n-Don't have quick reflexes? You're dead already.\n\n\nIf you're a fan of rogue-likes, buy this game. Go. Buy it.\n\nDon't keep staring at this review.\n\nShove your wallet in to the computer.\n\n\nGo.\n\nNow.","February 26, 2015","true","300.5"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","39","40","9","4"

Let me give you my gaming context for this review, I am an adult gamer, I have been gaming since I was in first grade and my parents bought me an NES. I've played through the subsequent console generations and of course I have always been a PC gamer.\n\nSo it is within that context that I saw Nuclear Throne easily makes my top 20 games of all time list. This game is still in early access yet has a great amount of depth, polish, and "feel".\n\nIt is a top down shooter, you can play it as a twn stick though mouse and keyboard is recommended. You choose from among several class all with unique abilities that will inform your play style. As befits a rogue-lite it has random generation, punishing difficulty, and leveling with each level allowing you to choose from among a small pool of mutations.\n\nThis game has sucked me in, I am fast approaching 300 hours in it. Even as you die you will be hitting R to restart and get right back into the action. Eventually you will learn how to play well and even defeat the throne and start looping. They have a daily challenge now, like Spelunky and the continue to work on this game, adding content and polish, long after it could be considered a compete game.\n\nIf you like old school games, if you like fast paced games, if you like addictive games designed by people who really know what moment to moment gameplay should feel like, then buy this game. This is an instant classic.","March 9, 2015","true","747.0"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","38","40","4","0"

Throw in an insane difficulty level, procedural level generation and a vast array of secrets and you have a title that will have you putting yourself into its mercy time and time again.\n\nThe way the levels are generated assures that the weapons, upgrades and enemies the game throws at you will always feel fresh. It also forces you to adapt to a large number of possible scenarios, most of which require pretty fast reactions to survive. The learning curve is steep, hitpoints are low, enemies are relentless and you can expect to have your ego crushed a lot, but if it's something that you are comfortable to see through then progress becomes just that little bit more rewarding. Oh, and say goodbye to immunity frames.\n\nVisually the game is very neat, with a pixel-proud charm that doesn't come at the cost of slowing down the action. Music  is well done and the sound effects / enemy sounds are all great. All the characters now also have their own unique voices (by some notable names in the VG voice-over scene) which really adds to the overall feel.\n\nPerformance-wise there have been no problems, runs well and no bugs encountered so far despite being in early access. Both controller and mouse + keyboard layouts are supported, and the game is always going to respond to your inputs immediately. Very important for a game with a pace this high.\n\nRecommended if you're a fan of roguelikes or twitchy shooters as a whole, or if you're just looking for something to remind you what the word "challenge" really means. Not recommended if the thought of replacing any part of your PC after an incident of rage is a turnoff.","November 1, 2015","true","201.3"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","36","38","5","0"

The RNG is acceptable enough, you usually get at least something you'll like by the time it actually matters.\n\nYou never feel cheated by the game. Any time you fail, it's almost certainly your fault. I can think of exactly one instance where the game becomes unfair, and that's with IDPD Vans. But those only appear much later into the game, and... hopefully they're being fixed soon.\n\nOverall, NT is an excellent game which follows a tenant I hold dear: "It's okay to do only one thing, as long as you do that one thing spectacularly." NT is the same thing over and over again at its very core, but that one thing is so satisfying and JUST varied enough in its own ways that it has a lot of replay value. It tests your skill without being unfairly difficult, it offers responsive and very fast-paced gameplay, and it's everything you probably want from a shooter like this.\n\nI would strongly suggest it.","January 25","true","353.9"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","38","44","2","0"

Eva Kazowski","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shayodarkleaf/","156 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPlease note that this is a spoiler free review; no story elements, secrets or special weapons are spoiled.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nNuclear Throne is a top-down shooter, in which you control a mutant (or a fugitive running from the popo), with the goal of killing everything in sight, and finishing your journey to the fabled Nuclear Throne. In your task, you are aided by a metric ton of possible weapons, ranging from revolvers, all the way to nuke launchers, and anything in between. Generally, if you can imagine it, it's there. To those favoring a more hack and slash gameplay style, melee weapons are also present.\n\nThe character you pick will influence your playstyle significantly, as each of them brings an active, and a passive ability to the table. Currently there are 12 characters in the game, with 6 unlocked from the start. Five of the six starting characters are easy to pick up and play in terms of mechanics:\n\n- Fish collects more ammo, and, as the loading screen kindly tells you a million times, "Fish can roll".\n- Crystal starts with 10 HP instead of 8, and has the ability to encase herself in a hunk of crystal, reflecting shots\n- Y.V. (Yung Venuz), the Gun God himself, has a faster rate of fire than the rest. His active ability is firing his weapon twice, with double the cooldown (affected by the fire rate reduction). He can also press B to airhorn, which should be a core feature in every game.\n- Steroid has no active ability; instead, his passive allows him to fire two weapons at the same time, in exchange for worse accuracy.\n- Chicken starts with a sword, instead of the usual Revolver. Her passive allows her to survive a lethal hit, by literally running around like a headless chicken. If she picks up health from any source, she'll survive, and take a -1 max HP penalty. She can also throw weapons Hotline Miami style, which is extremely effective in the early game.\n\nEvery stage, your main task is to blow everything the Hell up, and collect whatever you can to help you do that on future stages; radiation canisters (this game's experience equivalent), weapons, ammunition, medkits, and so on. Once you kill everything, a portal spawns near the corpse of your last slain enemy, and starts dragging you in. Enter, and you're whisked away to the next stage. (Possibly a secret area.. If you found one of them!)\n\nIf you've collected enough canisters to level up, you can choose one of four random mutations. All of these mutations are a large boon, that'll help you both short and longterm. There's quite the variety as well; each weapon category has it's own related mutation (example: Bolt Marrow apparently replaces your bone marrow with crossbow bolts [don't even ask how that's possible], causing your bolts to have slight homing capabilities; Laser Brain amps up the damage of your energy weapons, Long Arms increases your melee swing range, etc), as well as several more 'generic' ones (such as Second Stomach, which doubles the health you get from medkits, Rabbit Paw, which causes more items to drop, etc).\n\nThe mutations are varied, and powerful enough, that you have to make tough decisions when leveling up, however, there's not so many of them, that you can't aim for a specific playstyle.\n\nI didn't talk much about the actual combat itself - that's because there's not much to talk about. It's extremely simple, however, that is a compliment in this case. The game is a perfect example of the expression "elegance in simplicty", as the game's narrow focus means that the action is fast-paced, exciting, and extremely hectic. Patterns are predictable, however, the sheer number of enemies you fight at times, coupled with the fact that you NEED to collect those radiation canisters means that you're constantly making life and death decisions, on the fly, under a split-second. Hesitate, and you can either lose out on an advantage you desperately need, or die. The weapons are, for the most part, satisfying to use, and most importantly, consistent.\n\nOne interesting thing is that guns themselves don't vary much in terms of raw damage output. A basic Shotgun deals the exact same damage per pellet as higher tier ones, a Revolver does the same damage per shot as a Minigun does, and so on (There are exceptions to this, however); thanks to this, even if you've never picked up a weapon, you generally have a very good idea on how much damage it'll actually do to whatever you point it at. Upgrades still feel extremely satisfying, however; despite the ammunition itself dealing the same damage, the overall damage output always increases significantly. You will have to combat the increased ammo consumption, but generally your mutations tend to help out with that.\n\nEvery third level, you will face a level boss. They will not be spoiled.\n\nRinse, repeat, until you reach the Nuclear Throne.\n\nGRAPHICS\nSimplistic. However, it is extremely charming. If you're not a fan of sprite-based graphics, look elsewhere. If you are into it, you'll dig the sprites in some cases; the mutants themselves are rather creative, and the enemy design is okay at worst, and "HOLY ♥♥♥♥ WHAT IS THAT" at best. My personal favorite pieces of the art in this game are, funnily enough, shown in the first few seconds of the game: the character select screen. You get to watch your cast of mutants lounging around a campfire, doing their own thing (amusingly, their locations on the screen are randomly generated, too); selecting them results in a fighting game style character overlay. It's quite charming.\n\nSOUND AND MUSIC DESIGN\nNo shooty-shooty-bang-bang game is complete without sounds, and tunes.\n\nThe gun sound effects are actually surprisingly good. The audio feedback is excellent; even your starting weapon, the Revolver, sounds satisfying to use, higher tier weapons sound sufficiently devastating. It's a hard one to talk about without hearing the audio itself, so I apologize if the description is generic. Special mention goes to the sound effects you hear when you select a mutation - each of them have an associated sound clip, that's meant to represent the changes your mutant is undergoing.\n\nThe music... Oh, man, where do I even begin.\n\nPersonally, I'm infatuated with what the devs put on the table - or at least the idea of what they were trying to do. I sincerely recommend looking up the soundtrack on YouTube if you plan to read the rest of this section, as none of what I'll say make sense without.\n\nThe main theme itself is one of the most enchanting pieces I've ever heard in a game of this type. It's atmospheric, and it sets the mood perfectly well.\n\nHowever, the audio quality drops massively when you actually enter the game; while the tunes themselves are extremely catchy, and complement the game perfectly, it is hamstrung by the low fidelity of it; synthetized, grainy sounding drums, generic, MIDI-sounding choirs. The guitar tracks, which are the only thing that sounds legitimately recorded, is excellent.\n\nIt's an interesting design choice that they chose all three bossfights to have the same main motif, with alterations on the track to more accurately represent the boss and the zone you fight them in. A nice touch.\n\nI sincerely hope that they'll re-do the soundtrack before release, and pay someone to record a real drum track, as it's a huge flaw. Still extremely enjoyable despite that, if you're not an audiophile.\n\nVERDICT\nIf you couldn't tell by now, I'll spell it out for you: despite some of it's flaws, I ADORE this title. I've written this review after 25 hours, and I just can't stop playing it, no matter how many times I see the words: YOU HAVE NOT REACHED THE NUCLEAR THRONE.\n\nIt's one of the most polished Early Access titles; for $12, you'll get a lot of value out of your money, if you're into this type of game. The dev support for the game is great, they DO listen to feedback, and it shows.\n\nIf this is your jam; buy it.","June 20, 2015","true","74.5"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","26","26","0","0"

But with a reputable developer like Vlambeer, who have delivered games that feel like, well, actual games, I was pretty sure I would get my moneys worth. And if I were to stop playing the game now, it still would have made it worth the purchase. Luckily, Vlambeer has been consistently updating the game on an (almost always) weekly basis with new content being added all the time. They take criticism to heart and listen to the players.\n\nThe action roguelite gameplay allows for a variety of gameplay styles within the somewhat limited top-down shooter style, but a variety of "Mutations"(that function like perks which alter your statistics, abilities and expands and also limits how you play) which you are given the choice between when you level up can dramatically alter your plans. Even if you decided on a "melee" character, the selection of mutations you are given as you level up might not cater to that playstyle at all, nor might you get the preferred weapons for how you intended to play in the first place, so the game is dynamic and spontaneous in that it can crash your plans and force you to re-consider your strategy throughout your game.\n\nPermadeath keeps you at your toes. You can forget about checkpoints. This is good because modern games are plagued with these and they make your actions have less consequences. Vlambeer brings back the thrill of old school gaming, and the high-risk/high-reward mechanics is something that draws people to roguelites.\n\nNow to the negatives.\n\nThere are balancing issues in the game, sometimes game breaking generation parameters that can give you a seemingly impossible spawn. This has been heavily debated on the forums. This is an obvious problem area when you combine a bullet-hell shooter with a randomly generated roguelite, but Vlambeer have taken the criticism to heart and have improved on the generation parameters throughout the game development and continue to do so consistently.\n\nThere are also the obvious limitations and confines of the gamemaker engine, which Vlambeer insists on using. The game is locked to 30fps which is downright horrible on the eyes for extended playing sessions. The slideshow effect and clumsiness of this low a framerate is very detrimental to a genre that requires the player to be observant and react quickly. What makes it problematic for gamemaker creators to increase the framerate is that a lot of events are executed per-frame through the step event. This basically means that the devs have to re-write every part of the code that utilizes the step event and change it if the game was to run at, say 60fps. It is a shame that on a dynamic platform like the PC that a game is locked to perform like that.\n\nThere are also balancing issues between characters. Vlambeer seem stubborn on keeping some characters underpowered(Fish being the number one example) because they insist on keeping useless active abilities that nobody actually finds useful which becomes ridiculously underpowered in comparison to other characters abilities. At one point, some characters were ridiculously overpowered, like Rebel and Chicken. They were both nerfed, which somehow changed completely the way people play and sort of took away the novelty and personality of said characters. But I must add that criticism like this is aimed at something that takes time to perfect and that there is no one right answer to. You always give some and lose some with such decisions.\n\nTo sum it up, I have gotten my moneys worth at least two times over and I intend to also purchase the game again for the PS4 platform, even with the negatives mentioned because the game is still very fun to play.\n\nThe game keeps becoming more polished and new features are always added, so I am confident that the game will be great at release. It's just a shame about the framerate. I think it's important to know that a game is locked to 30fps before purchasing.","May 3, 2015","true","149.3"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","24","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Error666_UserNotKnown/recommended/242680/","Error666_UserNotKnown","Sensei Aaron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Error666_UserNotKnown/","235 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter playing a bit more of this, I can honestly say that this game is fun. It's a run-and-gun rpg bullet hell roguelike shoot-em-up from my own backyard (because Holland is about the size of a typical backyard). There are many aspects to making a game, and all of those (or at least most) have to be met in order for a game to be truly good. This game does just that. It takes every single one of my conditions for a good game and fills them in. Twice. Actually, I have two sets of conditions for the only two types of games that can ever be truly amazing: story-driven open world and hard-core skill & reflex fest. And it must also not be Call of Duty because that game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks balls. Anyway, this game falls into the second category, and let me explain what my criteria are and how it completely shreks the hell outta them. Unlike Call of Duty.\n\nEnemies. Any self-respecting game needs tons of varied enemies to keep things interesting and to make a natural transition to more difficult gameplay. Don't just add lvl. 44 to your opponent and give him more health and damage, make a new one! With different attack plans, weapons, health and speed. That's how you justify harder enemies, not by giving him a higer number. This game gets that, and every stage has it's own set of mortifying enemies that are designed especially to work on every nerve in your body. It's annoying to have to get to learn every opponent by dying from them first, but that's how it works. Nothing in life ever goes well on the first try. Except Call of Duty that stupid half-♥♥♥♥♥ piece of ♥♥♥♥! Ah that game is really getting on my nerves hrrrrrgghhh...\n\nDifficulty. In order for a game to actually be satisfying it has to be hard. Have you ever felt proud after you have eaten a banana? No? Wanna know why not? Because even a monkey could do it. It's not hard, it's not special, anyone could do it. Just like beating Call of Duty. It's not rewarding to do something anyone could do, it's only rewarding when you put time and effort into it. When you have thought about that glorious moment of opening a banana every second for the past 4 months of pure struggling. When you have longed for the taste of a banana for all that time. That's when eating a banana feels good, and that's what REAL men go for. And that struggle is exactly what makes Nuclear Throne rewarding to loop. That's right, Nuclear Throne is in fact unbeatable, for it has no end.\n\nWeapons. Preferrably of varied rarerity. A good selection of guns, of which at least a few hard to get, makes any game more enjoyable. It is necessary in games that are intended for replay, since playing the same game over and over again requires at least some aspect of variety. Hence the perks, random levels and tons of weapons. It's all there to keep you, the paying consumer, indulged in the game so that you'll tell your friends how cool it is and they would buy it too. Variety is the spice of life, they say, and I think the best example of that is having lots of guns in a run-and-gun rpg bullet hell roguelike shoot-em-up type of game.\n\nA good game also requires some type of milestones to help players remember that they ARE making progress! In this game that is done with levels and bosses. Anytime you beat one, you will know again that you have become better, encouraging you to play some more (and tell your friends about it)!\n\nFurthermore, under no circumstance should a good game ever be Call of Duty. Fortunately, this game is in fact NOT Call of Duty, and therefore meets this condition.\n\nI would have a few more criteria, but I think those speak for themselves. Anyway, there you have it, a great game and the reasons why! I do encourage you to go out and buy this game, even though it is not finished yet. It is already immense fun and more than worth your while and money.","October 14, 2014","true","28.6"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","37","46","0","1"

Great job from developers who know how early access should look like. Game feels like it is finished already (at least for me).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fluury/recommended/242680/","Fluury","Fluury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fluury/","114 products in account","Don't let yourself get fooled by the bright blue thumb up, this game is/was a wild train-ride which ended in a crash. Pun intended.\n\n(If U99/U100 fixes ♥♥♥♥, Ill update this review.)\n\n>>Emotional backstory, if you wanna read the review, scroll down.<<\n\nYou put a certain level of trust in a dev when you buy an early access game, and honestly, I thought that trust I put into Nuclear Throne and Vlambeer was well put with what they did. They communicated with the community, they did weekly dev streams and weekly updates. You really felt like you were part of the development. I have never seen any other devs do the entire early access thing this good, and to this date I hope for it to eventually be the standard.\n\nNearing the end of 2015, it all started to get downhill. Several issues addressed by a lot of players back then were said to be fixed "in the polishing phase" - right now, we had the "feature and content phase" - so balance, bugs, crashes etc. were to be fixed by then. The problem was that the so called "polishing phase" never really came alongside of other expectations raised by the dev, like full-seeding-support, or other things, like balance-overhauls of areas and other things. There was an insane amount of potential for Nuclear Throne, and the community reported and helped the devs more than enough to make the fullest out of that potential.\n\nNot saying they didn't do anything, though,  there was a certain level of polish done, some bugs were fixed, some details like\nravens leaving feathers added. Major crashes, some people literally being unable to play the game and other bugs though? Completely ignored. I didn't mind back then, since the game was in early access - and its completely acceptable for a game in early access to have crashes and bugs, since you know.\n\nAn early access game can have bugs and crashes, since its unfinished. A released game however says that the game is done - little bugs and crashes are supposed to be there.\n\nSo, around the end of 2015, the devs further and further pushed to release, constantly threw the sentence "we are almost done guys!" - which was followed by an insane amount of negativity by the community. Understandably, since, as I already said, there were tons of bugs, crashes and balance issues still to be fixed. No way they'll release the game like that - that's atleast what I thought, since I still trusted Vlambeer in their decision.\n\nUntil the shocking date of the 5th December - around 5 months have passed since the release. Remember that number, it'll become relevant later. That is when they announced the release of the game for both the PC and consoles, and that is when people started loosing their ♥♥♥♥. The extremely negative stigma and feeling of disappointment really got onto some people, understandably, since the game is in a broken state.\n\n"uhh buddy, ya sure you didn't mean "back then" ? - I mean, 5 months have passed, s-surely they fi - "\n\nNope. Some people still cant play the game, several people still crash, and people still get a frozen screen.\n\nThis is not me complaining about the broken balance of the game (which you have lots of) - but me complaining about a game said to be "released" to have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of bugs and crashes. I'm not overreacting either, you have lots of jokesters saying "B-but, it isnt that bad!" - It is that bad - Hell, one of the main reasons I stopped doing Dailies is because 30% of my daily runs end in a freeze, followed up with a death screen.\n\nAnd don't let me get started on the console version of the game, that version has its own set of issues like the player not being able to select their starting weapon, crown or skin - btw, these people have not even received both of the tiny updates which fixed maybe 5% of the issues available - reminder, 5 months have passed.\n\n--- And the ride is still going for both the PC Version and the console version. Both versions are still screwed, and while the changelog of Update 99 looks pretty, it's already sad that it takes over 5 months to fix insane issues.\n\nI'll put it like STAR_, an ex-Nuclear Throne Streamer said it when he streamed the game after a long pause :\n\n"Game was more stable and better 3 months ago."\n\n------------------------------\n\nNow, the game ; Let's talk about the game, the main thing you are here I'll assume.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fluid Controls and Game-feel.\n- Wide selection of Weapons.\n- Lots of Characters and combinations to try out.\n- Dailies and Weeklies (Runs where everyone has the "same Seed" (<- Not really since Seeds are broken.) which end up with your score (Right now : Kills.) being submitted to a leaderboard and www.thronebutt.com )  add extra replayability and competition which encourages improvement.\n- Sound effects are tastier than Guy Fieri's hottest hits.\n\nNeutral:\n\n- Mediocre amount of perks upon leveling up + them not being really balanced leaves up for a very limited amount of viable perks, thus runs end up feeling the same.\n- Pixel art tastes differently in everyone's mouth, while I like it most of it, I wouldnt call it amazing.\n- Same goes for the Music. It's good if you'd ask me, but nothing too amazing.\n- It's a difficult game. If you are a soft-bean which wants to be spoonfed, this isn't the game for you. Can and will likely get insanely frustrating.\n- While Roguelike elements are there, it is not enough to make the game not feel repetitive for most at the end.\n- Crowns (Gameplay modifiers) are the definition of missed potential.\n\nNegative:\n\n- 30 FPS.\n- No widescreen Support.\n- Several Bugs and crashes which have been reported several times are still not fixed. Some Features even unfinished.\n- Late-game and perk-balance is far from a good state.*\n\n* This ♥♥♥♥ will have a lot of Spoilers about late-game, so if you wanna explore that yourself, lemme sum it up : Expect terrible balance of both enemies and weapons.\n\nI don't know what happened to the idea of Loops, I suppose it was rushed like the entire game was. Another thing pushed back to "we'll do that later" - only to be ended up half-♥♥♥♥♥. The main idea back then was "Less-enemies, less randomness, more Elites! The Elites are the thing making the Loops hard, har har!" - however that transformed into "We can't be bothered to make more Elite enemies which is why we made 6 and then just added enemies out of secret areas and left the rest pretty much as it is"\nThe Quality of the Elite enemies we got sunk and sunk until we got nothing, too. It first started with Elite IDPD, which were cool with their own unique sprites and attacks, but however came with frustrating Insta-kills, because apparently you can only make something hard if it instantly kills you. Anyways, from these, we went to Elite-Aligators, which also instantly killed the player upon being shot, and then we went to literally two deviantart-reskins, one of them being insanely weak. That's it. Some Areas literally don't have any Elite enemies.\nOh, Vans too. Sometimes unavoidable, even.\n\n"But it's a single player game, why should balance matter in that?"\n\nBecause it isn't a single player game. With the addition of online-leaderboards, the player is now going for "the best" - which ended up with a stale Daily meta of Melee, SPC, and CoB. Maybe 15% of the Weapons in the game are viable late-game with CoB. Instead of being about "who is better at the game?" - Dailies are now "Who is better at the modified game?"\n\nOh right, Perks. We have an insanely limited amount of Perks, or called, Mutations, which are also horribly balanced. There is a certain "elite 10" of mutations which are practically objectively better than the rest, the usual stale meta stuff which is part of why the game might get boring quickly and runs feel the same. This is a case where quantity and quality is low.\n\nTL:DR: Good game with huge issues which might ruin it for some.","April 2","true","652.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","6"

Games are supposed to be extremely fun because of their gameplay not graphics. Nuclear Throne is a great example of that. Its gameplay is really smooth and easy to follow with, which the Binding of Isaac did not have. The controls are absolutely brilliant and made me feel like I am in complete control of my movements and weapons. The number of guns to choose is absolute freakin' insane! There are a lot of characters to choose from with different perks which provide a lot of insane replayability value. Oh and man... The explosions. The explosions are so satisfying.\n\nThis is one of the perfect examples of how Early Access games should be handled. The devs worked really hard and updated the game often and listened to the community. Huge props to the devs. Well done.\n\nOverall, the game is a masterpiece for its gameplay and is absolutely addicting. I am a harsh reviewer and I decided to give this game a 9.5 out of 10 which will place this game at 6th place into my "Steam HALL of FAME" list where only 15 games have obtained at least a 9 or greater so far.

Instant, immediate fun. Pick a character, move, shoot, pick up new weapons, shoot again.\n\nI am usually not fond of top-down shooters, but Vlambeer completely nailed it. The feedback of the weapons is great (it is even possible to reflect shots). It is so much a pleasure to play that dying and trying again in the randomly-generated levels does not feel frustrating. Except for a few specific ways to be killed, like flames from some traps, and taking multiple hits from the same source because of a lack of 'invulnerability frames' after the first hit.\n\nAnother great thing is that progress through the levels is quite fast, so deaths are not as disheartening as in other games. I don't even care about permadeath and reaching the end: I just want to shoot things and get as far as I can until I die. And try again, because I am having fun. There are official daily runs: a common level for everyone, refreshed each day, that can only be tried once. As often, players are ranked daily on leaderboards. This feature gives me a great incentive to play Nuclear Throne each day for at least a quick run (sometimes, really really quick, like less than a minute - yeah this game is not a walk in the park). Unlike The Binding of Isaac, in which I know that a single run can last for a long time and thus I am less inclined to launch it on a whim.\n\nEach character has different and original special skills that allow for a different gameplay, from minor variations to major differences. There is variety in the enemies and their way to attack, however since there are no alternate levels (there are many secret levels though), playing through the same starting area again and again can get a bit too familiar.\n\nThe art is cute and the music is perfectly adequate. Only gripe here is that the framerate is locked to 30.\n\nAn instant favorite to me.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=622827607","January 2, 2014","true","105.2"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","1"

There's alot of detail found in every hole and around every dark corner this game consists of. After playing for a while, the game boils down to a science, things you do seem to just slot in to place with the agenda of the game and it becomes almost systematic. The game is difficult, that's more than true, but you'll achieve such a rush in looping it compensates for the hardship you'll face trying to beat the Nuclear Throne for the first time. Also, you can definately feel the difference between the mutants you play as, each one has their own back-stories and reasons why they've wound up in this nightmare, and each of them want victory for different reasons, release, redemption, a show of weapon-weilding potency or the very taste of blood. The assortment of guns, the music, the bosses, the varied enemies and the unpredictability & variation are just some of the reasons Nuclear Throne is fantastic, it's a very worth-while price too, if you're considering it, watch the plethora of videos of the game on YouTube to get more of an understanding and a feel for it, but I, personally, would definately recommend picking it up.","April 5","true","135.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","4"

It's a wonderful example of how well early access can be used to create the best game possible, and I hope future titles learn from Vlambeers success.\n\nAnyways, the game as it stands now:\n\n\nPros\n\nExtremely difficult, yet rewarding.\n12 (+2 secret) characters,all with unique playstyles and mechanics. Some are very basic to learn, while others are more suited for advanced players.\nOver 100 weapons. I felt like making the weapons aspect of this review larger because of how varied they are, but I'll just say this to sum it up: Super Bazooka.\nDaily and Weekly runs give the game a competitive aspect. The daily system is currently broken as of writing this review, however I'll update it when it is fixed. If the daily runs are the reason you may be wanting to buy NT, I'd wait for a while until it gets fixed.\nQuite possibly my favorite soundtrack of the year.\nGorgeous artwork which really helps make the NT universe come to life.\nYung Venuz\n\nCons:\n\nThere is currently a lot of bugs in the game. Some of these are very minor texture glitches while some completey render the game unplayable on some systems. Like I said above, the developers are very much aware of these and are working on fixes right now, but I might suggest waiting until the next update comes around.\nThis is a very controversial subject in the NT community, but keep in mind that the game is capped at 30 FPS. In my honest opinion I find this to be completely okay, and I'm usually picky when it comes to FPS issues in games. But NT is designed around 30 fps and doesn't suffer from any of the usual issues.\nThere are some balancing issues when it comes to a secret aspect of the game after the final boss.

WAAAAAT YESSSS\n\n"more serious review on bottom"\n\nNulcear throne is a very fast paced, bullet hell, Rogue-like action game thats brings a whole new meaning to the word " Difficult "\n\nI am completely satisfied by the game's early access adventure they came a long way from the beginning and all the updates we have now is more reasons to support this game.\nI still remember when I first got this game, had a lot of bugs so much missing stuff, but now ?\nSECRET levels, improved characters and improved art and improved everything\n\nYou choose from 12 characters "That you can unlock as you progress in the game"\nand fight hordes and hordes of monsters with a HUGE Selection of weapons, "Seriously check the wiki DAMN"\n\nEach stage has 3 levels , goes like , 1-1 , 1-2, 1-3 ..etc and every 3 stages theres a "dark" one which sort of reminds me of the 2nd level in mario sort of I don't know I'm weird.\n\nEach character has its own passive and active abilities, making each one different from the other.\nYou can carry 2 weapons at a time, switching between them for the ultimate hell shooter action.\n\nThere are several boss fights in the game which introduces even more fun that it already gives, after beating the final level you can end the game for a story or do loops *cough*mario*cough" That goes on until you die, however loops are INSANE, you get an extra special abilities to pick from and the monsters are ... holy S***.\n\nThe game has its own secrets, secret levels and easter eggs♥♥♥♥♥♥ence whatever you'd call it and Im hoping they'd add more because its so good.\n\nTrust me when I say the game is hard its HARD but you'd get used to how fast it is, you'd get a bit frustrated at first on how suddenly BOOM you died WTF ? but then you'd get a clue on what to do and how to do it properly and you can follow some steam guides they're helpful.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS ! The game didn't have this at first so I got really excited when they got finally implemented, although the achievements are not as much as you'd hope but they're HELLAhard to get.\n\nThe soundtrack in the game is so good, this retro feel it gives me I love it. All the sound effects all the levels and their designs and characters are outstanding I cannot find the proper words to describe it so i'll make up a word "AWESOMARITYFEEEK" ...that didn't go well.\n\nYou got daily challenges, you got weekly challenges, you got to do certain things to unlock other characters, you'll just keep killing monsters along the way as a way of life.\n\nSome people would get shot off by the fact that this game is locked on 30fps but it can never be fixed and devs admitted it was a "Poor developing choice" but thats ok since after 1 hour of the game you'll forget all that and get sucked into this endless wormhole of AWESOMEIRTYFEEEK\n\nTLDR One of the best twin-stick shooters I played "after boi", the difficulty and the content this game provides is insane\n\n10/10 the best early access game I backed.","January 8, 2015","true","43.2"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","23","29","5","0"

I just love the game. The game runs smoothly even on my trash computer, and gameplay is exciting and never lets up. There's something for eveyone. Daily and weekly runs allow for competive play, and for the casuals, doing a bunch of regular runs is really fun. I guess my only complaint is that there's not really any difficulty curve for the noobier players. The only way to get better is to practice. Sure, you could unlock new characters, but the characters are pretty much balanced (and that's a good thing), and not one is so much better than the others that you're never gonna play the other ones again. Perhaps adding unlockable guns would be a good way to help the noobier players along (like me). But that's just my opinion. I'm not a game designer, so I wouldn't know about the techinical aspects of the power curve and other things that come along with adding new characters and features.\n\nAnyway, Great game. Buy it. Now.

You find yourself tutting at yourself, ashamed of your own ineptitude. Nuclear Throne is no different. In fact it's probably harsher than average. And that's a very good thing.\n\nMaybe I'm just a noob. I think I am. I get massacred every time: on numerous ocassions an irradiated rat has knawed me to death. Cars have exploded from stray enemy rounds and sent me spiralling across the level. A crocodile with a shotgun once made me wish my father had never had that dirty glint in his eye looking at my mother. I mean, they're divorced now, and that whole experience was probably less rage inducing than Nuclear Throne.\nI may be a sadomasochist for this type of thing, but I keep going back. Each run, each easily avoided slaying, simply drives me on to discover more of the complex progression system. The depth of game's secrets, weapon management and characters are all of incredibly high standard. All lures in their own right.\n\nBut I think the main reasons I love this game are its weird sense of humour and beautfiul graphics.

And with guns. And cops. And fish. And a lot more bullets.\n\nNuclear Throne has quick and natural progression that promotes fast paced but logical gameplay with a plethora of characters lending themselves to different playstyles, as well as a satisfying arsenal of weapons that range from the simple to the absurd. Whether you're running around litearlly as a headless chicken or spawning an armada of men with machine guns to p̶l̶a̶y̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ assist your twitchy ramapge to the Throne, each character manages to feel unique despite being exactly the same for all intensive purposes.There is a range of enemies, bosses and environments, a considerable list of perks (mutations and crowns) that can dramatically influence a playthrough depending on your choices, and 90% of them are well balanced, with a few exceptions that fall off a little late game, but still provide a good boost early.\n\nAt times the level generation, weapon spawns and mutation selection may frustrate you, but the game has very little in the way of artifical difficulty (Except for Little Hunter - he really needs a trigger warning on that jumpscare) Once you get past it's initial learning curve, Nuclear Throne becomes and incredibly fun, satisfying and, at times, humourous experience. The soundtrack that acompanies the game is phenominal, and whilst being very pixely, it's style is unique enough to not seem 'retro for the sake of retro lol aren't we cool'.\n\nThat, and you can spam airhorns as a rapping illuminati Gun God from Venus.

You play as one of several mutants in a post-apocalyptic setting. Your goal is to fight through throngs of enemies until you reach the Nuclear Throne. Along the way, you'll pick up different weapons and XP in the form of radiation. Each level you earn, you can choose a new mutation that helps you progress through the game.\n\nIt sounds simple enough, and the basic jist of gameplay is. If you shoot things and don't get hit, you win. That's much easier said than done, though, especially as you spawn into levels randomly--something surrounded by enemies. Many times you'll have to go in guns blazing and run for cover. Others you'll weave in and out of bullet sprays while popping off a few well-aimed shots of your own. It's challenging and engaging, even in level 1-1. And that's a good thing, because you'll find yourself back there a lot.\n\nI thought this game would frustrate me, but so far I've had a smile on my face every time I've died. It's such a fun game that the only thing keeping me from hitting R to do a quick restart is other commitments.\n\nIf roguelikes are your thing and you're a fan of punishing games, give it a whirl.

Everything from the music to the art has wonderful grit and polish, the setting of a hopeless post-apocalyptic wasteland never feeling so vibrant and varied. The controls are smoother than a babe's backside, the design is solid, and the pace frenetic. This is one of those games where a run could last anywhere from five seconds to forty five minutes, but every time the first thought that comes up when the death screen is encountered is, "Let's have another go". Nuclear Throne is as good as it gets for the marriage of well-designed weapons, varied characters, and a hard-as-nails bullet hell atmosphere that will hand you your own ♥♥♥ time and time again and leave you begging for more.","December 13, 2015","true","101.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Like, really hard. It's quite skill based which seems somewhat rare with rouge-likes lately. You will need to learn how the game works, adapt to your guns and ammo, and become a more skillful player in order to survive.\n\nThe number of guns in this game is high. Blood guns, Acid guns, Energy guns, Explosive guns, melee weapons, crossbows and more.\n\nYou can also choose from a roster of unique and interesting characters, that all change how you play the game. Once you find the character that's right for you, you're going to have a good time! For instance, maybe you're good at dodging you can play as Melting who has 2 health instead of 8, but has a really powerful move where he can explode all the corpses around! Or, maybe you want to dual wield? You can do that with Steroids, a big guy that has less accuracy, but can use both guns at the same time. And not only are there multiple characters, there are also upgrades that last for each run. Each character has a specific upgrade that does something unique to that character, along with PLENTY of other upgrades. You can also choose "crowns" at the start of a game they act as little modifiers, such as, no ammo drops, more gun drops. Or, free mutations narrow future. These can add a whole new challenge to the game which is nice... I haven't really tested them out too much as I'm not skilled enough to make full use of them.\n\nSomething else I want to point out, this game is pretty well balanced for a rouge-like...\n\nGRAPHICS The art is pretty simple not much to say. Animations are nice and simple.\n\nSOUND  The sounds are design is done nicely, guns are satisfying to here and there is even a made up language for the mutants. And the soundtrack is fantastic. From the ambience to the intense boss music. It's all really well done and helps set the mood for the tone of the level.\n\nSTORY There is a lot of lore, hidden in the game and told through unconventional means it leaves a lot to be desired. I hope some day we will get more insight on the characters and world.\n\n\nThis game is hard. Remember if you are faint at heart do not pick this up as it is not fair, and it will punish you. But that said, it is VERY fun and very rewarding. Anyone looking for an addictive and challenging shooter, look no further!","June 25, 2015","true","15.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

A while ago, I was scrolling through games and came over this. It honestly looked way too difficult and boring. After finally purchasing it much later, I came to find out that only one of these was true. It is one of the most fun rogue-like I'd played in a while, right up there with The Binding of Isaac and Risk of Rain.\n\nReplay Value You NEVER feel like you are having the same run twice. It is difficult to do so, there being so many characters, mutations, and secret areas to curve your run in another direction. Also, the amount of guns to kill baddies with is crazy, the uniqueness of every gun being quite great, some that gattle rockets, others that shoot a large bolts, and some that spit plasma and fire.\n\nBalancingOkay, so, difficulty is a hard thing to get right in Rogue-like games. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a bit too easy for me, while games like Rampage Knights and Rogue Legacy are ridiculous to me. This game is right in the middle- it is unforgiving and will ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥, but it can be nice with the mutations and guns you have. Getting to the last boss is a challenge, but not impossible. Looping is a bit harder, especially now. The problem I have is Hard Mode. My god, hard mode is so ridiculous to me. I love a challenge, but this ♥♥♥♥... ouch. I can barely get past the Desert on Hard mode. The enemies are really unique for the most part and the bosses each pose their own challenges to you.\n\nBugsBesides occasionally freezes and crashes for some people, the game is relatively bug free. The only bug I remember seeing is Crystal's B Ability turning into the A Ability, but that's not too bad. The game gets updated almost every week, so bugs are not frequent.\n\nCo-opWhile the idea of co-op is fantastic and would pose a lot of fun online, it is only local, sadly. While I wouldn't normally have a problem with this, the controller support is phenomonally clunky. It is extremely hard to aim a weapon and focus with it, while the mouse is much easier.\n\nCommunity SupportThe fact that they have lots of community support is fantastic. Some of the big contributors of this are the forums and the live developing streams that they have. I think it's really awesome that they have updates each week, too.\n\nArt and MusicThe art in this game is fantastic. The shading is really nice and the boss splash-screens are magnificant. The fact that there are B skins and so many different animations for each enemy and character is fantastic. The music is also great. A friend of mine described it as nostalgiac, but I don't really get that feeling. The music fits the place. If the place is slow, the music is slow and calm. If the place is fast, the music is intense and pumping. If the place is creepy, the music is unsettling yet calming. Some awesome songs are The Palace B, Y.V.'s Mansion, and The Nuclear Throne. I also like the Main Theme and the Credits.\n\nShould you buy this game?YES! It is totally worth the money. The Community Support is nice, the art and music is fantastic, the replayability is phenomonal, and the character designs are charming and mesmorizing. Despite the hard difficulty, this is a game that is easy to get into.","October 3, 2015","true","151.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154396763/recommended/242680/","76561198154396763","Copella: Quality Juice","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154396763/","43 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nREVIEW\n\n\nNuclear Throne is a roguelike, bullet hell shooter, with some RPG elements, however one could probably deduce that from the description. Vlambeer’s previous efforts to deliver a high-score based shooter, have failed to deliver on genuine replay value, and one could be done with them mere hours after purchase. Nuclear Throne is NOT that. You will be occupied for a long time after the purchase of Nuclear Throne, and will have your knowledge of the game tested, due to ever changing subtleties in the gameplay, level design and even themes as you progress. Be expecting a captivating experience for hundreds of hours after purchase, I know I’m only getting started!\n\nThe gameplay in Nuclear Throne is simple. Each character has a passive and active ability. These abilities keep one from sticking with a single character, and force one out of their comfort zone. This is helped by the fact that all the abilities are majorly balanced (except for the Chicken, which has recently been nerfed). I would call the gameplay a hybrid of Hotline Miami and The Binding of Isaac, however it is so much more. This is due to its immense gameplay depth. By this I mean, the game allows you to adapt the gameplay to your playstyle, and alter character’s unlockable abilities to synergies with one another, for example: A person could choose the “get more crates ability” along with the “Find more weapons ability” to have a greater likelihood of finding more guns, if that’s how he plays. Speaking of guns, the game has a wide selection of creative weaponry. These go from melee weapons, to hybrids of sniper rifles, shotguns and even fire. Even through the carnage of setting the whole screen ablaze with a flame shotgun, one can easily appreciate the game’s worthwhile arsenal. The difficulty pacing is very well handled, because at times I noticed the game was being as I wanted it to. If\n\nThe gameplay is made more enjoyable by the game’s extremely well designed aesthetics. The screen shakes like crazy, and enemies flash white and pause when hit, to give the game a punchier, more powerful feel. The pixel art style is good. Nothing of the art is so beautiful that it deserves commending, but it at least gets the job done well. Enemies all look good, and help make the “post fallout” theme really be in the core of the game at all times, always making you feel like the world around you is a desolated wasteland. My major complaint is that the size of the pixels, make it, sometimes, difficult to distinguish major pieces of information, like text, or even bullets. I still find it difficult to distinguish between a shotgun, and a pop gun.\n\nMusically the game is fantastic. All music has a theme that corresponds to the environment where it is found, and it sounds great! Psychedelic vocals play in the sewers, and rap plays in Y.V.s pimped-out mansion. The actual sound design for all the weapons is fine. It doesn’t strive to do anything special, and sticks to the similar sounds found in most retro-shooters.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that you have read this far (please let me know in the comments if you have ☺), I would like to talk about the amazing job that the developers are doing. The game is in the dreaded “early access” stage, however the game right now is basically complete. Developers are constantly adding new content to keep the game fresh, and its getting kind of ridiculous! I’ve never seen such a passion for expanding the community (which is terrific by the way), and for that I respect Vlambeer, despite their shortcomings in Luftrausers. I strongly recommend anybody interested in fun games purchases this game, because its well worth its price, even in early access, make no mistakes, this is one of the best retro shooters ever, and I definitely wont be refunding this *wink wink*\n\nSCORE\n\n80/100\n\nA solid title, worthy of players with interests in any other genre, and content well worth the price. Just don't come in looking for a well developed multiplayer.","June 10, 2015","true","9.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/i542/recommended/242680/","i542","Darwin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/i542/","190 products in account","Update Since this review I've been hired to work for the company which made this game as a freelancer. This review was written way before I even thought of that, and I still do think that this is a great game, but I am obviously biased now and you should read another review if that bothers you. I haven't changed the original review, so here it is.\n\n\nNuclear Throne is at the same time easy to pick up and detailed enough that you'll spend dozens of hours looking for various tricks, trying out different strategies, weapon matches, finding secret areas, and the most important thing - shooting mutants and rebels and fighting off the interdimensional police which is always on your tail. As a rougelike, it's not for the faint of heart - levels, the amount of enemies, weapons and mutations you get are always random and will differ each time you boot up the game. This allows you to replay the game as much as you like and it's always going to be just as great as the first time.\n\nThere's no detailed unlock systems which force you to invest hundreds of hours into the game to get the full experience. Almost all characters and all weapons will be available after your first playthrough. Pick up someone with the pleasant name and go. Feel like having an all-out powerful run where you can blow up corpses of your enemies? Go ahead. Feel like casually strolling through the wasteland with your allies? Go ahead. Feel like having a frantic experience where the game randomly throws enemies at you when it feels like it? Go ahead.\n\nFrom plasma cannons to heavy crossbows, from double miniguns to auto flame shotguns - this game has it all. Just saying the name of a weapon makes you imagine it and think how awesome it is. And when you finally get to find them in game, pick them up and use them, it's going to be just as awesome and just as chaotic as you imagined. As this game is in early access, new weapons are being added all the time, and when you read something like "Added a Flame Cannon" in the update notes, you can't help but smile and think to yourself - yes, that's exactly the amount of chaos I want to cause next time I open up this game.\n\nYou WILL die. You will die a lot. You will die in the most fair and the most unfair ways possible. But one thing is for sure. Each death, no matter how infuriating, will always teach you something. And in the end, each death makes you a better player. In a matter of hours, you will be pulling off professional dodging maneuvers, carefully picking mutations to build your character for the strategy you envisioned and the weapons you have, and before you know it, it will be 3am and you will be saying "just one more run".\n\nAs this game is in early access, it's bound to change and I hope that it proceeds in the direction it's heading. If you're in doubt whether you're going to get your money's worth - yes, you will. You will get much more than that. Once it's out of early access, I have no doubts that this game will be one of the best games released for that year. I honestly recommend you pick the game up and give it a shot.","October 18, 2014","true","103.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Basically it's a rouge-ish bullet hell game about a group of mutants who are on a journey to claim the nuclear throne, one of the most soul beating, ♥♥♥♥ kicking, rage inducing bosses ever (And it's not even really the final boss). You have a selection of 12 characters to play with, each with their strengths and weaknesses. It also includes a leveling up system with each level allowing you to choose from four powers, know as mutations. There are a multitude of stages with increasingly difficult enemies (But very few border the line of unfair). After a few levels a boss will spawn randomly from a wall or in the middle of the screen. These bosses range from: "Pfft that was a boss?" to "Ah ♥♥♥♥ I'm screwed, oh ♥♥♥♥ here he comes." I'd say it is very skill based and unforgiving, so if you are into that kind of thing in a game this will be right up your alley. I still have yet to master it but I still find the fun in it even if I suck. Also the devs seem interested in just making games and constantly updated the game till its full release, and there will most likely be content later. There are a couple of drawbacks however. Due to the games random nature, you can get a reaaaaaaally bad spawn where the boss spawns two feet from you or where you have minimum protection against a huge wave of fish (no joke).\n\n\nTL;DR\nPros: A good selection of characters\nGood devs\nFun yet not boringly easy\nLots of secrets\nNice art and sound tracks\nA looping system\nLOCAL Co-op\n\nCons:\nA couple of unfair bosses/enemies\nRNG spawns can make you want to tear your arms off and slam your face on your keyboard\nLosing a great run can give you a heart attack\nUnsure post-EA future (Maybe)\nFlame Traps\n\nRating: 9.5/10","March 14, 2015","true","111.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Hours of procedurally generated hard-as-nails top down shooter fun. You'll die over and over and over, but the game doesn't get any less fun. Great music to back up the unique visual style which fits perfectly with the gameplay. It's refreshing also to see an early access game which has so much support from the devs. They livestream development of the game every week which allows us to influence directly the balancing and features of the game.

The shooting feels as good as it gets short of holding an actual weapon in your hand (at least I think so, I never held one). Enemy AI is well balanced for this kind of arcade game. They hide around corners but not so well as to make the game tedious.\n\nNuclear Throne scatches an itch similar to that of the Binding of Isaac, but with shorter sessions. Both games are arcade shooters, procedurally generated, and unbalanced by design (Nuclear Throne is much harder though).\n\nI still prefer Isaac, because it has much more content and variety. After nearly 20 hours, I begin to grow tired of Nuclear Throne already, but those 20 hours have been very fun.\n\n","April 15","true","19.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

(which WILL happen eventually)\nAs you git gud, you will also unlock: new characters which encourage different playstyles, a  variety of improved golden weapons to start with in future runs to make delving down to the throne less hard, skins that don't do sh♥t, and challenging crowns to add even more spice to the pili-pili.\nOnce you reach and kill the throne, the game will 'loop', throwing you back in the first stage with a lot more and harder enemies to kill (you). This process will repeat itself. UNTIL YOU DIE\n\nI have not played a whole lot of this game, but i'll be adding more to this review as i play and discover more.","March 24","true","55.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Each and every play through is never the same. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing hard. I mean really hard. This is the Dark Souls of twin stick shooters. Each map randomly generates the field and weapons are also generate randomly depending how far you gotten. Example, in the beginning you get random low tier weapons from chests as in higher levels you get higher tier weapons. The enemies get stronger the further you go and you have to play it smart by finding cover. This game requires some skill and a lot of luck. More than half the time I either die from being spawned in the worst spot on the field or accidentally kill myself with a grenade launcher or some explosive weapon. Either because I was being dumb or the enemy was too close by running towards you. This game may be hard but it's a lot of fun. Great soundtrack, very responsive controls, my only complaint is that there is no online co-op mode. There is local co-op but no online. Still it's a great game and addicting.

The challenging fights coupled with the permadeath and randomly generated levels make each play through a little bit different!

No matter your skill level, the game constantly brings new things into the mix to help you or to harm you ( every single week). Also regardless of skill, this game bring endless hours of fun. Unlike other Rouge-Lite games, as of now, this game provdies 12 unique characters all with their own play-styles. Want to be a tank, Crystal is for you. Enjoy high-risk playing, Melting will suit you nicely. Nuclear Throne does an excellent job of incorporating a character to suit practically anyone. Nuclear Throne also adds a feature that is different than most other games of it's type; ammo management.  Just when you think you are about to beat Lil' Hunter and make it to the throne room, you can run out of ammo and it can mean almost certain death. This can influence your gun choices drastically, is it really worth taking the triple machine gun? Or the Hyper Rifle? As opposed to a Heavy Crossbow? On the subject of guns, every gun feels relatively different, not like the developers were lazy and reskinned a gun and called it new. Overall, Nuclear Throne does a great job of challenging anyone while still making sure that it is beatable. I would personally reccommend it to anyone i know, as Nuclear Throne provides something for all types of Gamers.","March 14, 2014","true","291.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

Each one of them feels different and unique so there will be a preferred weapon type for everyone. The gunplay in the game is very well done, all the weapons feel like they have a weight to them and it is fun to mix different weapons to find the perfect combination. The randomized nature of the game means that players will get to experiment and experience all the weapons. Furthermore, it’s very satisfying to learn the how the weapons work and master the controls of the variety weapons.\n\nThere are a variety of character which have unique abilities such as rolling and shields and player also levels up their character through the run which will unlock new attributes, leading to some unique builds that will adjust how the player will play the game, meaning every run is unique. There is also daily challenges which will spawn a new run every day and you can replay the same map for a day and try to place on the leaderboard, rather than a randomized level each time, creating a variety of game modes.\n\nEvery stage in the game feels unique with new enemies introduced that you learn the patterns. The game has elements of Shmup games with a large amount of bullets flying towards you and can get overwhelming but it’s very satisfying find a path through the enemies and beat the level.\n\nEven though the game can be very challenging, the difficulty curve is not too steep so that it doesn't become too hard for players too quickly, the player is always in a space where it is possible to fight out of any challenge.\n\nThe sound design and graphics both build a very unique atmosphere, the music often matches the settings perfectly and is very invigorating when fighting the enemies. The pixel graphics are very detailed and unique that gives the game great charm and character that is wonderful to look at, all the enemies are instantly recognizable and interesting to fight.\n\nThis is also a paragon of early access games. The devs have made over 90 weekly updates to the game that add new features such as weapons, characters, as well as adjust and rebalance gameplay. They listen to the community; they deserve some respect for their commitment to the game in a landscape of exploitive developers who want to release buggy, broken games to get a quick buck, such as DayZ and countless other scams.\n\nNuclear Throne started out a great game and has only gotten better over time as more things get added to the game, as it soon approaches its full release, it sets a standard for early access games on Steam and it is a shame that this level of dedication to a game isn’t seen very often. Overall, definitely worth picking up to support good developers and a great game, looking forward to the final release coming up soon!","November 2, 2015","true","57.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This is why we love indie devs! For every Jumpix Jump, there are absulote gems of games like this. I bought it on my PS4 as an impulse buy because I liked the pixel characters. I had no idea what I was in for. I bought it again through Humble Bundle just because I loved it so much. (I know Sony doesn't give indie devs that much revenue.)  I never done that before. I could have given that money to charity. What am I doing with my life? (I don't regret it. I support indie devs!)\n\nThis game is the hardest game I have ever played. It's harder then Shovel Knight, Dark Souls and Bloodborne. However, it's not cheap or unplayable like a lot of old NES games. Every mistake is your own fault. Only a few bad spawns made the game feel unfair. Otherwise, this game is based purely on your skill as a player and willingness to learn it's rules. This is great game for speedrunners and competetive players. It takes skill to play this game good. And once you finally master it, it throws a new trick at you.\n\nI am what you would call a casual gamer. I'm not a big fan of difficult games, let alone bullet heaven type games. However, I was immediatly pulled in by this game. I'm addicted. You die and die again, and yet I can't stop hitting the retry button. That is amazing that a game this hardcore could pull in a casual player like me.\n\nI grew up on the NES and the SNES. (I'm young, btw. Second hand gaming rules.) Those are my two favorite systems, and this game feels like it would belong among the most legendary and classic games on those systems. I love the graphics. The pixel art is beautiful. Every character, enemy and stage has their own personality. Obviously a lot of love went into this game. This just goes to show what can be done with Gamemaker studio. I actually really love Gamermaker games when they're done well. I think there's a charm to them.\n\nWhen it comes to the gameplay, there a million ways to play. Every character has their strengths and weaknesses, and along with various randomized mutations and a HUGE arsnel of weapons - there is a lot you can do! Which really adds to replayability. You can easily get 500+ hours from this little game. It's full to the brim with secrets, character and charm that will keep you coming back for more. As a NES/SNES fanboy, I think this game just trumped a lot my classic favorites. This is my favorite game by far and goes to show why we need indie games. I have plenty of mainstream AAA games with top notch graphics, but I come back to little games like these more often than not.\n\nI can not praise this game enough. It's a little masterpiece of an indie game. What are you waiting for? Get it. Through Humble Bundle if you can, if you want to support this dev more. (Go to the game's website. The link is there.)\n\nI have a few tips for you:\n\n- You will die. A lot. You will get frustrated and grit your teeth and curse this game. Take a break. Play another easier game (preferably Stardew Valley) or put the controller down, and then come back. You'll realize that when you're calm, you're doing better then when you were stressed.\n\n- There is no pointless character. Even if a character seems useless to you, every one is cleverly planned out to have strengths. It's up to you to figure out what those are. (Or you could just look it up, like a cheater.)\n\n- Crystal is BY FAR the easiest character to play as, but I would only play as him if you're just starting and getting used to the game's difficulty. Because of his special ability, learning how to play the game with this character can be counter-productive. You need to learn how to dodge.\n\n- There are plenty of secrets, but most are obvious once you realize how to find them. Keep your eyes open.\n\nEDIT: - Also, there's one more thing I'd like to mention. The screen shakes a bit in partcularly chaotic fights. If this bothers you, there is a setting in the options to turn screen shaking off. I did this and prefer the game with it off.\n\nI bought this game for co-op. It's awesome. In an age when were seeing less and less couch co-op games, this is really appreciated. Thank you devs for giving me such an amazing experince.\n\nNOTE: (13/03/2016) As of the time of writing this, the PS4 version of this game, however, is unfortunetly broken. Once you get past the beginning stages, it could crash at any time for no reason. It doesn't happen often, but it's annoying as heck. I have yet to hear any word on this being fixed. Darn it. Also, the game seems like it doesn't fit on the screen. I tested the PC version and it doesn't have this problem. It's especially noticeable on the tutorial level. The text is almost totally blocked because it goes off the screen. No word on this being fixed. I would recommend the PC version. I love this game to death, BUT it's unbelievable that ANYONE could release a game on the Playstation store in this state! This problem probably hurt the game more than we know.\n\nI would still prefer playing on my PS4 though, as the crashes aren't often enough to render the game unplayable.","March 13","true","0.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's fast-paced and not once have I been bored in all of my playtime.\n\nThe characters are the most colorful and creative I have ever witnessed, which is extremely surprising, considering most of them are simple one-word concepts drawn up as people. Or gods. Or even fish. I don't know how it works, but it does.\n\nThe gameplay is perfectly designed; the mutations are really satisfying to pick, and get even more satisying as you get better at the game and actually know which mutations do what.\n\nFor those that are iffy on the difficulty of the game, I can say the difficulty is definitely high, but I consider it a large feature of the game. The goal is to reach the Nuclear Throne, and it's not expected of you to do it on your first try, but when you do, (took me 50-60 hours) you will feel so accomplished. Everything in your entire life will light up in stunning clarity, and just as you commence the final fight, ready to take your Nuclear Throne...\nyou die because you didn't know there was a sudden-death beam at the beginning. you're welcome\n\nBut it was worth it, because then you knew it was possible, and you could do it again with an entirely different character, different levels, different guns, and all the same glorious feeling of killing everything in your sight.\nIt's fun.

It takes time getting used to the sheer amount of chaos happening at once. The game throws you right into the action with no tutorial or simplistic stages. When it comes to figuring out the game, you are pretty much left to your own devices.\n\nThis game is also INCREDIBLY HARD. Some enemies shoot out a ruthless spray of bullets, and it only takes a couple of them to kill you. With no recovery time, your character can die within seconds. Fortunately, each stage has a plethora of different weapons lying around, and each one of them has various pros and cons.\n\nEach character has a special move specific to them, from deflecting bullets, to slow motion, to summoning allies for help and so on. This makes each character play very differently, adding to the replayability. Your character also levels up, and can pick from random mutations in order to receive various perks.\n\nWith randomly generated levels and level up bonuses the game is endlessly replayable. Which is a good thing, because you will die A LOT. And every death sends you back to the start of the game. And there's no bonuses to make the game any easier when you restart. Nuclear Throne expects you to beat the game all at once, by only using your skills.\n\nThe game is still a little rough around the edges, but it has a lot more polish than most other early access games. And it looks like Vlambeer is doing a great job at constantly working on the game.\n\nIf you have the money, get this game. It's one of the best (if not the best) twin-stick shooters that I've ever played, even at this stage. Just keep in mind that getting to the Nuclear Throne is far from easy.\n\n","December 30, 2014","true","60.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","7","8","4","2"

It is fun and simple, but it is ungodly difficult at the same time. The premise behind the game is simple. You start the game with two characters, these being Crystal and Fish. All characters have two uniquie things. Their passive and their active. Their passive is just that; an ability that will run in the background, influecing your attack patterns and the drops for players. Their active is also known as their right-click ability. Left-click is the basic attack and the default movement is WASD. Just using the two starting characters as an example, I will show how different playstyles can be from character to character.\n\nCrystal\n-Passive: More base health than any other character.\n-Active: A temporary shield that will reflect multiple bullets and protect you from others.\n\nFish\n-Passive: Extra ammo recieved\n-Active: A dodge roll\n\nJust looking at this, we can see that even the starting characters are different from each other in multiple ways. With Crystal, the game gives you more chances, but it's also easier to get damaged if you aren't paying attention. The shield can be used as a weapon at the same time, however. This will prove useful against specific bosses, such as Big Bandit and Big Dog(the first two bosses in the game). Fish's dodge roll, though not making him invulnerable, can make him extremely aggressive with melee weapons, as he can roll in, attack, then roll out(Optimus Prime appears out of nowhere). And, with Fish, due to his extra ammo passive, you rarely have to ever worry about running out, until you loop, that is.\n\nI won't spoil the entire game, as there are many unlockables and secret areas, but I will tell you this. Before buying this, look up and download Wasteland Kings. Wasteland Kings is the extremely early version of this game, and it will give you a good idea of the insanity that this game will make you go through.\n\nOverall rating: 9/11 Too many explosions.","October 17, 2015","true","63.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

There is some backstory to be had there, but it's out of the way once the game starts up. And boy, is there a game to be had.\n\nStaple to Vlambeer's output, the game features hugely satisfying combat - with shots giving out appropriate amounts of screen shake, freeze frames and audio feedback upon pulling the trigger. You'll learn to love the impact of the shotguns and the sniper like efficiency of the crossbow. The weapons have been given loving amounts of attention, between tweaking, balancing and playtesting there is bound to be something for everyone.\n\nThe levels themselves are randomly generated, akin to the way Spelunky or other games of that ilk work. You'll have to navigate through several themed worlds, amassing rads (experience) and weapons along the way. The experience unlocks perks - gameplay perks you'll have to decide upon, the majority of which can greatly shape your playstyle and tactics. Defensive and offensive options abound for the players who like to play safe or for those who need more risk and reward. You'll find yourself on one hand (or two if you're playing Steroids) wielding increasingly massive amounts of firepower, while coping with the snowballing odds. Bands of enemies become hordes, and you'll find yourself in pure glee as you lay waste to everything before your eyes. Nothing can stand between you and victory, noth...oh wait. Death again.\n\nThe game is hard, and you'll initially find yourself inching to survive. You'll have to observe individual enemy behaviors, learn to understand the baiting nature of the game, and capitalize on every bit of terrain on the battlefield. With enough time you'll find yourself at the Nuclear Throne...only to loop the game and turn up the difficulty to 11.\n\nThe game features, single and local co-op action (still WIP), with dailies to add something to come back to everyday. I await the final release with (fish) baited breath.","November 20, 2015","true","112.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The starting weapons do feel a bit underwhelming however, but with enough practice and perserverance, you begin to move deeper into the game, where you are presented with some hilariously over the top futuristic weapons that are very fun and original. For example, the super plasma cannon... Imagine the BFG from Doom, only this time the giant ball of plasma steamrolls over all the enemies, before blowing a huge chunk out of the wall, then splits into several smaller pieces, which fly in all directions and blow additional chucks out of the walls before finally exploding... I won't spoil anymore because one of the most satifying aspects of this game is simply discovering new weapons and trying them out for the first time.\n\nThe combat manages to hit that same nerve as old school Nintendo games like Contra or Mega Man, but adds a variety of usable characters, which enable you to develop your own playstyle. There are several different characters to choose from, all with unique abilities, and interesting personalities. At the time of writing, I had put about 60 hours of practice into just one of them, before I finally felt like I had mastered it (literally a fish out of water that smokes cigarettes, plays guitar and dodges bullets by floundering around). My new favourite is a guy who's head is covered in eyes, is telekinetic, but is unable to speak because he doesn't have a mouth, so instead he just mumbles incoherently. He attracts enemies but repels bullets, which is highly effective, and completely changed my approach to the game.\n\nMake no mistake, this game is extremely difficult, but the learning curve is just right and rewards the player through a process of trial and error. Got shot by laser beams? Ok, I'll move out of the line of sight next time. Died to a self-destructing robot? Alright, I'll make sure to stand back when I finish those guys off. Before you know it, you're a pro, and previously difficult sections start to feel routine. That is, until you reach the final boss for the first time and the anxiety gives you a heart attack from the overload of adrenaline...\n\nI haven't had this much fun with a video game for a long time. It makes the rest of my library look sad, and lonely by comparison. If I could choose just one game to have with me on a deserted island, this would be it. Nuclear Throne is an instant classic, and to overlook this title would be doing yourself a disservice.\n\n10/10","December 7, 2015","true","84.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Its finally out. Finally out in a good way, not in the "Ugh, this is taking so long...". To be honest, I had no idea what I was doing when I first played this game, and I wasn't really that interested in it. I watched Northernlion play his daily runs and whatnot, and with every episode I watched I wanted to play the game more. So I finally actually gave the game a proper go. It was fun but I still didn't know what was going on. I continued to play Nuclear Throne more and more and with every playthrough I was learning and I was getting better. [I've only looped once]. This game is now AMAZING. Vlambeer could've released it a long time ago but they decided to keep it in Early Access. With every update I wanted to play more! Vlambeer have done MASSIVE updates for this game week after week and its made the game so GOOD. It feels so satifying to see a game grow into something this... this phenomenal! It was a bumpy ride at the begginning, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was it worth it for me to stick around with this game. When it was in Early Access it was awesome, and now its even more awesome now that its released. And even better, Vlambeer are going to continue to update Nuclear Throne, and expanding its story and the game. This game is amazing. I love, and I'm glad I gave it another chance when I first bought it. Thank you Northernlion and thank you Vlambeer for making one of the best indie games on Steam. Its been a pleasure to see it grow and develop into something great.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my review. It was honestly a tribute to Vlambeer in all honesty. I love Nuclear Throne and I hope everyone else does too!","December 7, 2015","true","43.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

So this game is about 12 mutants fighting through 7 well designed levels to the Nuclear Throne. I have played this game for long enough to say that you have a 100% chance of death in this. Runs aren't meant to last forever, as entering a portal increases the difficulty by 1 every time. That makes more monsters spawn.  You can have over 40 weapons of melee, bullets, energy, bolts, shells and explosives. They each can be intresting to use. When you level up, you get to choose 4 mutations. They are randomly set. I have no complaints about this game, yet it might be difficult at first.","November 21, 2015","true","388.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Nuclear Throne is a game of weapons, mutations and dying. So much dying. While there is a way to end the game without dying you can if you choose to; play the game until you die long past any point of reason. With colourful characters like Fish, Plant and Rebel, fantastical guns such as Grenade Shotgun, Super Crossbow and Laser Minigun not to forget our adverseries, Necromancers, Salamanders and... Lil' Hunter; Nuclear Throne is a game of immense replayability and wonderful fun. Honestly I think if you enjoying shooting things and enjoy a challenge Nuclear Throne is the game for you, it's as simple as that.  I guess I should put down some kind of benchmark for the difficulty. If you found the original Binding of Isaac was a mountain to climb, Nuclear Throne is colonising Mars with a tuna sandwich and some cardboard boxes.\n\n","November 27, 2015","true","306.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The graphics are lovely, the music is 10 out of 10, and it is enjoyable to play.  My thumbs-down is not me panning the game, I'm taking the "Do you recommend this game?" question literally and writing my review as a warning.  There comes a point when games are so excessively difficult that people need to be notified going in.  There's a very high chance that most people should avoid this game, because this game is designed to appeal to an extremely small audience: the highest tier of elite, hardcore, massively-skilled gamers.\n\nIf you want an idea of what you're getting into, imagine one of the hardest games you've ever played, and then imagine if that game sent you back to the very beginning after the slightest mistake.  A bird in Ninja Gaiden knocks you into a pit? Back to level one.  Get hit by a single stray bullet in Contra?  Back to the title screen.  This game is about as difficult as trying to beat Mega Man without getting hit once.\n\nI was aware that this game was difficult when I bought it, because I love nightmarishly difficult shooters and roguelikes, and this game still was able to alienate me.  You can have a competitive, positive attitude about challenging games, and Nuclear Throne will still transform you into a ragequitter.\n\nThere is no forgiveness, and there is no room for mistakes.  Nuclear Throne demands absolute perfection of you.  And this game doesn't play fair.\n\nYour health bar is pretty much irrelevant, because there are no invincibility frames upon getting hit.  You can have tons of HP upgrades, and a small cluster of bullets will destroy you inside of a split second.  There will always be something far off screen shooting extremely high speed projectiles at you, and your view is very zoomed in.  The screen is always violently shaking, and the game actually mocks you if you turn the screen shake "feature" off, as though your desire to make the game less of a jittery mess is somehow your fault.  Most enemies explode when you kill them. Sometimes it doesn't damage you and sometimes it... does?  Sometimes you'll die being sucked into the exit portal because it spawned next to an explosive object.  Sometimes the game will randomly generate a level where you are surrounded on all sides by enemies with no cover, and you're dead seconds after the level loads.\n\nYou will be saying "what the hell even HIT me?" constantly while playing this game.  Even the best played runs will end because of the tiniest mistake.\n\nI'm certain that the sense of accomplishment upon beating this game is absolute euphoria.  And I'm very certain that there are gamers with superhuman reflexes that this game is like catnip to.  I will say that if you can beat this game, you are truly a phenomenal gamer.  I wouldn't laugh at you if you printed out a screenshot of you beating it and hung it on your wall; you've earned it.  If you are one of those people that is looking for the ultimatest of ultimate challenges, then this game is going to deliver in spades.\n\nBut for the rest of us mortals, I recommend saving your money and your sanity.","July 20, 2014","false","2.3"," 621 of 1,188 people (52%) found this review helpful 94 people found this review funny","52","621","1","94","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/recommended/242680/","rsc","RSCNyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/","106 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNuclear Throne is a overhead twin-stick shooter. I know many of you are thinking, "Huh, this sounds like way too many Steam games, why would I be interested in this?" Well, it's because it happens to be way faster paced than many I have ever played. Also doesn't consist of only zombies and other living dead type things.\n\nThere's minimal story in Nuclear Throne: You choose a character, and you set out to find the Throne for yourself. There's no indication what the throne does, or what significance it holds, you just gotta find it. That's your only objective.\n\nYou can choose from one out of five initial characters (there is a total of 12), each with their own unique passive and active abilities, and then the game begins. The objective on each level is to kill every enemy. Upon doing this, a portal opens to the next floor. Along the way, you can find chests containing weapons, health, and ammo. Nothing is really hidden: These chests are as clear as day, and are very important to your journey.\n\nYou can carry up to two weapons at a time, and there is a very wide variety, too many to mention. Instead, I'll name the five types: Bullet, Shell, Explosive, Bolt, and Energy. Each class of weapon has their universal pros and cons, but there are some in every class that stand out with their own unique abilities. The game heavily encourages picking up and trying out every new gun you come across, to see if it would work for you. Even the worst weapons have their uses from time to time!\n\nYou will also collect rads from enemies you defeat as experience points, and as you level up, you unlock mutations. Mutations are perks that will give you one permanent buff to your character, ranging from increased chance of item drops to homing crossbow bolts. Each character also has a unique mutation called a "Throne Butt", which will enhance their unique abilities. There are also two "Ultra" mutations that are unique to every character, providing very powerful abilities that can really change how you play the character! The mutation and weapon choices leave a lot of room for experimentation, and seeing what works best for you.\n\nSpeaking of experimentation, you'll have plenty of time to do this, because this game is -hard-. Starting out, you will be flattened by swarms of bandits, crows, lizards, mutants, maybe a dog or two. Nuclear Throne won't hold your hand and give you a tutorial: You are on your own, and you'll have to manage. You will become accustomed to seeing, "You did not reach the Nuclear Throne" over and over. A lot of it is reaction time: As mentioned, it is a very fast paced game, and you will need to be in top form for what you'll come across. However, that is not always the case...and that's where some flaws (or what I feel are flaws) will rise up.\n\nMap layout, enemy spawns, weapons you receive, all of this is up to the random generator. There are times where, due to one or more of these reasons, you will just lose. This is usually the case in roguelike games like this, but nothing is pre-set like in Binding of Isaac or anything. Every game is unique, and sometimes that game will end regardless how well you play. I generally keep a calm head while playing games, but Nuclear Throne knew how to push buttons to make me rage from time to time! It can be a very frustrating game.\n\nAnother thing is the emphasis on "looping". Once you beat the game, you will start again on the first level, and continue on, although enemies will be tougher. There's no actual end outside of your inevitable destruction, or you quitting the game. Having a good run lasting many loops can be fun, but for me, the most exciting part is starting from scratch, and trying to cobble a run together. Granted, this will only be an issue once you get the hang of the game.\n\nThese are, in the grand scheme of things, very minor complaints, though. In addition, Vlambeer is updating this game every week with various fixes and new features, as opposed to the many Early Access games that forget they're developing a game once they have enough of your money. It is a shining example of how to do Early Access right.\n\nNuclear Throne is extremely fast paced, and even if you die, you will have that urge to try again. There's no long game over or intro screens here: Just start it up, play, and keep going until you're done! If you're looking for frantic twin stick shooting action that will leave your palms sweating by the end, Nuclear Throne is for you, and I totally recommend it. Can you reach the throne?\n\n(Should also mention that this game provides gamepad support if you don't wanna use mouse and keyboard, if that's your thing!)","July 16, 2015","true","214.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game throws you into action immediately and can just as fast throw you out of it. It's fast, it's unforgiving and it's brutally challenging. It is everything a roguelike game should be.\nWith a devoted team of developers updates arrive weekly with new features, bugfixing and balancing. Vlambeer also hosts a weekly stream on twitch with development process as well as responding to comments and complains about the game to make sure the audience is pleased with this work in progress masterpiece.\nWhen i first purchased this game i didn't play anything else for a good week or two, not only because there is a lot of ways to play the game (characters, weapons, upgrades etc.) but also because i was driven to see just how far i could get. See when the last boss is defeated you replay the game with the same items and upgrades, only now it's balls to the wall hard. That's where the real difficulty begins.\nBeing in early access means it just keeps getting better, so i suggest purchasing it now to witness the small changes that improve the game every week. You will hate this game, then you'll love it, then you'll die to that annoying-♥♥♥ enemy and you'll hate it again. But when you loop for the first time and get that sick run with thousands of kills, you'll love it forever.\n#VerifyVenuz","August 12, 2015","true","273.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Intrigued by it's similar gameplay like "The binding of isaac" which I enjoyed quite a bit, I bought the game after countless hesitations and started it up the moment it was done downloading.\n\nMan was this a breath of fresh air.\nThis game to me was like Jesus freaking christ showing up to christian people. I never thought I would say "This is harder than trying to sing the russian national anthem backwards without even having heard it nor the russian language once" but here I am. If you're a fan of any rouge-like games whatsoever, then this game will certainly fulfill your dreams and beyond.\n\n\nThe gameplay is fast, hard it will probably end pretty quick (Like me in bed) because you died but you will want to start over again because it's so addictive.\nThe enemies will tear you apart, Your weapons will most likely screw you over in one way or another and if that's not enough the bosses will surely leave a scar on your back saying "i was here you lil shet."\nThe music is bloody brilliant and fills you with adrenaline, actually helping you getting through the harsh level.\nEven there is little to no story to be discovered in the game there are bits and pieces which the player can make his/her/it's own conclusion to what the story is about.\n\nI think this game is great. Actually no, scratch that.\nI think this game sets the bar for how a difficult but fair game should be. Not a complete pounding session but a pounding session with some lube.

This game, even being early access, is my favorite Vlambeer title to date.  Think Hotline Miami meets rogue-like mutant monster infested wastelands. Awesome weapons, mutant upgrade. Gameplay is tight. I love the way the game camera moves. If you don't hold up well with camera shake they give you the option to adjust it under settings. Should also mention the soundtrack is kickass and fits perfect with the game's universe.  Looking back at their history of releases this should be no suprise. Lots of replay value.

Even if you don't, I would strongly urge you to consider it anyway. This is one of the most fantastically executed games I have played in my life. Yes, it is in early access, and I will possibly revise this review once the game is fully released (The game currently does not have all the planned content implemented, and there are some bugs and balance issues), but I seriously doubt that my opinion of it will change to anything other than even greater love.\nOn paper, everything seems pretty swell. The soundtrack is great. The presentation is absolutely incredible. Even the game's setting is very original and oddly intriguing, with a more cartoon-like, but still fairly gritty approach to the post-apocalypse aesthetic, complete with such details as an (admittedly not yet fully fleshed out) original language and hints to some fairly complex plot elements.\nIn practice though, the game is even better. So, so much better. Nuclear Throne was built from the ground up to be as responsive and as visceral as possible. This is done through many seemingly insignificant factors such as attack animations, sound effects, and screen shake (which can be turned down, but unless you suffer from serious motion sickness, you're doing yourself a disservice by doing so). Combined with the considerable variety of weapons and fairly expansive character roster (both of which are still being added to), this creates a gameplay experience that is absolutely greater than the sum of its parts. Playing Nuclear Throne is enjoyable in ways that descriptions and even gameplay videos can't fully portray, because everything about the game is created to be satisfying on a psychological level.\nAlso worth noting, the devs everything a independent development can and should ever be. Being in early access, the game is updated around once a week, and the developers are always active on the message boards, receptive to suggestions, and perfectly transparent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferencmato/recommended/242680/","ferencmato","Pickles Giggles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferencmato/","275 products in account","This is the shortened version of my original Slovak review, which can be found here:\nhttp://www.madhouse.sk/152/nuclear-throne\nIt's a pretty quick traslation, so I apologize if it's not perfect.\n\nRather than explaining the basic mechanics, I'll only talk about what I personally think is good and bad with Nuclear Throne. Steam won't let me post the full review anyway. If this is still too long for you, skip to the conclusion at the end.\n\n____\n\nNuclear Throne might seem like a shallow indie title at first...and you could not be more wrong for thinking that. There's a surprising amount of depth, which is the reason why it's still fun to play, after the amount of hours I've put into it.\n\nEven though it is one of those games that I really love, and I do recommend it, it needs to be said that THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. This game is hardcore. Many people claim that it's the most difficult and the most frustrating game they have ever played. SO..if you aren't into rogue-lite and bullet hell, you can stop reading right now. If proceduraly generated content is not your thing, or you are not particularly skilled FPS player (even thought that entire genre), it may be hard for you to really enjoy chaotic nature of Nuclear Throne.\nHowever…if things mentioned above check all your boxes, and you feel strong enough to overcome first several hours full of frustration, then feel free to continue reading.\n\nOrganized chaos (the good)\n\nThere are many thing that I like about Nuclear Throne. The thing that stands out the most to me is not the sheer amount of content and possibilities, but the way they've tied it all together. The game has many ways how to keep you moving and thinking, and punishes you for every misstep you make. This is the level of depth and that special "something", that will have you coming back over and over again.\nDespite the random nature of the game, I found Nuclear Throne to be more skill based, than, let's say BoI or Risk of Rain. Sure, those games are a lot of fun…when you get the right drops. At least, that's my take on it. Nuclear Throne takes part of that problem away. You won't ever be completely OP, because the game is so unfair, that mutations don't make all that much of a difference…and they certainly won't get you to the throne by themself. And if you're good enough, even with bad build, you can have a great run. You're getting better yourself, your skills get better. Doesn't matter if RNG has a bad day.\nAlso, let's not forget to mention sound design, that is perfect. Everything, and I mean everything in this game, has it's own sound. Once you'll get into, it will help you a great deal to understand what the hell is going on on the screen. I can't stress enough how important this is in the game, where you can get killed by something you can't see at the moment. Also, soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ing great, and I still listen to it from time to time even when not playing.\nThe last big possitive, that is kind of hard to describe, is the overall gameplay and the feel of the game. That's something that Vlambeer excells at, and you will know what I mean if you've played Luftrausers or Super Crate Box. Controls are tight, everything feels right even though you are not sure why. There's something very visceral about the wa it plays. And the most important thing - the gameplay is fun, even though you are not very good at the game yet.\n\n"It's not fair, it's not right." (the bad)\n\nIt's little bit hard for me to talk about what's bad here, because I see the game differently after the time I've spend playing it. But I'll try my best.\nThe biggest downside to this game may be the time you have to put in, to actually get skilled enough and be able to see more, than just first couple of levels. That's pretty funny, because this is actually game that you can play, when you have just a couple of minutes to kill. Playthoughs last 10-15 minutes, of course they can strech to hour or more, as you get better and better. To fully explain what I'm trying to say here - I've beaten throne for the first time after playing the game for 60 hours. SIXTY. That just may be too much for some. That said, I'm someone who can get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ very much, very quickly…so if it wasn't fun for me to try and beat the game, I would ditch it half a year ago.\nAlso, the whole game is locked on 30 FPS, which may seem like a terrible idea for a game as frantic as this one. Not only that, but there are times, where the framerate dips even lower, because there's just too much stuff going on at the same time. Now, I know this may sound stupid to you, but I don't mind any of that. Freezeframes are an actual feature of the game (no, really). They are actually helpful, as they give you those fractions of the second to realize what's going on and act accordingly.\nBUT, I know some may have problems with that, so that's why I'm telling you about it. Also, I don't know what's up with that 4:3 format.\nAt the time of writing this, we are at update 97. As of now, there are still some bugs; also daily/weekly modes are pretty much unplayable, since leaderboards don't work. That said, I believe that Vlambeer will fix this as soon as they can. Nuclear Throne is imo one of the best examples of Early Access done right…\nLast, but not least - the game is ridiculously unfair at times. You will encounter situations that seem absolutely hopeless, because they really are. And even though the game lets you try different play styles, some just won't work very well…and that's a bit frustrating, to say the least.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nNuclear Throne is the best game in it's genre imho, and my personal GOTY. If you're looking for a hardcore shooter, that will provide you with endless hours of fun and tears, for the price, this is the best deal. Despite being procedurally generated, it doesn't feel completely random and your success actually depends on your skills, and not just RNG. However, it will take you a great amount of time to reach the throne, and that might just be too much to swallow for some.\nNuclear Throne covers the surprising amount of depth behind it's cute, yet weird pixel-art aestetic.

The game goes on to the next level after you kill all the enemies, and if you die, you restart from level 1 or pick a new character.

I miss the chicken freeze time ability. but consitently you will get better weapons as the game gets harder. none of that binding of issac lame power ups as the game gets harder.\n\n- THE DIFFICULTY.\nIt's hard, unforgiving like your parents when they caught you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ an apple pie, but that's a good thing because you learn from your mistakes and get better at ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the pie. which makes the expierence all the more rewarding. If you get caught with your pants down it is mainly your own fault\n\n-The Graphics.\nthat perfect mix of low fi cartoon style but defined well that you can see all the detailed pixel art. there are points that the chaos is too much but that's hardly bad. they got rid of that crappy screen shake problem, and it all flows smoothly, like a waterfall of caramelly chocolate goodness and rainbows wrapped in ♥♥♥♥♥♥s straight into your eyeballs.\n\n- The charaters and Power ups\neach character has a unique special ability, all the characters are fun to play and add layers to a already big onion. there's a secret throne room that offers different crowns of game changing awesomeness. after you level you get a moment in the spining vortew to pick a perk that enhances your characters traits. there will always be atleast 2 good power ups for the type of character your building and it's fun to grow stronger as the game does. the difficulty is still tough but unless you can't handle the heat, the food your cookings tasty.\n\n- IT IS FUN\nalot of games miss that crucial component. it is fun, I've played alot of this game and it's still fun and I still haven't finished it cause that boss with the jetpack and crazy gun kills me so fast. one moment I'm a mutated fish rolling on the ground the next I'm a mutated fish NOT rolling on the ground. such a powerful image even a child could understand it.\nfun, so much fun it's the very definition of fun gameplay\n\nTHE ♥♥♥♥\n\n- some small bugs, like the game wont start for me for some updates. but then it does. this is a minor issue and won't matter when they finish it. its still getting better and better. i hope it becomes the masterpiece it could potentially be\n\n- the tips\nduring loading screens they give you tips, while some like "don't die" or "don't be afraid" are funny and even motivating to push yourself further. at some point there should be a deeper guide that you dont have to buy or search for seperately\n\n- the chicken\nneeds a better power up\n\nin summary buy this game because it's awesome and a great investment in time killing. even now with the early access it's worth twice the asking price.\n\nUPDATE!\nI FINISHED THIS MONSTOSITY\nconclusion\nis 40% learning from mistakes through masochistic dying. 10 % accuracey, concentration and dodging 10% concentrated power of will. 40% luck and fun\nno replayability cause it was some guerilla warfare pain.","July 8, 2015","true","42.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The art is nice, and each character is balanced, although each player will end up having a favorite. The gameplay is fast. Really fast. As soon as I die I am left pondering what killed me (thankfully it tells you). You will definitely learn to react quicker and the strategies required to loop throughout your playtime with this game. Daily challenges and weekly challenges keep me coming back, and I love to participate in them.

Even though I am new to this game, there are so many ideas I have for it, and unlike more popular games, I can freely share them without being embarassed or called out for how ♥♥♥-smearingly stupid it is.

This game hits all the right switches for a fantastic roguelike shooter. Probably one of my favorite games of all time. This game has a steep learning curve, endless replay value (in my opinon), a boatload of content, especially in the "post game" parts. While "post game" really is just the start to the game. Excellent gunplay, weapons feel unique, satisfying and most of all, powerful. A 12 character roster (technically 14) with their own unique active and passive abilties. Add to that a heap of "mutations" aka perks that can help you during your run, going from the run of the mill stuff like "Extra Health" to "Hit Bullets have a chance to recover instantly" can allow you to play around certain weapon types, making you the king of the wasteland. Though it may seem brutal at the start it gets a lot better once you get better at it. It's one of those games that you start a round of at 10pm, then end up at 3am and hating yourself for loving it.

In Nuclear Throne, you control one of 11 different, unique mutants and/or other creatures on a never ending quest to reach the titular Nuclear Throne.   Each character has different passive and activatable abilities as well as sometimes unique weapons that make each of them fun to play as.  You have a multi-eyed mutant who can see better in dark levels and use telekinesis to bring enemies and pickups towards him, a literal "Melting Man" who has little HP but levels up quicker and can blow up corpses to make stunning chain kills, and my personal favorite character is a robot who can eat weapons to gain more ammo or heal itself and can also find better guns earlier.\n\nYou will die in Nuclear Throne.  You always will.  Its simply a matter of when and how.  The game is endless, with it getting progressively harder each time you "loop" the game.  The entire game is a fight for your life as you race from area to area in the hopes of just seeing the Throne.  On your journey, guns and other abilites are not your only ally.  By collecting rods of pure radiation, you level up and are given access to a selection of 4 mutations from a group of currently over 25.  Each one has viability and can make weapons and/or characters even more fun to play as.  None of them are useless, and while some may be more viable overall, each one has its time and place to be taken.  The weapons are also insane in their own right, ranging from your standard Machineguns, shotguns, and assault rifles, to god-given tools of decimation and absurdity.\n\nThe gameplay theme is conservation, specifically ammo conservation.  Ammo, while obtainable on every stage, is not very common compared to other games.  You can't just fire all you want whenever you want and expect to get the job done.  And while there are melee weapons, even then you have the risk of close-quarters combat with enemies that can crush you before you know it.  This game encourages you to think wisely about what weapons you use and when.  While a crossbow is nice against slow-moving bulky enemies, it isnt good against faster, player-rushing enemies, enemies that an assault rifle would be good for.\n\nEvery run is an adrenaline rush as you make your way through caves and scrapyards in pursuit of the Throne.  And with different layouts, weapons, mutations, and characters to recieve and choose from each time, every run is unique.  The soundtrack is also absolutely amazing, a great combination of hardcore rock pieces and somber acoustic guitar songs  that just add on the experience.\n\nIf you have 13 dollars, love roguelikes, love challenges, and most of all, love WINDOWS FULL OF SHINY, DEADLY BULLETS, this is the game to pick up.","September 18, 2014","true","476.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I had followed this game for quite a while but was never able to pick it up until then. I managed to rack up so many hours so fast, that my friends became worried and tried to talk to me about it. I told a few of them to try it out, and now they're addicted to this game. My friends who play it have developed a small "cult" and it seems like anyone who listens in on our conversations thinks we are the strangest people. It is now update 95 and so much has changed in this game. I can always find new and interesting ways to get better, more fun combinations of weapons, mutations, and crowns. I seriously cannot recommend this game enough to anyone. If you are feeling on the edge of getting it but are being hesitant, the developers have stated that the price will go down once this game is out of early access.

I've only got about 2.3 hours into the game but I play it every day and I love it!\nAll of the classes are nicely balanced\nI love the fact that you can watch Vlambeer's livestreams every Tuesday and Thursday where they add new content\nI really like how the game itself is set up!\nI bought the predecessor 'Wasteland Kings' in the Mojam 2 Humble bundle, and found out about the improved version at the Indie Developer booth at Minecon :)\nI reccomend this game to anyone who has some money to spend on an awesome game!\n\nEDIT: It's been 6 months since I purchased the game and I do not regret it. There was a large gap of time in which I didn't play the game, but a couple of updates put me back into it. I've gotten around 11 hours into this game in 6 months, which isn't really that much because of the length of time that I have owned this game. Even though I'm absolutely horrible at this game and cannot get past Big Dog (the second boss) I still love it to death and won't stop playing it until the development stops on it. The devs really make this game awesome, doing livestreams for players to know that their hard-earned money has not gone to waste, sometimes going onto the livestreams of their community, actually responding to questions on the steam community hub, and doing constant updates. All of this stuff makes me want to play the game, be it because of the new content or just that I'm supporting awesome devs.\n\nEDIT 2: It's been more than a year and a half since I purchased the game. I only have 60 hours in it and suck but it's one of my favorite games. The devs are awesome and the game is great, it's worth your money. I definitely recommend it.\n\nEDIT 3: It's been more than two years since I have purchased this game, it has now been fully released. This game is definitely STILL WORTH IT, and I've enjoyed every minute of my playtime, even if most of my deaths were due to BS like Golden Snow Tanks. Verdict: BUY IT.","November 27, 2013","true","118.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thiagogb/recommended/242680/","thiagogb","Choppa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thiagogb/","99 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWelcome to Nuclear Throne, and this is a review for it. As for now, Nuclear Throne is a early-access rogue-like indie game, that receives weekly updates to make the game more balanced and fun, as well as adding a lot of stuff. It still has loads of planned features, so if you decide to get the game, stick around it for a while, or come back to it from times to times to always have new experiences with it.\n\nNow starting from the game: You open the game to be welcomed by a very enjoyable soundtrack, as well as the character selection menu for it. You start the game with a few characters, but as you progress through it, you will unlock more of them, and at the time of this review, they are pretty easy to unlock. Every character has a passive and active ability, the active ability being used by pressing the right button of the mouse once in-game. It's also recommended you try every character, since they all play differently.\n\nOnce you select a character, you are ready to go. You will find yourself with a weapon at hands, surrounded by enemies in the middle of a nuclear wasteland. Your objective is to use the weapons and abilities on your arsenal to kill all the enemies in the area to activate a portal, leading to the next level. You quest is to reach a throne, collecting radiation on your way to mutate yourself and turn into a even more powerful being, as well as collecting new weapons, which can be divided by:\n-Bullet weapons\n-Shell weapons\n-Bolt weapons\n-Explosive weapons\n-Energy weapons\n-Melee weapons\n(note that all the weapon types listed above have their own ammo, and also their own sub categories, but that use the same ammo type)\n\nThe gameplay is very simple. You spawn in a area, filled with enemies, and the random generated levels could get you easily, so keep an eye open. Sometimes it could be very easy but in other occasions, it might just swarm you with foes, leaving you to die right after spawning. The game can also be frustrating at the time, since the chances of you being a master right off the start are very small, so you can expect to die a lot, but it's all part of the game, everytime you play it and die, you grow better at it for learning how to deal with enemies carefully. Keep an eye on your ammo, as you might run out pretty quickly with certain weapons, and don't forget to choose your mutations wisely.\n\nWrapping everything up, I'd give Nuclear Throne a 10/10 for being an awesome game. Awesome soundtrack, challenging gameplay, and an frustrating, yet enjoyable, expirience. I'd recommend going to the game's Wiki[nuclear-throne.wikia.com] for more in-depth information about the game's development and already implemented features. Remember once again that the game might not be enjoyable right away for some people not used to this kind of game, rogue-likes tend to be difficult and require patience to play and master\n","January 17, 2015","true","251.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The levels, loot, and enemies are all randomly generated, with set bosses at certain points. Get enough plutonium and you'll level up and get to pick one of four random new mutations (more ammo capacity, more melee range, some kills generate HP, and so on). When you die, it's game over.

Elements from the Binding of Isaac, Hotline Miami and Borderlands combine to make an extremely challenging but fun game that you will play for hours on end trying to get past the next area. Good variety of different characters, weapons, mutations and enemies keep this bullet-hell roguelite new and refreshing every time.

I enjoy the soundtrack and the mutations are a fun leveling tree. This game is tough. I would like to see online multiplayer. My only complaint so far has been that in local co-op the descriptions of stuff, such as your base traits and what the mutations will do, overlap and cut one player off from seeing their description properly.\n\nI have also noticed that it seems significantly easier in singleplayer than in multiplayer (though still hard as crap-for me anyway). I'm not sure if that means that me and my friend suck, if multiplayer is not ideal for this crazy fast paced small level game, or what.\n\nRegardless of any flaws, this game is awesome. I paid full price and it was totally worth it. I highly recommend it, as long as you are prepared to die a ton.","February 15, 2015","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I will summerize the whole deal in 3 words.\nHardest - Game - Ever.\nEven our society's best Faze clan's 360 no scopers will have a very hard time going through different generated levels.\nThe game's content makes it a very fun game even though its hard, lots of different weapons and classes and upgrades, different monsters and enemies, each level is different than the other one. Basically , you can't get bored of this game realy...\nI recommend this game to anyone who seeks challenge in gaming.

Ever since I bought it when it first came out, it's been a great deal of fun experiencing the new updates and growth of the game. The delevopers roll out new updates every sunday (don't quote me on the day) with detailed patch notes, bug fixes, and new content.\n\nIn my opinion, what makes this game stand out is it feels like an arcade game.

As you continue, you get better weapons but the enemies get stronger and shoot MORE bullets towards you. Every few levels, you find a boss that has considerably more health than everyone else, and seem to only spawn when you are in a pinch and surrounded by enemies.\n\nIn short, this game has a surprising amount of story to it and the developers update it almost every week, not to mention the music is awesome and there are secret levels everywhere.

Having over 200 games on Steam and having played many more on handhelds, consoles, and yes, even phones, I can safely say that this game is worth thirty times what it costs as of now.\n\nLet's start with the gameplay. Oh, the gameplay. Every gun is varied and somewhat useful and satisfying to use, the characters and how you play them vary vastly despite having little differences between them, And by satisfying, I mean oh, good lord. Let me quantify this. Have you ever played a game in which a shotgun feels the same as a pistol? That game lacks what some call, "crunch". Nuclear Throne is naught but crunchy. Killing with the basic revolver is satisfying if a bit difficult, most of your friends will find differing opinions on characters to use, and finally, the game's FUN. No questions asked, straight-up FUN.\n\nNow how about the graphics and sound? This game has one of, if not THE best pixel aesthetic I've seen. Everything pops out from the background and it feels alive. It's not muddled down by the browns and the greys; you can tell what's what almost all of the time. Oh, and the music is spectacular. It's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time and every song or ambient track is somewhat enjoyable.\n\nHow about the length? Well, depending on your skill level, it could take you over 500 hours to even make it to the final boss once. However, if you're skilled enough, you could loop twice within 40 hours. It really does vary on skill level, so I wouldn't say much about it. Just know that no matter how many times you try, you'll come back to the game.\n\nIn essence, this game is fantastic beyond belief. Vlambeer is a fantastic developer that I would very much enjoy to purchase from in the future. They've released several other games that I'd recommend as well, too, so check them out if you can!\n\n...except for Super Crate Box.

Not as many items and mutations as that game but the raw gameplay is skill based and more akin to Hotline Miami as opposed to BoI where it's all about your items and bullet-hell running around. It has a wild-west feel of emptying your clip and hoping that when the dust settles you'll be alive and there'll be enough supplies for the next level.\n\nThe story, setup, worlds, bosses, guns, enemies, and artstyle are top notch. Every time you die it never feels like the game screwed you, and each world has it's own tactics and style.\n\nJust a perfect game and a truly unique roguelike. My only complaint so far is that they need to add more characters. 7 doesn't feel like enough for this game.","June 15, 2014","true","37.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some guns you get from the start can last you a while, and it's pretty rare for your weapons to become 'outdated' if you manage your drops wisely and pick the right mutations.\nEnemies are kind of odd sometimes, and you're going to feel legitimately cheated sometimes when you turn the corner and a flock of enemies rip you a new everything. The game is fast to restart though, and you'll be getting shot by crows again in no time.\nThe action from fight to fight goes from calm and controlled to frantic and twitchy very quickly, and the fear factor of losing a good setup really helps with the panic of being on low health and surrounded. Some times you'll just die, but other times you manage to kill off a filled room at 1 health and it feels great.\n\nThese devs update once per week. There is always something these two want to update with the game, and the updates bring new guns, UI, balance, upgrades, everything. This is an Early Access title where you can really see where your money's going. The devs keep up to date with the community and it's pretty much amazing. Only a slight downside, but you do have your save reset every update. Characters aren't hard to unlock though, and it takes about an okay life or two to unlock all but one of the characters, the last one being a bit trickier to unlock carelessly.\n\nOver time, you'll start to understand the game more and really come to love some of the possible loadouts and character setups you can pull off in this game.\n\nDO NOTE, HOWEVER, if you can't spend the sub-20-or-something dollars this game costs, it's not going on sale until the game is completely finished. Get less than 20 dollars. This is a good game.\n\n6/10 there's mimics\n\nEDIT NOW THAT IT'S OUT: Yeah still get this game. Just like before, only get it if you're a real hardcore video gamer who plays tough video games that hurt to lose at.","July 18, 2015","true","107.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm still kinda in awe over what a great game this is. So much so, in fact, that even with the bugs, the lack of content [still being early access at time of writing], I want to play over and over. More so than some $109 games (*cough*bf4*ehem*). The famous last words "just one more game" are uttered quite a few times during my sessions with Nuke Throne. There is sooo much that is right with this game but the most notable is the controls. Vlambeer gets them right (everytime!). What gives this style, flare, replayability and more fun factor is nice selection of characters with diffrent and challenging abilities and an ever expanding list of items, weapons, leveling up, and upgrades. I can't say enough good things about this game so I'll sum it up for you. If you are a fan of dual (or twin) stick sh'mups, what are you reading this for? You should have already bought the game! But since you haven't you should support a good indie dev and buy it in its early access. Regardless, I've got the "itch" to play again, but this is a solid 10/10 in my book and maybe in top 5 dual stick shooters of all time (pending completion).\n->RoX<-","April 29, 2014","true","166.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What is expenses? Could it be possible that ancient civilizations were visited by outer space travelers? Let's find out.\n\nNuclear Throne is an isometric bullet hell shooter with roguelike elements. Esentially, the goal of the game is to clean seven 'worlds' or instantiations of a nuclear wasteland by killing every moving thing in them. To do so, you are armed with a broad range of weapons, from classic assault rifles and revolvers to more futuristic stuff like laser cannons and lightsabers. Also, your character mutates as you kill more enemies, obtaining certain buffs like extra health, lower enemy bullets, the ability to push through walls, etc.\n\nFrom the first moment it is clear that the game has a very arcadey setting. Lots of bullets, screen shaking constantly, low health both for the player and the enemies. Some enemy faking death gets up and instakills you. A boss spawns right next to you. A cop reflects your bullets back, killing you in the process. In Nuclear Throne, everything happens very fast, especially your death. This is a hard game. This is the most important thing to bear in mind when purchasing Nuclear Throne. It is a ♥♥♥♥ing hard game. And I'm not talking about Dark Souls-like hard. If you're ok with dying against the easiest enemy, for any bad decision, for any second of doubt, then go ahead and buy the game. Otherwise go buy any PS3-gen game.\n\nAs mentioned above, Nuclear Throne has some roguelike elements, namely random level generation and permadeath. The former is well implemented, although in a simple way. Most levels have nothing remarkable about them. Some people complain about spawning in the middle of a room full of enemies. It is true that some spawning scenarios may be overwhelming at first, but in my experience I have found that it is possible to deal with this situations. Regarding permadeath, there's not much to say in a time when every indie roguelike has permadeath because it is trendy.  You can argue that it is a way to artificially extend the game life, you can argue that its a way of mastering the game. That's up to you.\n\nThe setting of the game is pretty bizarre. You find yourself in an unexplained nuclear wasteland, where the survivors fight for some reason not really clear, but who really cares about lore in a arcade shooter? Most of the characters and enemies are mutated animals, which is quite original. The art of the game is simple but effective, and matches the tone of the game. The music is amazing, go check it out for yourself (the ♥♥♥♥ing ending song dude, the ♥♥♥♥ing ending song).\n\nNuclear Throne comes with some very welcome features like many playable characters with different strong and weak points and lots of different weapons, which leads to different gameplay styles. There are crowns, which act as game modifiers, and also some secret levels. Recently, daily and weekly challenges were added. Not that they are a completely different game, but these things add some replayability.\n\nIn conclusion, Nuclear Throne is one of the best roguelike games right now. If you like the genre, and don't mind dying a lot while slowly getting better, then this is your game. And, by the way, yes, aliens built the pyramids. You said it. Not me.","December 29, 2015","true","42.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You don't have to reset endlessly for a viable run, enemies actually die when you shoot them, and...just in general, it's a joy to play. It's punishing as hell, but it's fast, the gunplay is amazing (Borderlands doesn't have ♥♥♥♥ on the weapons in this game) and only the most frustrating deaths will dissuade you from taking explosive revenge.\n\nIt's also worth noting that it's one of the most exemplary titles in Early Access and it won't go on sale until after release, so if you're curious, go for it now.","November 5, 2015","true","69.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What is expenses? Could it be possible that ancient civilizations were visited by outer space travelers? Let's find out.\n\nNuclear Throne is an isometric bullet hell shooter with roguelike elements. Esentially, the goal of the game is to clean seven 'worlds' or instantiations of a nuclear wasteland by killing every moving thing in them. To do so, you are armed with a broad range of weapons, from classic assault rifles and revolvers to more futuristic stuff like laser cannons and lightsabers. Also, your character mutates as you kill more enemies, obtaining certain buffs like extra health, lower enemy bullets, the ability to push through walls, etc.\n\nFrom the first moment it is clear that the game has a very arcadey setting. Lots of bullets, screen shaking constantly, low health both for the player and the enemies. Some enemy faking death gets up and instakills you. A boss spawns right next to you. A cop reflects your bullets back, killing you in the process. In Nuclear Throne, everything happens very fast, especially your death. This is a hard game. This is the most important thing to bear in mind when purchasing Nuclear Throne. It is a ♥♥♥♥ing hard game. And I'm not talking about Dark Souls-like hard. If you're ok with dying against the easiest enemy, for any bad decision, for any second of doubt, then go ahead and buy the game. Otherwise go buy any PS3-gen game.\n\nAs mentioned above, Nuclear Throne has some roguelike elements, namely random level generation and permadeath. The former is well implemented, although in a simple way. Most levels have nothing remarkable about them. Some people complain about spawning in the middle of a room full of enemies. It is true that some spawning scenarios may be overwhelming at first, but in my experience I have found that it is possible to deal with this situations. Regarding permadeath, there's not much to say in a time when every indie roguelike has permadeath because it is trendy.  You can argue that it is a way to artificially extend the game life, you can argue that its a way of mastering the game. That's up to you.\n\nThe setting of the game is pretty bizarre. You find yourself in an unexplained nuclear wasteland, where the survivors fight for some reason not really clear, but who really cares about lore in a arcade shooter? Most of the characters and enemies are mutated animals, which is quite original. The art of the game is simple but effective, and matches the tone of the game. The music is amazing, go check it out for yourself (the ♥♥♥♥ing ending song dude, the ♥♥♥♥ing ending song).\n\nNuclear Throne comes with some very welcome features like many playable characters with different strong and weak points and lots of different weapons, which leads to different gameplay styles. There are crowns, which act as game modifiers, and also some secret levels. Recently, daily and weekly challenges were added. Not that they are a completely different game, but these things add some replayability.\n\nIn conclusion, Nuclear Throne is one of the best roguelike games right now. If you like the genre, and don't mind dying a lot while slowly getting better, then this is your game. And, by the way, yes, aliens built the pyramids. You said it. Not me.","December 29, 2015","true","42.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Having over 200 games on Steam and having played many more on handhelds, consoles, and yes, even phones, I can safely say that this game is worth thirty times what it costs as of now.\n\nLet's start with the gameplay. Oh, the gameplay. Every gun is varied and somewhat useful and satisfying to use, the characters and how you play them vary vastly despite having little differences between them, And by satisfying, I mean oh, good lord. Let me quantify this. Have you ever played a game in which a shotgun feels the same as a pistol? That game lacks what some call, "crunch". Nuclear Throne is naught but crunchy. Killing with the basic revolver is satisfying if a bit difficult, most of your friends will find differing opinions on characters to use, and finally, the game's FUN. No questions asked, straight-up FUN.\n\nNow how about the graphics and sound? This game has one of, if not THE best pixel aesthetic I've seen. Everything pops out from the background and it feels alive. It's not muddled down by the browns and the greys; you can tell what's what almost all of the time. Oh, and the music is spectacular. It's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time and every song or ambient track is somewhat enjoyable.\n\nHow about the length? Well, depending on your skill level, it could take you over 500 hours to even make it to the final boss once. However, if you're skilled enough, you could loop twice within 40 hours. It really does vary on skill level, so I wouldn't say much about it. Just know that no matter how many times you try, you'll come back to the game.\n\nIn essence, this game is fantastic beyond belief. Vlambeer is a fantastic developer that I would very much enjoy to purchase from in the future. They've released several other games that I'd recommend as well, too, so check them out if you can!\n\n...except for Super Crate Box. That one was just frustrating.","September 23, 2014","true","103.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm still kinda in awe over what a great game this is. So much so, in fact, that even with the bugs, the lack of content [still being early access at time of writing], I want to play over and over. More so than some $109 games (*cough*bf4*ehem*). The famous last words "just one more game" are uttered quite a few times during my sessions with Nuke Throne. There is sooo much that is right with this game but the most notable is the controls. Vlambeer gets them right (everytime!). What gives this style, flare, replayability and more fun factor is nice selection of characters with diffrent and challenging abilities and an ever expanding list of items, weapons, leveling up, and upgrades. I can't say enough good things about this game so I'll sum it up for you. If you are a fan of dual (or twin) stick sh'mups, what are you reading this for? You should have already bought the game! But since you haven't you should support a good indie dev and buy it in its early access. Regardless, I've got the "itch" to play again, but this is a solid 10/10 in my book and maybe in top 5 dual stick shooters of all time (pending completion).\n->RoX<-","April 29, 2014","true","166.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have to shoot your way through dungeons/maps that find ways of confusing you, so it's advised that you don't rush them. If you want a game that is packed full of challenges for your hand-eye co-ordination and reflexes, then I definetly believe you should play it.

These characters all have their own unique play-style that helps you through the different experiences had throughout this game. For your characters, you can find new weapons and "mutations" (upgrades). The game is still in Early Access so it isn't nearly done. In saying that, the content that is in this gem of a game so far is great. DEFINITELY worth the $13.\n\nBe careful. This is one of those games where you say "Oh, I'll just do 1 more run." HA. Wrong.

Games with roguelike elements are known for their high replayability, and Nuclear Throne is no different, but a big part of the replay value in this game is the different abilities of each of the characters.  Transform into an immobile bullet-reflecting cyrstal spire, eat guns and recycle them into ammunition, ensnare enemies in a tangle of thorny vines, cause enemy corpses on screen to explode... each character changes your approach to the game in sometimes subtle and sometimes dramatic ways, and that'sone of the big things that keeps me coming back.

Games with roguelike elements are known for their high replayability, and Nuclear Throne is no different, but a big part of the replay value in this game is the different abilities of each of the characters.  Transform into an immobile bullet-reflecting cyrstal spire, eat guns and recycle them into ammunition, ensnare enemies in a tangle of thorny vines, cause enemy corpses on screen to explode... each character changes your approach to the game in sometimes subtle and sometimes dramatic ways, and that'sone of the big things that keeps me coming back.  Even though I do have my personal favories... Robot and Melting 4 life!  And death.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtox508/recommended/242680/","dtox508","d.Tox508","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtox508/","217 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n**PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THIS WAS WRITTEN 10/26/13 AND AS THIS GAME IS IN BETA IT IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING SO THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE GAME AS IT WAS AT THE TIME**\n\nYet another addicting roguelike from Vlambeer and friends, Nuclear Throne is the cooler older brother of Super Crate Box. This time around there are more crazy monsters to kill with another massive arsenal and seven new playable characters to do it with. When I first saw previews for the game, I recognized the work immediately as Vlambeer, as I was a huge fan of Super Crate Box. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this game is being able to move freely through an open level, opposed to the single screen of SCB as well as the option to choose from multiple characters with different stats and special abilities.\n\nAfter a few failed attempts at trying to reach out to Vlambeer via Twitter for a possible copy to review I just decided to buy it. Supporting indie developers like Vlambeer who have provided us gamers with awesome free games like Super Crate Box doesn’t bother me, I just didn’t want to wait till my next payday to be able to play this game, AND coincidentally Nuclear Throne happened to come out on my birthday. Anyway, I digress… Nuclear Throne is more fun than playing Mario 3 christmas morning 1988 and manages to keep you on your toes while you battle through each level where your goal is to clear it of all enemies. Loaded with upgrades, tons of different weapons and ammo, a boat load of monsters that came off a zombie infected Noah’s Ark of doom, and a cast of characters resembling the Garbage Pail Kids, Nuclear Throne is sure to turn you into the next Toxic Avenger.\n\nNuclear Throne is Vlambeers latest action roguelike-like about mutants fighting their way through a post-apocalyptic world. The radioactive waste in the world allows mutants to get ahead by mutating new limbs on the fly, the abundant availability of powerful weaponry makes the quest to become ruler of the Wasteland one fraught with peril. At this point in development, Nuclear Throne consists of 7 playable characters and has 4 worlds, each containing 3 sub levels that you must complete before moving on to the next. Your ultimate goal is to clear the map, collect ammo, build your arsenal and gather nuclear waste to gain levels.\n\nTo gain levels you must collect the nuclear waste capsules that enemies drop after you kill them. After collecting so many of these you gain your next level and given the opportunity to upgrade your character. Some of these upgrades include “Lucky Shot” that when added allows some shots to regenerate ammo. “Blood Lust” gives you the ability where some kills may regenerate your HP, or “Rhino Skin” which gives you an added +4HP. These upgrades are essential to your gameplay, and if you choose wisely you can get further and further every time you play.\n\nThe gameplay of Nuclear Throne is genius and compelling, keeping you glued to your computer making every last bullet a battle cry at redemption. Each character has its own special ability and varied stats, for example, “Fish” gets more ammo than most other characters, and his special ability is the doge roll. Whereas “Crystal” gets more HP, and has the crystal shield as a special ability. Right now my favorite character is “Plant.” He moves around faster, and has the ability to throw seeds out and snare enemies making it easier to kill them. This helps greatly when trying to move around enemies that are shooting at you as well, not to mention snaring larger enemies allowing for an easier target to move around.\n\nWeaponry isn’t an issue when it comes to Nuclear Throne. Everything from a screwdriver to a grenade launcher, Vlambeer certainly didn’t leave anything out of this one. The shooting dynamics when using a mouse and keyboard are flawless, and put the power from your current weapon at your finger tips. Extra ammunition is found from killing enemies and dropped randomly, usually when you’re running low. Like many roguelikes, ammo is essential and there usually isn’t that much of it readily available, especially when using the triple machine gun.You can also find ammo and extra weapons from the chests scattered throughout each level, and health is also dropped this way as well.\n\nThe music in Nuclear Throne blends perfectly with gameplay and isn’t overly annoying like in most other games. I liked that each level had its own unique and distinct music that was congruent to its surroundings. Graphicly, Nuclear Throne is a step up from Super Crate Box and adds more shading while adding more characteristics to the enemies and playable characters. Overall, Nuclear Throne is an awesome game, tons of fun to play, and leaves you wanting more. Anytime that I find myself thinking about a video game outside of my house I know that its a hit. Needless to say this game is incredible, and even in early development shows promise. I highly suggest this one, its bound to be another classic.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nPlayability: 7/10\nStory: 3/10\nChallenge: 7/10\nReplay Value: 7/10","November 28, 2013","true","6.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Fight through levels of deadly enemies that can and will kill you on sight. Shoot maggots with a Triple Machine-gun or use a crossbow on a bandit while avoiding hundreds of bullets that will chunk your health down pretty quickly.\n\nThe cast of characters is vast and their abilities add a new type of playstyle everytime you try them out. Playing "Melting" lets you explode every corpse you create, but you only get 2 health. That's basically a one-hit wonder. Play as "Crystal" and block and reflect every shot for a limited time, but be careful not to get surrounded. Play as "Steroids" and get a hefty amount of health and dual-weilding capacity. Ever wanted to shoot double laser guns? I know I have.\n\nThis game will keep you entertained and hitting R to quick restart for a good amount of time every session. The levels are randomly generated, and so are the enemies, but the difficulty never goes down. Gather experience to gain upgrades such as an increase in melee range or regenerating bullets on hit.\n\nIf you manage to reach the Vault, you can gain a Crown upgrade that may make the game more rewarding, but also challenging. You could also choose no crown, for a bald head is the best head.\n\nWhether you're a casual gamer or a bullet hell lover, this game will manage to keep you entertained for it's value, not to mention Vlambeer likes to release constant updates fixing bugs and adding content.\n\nTestimonies\n-----------------\n\n"Pls good, such buy, wow." - Me\n"This game...is a game." - Me\n"Dude, shut up, these aren't testimonies." - Some guy\n"He payed me to write this." - Anonymous tip","December 25, 2013","true","92.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If you're like me you enjoy the pixel-like graphics it is, if you're a new ager((Or whatever)) then you probably wont enjoy the pixels as much.)\nI honestly can't really think of anything else.\n\n\nThere you have it. This game is highly recommended by me. 10/10 Lovely game.\n","December 20, 2014","true","90.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/recommended/242680/","Aizawaa","crowbAr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/","342 products in account","rating: worth buying at full price\nscore: 8/10 - very good\nsimilar games: Doom, Binding of Isaac\ntags: shooter, rogue-lite, top down\n\nNuclear Throne is one of those games which have great core gameplay, but lack content and maybe a bit polish too. Because of that the game didn't provide a satisfying experience to me although the gunplay is really satisfying. What I basicly expect from every rogue-lite game these days is the following:\n\nlots and lots of unlockables -> encourages multiple playthroughs and makes death not feel meaningless\nThe only unlocks in Nuclear Throne are new characters, but those I would normally count as a bonus, since they don't affect your next playthrough at all, they just offer a new playstyle, but if you don't like most of the characters then these unlocks are worthless to you. And that was the case a bit for me in Nuclear Throne. Some of the characters are useless if you ask me, but the most fun to play character was definitly Steroids, and I just play as him. He has the highest DPS and is just the most crazy character which makes him by far the most fun to play for me. But at least the character design is really creative and cool. You can also unlock crowns but they are useless and don't have a big impact on the game, and you can unlock golden weapons which replace your starting weapon, which isn't a big deal, because you get new and good weapons really fast anyway.\n\nlots of different upgrades -> makes every run feel more unique\nThere are only a handful of upgrades (mutations are they called) in this game and a third of those are completely useless. Because of that your character build will be same more of less for every run. Also there is a mutation which heals you when you make kills, this is BY FAR the best mutation in the game and has a too big impact on the game. This wouldn't be a problem if the HP drops weren't so random. In some runs the game is generous and gives you lots of HP drops, in other runs you will rarely see one. What is the point in this extreme randomness?\n\nrandomly generated levels need things which are worth randomly generating -> make every run feel more unique\nWhat I mean by this is how similar the runs feel because of how the levels are generated. The enemies you encounter for every region will be the same, the types of weapons you will find will be same, just the paths you have to go will be a bit different but the difference won't have any impact on how you will play the levels, they are just different so the game isn't completely the same every time. But this is not enough. In very few instances sometimes a rare enemy appeared in a level. This game needs more of that, don't have a set ensemble of enemy types per region and use them all, but have a big pool of enemies per region and only use a few of that pool, so you will encounter different enemies every run. The weapon drops could also use more variety. Maybe give weapons status effects like burn of freeze damage (that exists in the game but just a bit).\n\nthe game needs to become harder after every playthrough -> encourage multiple playthroughs and allows the developers to better balance the learning and difficulty curve\nWhat I mean by this is how Binding of Isaac does things. For your first run there are only like 6 regions, when you beat the final boss you permanently unlock a new region after the final one for your next run which is more difficult. Then you unlock another region maybe, but then after beating the main boss 10 times the whole game gets more difficult, but that also makes sense because by this point you have unlocked tons of items and upgrades. Nuclear Throne has the "looping" mechanic and hard mode, but that's it.\n\nAnother thing which is extremely infuriating in this game is how sometimes you can be nothing but unlucky and just die, especially in 5-3 where you sometimes spawn in the middle of million enemies while a boss appears which shoots 100 projectiles, flys all over the places while making explosions when landing, spawning more enemies AND when you beat him he will randomly fly in a direction and explode. You beat the boss but because RNG decided to make him fly in your direction and explode you loose anyway. There are lots of really cheap deaths like that in the game. Even more infuriating is when a portal spawns near a car and make the car explode which can kill you even if you have lots of HP. And the thing is I don't understand why this is, because apart from these cheap things the enemy design is GREAT with a lot of variety and depth.\n\nOne last thing. The game's core gameplay is already really good and has depth, but it could have even more depth by allowing the player to carry more than 2 weapons. I think it would be great if you just could carry a weapon of each weapon type at the same time. This is would give the game more depth because then you would have to consider more criteria when making more decisions. Obviously enemy design and balance and other things have to be adjusted as well for this to work. Just think Doom and Serious Sam.\n\nThe game still gets a REALLY good score from me, because the core gameplay is just really good, great character design, great enemy design, great weapon design, great sound design and great soundtrack. All the ingredients for a 10/10 game are there, but there is just not enough AT ALL around that. The game "Downwell" has the same problem, but that game costs 3€.\n\nOh, also: 30 fps lock is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid especially for this type of game.","December 28, 2015","true","24.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

If one doesn't fit your play style, simply choose another.\n+ Fun mutation system, sometimes you get ones you don't want but have to make it work.\n+ Interesting to infuriating enemies (I'm looking at you scorpions, rats, flame traps and green ooze exploder).\n+ Multitude of weaponry, some good, some bad, some great and some awful.\n+ Daily and Weekly Challenges ideas are great.\n+ Crown system for run manipulation.\n\nCons - The game is prone to the occasional crash.\n- Still has a lot of bugs that should've been fixed before release, but alas the devs had to honour a contractual agreement on PSX and it would've seemed strange that it released on platform and not the other I guess.\n- Base weapon RNG is just terrible. The frequency at which you get duplicate weapons is way too high (but then again it's random).\n- Level generation leaves A LOT to be desired. Sometimes it's good and other times you get swarmed with no way out. The player should always spawn in a safe location and not right next to enemies as it currently does as this often leads to panic and death.\n- Some boss fights rely on your initial spawn namely Raven\Assassin + Sniper infested Big Dog fight and Tank + Snow Bot\Yeti Lil' Hunter fight.\n- Most Crowns seem rather pointless or worthless as they make your run worse with no added benefits.\n- The Daily Challenge is not really fair or balanced as players can choose whichever character to play as and certain characters are just better overall. Secret levels, big weapons chest and leveling right before a level has a tendency of changing the seed resulting in a modified level generation. Crowns especially Crown of Blood can have an unfair advantage on score (but this is more like Ghosting in Spelunky so I'm not too peeved about it, if you're good enough to do it then do it).\n- Speaking of Daily and Weekly Challenges, their leader boards have been broken since release. I know the devs are working on it but it should've been ready at launch.\n- Hard Mode is just terrible and not fun. The game basically starts on Loop 1, 1-1 and the player is given a big weapons chest at the start which contains 'beginning tier' weapons to deal with  swarms of enemies. I get that Hard Mode was put in as a joke but that is most certainly not how you do hard mode.\n\nIrritations - Each character starts off with the same gear, a pistol except Chicken and Rogue. Even though you can unlock golden weapons to start off with, I'd have liked if each character had a different base starting weapon.\n- Enemies know your position as you spawn even without line of sight and often shoot at you from off-screen.\n- Enemy AI is too inconsistent at times; Bandits will often look at you and shoot backwards or vice-versa. Yeti bots can be stuck in their charge state for a very long time often gliding across the levels. Snow dogs can be stuck in their shoot pattern for far too long. IDPD inspectors often shoot their shots at you even though you are far beyond thier reach.\n- The game is unbalanced as a result of some changes made during the Early Access phase and too often the difficulty of situations feel cheap as it was beyond the player's control.\n- Looping is a mess; prepared to be swarmed by flies, scorpions, snipers and\or assassins unless you have a powerful weapon or skill.\n- I feel the game relies too heavily on RNG this is seen clearly with the seed generation and weapon drops the for Daily and Weekly Challenges.\n- Tiered weapon distribution needs some work still. At 'late game' pre-loop, you shouldn't even be given 'beginning tier' weapons any more or rather they should drop less in my opinion.\n- You tell me to avoid weapons chests and when I do you give me 2 wrenches and a low tier bullet weapon mid game. What kind of rubbish is that?\n- Secret levels aren't really interesting to be honest. I wish there were unique weapons you could only attain on those levels like how it was done in Spelunky.\n- It makes no sense to me why the player is the only one affected by Flame Trap in the Wasteland and Spider Webs in the Caves. Enemies should not be able to walk or run full speed on the webs except for the spiders and crystals.\n- I wish the scoring system used for the Daily\Weekly Challenge Leader board rankings relied on something more than just kills, something like a point system for instance.\n* Points based on enemy types (1pts - Maggot, 3pts - Big Maggot, 5pts - Bandit, 15pts - Scorpion, 30pts - Golden Scorpion etc.)\n* 1.0		- Loop 0 multiplier (increments by 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 2.0 etc.)\n* 100pts	- Per level, affected by the Loop Multiplier\n* 250pts	- Secret levels (multiples of 250)\n* 500pts	- Defeating bosses (multiples of 500)\n* 750pts	- Crown raid + taking crowns\n* 1000pts	- IDPD HQ raid\n\nVerdict  Nuclear Throne is an extremely enjoyable and frantic rogue-lite which requires your utmost attention as any wrong slip will result in your death. Sometimes you get a crap seed where you get murdered instantly, don't get the right mutations or weapons and other times you get all the right mutations and weapons and go on a murderous rampage. That feeling is exhilarating. However it was released with various bugs that should've been fixed while in Early Access and it unfortunately represents the first strike against Vlambeer's perfect or near perfect record.\n\nSo can I recommend you buy this game, sadly no, not with all the issues currently surrounding it which is a shame as the game is really enjoyable. However, if you can overlook the Cons and Irritations and understand that you're purchasing an unfinished game then by all means go for it, otherwise it's best to wait a while until the bugs\issues are fixed.\n\n- Review Update: (2016-02-22 Update 98) -\nVerdictNuclear Throne is an extremely enjoyable and frantic rogue-lite which requires your utmost attention as any wrong slip will result in your death. Sometimes you get a crap seed where you get murdered instantly, don't get the right mutations or weapons and other times you get all the right mutations and weapons and go on a murderous rampage. That feeling is exhilarating. Although it was released in a broken manner, it seems Vlambeer was hard at work to fix all\most of what was broken and I'm happy to sasy that I'm glad they did.\n\nSo can I recommend you buy this game now after Update 98, sadly still no. Don't get me wrong Update 98 fixed some things like the Daily\Weekly Challenges and some other issues but the game is still buggy and crashes from time to time for no reason.","January 26","false","643.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","3"

Nuclear Throne is highly replayable and satisfying.\n\nThe enemies are varied, the guns each feel different and there's a decent level of strategy over randomness with weapon, mutation and character selection. It feels quite balanced, even whilst in early access, and Vlambeer tweak and update the game on a very frequent schedule (about weekly, so far as I have seen).\n\nThere is the promise of eventual online co-op and perhaps a versus mode too, but even without those I would recommend the game.","June 15, 2014","true","46.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game already feels finished, with a wide variety of characters to choose from. With one active and one passive special ability they all play differently, some only a little and some a lot (samurai-chicken!).\nTher is new stuff to discover even after you've played for a long time, secrets to discover, new awesome weapons to find, secret rooms and so on. And the developers are doing almost weekly updates, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller, so there is still lots of content coming on top of that.\n\nThe gameplay mechanic is very simple, as you go around shooting everybody while trying to avoid enemies and projectiles. There is some character progression through various mutations, but the game is still mostly based on your skill in aiming and evading.\nFor me it's not a game to be playing for hours on end, but rather a few runs whenever I find the time.\nOh, and did I already mention the game has great music?\n\nFor me this is definitely the best indie game this year.","July 16, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game in its current state has plenty of characters each with their own passive and active abilities, accounting for many different playstyles. The game is randomly generated and extremely difficult leaving a lot of replayability. There are a large number of weapons and a few secrets to be found. Throughout the game you will collect rads to level up. When you leave a floor in which you levelled up you get to choose from one of four mutations, which change the way certain things work.

While most people are driven away by the Early Access label, being in early access is what kept me playing this game more and more. When I first got it, it was a lot of fun. With every week that came, a new update came for the game. New content, fixes, balancing, and more. This is what kept me returning to it. Every week I would check if the new update came out, to see if they added a new area, new weapon, or sometimes even a new character. Overall, this game is fast paced and tons of fun. In some areas it can become a nightmare with all the bullets, but with each new update they are balancing certains aspects of the game to keep it a bit more fair.

For a cheap title, it's a hell lotta' fun.\n\nFor one, it's filled with a ton of characters with various risks vs. rewards and ultimately takes a ton of skill, time, and effort to find your best character, playstyle, and luck, of course! Go full dakka as Steroids? Or equip yourself with a melee and a weapon for some more utility? Ultimately, it comes down to preference. The art so far for this game is amazing. The music is great, rememberable, something that you wouldn't mind listening to outside of playing it. Enemy design is great, easy to follow patterns, but when the going gets tough, it gets tough.","November 17, 2013","true","239.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The randomly generated levels, weapon drops and leveling system makes it fun to play over and over again, trying different characters, different perks and weapons.

While currently very small and limited, it looks quite promising. I just got it yesterday, it was recommended by a good friend of mine around the middle of this summer. I think it's pretty cool and edgy, I like the smoothes and diversity of the graphics even though they have a pixelated esc to them which numerous games before it have tried "modernizing" I should say. I have no complaints whatsoever, but maybe you guys could add more diversity to levels. I'm not asking for additional levels, but more unique styles to the levels already incorporated within the game at this point, just some flair is all. Anyways, keep up the great work, I'm looking forward to see what's gonna be brought to the table next!\n\nMake us proud devs! :D","September 7, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It recieves mostly weekly updates, and has been worth much more than the asking price for a long time, plus the developers do a good job of listening to user feedback.\n\nAs for the game, it is infinitely replayable, and has no end. You will never stop improving. In the begining you may find it hard to avoid bullets, or you may not have the hang of ammo management, so you may die early. However as you play you will get farther and farther, and see more and more. Eventually you will beat the final boss, and your reward is looping back to the begining, with a much harder version of the game. When you beat the boss again, you will keep looping, and it will keep getting harder and harder, and weapons will keep getting cooler and cooler, until you die. There is something very rewarding about getting to levels flooded with hundreds of enemies, and bosses too, and fighting your way through them with the same amount of health you had at level 1, like a god.\n\nIt's content rich, has strong enemy variety, has infinite replayability, has good developers, has lots of weapons, has many diverse characters that change how you play the game, has many secrets, has competitive daily runs, is challenging no matter how much you improve, is cheap, and is constantly being updated. I couldn't reccommend this game enough.\n\nCons: There are certainly bugs, and WIP graphics in places, as this is early access, and it's still being developed. However anything game breaking is usually hotfixed so that there is never a moment where you straight up cannot play the game. The game also wipes progress every update, however this isn't a big issue because the only unlockables in the game, characters, can easily be unlocked all in one short run. The only inconvenience this causes is your proto chest and golden weapons are wiped, which aren't very commonly used features anyways. Finally, co-op is not very good in it's current state, so if you are buying this to play with a friend, I'll tell you right now that it will just make the game a lot harder and more confusing.","July 16, 2015","true","222.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combination of shoot'n'dodge and character builder really emphasizes the complexity and importance of decision-making.   I like it.  It's a game to play with music pumping and wanting to get pumped up in 10 minutes- if you can make it even one play through.  I'd almost say it's an excellent lunchbreak speed-game in the sense of Strange Adventures in Infinite Space.  Semi-spoilers ah.. it's obvious that the draw is long-lasting complexity and high-skill ceiling, not tweests, right?\n\nThe shooting and movement is very well-executed.  Combined with the screen shake, the experience is intense and embracing.   The situations you find yourself in vary a great deal, a consequence of weapon variety, enemy attack types, and  character's and talents.\n\nBalance, particularly for talents, is beta from my perspective.  I've been playing YV and Steroids, who both feature high-dps and emphasis on weapon combos, which could color my opinion.    The playstyle varies quite a bit between characters due to a variety of unique characteristics.  If I were better at dodging, I might prefer characters that are required to dodge more bullets due to comparatively low dps and talents that do little to shorten or ease a fight or improve my ability to panic spam.  Many of those heroes have traits that improve their resources.  Anyway, it is beta and balance is indisuptably a work in progress.\n\nA significant example of the design philosophy is the cursed weapons available at this time.  If you pick them up, you can only exchange them for other cursed weapons.  You get more ammo for those weapons though.  This is a principle that pervades the game; even though talents are never generally bad, they are very often situationally useless.  What good is  a bonus to energy weapon damage or kinetic ammo supply if you don't have those weapons?    Optimization in specific utility (for short-term survival or situations that are not sustainable or easily achievable) or for general viability of your build are very important and I'd hazard most players will spent some time at the inter-level level screen, simple as it is.\n\n\nIt was worth it at $12 for me, but if you want it for less, it won't go on sale until after release.","June 25, 2015","true","103.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This all nicely shown in a pixel art style that representative, fun and appealling.\n---\n\nNew review:\nFirst off: This is one of the best Early Acces game releases, probably the best. With their mentality to really get everything out of EA they went and did it. Every Tuesday and Thursday on of the team was streaming: showing new projects in the developent, streaming the game, having fun with new ideas, testing new features, answering questions. They have truelly been an inspiration for me in the past 1.5 years I have followed them develop this game. We were able to see it from beginning to end and we got delivered what they were promised.\n\nThe Good:\n- The game play: it's fast and fun\n- Instant gratification: Jump right into the action, no bla bla. (If you get the joke, well done).\nLot's of characters, weapons and MUTATIONS: so many combinations to try out, you keep combining and you have to, as everything is randomly found.\n- Good challenge: If you're not a very skilled player, this game is still fun, you will still have a feeling of achievement after ending a run. For the high skilled: try staying alive when you are looped! More bosses, more environments, harder enemies!\n- Audio: The reason I bought the game. The rough sounds gives a tough feel, a super attitude to a game that oozes with action. Every gun feels better.\n- Price: €12,99, that's not pricey for a single/co-op game.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Crashes: Game crashes when immediately leaving the co-op menu, after entering.\n- Stats: Stats do not load.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Some graphic bugs: Shovel looks weird, sometimes a glitch.\n\nConclusion:\nI highly recommend this game, if you like top down shooters, guns blazing, rough audio, a cool soundtrack and EXPLOSIONS! So much fun and hard to get through. You'll easily get you money out of it!\n\nThanks JW + Rami (Vlambeer) and team.","August 26, 2014","true","89.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chalenged/recommended/242680/","chalenged","Chalenged","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chalenged/","261 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNuclear Throne is a rogue-like twin-stick shooter. You play as one of the many characters and fight to claim your rite to sit on the nuclear throne. There are a lot of weapons, and the difficulty is very high. It's very fast-paced, and extremely enjoyable. The game is constantly being developed, which is really nice. It makes it so there are fresh things almost every week. One drawback is that unlocks (and settings) are reset whenever it updates, which is almost every week. Luckily most of the characters have really easy unlocks and take 1 run to get for the most part. Even if you're one of those people who is wary of early-access games, this game is at an extremely playable state, and even if the game was considered "finished" at this point i would still be very happy with it. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes rogue-likes.","April 22, 2015","true","30.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fraggynade/recommended/242680/","fraggynade","dr1nkable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fraggynade/","33 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOk, this is one of my favorite games ever. If you liked Castle Crashers or The Binding of Isaac, you'll LOVE this.\n\nNuclear throne is a game where all you do is shoot.\nshoot, shoot, shoot. Shoot stuff till it's dead. It's got nice retro graphics and easy-to-get-used-to controls.\nI REALLY reccomend this game to almost any gamer. BUT! And this is a big but...\nThis game is harder than a rock. I've played two days straight almost nonstop, and I've only gotten halfway to the Nuclear Throne.\n\nSo, as I said, this game is great, and supplies you with hours upon hours of fun.\nLet's get to the details,\n\nCONTROLS:\nAs I said, this game has easy controls. Rightclick for special ability, left click to shoot, WASD to move, y'know, the usual. Very easy to get used to.\n\nDifficulty:\nHARD. VERY, VERY, VEEEEEEEEEERY HARD. However this doesn't ruin the game. If it wasn't hard you could finish the game within a day. If you like games where every single run you beat the game, don't get this one.\n\nGameplay:\nThe basic gameplay elements are simple: Dodge bullets and shoot enemies. The more you kill enemies, the less stuff to dodge (Obviously). Killing enemies gives you radiation, which is this game's exp system. Why radiation helps you... I'll explain later. Once you kill all the enemies in the area, you go through a portal. If you managed to level up in the last area, you get to select a mutation. All the mutations make very noticable changes and some of them have a huge effect on how you play.\n\nSTORY:\nThere was a huge nuclear war. And you play as mutants. Except for one character.\nBut anyway, from what I can tell, the story goes like this...\nA mutant tells all his mutant friends that he saw the mythical "Nuclear Throne" (I think whatever character you used in y your current run plays the role of this mutant). So he/she goes on a quest to rule the world by getting to the throne. I can't really tell after that so MOVING ON TOOOO.....\n\nCHARACTERS:\nThe characters are all unique in their own way, and fit almost every playstyle available. (Also, every character other than rogue is a mutant. EXCEPT for I.D.P.D. Thats why the mutants need radiation.)\nRogue- The only human character you can play as in the game. Every time he's attacked, he lets out a blue explosion killing anything around him. The only problem is he's constantly being chased down by the I.D.P.D, which are basicallly insterstellar space police. His special ability is an airstrike.\nHorror- The hardest character to unlock in my opinion. To unlock horror, you must skip a radiation canister (exp crate), then on the next area, skip a BIG radiation canister (If you don't get those canisters in a row, just keep skipping regular canisters until you find a big one. Skip it, and you're good to go!). On the NEXT area, if you see a radiation canister, the hostile version of horror should emerge. He attacks you a lot. And does a lot of damage. Anyway, kill horror, and you've unlocked him! Horror's passive ability is getting an extra mutation choice when he levels. His special ability is a radiation beam that uses exp for ammo. If you kill an enemy with it, the rads you used to kill it are returned to you.\nRebel- I like this character. Rebel's passive is that whenever he enters a portal, he has a chance to heal 0-2 health. His special is exchanging one health to summon a minion. The minion dies on it's own eventually.\nChicken- The only character who starts with a melee weapon! Chicken's passive ability is that when she dies, she runs around headless for 5 seconds. She can attack when headless. If you get health in any way when headless, you grow your head back, reviving yourself. Each death removes one max health, though. Her special is throwing whatever is in her hand. throwing does a LOT OF DAMAGE.\nSteroids- His passive is starting with two weapons which are both fully loaded. All weapons you pick up with Steroids is fully automatic. His special is that he always holds both weapons he has equipped. He's also RIIIIIPPED.\nRobot- His passive is finding better weapons earlier than other characters. He can eat guns for ammunition or health. He's also kind of like a dog. SO cute.\nY.V- IS illuminati. Passive is faster rate of fire. He starts with a golden revolver, which has more firing speed than a regular revolver. His special is a shot with 2x power. Also, he has a secret ability. (Hint: press all the keys on your keyboard. You'll find out eventually.)\nPlant- He's faster than everyone else. He can also trap enemys in snares with his special ability.\nMelting- His passive isn't very passive. It actually affects the entire game. Like, seriously, 3 quarters of the enemies in this game can one-shot him. His max health is 2, but he gets a little more xp. He can detonate the corpses of people he's killed. This is a key gameplay element to Melting. Without it, he'd be useless.\nEyes- Can see better in dark areas like the sewer. He also has telekenesis, which attracts enemies, exp, and chests. It also pushes away projectiles.\nCrystal- Starts with 10 health instead of 8 or 2. He can also turn  into an almost inpenatrable crystal shard which can also deflect some projectiles.\nFish- Starts with more ammo. Fish can roll.\n\nOk, sorry for the frickin' essay I just wrote. It's only because this game deserves my time. It's amazingly well developed.\n\nOk, now a message for Vlambeer, the creators of this masterpiece:\nThanks for making ANOTHER great game. You guys are legendary. I just have a FEW suggestions:\n\nUp Melting's max health to 4. 2 is quite pitiful.\nNerf the spider cave's crystal-laser things.\nAdd more story! Make the player feel like the mutants are in a struggle for power. Make it have more feeling.\nSometimes when I die, my game freezes and I have to restart my laptop to actually close the game. Kind of annoying.\nThat's really all I can suggest. Otherwise, this game is PERFECT.\n\nP.S. Where is that Ridiculous Fishing update? Sorry if you've already announced something, but I REALLY wanted an update for one of my favorite IOS games!","August 13, 2015","true","87.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Playing it throughout all the updates, changes, and bug fixes is like watching someone grow up. It might be a challenging game at first, but if you keep on practicing and never give up hope of reaching the throne, you'll be brandishing golden weapons and looping in no time. Now, the price of this game while it is still in early access might scare away some people, but the game hardly has any bugs, and any error that is reported will most likely be fixed in the weekly updates.\n\nBUT\n\nif you give up/get angry easily and have trouble learning from mistakes, I do not reccomend this game.

It is very fast-paced, and unpredictable. Each playthrough can last only mere minutes. In my first 2 hours of playing, I managed over 50 plays, none of which were successful. Don't let that scare you off though, I enjoyed every moment of it.\nThe random generation of levels, enemies and drops keeps you constantly on your toes. Many of the enemies have some nasty suprises in store. Each of the character has their own special ability. Even the upgrades you choose from as you progress are randomized.\nI would like to see some more melee weapons added to the game as I tend to favor the sledgehammer when I find it. The variety of the guns I find amazing, especially the Triple Machine Gun.

When I was writing that review I failed to notice that even though each update comes with a new bug, it also comes with a new feature.

It's a game focused around having a bullet for every inch of your screen, but who cares. The insane gameplay gives no time to rest as you are forced to each level in an infinite loop constantly finding better loot, and harder enemies.

Each character has their own special ability. Such as spawning in allies for the cost of health or having the ability to roll. Every time you level up, you get to choose 1 out of 4 upgrades. Once you level up to around level 5, it gets really fun. at around level 9, once you level up again, you get to choose your ultimate mutation. They are different ultimate mutations for each character so you might have to find out for yourself what each mutation does. (or look at the wiki) So it's really fun, many options for gameplay, and a lot of characters and weapons. Would I recommend it?

Playing it throughout all the updates, changes, and bug fixes is like watching someone grow up. It might be a challenging game at first, but if you keep on practicing and never give up hope of reaching the throne, you'll be brandishing golden weapons and looping in no time. Now, the price of this game while it is still in early access might scare away some people, but the game hardly has any bugs, and any error that is reported will most likely be fixed in the weekly updates.\n\nBUT\n\nif you give up/get angry easily and have trouble learning from mistakes, I do not reccomend this game. If you die, you DO start over from the begginging. There are no save points, no permanent unlocks (yet), and NO MERCY.\n\nSo yes, I do reccomend Nuclear Throne to those who can handle it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fraggynade/recommended/242680/","fraggynade","dr1nkable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fraggynade/","33 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOk, this is one of my favorite games ever. If you liked Castle Crashers or The Binding of Isaac, you'll LOVE this.\n\nNuclear throne is a game where all you do is shoot.\nshoot, shoot, shoot. Shoot stuff till it's dead. It's got nice retro graphics and easy-to-get-used-to controls.\nI REALLY reccomend this game to almost any gamer. BUT! And this is a big but...\nThis game is harder than a rock. I've played two days straight almost nonstop, and I've only gotten halfway to the Nuclear Throne.\n\nSo, as I said, this game is great, and supplies you with hours upon hours of fun.\nLet's get to the details,\n\nCONTROLS:\nAs I said, this game has easy controls. Rightclick for special ability, left click to shoot, WASD to move, y'know, the usual. Very easy to get used to.\n\nDifficulty:\nHARD. VERY, VERY, VEEEEEEEEEERY HARD. However this doesn't ruin the game. If it wasn't hard you could finish the game within a day. If you like games where every single run you beat the game, don't get this one.\n\nGameplay:\nThe basic gameplay elements are simple: Dodge bullets and shoot enemies. The more you kill enemies, the less stuff to dodge (Obviously). Killing enemies gives you radiation, which is this game's exp system. Why radiation helps you... I'll explain later. Once you kill all the enemies in the area, you go through a portal. If you managed to level up in the last area, you get to select a mutation. All the mutations make very noticable changes and some of them have a huge effect on how you play.\n\nSTORY:\nThere was a huge nuclear war. And you play as mutants. Except for one character.\nBut anyway, from what I can tell, the story goes like this...\nA mutant tells all his mutant friends that he saw the mythical "Nuclear Throne" (I think whatever character you used in y your current run plays the role of this mutant). So he/she goes on a quest to rule the world by getting to the throne. I can't really tell after that so MOVING ON TOOOO.....\n\nCHARACTERS:\nThe characters are all unique in their own way, and fit almost every playstyle available. (Also, every character other than rogue is a mutant. EXCEPT for I.D.P.D. Thats why the mutants need radiation.)\nRogue- The only human character you can play as in the game. Every time he's attacked, he lets out a blue explosion killing anything around him. The only problem is he's constantly being chased down by the I.D.P.D, which are basicallly insterstellar space police. His special ability is an airstrike.\nHorror- The hardest character to unlock in my opinion. To unlock horror, you must skip a radiation canister (exp crate), then on the next area, skip a BIG radiation canister (If you don't get those canisters in a row, just keep skipping regular canisters until you find a big one. Skip it, and you're good to go!). On the NEXT area, if you see a radiation canister, the hostile version of horror should emerge. He attacks you a lot. And does a lot of damage. Anyway, kill horror, and you've unlocked him! Horror's passive ability is getting an extra mutation choice when he levels. His special ability is a radiation beam that uses exp for ammo. If you kill an enemy with it, the rads you used to kill it are returned to you.\nRebel- I like this character. Rebel's passive is that whenever he enters a portal, he has a chance to heal 0-2 health. His special is exchanging one health to summon a minion. The minion dies on it's own eventually.\nChicken- The only character who starts with a melee weapon! Chicken's passive ability is that when she dies, she runs around headless for 5 seconds. She can attack when headless. If you get health in any way when headless, you grow your head back, reviving yourself. Each death removes one max health, though. Her special is throwing whatever is in her hand. throwing does a LOT OF DAMAGE.\nSteroids- His passive is starting with two weapons which are both fully loaded. All weapons you pick up with Steroids is fully automatic. His special is that he always holds both weapons he has equipped. He's also RIIIIIPPED.\nRobot- His passive is finding better weapons earlier than other characters. He can eat guns for ammunition or health. He's also kind of like a dog. SO cute.\nY.V- IS illuminati. Passive is faster rate of fire. He starts with a golden revolver, which has more firing speed than a regular revolver. His special is a shot with 2x power. Also, he has a secret ability. (Hint: press all the keys on your keyboard. You'll find out eventually.)\nPlant- He's faster than everyone else. He can also trap enemys in snares with his special ability.\nMelting- His passive isn't very passive. It actually affects the entire game. Like, seriously, 3 quarters of the enemies in this game can one-shot him. His max health is 2, but he gets a little more xp. He can detonate the corpses of people he's killed. This is a key gameplay element to Melting. Without it, he'd be useless.\nEyes- Can see better in dark areas like the sewer. He also has telekenesis, which attracts enemies, exp, and chests. It also pushes away projectiles.\nCrystal- Starts with 10 health instead of 8 or 2. He can also turn  into an almost inpenatrable crystal shard which can also deflect some projectiles.\nFish- Starts with more ammo. Fish can roll.\n\nOk, sorry for the frickin' essay I just wrote. It's only because this game deserves my time. It's amazingly well developed.\n\nOk, now a message for Vlambeer, the creators of this masterpiece:\nThanks for making ANOTHER great game. You guys are legendary. I just have a FEW suggestions:\n\nUp Melting's max health to 4. 2 is quite pitiful.\nNerf the spider cave's crystal-laser things.\nAdd more story! Make the player feel like the mutants are in a struggle for power. Make it have more feeling.\nSometimes when I die, my game freezes and I have to restart my laptop to actually close the game. Kind of annoying.\nThat's really all I can suggest. Otherwise, this game is PERFECT.\n\nP.S. Where is that Ridiculous Fishing update?

Nuclear Throne is one of my favorate games even thouugh it doesn't show, because the hours I played it I was offline. For a game that is still in development its have countless hours of gameplay and if pretty well developed. There is a crazy amount of weapons and enemies, which are all well rounded and most have variety. It is being updated every Saturday which is nice unlike games like Rust that gets updated every seven or eight months. There are daily runs so you can challenge your freinds and people from around the world.\nNow to talk about the flaws in the game, there are mostly minor bugs most you wont see. The boss intro screen is pixleated, and some enemies  appear a little low rez but other wise it looks great ( l love the theme that they have designed) The biggest problem I have with the game what keeps me from finishing a run is it has a 30FPS lock, I am so used to playing games at 60 or higher that i have headaces if I play for a while.\nFinal toughts on the game is that there is no reason you should not get this, it is very well rounded and challenging there is countless hours of gameplay and you will definaltly get you moneys woth out of it.","August 22, 2015","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fraggynade/recommended/242680/","fraggynade","dr1nkable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fraggynade/","33 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOk, this is one of my favorite games ever. If you liked Castle Crashers or The Binding of Isaac, you'll LOVE this.\n\nNuclear throne is a game where all you do is shoot.\nshoot, shoot, shoot. Shoot stuff till it's dead. It's got nice retro graphics and easy-to-get-used-to controls.\nI REALLY reccomend this game to almost any gamer. BUT! And this is a big but...\nThis game is harder than a rock. I've played two days straight almost nonstop, and I've only gotten halfway to the Nuclear Throne.\n\nSo, as I said, this game is great, and supplies you with hours upon hours of fun.\nLet's get to the details,\n\nCONTROLS:\nAs I said, this game has easy controls. Rightclick for special ability, left click to shoot, WASD to move, y'know, the usual. Very easy to get used to.\n\nDifficulty:\nHARD. VERY, VERY, VEEEEEEEEEERY HARD. However this doesn't ruin the game. If it wasn't hard you could finish the game within a day. If you like games where every single run you beat the game, don't get this one.\n\nGameplay:\nThe basic gameplay elements are simple: Dodge bullets and shoot enemies. The more you kill enemies, the less stuff to dodge (Obviously). Killing enemies gives you radiation, which is this game's exp system. Why radiation helps you... I'll explain later. Once you kill all the enemies in the area, you go through a portal. If you managed to level up in the last area, you get to select a mutation. All the mutations make very noticable changes and some of them have a huge effect on how you play.\n\nSTORY:\nThere was a huge nuclear war. And you play as mutants. Except for one character.\nBut anyway, from what I can tell, the story goes like this...\nA mutant tells all his mutant friends that he saw the mythical "Nuclear Throne" (I think whatever character you used in y your current run plays the role of this mutant). So he/she goes on a quest to rule the world by getting to the throne. I can't really tell after that so MOVING ON TOOOO.....\n\nCHARACTERS:\nThe characters are all unique in their own way, and fit almost every playstyle available. (Also, every character other than rogue is a mutant. EXCEPT for I.D.P.D. Thats why the mutants need radiation.)\nRogue- The only human character you can play as in the game. Every time he's attacked, he lets out a blue explosion killing anything around him. The only problem is he's constantly being chased down by the I.D.P.D, which are basicallly insterstellar space police. His special ability is an airstrike.\nHorror- The hardest character to unlock in my opinion. To unlock horror, you must skip a radiation canister (exp crate), then on the next area, skip a BIG radiation canister (If you don't get those canisters in a row, just keep skipping regular canisters until you find a big one. Skip it, and you're good to go!). On the NEXT area, if you see a radiation canister, the hostile version of horror should emerge. He attacks you a lot. And does a lot of damage. Anyway, kill horror, and you've unlocked him! Horror's passive ability is getting an extra mutation choice when he levels. His special ability is a radiation beam that uses exp for ammo. If you kill an enemy with it, the rads you used to kill it are returned to you.\nRebel- I like this character. Rebel's passive is that whenever he enters a portal, he has a chance to heal 0-2 health. His special is exchanging one health to summon a minion. The minion dies on it's own eventually.\nChicken- The only character who starts with a melee weapon! Chicken's passive ability is that when she dies, she runs around headless for 5 seconds. She can attack when headless. If you get health in any way when headless, you grow your head back, reviving yourself. Each death removes one max health, though. Her special is throwing whatever is in her hand. throwing does a LOT OF DAMAGE.\nSteroids- His passive is starting with two weapons which are both fully loaded. All weapons you pick up with Steroids is fully automatic. His special is that he always holds both weapons he has equipped. He's also RIIIIIPPED.\nRobot- His passive is finding better weapons earlier than other characters. He can eat guns for ammunition or health. He's also kind of like a dog. SO cute.\nY.V- IS illuminati. Passive is faster rate of fire. He starts with a golden revolver, which has more firing speed than a regular revolver. His special is a shot with 2x power. Also, he has a secret ability. (Hint: press all the keys on your keyboard. You'll find out eventually.)\nPlant- He's faster than everyone else. He can also trap enemys in snares with his special ability.\nMelting- His passive isn't very passive. It actually affects the entire game. Like, seriously, 3 quarters of the enemies in this game can one-shot him. His max health is 2, but he gets a little more xp. He can detonate the corpses of people he's killed. This is a key gameplay element to Melting. Without it, he'd be useless.\nEyes- Can see better in dark areas like the sewer. He also has telekenesis, which attracts enemies, exp, and chests. It also pushes away projectiles.\nCrystal- Starts with 10 health instead of 8 or 2. He can also turn  into an almost inpenatrable crystal shard which can also deflect some projectiles.\nFish- Starts with more ammo. Fish can roll.\n\nOk, sorry for the frickin' essay I just wrote. It's only because this game deserves my time. It's amazingly well developed.\n\nOk, now a message for Vlambeer, the creators of this masterpiece:\nThanks for making ANOTHER great game. You guys are legendary. I just have a FEW suggestions:\n\nUp Melting's max health to 4. 2 is quite pitiful.\nNerf the spider cave's crystal-laser things.\nAdd more story! Make the player feel like the mutants are in a struggle for power. Make it have more feeling.\nSometimes when I die, my game freezes and I have to restart my laptop to actually close the game. Kind of annoying.\nThat's really all I can suggest. Otherwise, this game is PERFECT.\n\nP.S. Where is that Ridiculous Fishing update?

It's rare that I ever put as much time into a game as I have with this one, and I'm not even close to considering stopping yet. The combat is rarely an issue, and every level provides a new type of challenge to overcome. 12 different characters are featured, each with their own unique passive and active, and all offering a different play style. While some mutations may be better than others, it's impossible to go wrong with mutation choices as they all offer a worthwhile upgrade. All of this combined into an endless roguelike with countless different weapons makes for an amazing experience...\nIf you're patient. The flip side to this game is that it is BRUTALLY difficult. To master this game, unless you're one of those people who's just amazing at video games, you will need time. A lot of it. You will die hundreds, if not thousands of times to mistakes you can't believe you made. I'm approaching 200 hours in this game and I still have rage-inducing deaths on the scrapyard in daily runs.\nAll in all, buy this game!

There is no good luck in Nuclear Throne, only bad luck, because a random generated map that'd be considered "good luck" is still a frenzied maze of bullets and action that you have to act on pure reflex to conquer\n\nAnd with more content coming out on a near-weekly basis?

The controls are fine tuned, the weapons are interesting, and the snipers are annoying. Blast some nuclear palace dogs and sit in your rightful place on the comfortable velvet-covered throne.\n\nDo yourself a service and (ultra) shovel $12 forward and buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game.","January 19","true","281.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every single run I do is a new experience, and the new suprises NEVER get old. Before you quit this game, you need to know that it takes A LOT of time to be "good." I have 150 hours on it and im "ok." So give this game a chance, and TRY not to ragequit when playing melting. He's really good.","February 19","true","381.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
