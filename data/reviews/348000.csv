Glitches out the wazoo, a clumsy non-rebindable control scheme, and inconsistent platforming mechanics make this one to avoid.  The sheer incompetence and snippets of mangled English do offer some unintentional hilarity, but even so, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.\n\nWell okay, maybe if you run a YouTube channel and need a bad game to entertain your subscribers, but to the average consumer, stay away!","February 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","34","35","6","0"

The only thing good about Datswer is the art style, everything else is horrible! It freezes, task manager says its running, but you can't move. The controls are atrocious and there are no setting options. Too bad really, the look of the game is unique, but its completely broken and unplayable. Another horrible GL game that I have had the misfortune of "trying" to play.0/10","March 4, 2015","false","0.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

Otherwise, Steam would not even see the .exe file.\n- Terrible controls with the mouse (a platformer without controller or keyboard support is a game-breaker for me)\n- a horrible bug after dying that made my character get stuck above the checkpoint (I have uploaded a picture to Steam)\n- bad English (the Continue option means Reload Checkpoint, which does not make sense, just to give an example)\n\nPros\n\n- nice graphics style\n- nice audio effects\n\nI really want to play this game, and hope I can change my review in the future.","July 3, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Sometimes you can jump into an object and get stuck. If you cancel a climb animation while hanging on an edge, you will get stuck. These will force you to load the last save point.","June 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's not frenetic like Super Meat Boy, but  slow and  almost  hypnotic in its movement. The  graphics are not brilliant, but   the art style, which is a pastiche of muted  colors and styles reminicient of several other  platformers i've played over the years (notably Gish)  is   somehow  pleasing and  really  drew  me into the game.   The next thing I knew three hours had passed.\n\nThere are numerous enemies,  traps,  paths, chasms, pits and obstacles to avoid   while exploring the cave system that  you find yourself in.   You also have  to interact with many of the objects you find within the cave as they may be required to solve one of the many puzzles you will  be faced with while exploring the cave system.  If you get stuck,  you can find  useful hints and tips  via the developers face book page, which you can find HERE; also you can see a You Tube video of  game play HERE. I'm sure if you look you'll also find  video walkthroughs which can always be helpful if you get totally lost.  :)\n\nFor the price  (i.e. not much more than a large latte from one of the  big coffee houses) it's well worth buying,","February 5, 2015","true","5.4"," 23 of 47 people (49%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","49","23","47","6","4"
