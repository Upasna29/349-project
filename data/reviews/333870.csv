"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/333870/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","The goal of this game is very simple - in every level you need to move a ball to the exit through a maze without touching the edges of the maze and avoiding all other obstacles. There is a time requirement for every level - you get 1 - 3 stars per level according to your time performance; these stars are needed for unlocking all the levels.\n\nThis is considered to be one of the games in which you can obtain 100% achievements very easy – some do it in 30 minutes – 1 hour. For me, the experience of obtaining 100% was a quite frustrating because I had to retry each level several times and push myself to do it faster and faster to the point in which my wrist started to hurt like hell. Depending on your mouse type and mouse grip or maybe depending on your coordination skills and quick reactions that have been trained or not by extensive session of FPS – this might be a fun game for you or not.\n\nDespite this, I decided to give this game a positive review – I enjoyed the concept but I think that the required times might be a bit too strict - it's that kind of game in which 1 millisecond counts a lot. I also liked a lot the extra Christmas levels, which had innovative ideas and were very fun to play.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","March 15, 2015","true","3.2"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/333870/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4010 products in account","What is Feel-A-Maze?\n\nFeel-A-Maze is a dexterity game where you need to navigate a green ball with your mouse through different mazes in a certain time. The time limit is tight, but never unfair - even I was able to finish some levels feeling I had some time left or made a mistake in between and still got three stars.\n\nThe game reminds me of the wire-loop game, as in you have that ball and click it with your mouse to navigate it and are not allowed to touch anything except keys you need later to open locks. This "anything" is at first walls, then later moving walls, walls that blend in and out, walls that follow you as well as rocks and balls that fall down and in the case of balls also may bounce.\n\nThe biggest minus point of the game is the length. Even at the nice number of 40 levels it brings, you can finish the game in five minutes with perfect play. A realistic estimate to beat it is around 30 to 60 minutes. If you desire so, you can play another 15 christmas themed levels by clicking a button in the main menu. I did not play those since they don't give extra achievements.\n\nUnfortunately I was unable to find how to turn off the music and sound ingame, so a minus point must be given there. The music is okay, but you should not expect anything special.\nThe graphics are fitting for the type of game it is, with the exception of the final level, but this was most likely done by default.\nThe controls are - as said before - completely with the mouse. Bad: I would have wished an option where you control the ball always instead of having to keep the mouse key clicked. Regardless of how well that would work for me personally, it would give everyone the preferred playstyle.\nThe gameplay is varied, but in my opinion some themes are explored not enough. Maybe more levels that screw with visibility would have been nice, or even one where your up and down controls are reversed, but then with a lot more time to complete it.\n\nAs it stands, however, it is a solid small title that is reminiscent of the early 1990s in style. It is of course up to your personal taste if you enjoy such games, but for me it was a fun and short experience that had the frust factor nailed right to keep me going - it felt difficult but almost never unfair. Yes, there could be improvements, it is far from perfect. But the developer has apparently invested quite some thought in it. With more levels, more variety, maybe even an editor, this game could improve, but this does not mean it wouldn't already be worth playing.\n\nFor achievement hunters: The achievements work fine and can be gotten by getting three stars on all levels, i.e. in the time described above.\n\nRecommended: If you can get it on a good sale, it is definitely worth checking out for fans of dexterity games! There is some potential that is unused, but the base provided here is a solid one. Overall I can give a slightly positive review, or if you prefer numbers I give a 6 out of 10 for the fun but short experience.\n\nIt remains to be hoped the developer expands the game or makes a sequel, incorporating a few of my ideas or other ones he can come up with for more variety.","June 18, 2015","true","0.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Before buying it, I knew I would feel bad doing it.\n\n... I was right.\nAs you can guess, there's no story. No help, not even an explication ingame. At least you can get almost all of it on the steam store page, hehe.\nIt's the king of game that made you wonder how it got approved. $5 for this could almost be called "stealing".\nI bought it for $1, and it feel way too much for this.\n\nI played 1 hour to get the gist of it, to finish this game at 100%. Yet, I only enjoyed the first 5 minutes or so.\nThis game is freaking repetitive, the music is generic as hell, nothing outstanding for the graphics, and there's this really bothering lag every time you go on the menu.\nFirst time I launched the game, it always showed "0/10 achievements", even when Steam was saying I got some. It even showed "5/20 achievements" from time to time (wtf?) I got really bored of it, and I continued later. The achievement counter was fixed when I launched it a second time, and it was the star counter.\n\nLike, some basic features like that are not even correctly done.\n\nThis game wants to be "hard", "frustrating", "giving the chance to improve", and yet, after every death, there's this a bit too long for my taste, wait to finally starts. It frustrates me more than the game itself.\nThere's also the fact that when you finish a level, you see for some seconds the screen saying you failed, then the right screen is shown. What is wrong with this game?\n\nI think it would be way more apt for this game to be on a website like Kongregate, somewhere where it would be free to play, since it's definitely not worth paying for.","May 11, 2015","false","1.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's really straightfoward and short. The game took me 25 minutes to 100%, finishing all levels in the game with 3 stars.\n\nThe movements are fluid, which is great, but the game is a little frustating. The monsters only follows you in the first 2 seconds or so of the game, after that you have to wait until 7-8 seconds until they start moving again. This makes it really awkward when going for 3 stars, but it is totally doable.\n\nThe game is repetitve, there's about 3-4 electronic soundtracks that are alright, but nothing special... I've seen at least 1 level be re-used in this awfully short game, they just added more monsters to it...\n\nA total waste of money at $5, the game takes about 25 minutes to complete! Buy it on sale or do not buy it at all in my opinion! It's fun, but way too short.","January 6","false","0.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

However, I did pick this up for $0.49 at 90% off and at that price this game is a good game.  The basic concept is that you click on a ball and walk it through a maze or an obstacle course.  If you touch a wall or any other object other than the exit, you will start the level over.  There are 40 levels and the types of obstacles from standard walls to ghosts to lasers to bouncing balls changes as the game progresses.  The graphics are not anything spectacular, but then again the game doesn't require them to be.  The game is really short and easy to complete, but yet you will go through your frustrations as the sensitivity of the mouse can easily slam you into walls again and again and again.  Overall, if the price is as low as the one I got it for, then I recommend it since there is no other game like it that I'm aware of on Steam.","March 14, 2015","true","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(even with the extra levels) That's the idea of the game - gotta go fast. It's fun, sure, but definitely not worth 5 euros. I paid 99 cents and I still Feel-A-Lack of gameplay. Maybe because the levels were easy and what's more important - short. It looks like a flash game. And that's why I am going to give this one a negative review. It's overpriced. I've played a 99 cents game (for which I've paid 15-ish cents) and it took me 8 hours to complete it, plus it was more fun.

This is fun and enjoyable, although not that challeging, except for some levels.\n\nAt the current price (4,99€), I think it is too expensive, but if you can find it in a bundle, I recommend it !","July 5, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I liked the game and raged a decent bit on a few levels, but I don't recommend it to the faint of heart.

It has unique gameplay that keeps the game challenging and interesting. Well worth the price I bought it at (50 cents). The only problems I ran into were on the candy chain level where I was losing even when I wasn't touching the sides and on the star gather level where the game lagged out terribly bad to the point of not being able to get all 3 stars. The lag clears up after I have about only 14 stars left to get.\n","March 14, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Took less than hour to finish this game with 100% everything done. I liked the concept of the game and everything worked well. Only minus is the length of the game and that's why game is definitely not worth 5€.

Haha.\n\nSimple enough concept, move your ball through the maze without touching the walls. Great, I love mazes. But with a mouse, it physically hurts. Holding down the mouse button and repetative wrist motions are the only way to play, and if you fail it takes about 3 seconds to retry the level. Almost as much time to restart the level as you are given to complete a level with 3 stars... cannot recommend.\n\nIf you are going to play, I would suggest using windowed mode with the lowest resolution to reduce the range of motion.","March 25","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game definitely has an old-school arcade feel to it. It's simple point A to point B gameplay, guide a ball to the goal, rinse, repeat, unlock an achievement. Ocassionally you collect keys and dodge spooky faced blocks too.\n\nThere's really not much to it. You got some music, graphics that get the job done. Content wise, there's really not alot here. Some will speed thru to completion, others (like myself) will get stuck trying to 3 star everything and just give up in fustration at that point. I enjoyed it overall, despite some fustration along the way.\n\nWait for a sale and then Feel-A-Maze too!","March 16","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it was another kind of  game where you bounce the ball off walls that dissapear for points  but no you drag a ball from point a to point b. (should have watched a play through cause this game is so f---ing stupid). epic fail in every category its not even a puzzle game so it fails so epicly at that as well. click and drag controlls only no controller support FTL.","January 23","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
