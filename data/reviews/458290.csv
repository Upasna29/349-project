I have thoroughly enjoyed the increasingly difficult waves (even though I struggle to get past wave 7  XD).  Without already knowing a clear-cut strategy I find myself trying various tactics to stop the oncoming horde of alien scum.  Mark my words, I will find their weakness!!!\n\nUpdate:\nStill can't get passed wave 7, I've come close though!  You must be precise with your shots.  I've been using the Vive controllers rather than a gamepad. This way aiming is performed by their movement and gives you independent control of your weapons, but I have found it slightly easier to just use one controller to aim and fire both weapons.\nStill having lots of fun, I'm just weary of wave 8 if 7 is this tough!","April 6","true","1.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

This is a modern take on Space Invaders, except in 3D with VR controls.\n\nThe VR controls feel good, and there are two options, one where you move with your look and aim with Vive controllers, and one where you aim with your look and move with a regular controller.  By using the Vive controllers you can split your firing directions, but I had the habit of looking at an enemy's incoming fire which moved me into it, so I think the regular controller is the best.  The visuals are enjoyable, you can hardly go wrong with space in VR.  I had no problems with anything using a Vive to play the game.\n\nWhen they say the game is made for VR, they mean it.  It can technically be played without, but I had some issues where I was unable to hit the enemies because I couldn't find a way to shoot any way other than straight ahead when trying to play with mouse and keyboard on a monitor.\n\nIf you're looking for something simple and fun, pick it up.  I found that it's a great way to wind down when you still want to play in VR after tiring yourself out with some intensive roomscale games.","April 8","true","1.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

Fun to get a new twist on a classic style of gaming with updated technology!  Worth a purchase for the taste of nostalgia, and good times to boot!  I finally get a chance to play a game similar to the "Raiders of the Lost Arcade" episode of Futurama!  :)  Nice!","April 11","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played it with my Oculus Rift DK2 and an XB360 Controller and it worked great. It's not much, but it's awesome for what it is. I think if i ever have the urge for some good old space invaders, i will propably step into my rift again.","April 15","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is awkward to move with your head.. and to control two guns, one with each hand.  Simplify the movements and add more action to the game.","April 18","false","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The rate of fire of your ship is so slow, that I felt like I could fall asleep. There's also very little content. You just shoot differrent waves of enemies, and move around. That's it.\n\nIt's also essential to play this game with a gamepad, because the if you use vive controllers, you have to move your head around to move your ship, which just feels weird and uncomfortable.","May 20","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
