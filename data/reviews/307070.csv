But since it was only 5 bucks I cannot complain about length. The story is decently written and paces okay. Feels more like an one time D&D adventure pack with JRPG elements. My only real complaint is that I wish there was more of it. For $5 well worth the show, kind of like buying a movie ticket. It also has a NG plus mode but I don't think I'm going to dredge through it again to see how my alternative choices would effect anything.","July 7, 2014","true","2.9"," 72 of 93 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","72","93","0","0"

It isn't even worth referring to as "writing." This may have been made by some youngsters or something because this reminds me of the kind of thing I wrote with my buddies back in middle school because of the absurd lack of depth to anything and childish dialogue. EX: Main character walks into a monastery and comments, "This monastery is s**t!" or some such. He just uses profanity and yells at things I ASSUME so that he sounds like some kind of cool dude with a 'tude or something? That's half the time. The other half he's just blandly helpful. He loves his girlfriend (or I guess you could choose to not tell your girlfriend you love her?). He's mostly helpful, but he complains a lot. Which is probably supposed to be some kind of parody of RPG tropes and their bland fetch quests and such. Maybe he's supposed to be bipolar? Regardless, there are a ton of easily avoided spelling and grammar mistakes (EX: use of the word "abandonned").\n\nI'm not just ragging on these guys for choice of words and typo's, though. Oh, no. The story itself reads like a kid wrote it. Seriously, it's like Axe Cop only not hilarious or creative. For example, at some point you enter a village and are asked to go to a cave to stop... bandits or something (?) from attacking said village. A mercenary guy joins your party to help you as he is emotionally invested in helping this village, I think. In the cave you fight some kind of ghostly knights and an ogre. Then you stumble upon a time travel amulet for no reason. The main character goes "Sweet!" and finds out how to go back in time. The whole reason you came to that cave (remember the village being attacked?) was completely forgotten the moment you stepped into that cave and the warrior who joined you silently sticks with you for the rest of the adventure, given no characterization or lines of dialogue again (save for maybe pointing out the amulet is a time travel amulet). Later on, after you're done using the time travel amulet, a pop-up tells you the amulet is now broken. I can only assume this was some kind of afterthought when someone asked, "Why don't they just travel back in time again?" Maybe it only held enough magic for one use, but where does this place you in time? And why was the demon you were chasing exist in the same time line? It seems like when it broke you went back to the future and yet he's there with you. What kind of sloppy nonsense is this!\n\nThe whole game is like this. The first town has you start in a prison that you break out of. But then it's said the prison guards somehow hold the town hostage. So, doesn't that make them warlords or something? Not just "prison guards?" Why do they bother running a prison? Did they turn the castle into a prison? And they all live there? What?\n\nHow about the combat? Well, it's overly basic. I guess some people think this is par for the course for RPG Maker games or JRPG's, but I think it's plain lazy. Sometimes you have to heal or manage your mana, so I guess that's something. But there's so little strategy and so much overlap between the classes.\n\nIf there's one consolation it's the music. Sweet Christmas, this person poured his/her heart into it. I mean, it's not that it's outstanding. You know? Like I'm not rushing to get the MP3's onto my iPod or anything. But there's actual composition, effort, know-how, and emotion in it. There's even a live (I think) guitar in there! I'm a sucker for metal, true, but those boss fights were intense ONLY because of this chugging distortion and orchestral synth-work. Composer, please, whoever you are, ditch these guys. You actually have some amount of talent and skill! These guys can't even piece together any kind of semblance of a game.","July 8, 2015","false","3.1"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","38","41","0","0"

Battles feature party members opposed to enemies in lines on either side of the screen a la Final Fantasy VI (or III in the US), there is a basic class system offering some versatility for the main character, as well as a few other recruitable allies with various set classes. While the game is an RPG Maker game, the visuals are reasonably good for the style of the game. The music is a noteworthy strength of the game, generally being catchy, exciting, or otherwise appropriate for the given circumstances.\n\nI do not recommend this game however. For all of the things right, there are a number of faults that detract from the overall experience leaving the game, as a whole, lacking. The game is short, at a somewhat methodical pace, trying to collect everything in each level, the game's first playthrough didn't take more than a couple of hours. Most of my time in the game was fooling around with the controller settings in which there were legitimately issues upon release (to the developer's credit, they acted quickly to resolve this, kudos to them for that).\n\nThe gameplay seemed somewhat unresponsive, particularly in menus, being an RPG, this wasn't gamebreaking, but still slightly annoying throughout the game. A number of glitches existed and in the short time it took to complete the game, I encountered the screen freezing after a scripted puzzle moved the screen, rain that carried over to other areas (including inside a shop and houses), etc. In combat, most of the abilities felt uninspired and, on normal difficulty setting at least, they could be all but ignored. Attack and/or heal pretty much would win the game if characters were decently equipped. The attacks didn't feel necessary or worthwhile to do. For instance, one of the final abilities I acquired with my assassin class only dealt about 10% more damage than my regular attack on average, for a relatively high SP cost. SP moves felt lackluster as they cost large amounts of SP (particularly for non mage classes), but only boasted marginal damage increases for using them with few added effects that often were unreliable. (It MIGHT apply a status effect. and to this day, I've never sucessfully paralyzed an enemy with the mage's Paralyze spell.)\n\nStory, was rather cliche and didn't feel relevant most of the time (if the gameplay were stronger, it might have been easier to overlook). Dialogue was usually particularly weak, with frequently mispelled words and conversation, at times, so unnatural to the point it was distracting.\n\nPro's:\n\n+Good soundtrack.\n+Pretty visuals.\n\nCon's:\n\n-Very short.\n-Weak story/dialogue.\n-Combat is not compelling, particularly abilities don't feel useful/necessary.\n\nFortunately the game's low price point and an available demo do not make this a huge investment and some may find the game worth the time to play it. It does have some redeeming values, The game felt as though it had quite a bit of potential and could have hit the mark, if it were lengthened and given more polish.","July 27, 2014","false","5.2"," 68 of 92 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","68","92","2","0"

You play the role of a young guy, whose soon-to-be wife was kidnapped and your quest is to rescue her with help of allies you met on the way. Clich√©, I know. One thing that surpriced me was uniqe idea of "dying" and switching between souls, really liked that one. For me, it was quite enjoyable ride, especially that in past I used to play one RPG after another so it brings back memories. Good times man, good times. Overally, could be better, feels like devs tried to test as many ideas of games as they could in one game. But still, cool, little RPG worth it's price tag.\n\nAdvantages\nEasy to learn mechanics of fighting and crafting\nEnjoyable gameplay itself, grinding is not necessary to complete game, bunch of side quests\nSuprisingly good soundtrack for game on RPG Maker engine\nUnique idea of being soul that is able to change bodies (classes) after death\n\nDisadvantages\nShort, took me about 3 hours to finish, including most of side quests and bit of grind\nMain theme of game is really overused and not really desirable, makes players sigh every time it shows up around\nQuite simple, alot of potential is left out. No stats, no detailed items nor characters\nDialogues from time to time feels like they've been written on a really childish standard\nPersonal score\n7.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","February 20","true","6.3"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","1"

I will compare this to an old Final Fantasy. The combat is good, there may be some bad balances, but overall it's good. It's a good introduction to turn-based RPGs as well, if the player haven't played those. Another good thing is that the game is very short. You won't be sitting for 20+ hours like in Final Fantasy. This game features all those things - classes, spells, items, chests, skills, stats in just 3 hours. But yet, it's too short, the story wasn't gripping (at first the game wasn't gripping at all but I had to force myself to finish it. It is just 3 hours though).\nBut there are far better games to play in this time. Sorry for the harsh words, developer. I bet you are reading this (because developer is so cool that he is actually reading and responding to discussions and community hub). You said you will be working on a new game.

There are various themes for various settings.\n\nI was on the verge of recommending the game, because it's OK (a little short, though; 3.5h is enough for normal difficulty), but be prepared that the storyline is reeeally weak and the dialogues are just moronic. The characters have no depth at all. They try to deliver funny lines which might be funny if you were a 14-year-old with serious brain damage. They are not.

God knows if I made a game it would be terrible. And this game isn't terrible. But there are an awful lot of RPGs out there, and a heck of a lot of them are from RPG Maker. Being "kind of ok I guess" isn't good enough to warrant this one above any others.\n\nFor starters, this game is really short. About 3 hours. I can deal with a short rpg if there is something compelling about it. Like, if there was a really good story, or a really unique twist, or humor, or interesting mechanics... or... anything really. The story of this game is not very interesting. The dialogue is sometimes downright awful. The unique twist is that you can change your class each time you die... but that doesn't really make a lot of difference. There aren't really any interesting mechanics. In combat you'll probably just choose whatever does the most damage until they are dead. There isn't much need for status changing stuff. And there aren't really any complex things going on. You have a wide variety of weapons you can pick from, but it doesn't matter what type they are really as long as you can equip them. Sword, gun, bow? The only thing that matters is what has the best damage. Speaking of bows, the animation for firing a bow has it aimed backwards.\n\nThere are some odd things they put into the game. For instance, when you kill an ememy instead of gaining their items they drop a sack on the ground you have to pick up. But there is no inventory limit so there is really no reason you would NOT want their items. So it is just a mechanism to make you forget things on the ground. Also, there is a crafting system which could be interesting but I found literally 4 recipes and only 1 of them was remotely useful because it made explosives you need for a side quest (you could just buy explosives though.) I could make a sword that is worst than one I found and an axe that is also worse than one I found and an hp potion which I guess I could use but I found so many just by opening chests and stuff. Also there is a fishing mechanic. You use it once in the very beginning of the game to do some quests for a chef that are really unnecessary. Then you never fish again.\n\nThe characters are.... There. There is no real development. There is a bunny girl, for... reasons, and 2 mercanaries (one is a mercanary class and one is not but you pay the one taht is not to fight for you, thus he is indeed a mercanary) They have no character. They are just present to help you do more damage. I don't know if you can find any other characters, I was going to find out on a new game+. I succeeded in preventing the bunny girl from joining my group but I got bored before seeing if there was any one different I could get. Not that it really matters, as again they are just there to do more damage and have no personalities or input or anything.\n\nI wanted to like this game... And I didn't hate it. I mean it is competant if short, but there are other games for similiar prices that are better. The Zeboyd games Breath of Death and Cthulhu Saves the World come to mind. Both are short simple RPGS with humorous premises, clever writing, and refined battle systems that are pretty interesting. This game, however, doesn't have a whole lot to offer besides just being OK. OK is fine I guess, but I can't recommend a game that is merely ok.","March 6","false","4.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/307070/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Memories of a Vagabond is a small RPGMaker game. That's about it. Aside from 2 or 3 aspects that I may like the game for, this seems to be 90% filler content. It's a functional RPG without a heart of its own. There isn't really an idea or a purpose for the story, and neither is there an interesting combat system.\n\nIt's unfortunate for me to start the review like this, but this is what I've felt during the whole experience.\n\nContext\nFirst off, I got this game for free. I've seen it around in bundles and/or giveaways a few times, and decided to give it a go. I didn't go in with any expectations, but unfortunately, the game did nothing to win me over. It didn't do anything too wrong either! It's just not interesting at all.\n\nI beat it on Hard Mode in 5 hours.\n\nAs with every other RPG Maker game, the engine doesn't allow for resolution options, only Fullscreen on/off; when I go fullscreen, it screws the aspect ratio up, so I can either play with the screen displaced and low resolution, or in a tiny window.\nAside from that, I haven't had any technical issues.\n\nI've read quite a few reviews on steam, and they're mostly positive, which I don't understand. I mean, JRPGs aren't all that common on PC, but Memories of a Vagabond does absolutely nothing to stand out or be a memorable experience...\n\nHowever, I do respect the developer for supporting this game nicely. From what I've seen, he's been solving problems posted in the Community Hub, and is also launching a patch tomorrow.\n\nAnyway, here's the review.\n\nPresentation\nThe visuals here are mostly standard. A few of the objects are pretty nicely designed, but there isn't much to say.\nThe combat effects look pretty smooth, which I appreciate, but it's nothing mind-blowing. The combat backgrounds have a different style, being seemingly hand-drawn (well, digitally, but you get the idea). They're fairly simple, but it gives the game a bit more personality.\nThere were also some graffities spread around. These were completely out of place, in this fantasy setting. I'm not sure if they're an inside reference or what, but it seems completely random to have these.\n\nThe music, as noted by other reviewers, is certainly the game's highlight. And I didn't even consider it that good, for the most part. It's fitting with the locations, but it's mostly orchestrated, which I don't think fits very well with these low-res games. But again, it's good, especially the one from the last Boss. That was certainly a well chosen song!\n\nThe sound-effects and menus were, once again, standard. I've had a few interface issues, though. Those problems were caused mainly by some of the mechanics, so I'll right about it when I get there (1).\n\nThe writing and story has probably been my least favorite aspect of this game. It just seems very amateur, the characters have nothing interesting about them (on the contrary, many of them seem very childish), and the story is also a very bland damsel in distress scenario.\nThe game's tries to keep a more or less serious tone (no too serious, but serious), but then throws in some really out of place jokes.. I don't understand what it was trying to do, to be honest. There was a funny area near the last area, but again, it just came out of nowhere.\n\n\nGame's Structure\nIn here, you go through Dungeon-ish areas, and also have an Overworld, to travel between them. The areas are pretty small (including the overworld).\nThere are no random encounters! You can always see the enemies walking around, so you can approach them at will, and when you're ready. I think that's good. Also, once you kill the enemies in the dungeons, they're dead and do not respawn. If you're having difficulty issues, you can grind a bit in the Overworld (a couple of levels make all the difference, and are quick to get).\n\nOther than that, there are a few sidequests, with very minor rewards (both in terms of equipment and interesting events, they're completely filler).\n\nThere is also an Arena of sorts, where you battle increasingly difficult groups of enemies. I always like this idea in RPGs. However, the game doesn't take advantage of it at all. There's no adrenaline-pumping ambience to it or anything. You go in, fight, and get back out. At the end of each fight you'll get a pretty decent reward (in gold, items and equipment).\nThere's one fatal flaw with this, though.\nThe arena's difficulty is not scaled with the main game at all.\nI've only managed to finish 3 fights before the enemies got too strong for the point in the game. I could have endured it, maybe grinded a bit, and tried to keep going, but there was not point! After the third fight, I went and beat the final boss without any problem at all. I had the best equipment available (by simply buying it from shops) and yet, the arena's difficulty was already too high. Yet another elements that feels pointless and misused.\nI suppose it was intended as an end-game thing, perhaps. Without an interesting combat system, however, I have no desire of trying it out.\n\n\nCombat System\nAs is to be expected, you can use a Basic Attack, Skill, or Item. Skills require mana to use, and can be normal attacks with an added bonus, or status ailments. The status ailments, however, are completely useless against basic enemies, and cannot be used against Bosses (or at least their hitting rate is reeeeally low), so there's a big portion of the combat rendered useless. Most of the time, you'll be going between strong attacks, AOE, and healing. There isn't any deep strategy to the combat. Battles usually take no more than 3 turns, with Bosses being the exception, just because of their amount of HP.\nThere are no phases, interesting skills, or anything of the sort. Everything is just as you've seen in every other JRPG. It does, once again, nothing to stand out.\n\nNot replenishing your pools after each fight -- relation with Random Encounters and Difficulty\nThere's one huge problem I have with it, though, that modern RPGs seem to have eliminated. That is how you have to manually heal and restore your HP after a fight. Most of recent RPGs take the route of each battle being self-contained. This way, you don't need to worry about the time between battles, and just wasting time buying and managing potions.\nThere's another design route that comes with this, and that's taking the random encounters out. With random encounters, it makes sense for you to be "permanently" damage, making the dungeons tense.\nWith a limited number of enemies, however, that stops working in the game's favor. Another possibility is making each battle almost like a puzzle. Each battle can be harder, but also far more interesting. Without the nuisance of having to buy and manage potions, you can have more difficult fights that bring you to the limit, without it being a problem. As it stands, it just ends up being a couple of conflicting design decisions that make the combat much worse.\n\nThere's also an element to the attack types (with Fire, Wind, Earth, Ice, etc. having weaknesses and strengths) but with the fights in the game, they're useless. The enemies don't really have an apparent type so that you can play with that in mind. It's mostly guess-work. But in the couple of hours of this game, there's no chance to use that strategically.\n\nConclusion\nI'm sorry for being this harsh on a small game like this, especially when the developer cares for the game. If this was a first game, more like an experiement, then that's fine. It's functional, despite the many flaws, and everyone learns from mistakes.\nStill, I can't recommend this, when there are so much better games out there. I didn't enjoy it at all, due to it lacking personality. There's nothing that the game's trying tell or do, unfortunately.","January 16, 2015","false","5.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","1"

It‚Äôs over? Finished? Completed? Ended?\nOKAY THEN. Onto the review!\n\nThis is a game where you get to name the main character, so naturally, I named him Billy Bob (because Billy Bob Joe Blink wouldn't fit). And made him a wizard. Because why not.\n\nThe first word that comes to mind with this game is ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù promptly followed by a shrugging ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. It has several good characteristics and several bad ones too. What are they?\n\nLet me get the positive aspects out of the way. The battle system and animations were nice, the map layouts were quite good, and the sprite work itself seemed quite decent. Plus, I suspect there‚Äôs a bit of replayability, based on how the ending played out for me, but this game didn‚Äôt engage me enough to make me get another ending. Also, the choices you got to make in regards to your Party Members were a nice touch. And let us not forgot the original sound track, because even I think it's quite good. I'm pretty sure there are other positive aspects I could mention, but my mind is drawing a blank right now. But just because it is, doesn't mean there aren't more positives.\n\nAnyway, now that that‚Äôs over with, lets begin with the negatives‚Ä¶\n\nThe plot itself wasn‚Äôt actually too bad, when you get down to it. I won‚Äôt say what it is, but it definitely has potential by itself. If put into more competent hands, I think we‚Äôd have a really great RPG Maker Game on our hands. However, what fails is the delivery; more specifically the dialogue.\n\nNot to mention that the writers try to make the main character cool, but instead makes him come across as a jerk. The ‚ÄúJerk with a Heart of Gold‚Äù Trope is a very fine line to walk. The first scene of the game, he forces his love interest to help him fight in the first battle of the game. This would be cute and all if it was established that she was a fighter babe and have them bond as a couple during this. But she's kidnapped promptly after (because of course she is), and she's wearing A FREAKING ROCOCO DRESS! This is the kind of gal the hero would look good defending, not one you drag into the battlefield! Even ignoring that, he seemingly complains about everything. True, it could be because of some of the things I made him do, but proclaiming ‚ÄúI hate monasteries‚Äù upon entering one does not make him look good. I almost want him to die‚Ä¶and stay dead.\n\nOkay, saying this guy‚Äôs a complete jerk is not fair. This guy is 50% jerk and 50% idiot. He asks squirrels why they look sad and even said an open fire was delicious. Billy Joe can read the facial expressions of squirrels? And can taste fire without touching it or getting burned? Most of the dialogue does not sound natural in the slightest, even from the side characters and NPCs. This is an actual exchange I had with my friend when I quoted one of the lines from the game:\n"I have the blood of innocent people on my hands! Why!?!?!"\nMe: I dunno! You tell me.\nFriend: durrrr\nWhich I thought was an excellent summation of this game's dialogue.\n\nAlso, this game is confusing at times. Like, the first enemy of the game is a slime, and I think it swung a sword at me...without hands. And I think there was an archer I fought who shot an arrow out of a bow while holding it backwards. I don‚Äôt fault this with the game, though, since these things are a pain to fix, especially someone who is terrible at programming like I am. However, it just looks...odd sometimes.\n\nWhat about the characters, you may hypothetically ask? They‚Äôre all one dimensional, and some don‚Äôt even make sense. There was this freaking angel chick that appeared out of nowhere halfway through, and I STILL don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with her. Long story short, this is not a game you play for the characters. Moving on.\n\nI felt like I wasn‚Äôt allowed to explore the world as much as I would have liked to. The two boats in the game only gave you the option of going straight to one destination, negating any potential exploring. Why? Why not make little optional areas for the player to explore? This would make them feel like they've discovered a secret area or something. Granted, a lot of RPGs are quite linear, but this one felt even more so.\n\nLastly, there was what I think was supposed to be religious commentary that left me rather confused. The main character says he won‚Äôt read a Bible he comes across because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt believe in the big man‚Äù, but just goes along with this random demon dude who brings him back to life? Wouldn‚Äôt that be evidence enough to repent and join any religion in hopes to avoid meeting such a fate when he dies again?\n\nAnd even if Billy Bob is a stubborn old magical geezer who ain‚Äôt easily swayed by such life changing events‚Ä¶the rest of religious stuff just puzzles me‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs an underworld, demons, and monster roaming around, clearly indicating that this is a different world than our own, yet they have the Bible? That‚Äôs kind of Earth-specific, especially the Old Testament, which is the Hebrew accountings of what many believe to be the World‚Äôs History. What the heck is it doing in an RPG Maker World?\n\nAlso, there was a bookshelf in the monastery that was apparently on ‚Äúall kind(sic) of religions‚Äù, which doesn‚Äôt make sense, considering that monasteries were dedicated to only ONE religion. But this makes a lot more sense than the monks having a secret mine where they forced slaves to work‚Ä¶ Do the writers even know what the definition of a monastery is? Or what people actually did there? I just... What?\n\nAnother curious thing about this is that this is clearly a different world than our own, but they have the Christian Religion? Like, I get that those sprites come with the RPG Maker default set, but other games have avoided this issue by saying that the religious imagery is for a completely different religion. Which works to an extent where the audience can let it slide. However, here, it‚Äôs specifically Christianity, since the main symbol is the cross (an execution method during much of time of the Roman Empire), and very few other religions worship a single deity, let alone call them ‚Äúthe Big Man‚Äù. In that case, wouldn‚Äôt that mean this game is saying that Christianity is the TRUE religion, since it spans over multiple worlds? But, if that‚Äôs the case, then why Christianity portrayed with such hostility throughout the game?\n\nLook, I realize I‚Äôm overthinking this, and that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a religious person, myself. I am not ashamed of that fact, but I‚Äôm also not afraid of hearing and understanding opposing opinions. With that said, if you‚Äôre going to criticize my religion, can you at least do it in a way that makes sense?\n\nOverall, I guess I‚Äôm mostly neutral about this game, though I have more negative things to say than positive. While the religious commentary didn‚Äôt make any sense, it wasn‚Äôt offensive either, so you can argue this game is mostly harmless. If you want an RPG that‚Äôs kinda mindless, but still fun to play, I guess this one isn‚Äôt too bad. But if you‚Äôre like me and can‚Äôt help but pick apart bad dialogue, point out plot holes, and look for deeper meaning in stories, then there are better games to spend your money on.","September 23, 2015","false","3.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","8","13","3","2"

It seems more like a freeware game than something worth $5.\n\nPro:\n\n-Steam Trading Cards-  Need I say more?\n\n-You can switch your class-  Later on, you can try out a different class, although that specific class won't be as high of a level as your current one.\n\n-Buy the best weapons-  The weapons you can buy are usually more powerful than what you can find, so you can rest assured that you won't find a more powerful weapon and immediately have to discard the weapon you just bought (personal pet peeve of mine).\n\nMaybe I'll think of more pros later. :P\n\nCon:\n\n-Short game length-  If you're one of the people who paid $5 for this game, then that would be a bummer.  It's far too short to justify a $5 price tag.\n\n-Useless skills-  Many of the skills in the game are worthless, you'll probably find yourself using only a couple different skills to beat the game.\n\n-Hideous grammar-  If you demand proper spelling and grammar from text-based dialogue... then this is not the game for you.\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for a short RPG to waste some time on, then this game could suffice.  I enjoyed playing it, but I had to come back multiple times to finish it.","April 18, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

The game itself was not long as I beat it in 3 hours and all the side quests. I will be going back to play the other classes and modes. The music is well done and very nice to listen too, basic turn based fighting, and a few diffrent type of monsters and bosses. There is crafting but not really worth it unless you make a few bombs here and there to get some secret chests. There is fishing, dosen't really do much except for a side quest. Mini game if you want to call it that called "the trials" a few rounds beating monsters and getting some better loot.\n\nHopefuly we get a dlc or update, they could take this story farther after what happens in the game (won't spoile the game for people), maybe add in few more islands, cities, some more side quests, items, monsters, refine the crafting system a bit.  I'd pretty much take anything.\n\nGood:\n-good concept of a game\n-great music\n-side quests\n-crafting\n\nBad:\n-way to short\n-not enough content (items, spells, locations, dungeons, mini games, achievement, ect)\n-$4.99 (should be free)\n-story to clich√© (needs a twist)\n\noverall it's a good game to me, I love rpg's but to most I see that they wouldn't get into this. 6.5 out of 10.","January 11, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Though easily fixable, they exist in such numbers that documenting them all and reporting them is more work that the task is worth; I honestly did not expect to buy a game that still required extensive proofreading and copy editing.\n\nThe second point nearly drove me to stop playing this game altogether -- during the opening of the game and all through (what I am assuming is supposed to be) the intro, your main character's name is simply "Hero". If the intro was quite short, this would not likely be much of an issue, but when you add the generic hero "Hero" to the error-strewn text, this part of the game becomes, well, boring and feels extremely long.\n\n(For example, playing through this "intro" took me three (real-world) days over what had to have been only 15 or less in-game minutes.)","February 9, 2015","false","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

These aren't orginal ideas, of course - Planescape: Torment did all that first - but they're unusal enough that it's nice to see them being used here.  Even so, the class switching and skill honing seem out of place in a game that doesn't last long enough for the player to fully take advantage of them.  Also, the game seems weirdly unbalanced in some ways (maces are OP, and magic is both more costly and weaker than physical attacks, to name a couple).  What really kills it, though, is that the writing is so bad it's almost funny (and peppered with typos).  If I play an RPG, I want to be playing it for the story, and this one was just one big cliche (girlfriend gets abducted - check; demonic big bad - check; nebulous plot for world domination - check... I could go on, but I think that's enough).  Don't let that stop you if you're one of the many people who got it for free - who knows, you might actually enjoy it, and it's only 5 or 6 hours long anyway - but I wouldn't recommend buying it.","January 7, 2015","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think twice before buying/playing this game\n(This only applies to some games that have been recommended, not all, please read above before reading the review below)\nMemories of a Vagabond is... meh, it is not a terrible game nor is it a fantastic game!\n\nThe game was developed by Enterbrain's RPG Maker engine, it looks really nice and the story is okay. The soundtrack is nice and did hum along to some of the music that played in the background while I was playing. And the game has some very pretty visuals.\n\nHowever, As I have read in other reviews, the game is very short. Till where I have reached, there is a weak story and the dialogue is poor. The combat is not very compelling and fun, particularly abilities don't feel that useful and/or necessary.\n\nHowever this game made me feel nostalgic for a classic turn-based RPG as it looked to be a throwback to the good old role-playing games back in the day!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  Either if you really like or are a big fan of RPG games or if it is in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game, otherwise...\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED :(  If you are not that much of a fan of RPG games or for its full price","December 31, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are not that old enough to play those games... Well let's just say you will definitely not enjoy this game at all.\n\nNow on to the game. Story is relatively easy to predict up till this point of the game(2HR or so) but at the very least it's not THAT easy to predict. You still can guess what will happen later onwards, wonder what is happening, and so on.\n\nNot really that bad if you just want to try a random new game out, plenty of quests and apparently an world map very large. 2 hours in the game and I've just completed my first city, along with a dungeon and a quest from another city.(By first city I mean I finished all quests in that city)\n\nAll in all I personally would recommend the game to a friend, but due to it's mechanics and graphics, not everyone will like it for sure.\n","January 2, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is nice and did hum along to some of the music that played in the background while I was playing. And the game has some very pretty visuals.\n\nHowever, As I have read in other reviews, the game is very short. Till where I have reached, there is a weak story and the dialogue is poor.

You can complete the game in 3-5 hours and this can turn off some players. If you are a player that have little time but truly enjoy rpgs then this is definitely worth a play through.\n\nYou play the role of a hero who is about to ask his girlfriend for her hand in marriage and live a happy life. This all suddenly changes as a demon appears and takes her away and to make matters worse, you die trying to stop it!\n\nThis story also leads to the most unique play mechanic of the game and that is when you die, you are granted a new body. A new body is much more then a new look as it's also your way of changing your class. Battles are similar to classic Final Fantasy and the animation for the characters and monsters is decent. Aside from the battles the backgrounds and sprites are nicely done and look very nice. The music is good and fits each scene perfectly though not totally memorable. It also has small sound details like each tile in the game have different footstep sounds and that is very cool!\n\nOutside of fights it's very basic as you buy weapons, armor and level up to learn more skills and for what it's worth it's done right. Many times throughout the game you are offered choices for dialog and it keeps the short and basic story interesting. It has many advanced features not in classic rpgs like quest logs, being able to loot body's and even being able to craft weapons and items! Many side quests are available and it even have a few mini games to distract you from your main quest and that is always welcome in a rpg. Even upon finishing the game you have the option of new game + and that let's you start over with your money and items already earned. Being able to play again with different classes with your current items gives some replay value that most rpgs lack.\n\nThis game was made using the rpg maker engine and though a very short game, it has many unique and custom features that are very impressive. I recommend this game to anyone who like classic rpgs or looking to play but short on time.","January 10, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoderNaeta/recommended/307070/","NoderNaeta","Naeta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoderNaeta/","15 products in account","This game was a pretty good experience to play.  While Memories of a Vagabond was not exactly fresh in its entirety, it brought out a class system based on death. I personally did not like this, as it removed your bonding to your character/party. And going up on that, the party members you obtain within the normal game (minus game+, have not played it) feel poorly made. The only character I loved to hear dialouge and character development was Porcha. Every other character felt like, even to the end of the game, they were not official characters for my party and would leave soon.\n\nThe atmosphere was a let down to be honest.  I felt like character development could have been better (unable to continue sexual talk with Porcha, boo!) and at the very least go above name and role (double boo!). Choices in the game felt very meaningless and are almost pointless to include (letting Bunny Girl die or join your party). Obviously not by meaningless, but choices in this game are relatively brain dead to choose for a serious playthrough.\n\nThe death in this game is unique in that when a character dies, party member, let's say, they are dead for good... or at least I first thought, which immediately I loaded a decently far back file to keep my first party member from dieing. Turns out, on death, you can revive your teammates, and specifically yourself into a new body. I found this a frustrating feature that I thought my friends would permanently die, along with the option for myself to remove all bonds from the previous hero, to the new hero.\n\nOverall, Memories of a Vagabond is an okay game. My main complaints are: 'permanent' death for party members on first witness, (big one) lack of character development, no in depth strategy beyond healing and special attacks, having to memorize instructions the first time someone calls for them with no way to view them again, (major one) inability to dump wife and marry Porcha or continue sex talk after nightmare. For 5 dollars, this game is an okay experience. If you want just a short game with great music and new feel, try this out, especially if it is on sale. And yes, I have beaten the normal game.","January 24, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did like the class system because you could change it later in game too and I liked that buying strong weapons was needed because better weapons were not found(atleast I could not find them). Maps looked good and I just really enjoyed how everything looked like. But enjoyment stopped there.\n\nSPOILERS!\n\nI believe that games like these lean on great plot to make them excellent but this game did not have that. It started out interesting with hero's girl being kidnapped by demon and hero having to find a way to find her and then of course being joined by people to help him. But the plot did not hold up as characters had little personality, bunny girl joined hero just to get out of a dungeon area but never told why she kept following him after that. Another man was come with hero and bunny to find bandits in caves but as soon as cave was reached, bandits forgotten and still this other man just came along in  sudden time travel adventure. Then there was angel wanting to help hero but no idea why, and prison guards torturing random people and holding villagers prisoner for... reason not given. Also the way characters talked was very crude and it went for all characters as they would curse at little things for no reason. It was good that the game was short.\nI wish I could recommend this but I can not, the story is just too bad.","January 1","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Battles play exactly like older Final Fantasy games. As your character levels up you gain new abilities in combat. Exploring the small world was semi fun. Nothing really new in this department. 5/10\n\nSound/Music: A few of the music tracks sounded pretty good, and overall matched the atmosphere well. Sounds were average, I never noticed anything majorly good or bad. 6/10\n\nGraphics: Again nothing great. Most of it looked like generic RPG sprites. Character models are well done. 6/10\n\nStory: You are a young man searching for his dead wife. A few interesting moments, and a few funny jokes hidden in there. This game also only takes around three hours to finish. There is also a new game plus, but I did not play through it. The plot is pretty straight forward. 6/10\n\nSummary: I picked this game up during a Humble Bundle sale awhile back. It is a nice quick little playthrough. There really is not anything special here, though at no point did I get frustrated in this game.\n\nPros:\n+Easy to pick up and play\n\nNeutral:\n*Story\n*Art\n*Sound and graphics\n\nI would recommend this game to casual RPG fans if they have nothing else to play.\n\nOverall Score: 5\n\nRecommended Purchase Price: Full price. (I mean it‚Äôs only five dollars.)","May 22, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is balanced - you advance through the game, you're entertained, but not challenged (i.e. not frustrated).\n\nSo just get the game and have fun with it!","July 12, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
