I mean what kind of game is this exactly?\n\nLimit your scope, this might be very detailed, but it is not fun, and the interface of needing to navigate to different buildings and then navigate to some sub screen just to do anything is time consuming and annoying.\n\nWhy do people keep making these strategy games with incredibly tedious "theatre of the mind interfaces".  It seems like a German thing, and it is atrocious.  Have a freaking responsive dropdown menu.\n\nEDIT AFTER MORE PLAYTIME\n\nI tried to give the game a second chance since the developer responded to the review.  I still would not reccomend it.\n\nThe tool tips and gameplay cues about what happens when you say advertise with your game, versus advertise for the company as a whole are not remotely clear.  The lack of save functionality is crippling in realtime game with poor and non customizable autopause features.  Trying to get the information about say what games are popular is on a totally different screen than the one that offer syou contract and it 3 or 4 clicks away.\n\nThe whole bank makes little sense, the loan terms are all wrong.  You ae only charged interest once, it is not amortized.  So you can get a $100k loan for 1 year for a one time 7%, or over 25 years for a one time 30%...which do you think is a better deal?  Loans don't actually work that way.  A 1 year 7% loan indeed costs you ~$107k, but a 25 year 30% loan costs you $750k NOT $130.\n\nThere is a good game here somewhere with a better interface and so more clear tool tips and fat cutting of needless features and more focus on the game development portion of game, but uggh what a chore to play right now.","April 8","false","2.9"," 238 of 283 people (84%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","84","238","283","23","4"

It also lacks necessary indicators (you have to go to development room, then to development menu to view development progress), there are no tips as on estimated effect (for example, on copy protection), and the overall gameplay is not only non-intuitive, but also redundant (like having to find a proper publisher for game GENRE, and there might be none at the time).\n\nAll in all, it might be fixed somewhat, but I do not believe any major issues will be addressed, and thus do not advise to buy this game.","April 8","false","0.8"," 107 of 129 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","107","129","7","0"

It barely felt like I was making progress, even after the tutorial I was still confused (by the way the tutorial is pretty long, doesn't save your progress during it, and is ridiculously long.) The UI reminds me of a mid-90s mystery game.\n\nIt's nice with the details and complexity, but just doesn't pull it off correctly.\n\nThe biggest problem is the clutter and general unkemptness of it all. I make a game, but wait, I need to go to a completely different room to research things...ok did that, now lets start...oh wait, I don't have the necessary employees, lets go to a completely different building to hire people...Ok hired a graphic designer, programmer, and audio technician...can I make my game yet? Yes, but make sure you pick your console...ok PC, alright now lets wait for development...done, now lets pack your box.....erh wtf am I putting in the box (better remember that tutorial.)\n\nFinally, packed and ready to go, lets order it!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NMEPlays/recommended/404640/","NMEPlays","NME Plays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NMEPlays/","104 products in account","https://youtu.be/VqPhdLv2j6c\n\n"Awful tutorial, overly complex layout of the game, and the graphics make me feel like I just watched some bad 90's CGI." - NME Plays\n\nMy original review was short and sweet.  That quote above is the entire review.  Since I wrote it, the developer convinced me to give the game a second chance.  Mostly because I didn't give the tutorials a chance.\n\nSunlight Games: "@NME Plays: You should try the tutorials..."\n\nWait, that was the very first thing listed in my review above.  "Awful tutorial"\n\nSunlight Games: "The game was 6 month in EA and got a lot of polishing. Did you play ALL 5 tutorial?"\n\nFine, I'll play all 5 tutorial.  I went back and replayed them, but for reasons described and demonstrated in my video, I didn't learn anything from the tutorial.  I tried to restart the first one, but since I'd completed it, I guess the game thought I had mastered all the skills available in that tutorial, and wouldn't want a refresher course.  Oh well, I guess I'll just work on 2 through 5.  So I did.  I made it through 4 more tutorials, all of which were just as bad as the first.  I didn't learn anything.\n\nIt took about 35 minutes to complete the remaining tutorials, at which point I was released to the world of Game Tycoon 2 to do as I please.  I choose a character, which I assume I'll never need to see again.  I pick a company name, NME something or other.  Then a company logo...I chose the H8 logo, because I H8 this game.\n\nThen, because I'm super confident in my skills from all the excellent information given to me by the tutorial, I choose hard mode and start my game.\n\nI lay out the groundwork for my game.  A brilliant piece of work.  Truly, a masterpiece of it's time.  It's called Bang!, and it's a shooter.  But it's not just any shooter.  This is 1980, we don't have fancy things like graphics.  It's a text based shooter.  I can clearly see this will be a hit.  Just imagine with me...\n\n/fire at grue\n\nSYNTAX ERROR\n\n/shoot grue\n\n>>You can't see <GRUE>, it's dark.\n\n/shoot north\n\n>>You hit the <GRUE> in the leg.  <GRUE> Eats you.  You are dead.\n\nThrilling, right!?  Now, don't go stealing my ideas or anything, because I've already filed the paperwork to make this a reality.\n\nSo, we start developing Bang!, but I run in to a problem.  I don't have staff!  How dare I make the assumption that a beginning developer start their first game on their own.  No!  I need a programmer and a graphic artist.  I don't know why, because there are no graphics.  Maybe he's also a writer, because he's a creative type.  This is where the one point of realism I liked came in though, because I deliberately didn't want sound in my game, so I wasn't required to hire a sound guy.  Nice touch, 1 single point to Game Tycoon 2 for that.\n\nNow, let's go back to my office and watch the little Newton's cradle on my desk.  Yes, there is a semi-functioning Newton's cradle!  If you hover over it, the balls go back and forth.  Well, the ones on the end do anyway, the 3 in the middle just sit there transferring energy.  Lazy good for nothing...wait a minute.  Something is missing.  Apparently I wasn't the only one to not hire a sound guy, because Sunlight Games didn't bother to put that little clacking sound these things make in the game.  I'm taking back that point I gave you in the last paragraph.\n\nFinally, the time has come.  I made my game!  Bang!  It's here, it's done!  I rush over to the production and distribution area, where I design a box.  In the tutorial, I just went with the standard poor quality box, and it showed.  Man that thing was ugly.  Not for my pride and joy though.  Nothing but the best for Bang!.  I go with the Noble option.  Yeah, the scale is Normal, High Value, and Noble.\n\nOh, I also skipped Copy Protection, because A. I don't believe in it, and B. it's 1980, what options were there?  A sticker that says "Please do not make illegal copies of this software" as the Simple option, and Complex is a copy of the music video "Don't Copy That Floppy" that is mandatory to watch every time you load the game.\n\nBack to production, we don't get an option for a manual, which is odd to me, since the developer of this game is really invested in making sure the player sees the tutorial.  Maybe all games just come with a built in guy that talks you through everything in an unintelligible language.\n\nI make 1,000 copies of the game, since that's the minimum, and I have no idea what the market is like.  I'll play it safe, assuming I can make more later, I just might miss a sales window if I have a hit.  I get my 1,000 games, and...are you kidding me?  This is Noble quality box making?  Not a single edge on this box is a straight line!  I'm all for artistic design here, but come on, be practical.  How is this supposed to sit on a shelf?  I guess consumers are forced to lay it on it's back.  Although, for all I know, the box isn't big enough for all the disks, and it starts to bow outward a bit.\n\nWell, let's get to business.  All this work is about to pay off.  Time to sell these games.  I need to determine a price.  Well, I vaguely remember it costing over $1.00 to manufacture each game, but I don't know if that price includes development costs or not.  Let's assume not.  I suppose $3.00 is a fair price to ask, but I want to make sure.  I'll just drive down to the local game store in the mall, and price check other games.\n\nI make it to the game store, which doesn't sell erotic games by the way.  They made a point of specifically mentioning that in the tutorial.  The only thing here is a list of hit games.  But because it's before any games have been released, it's empty.  Why does an entire store exist that doesn't sell anything yet?  I'm feeling my immersion start to fade.  Everything is falling apart and nothing makes sense in this world.  Just then, a black hole emerges from the empty game store, sucking everything into it, where I die and it's game over.\n\nThen I woke up, and I was still playing this game!  I angrily drive back to the distribution center, where I say screw it, sell it for $3 a game, I don't care.  But I don't have a distribution contract.  Now I have to drive to the lawyer, negotiate a contract, drive back, ship my game, and repeat the process.  When I make it to the lawyer though, there isn't anyone interested in distributing my game.  No one wants a text based first person shooter.  I guess there's a lesson to be learned there.\n\nMake sure a market exists for the game before you make it.  Because no matter how much you defend how great a game it is, if no one wants it, you've just wasted a bunch of time and money.\n\nTo anyone who does like this game, fantastic!  I'm beyond thrilled that you found something in this world that brings you joy.  But for the general public, and those on the fence, and those who think this is a sequel to Game Dev Tycoon, I would advise against buying this game.  It's just not fun.","April 9","false","16.1"," 72 of 106 people (68%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","68","72","106","8","11"

Awful just turn it off.\n\nYou get to be impersonated by three robots, a blond, a redhead and a brunette. Why only three I don't understand. NO characters would have been vetter\n\nYou get two game choices campaign or endless. OK.\nI chose campaign. I made SURE the old game folder was deleted in Steam/common but when the tutorial pops up it started at #4 learning all about the marketing and PR department.\n\nINSTANTLY this character speaking Germish babble atarts to talk over the tutorial WHY WHY WHY??? What is the point of that??? WHY NOT JUST READ THE TUTORIAL TO US? Bad bad choice dev.\n\nYou're looking at a nice big office with a nice big LED monitor and three other doors. Wait. LED monitor in 1980? Really? OK I'll go with it.\n\nNow comes the really disconcerting part after Babbling robot's voice stops, HIS LIPS KEEP MOVING. I let it sit for about five minutes and they kept moving like A ROBOT in a German PC game. He wants me to open the map and select the Law department. problem is WHERE IS THE MAP TO OPEN???\n\nLet's try M.M doesn't work. If I stop and go back it's just going to start here again, So it's click on everything time. Crap RIGHT clicking on the window doesn't bring up a map it brings up a view of the buildings around you AND NOTHING IS LABELED ANYWHERE. A big yellow arrow points at a building yay. But no labels.\n\nThe next instructions ar "After you pick a lawyer the publisher contracts are automatically displayed". WAIT how much does a lawyer cost? WHY do I need a lawyer? Can't I self publish? This is not going well.\n\nFrom the arrow lawyers are on the ground floor. Figures, bottom feeders on the bottom. WAIT I DIDN'T PICK A LAWYER it immediately threw me into the publisher's area WTF???  "Now select the tutorial-publisher contract and conclude it" Conclude what? HOW?\n\nYou click on "sign" the babling ♥♥♥♥♥ doesn't tell you that "Jango krakenrobbins" as he said. "Since I ALREADY DEVELOPED A GAME"I did? OK lets just go with mr. babbling Germish.\n\nOK so a game was completed and I have to keep in mind deadlines and genres. Really? Deadlines? Shouldn't this be like kinda open ended? So a message pops up telling me I passed the game but when it disappears I can't recover it. Grrrrrrr. What is "passed the game" mean. grrrrrr.\n\nNow it's time to go to the "map" (window) and select the publicity? ooohh nice, money time. Wait, what? I can book campaigns booths of r  fairs and do interviews? WHY why not HIRE someone to do that???  Here's the problem, in this window there is no indication of how I get back to the map, none. Click bang time. Right click BELOW the window I'm in and another nondescript building is pointed to.\n\nWHEN MR. BABBLER STARTED TO SPEND MORE TIME ON ADVERTISING THAN ON THE CORE GAME I GAVE UP. This game is a nightmare. There's no continituity and the polish was done with corse sandpaper. Sunlight charges WAY WAY WAY too much for this game. Buy GameCorp DX for $5 by game dev tycoon, Gamers go makers, or Mad Games Tycoon but don't waste you money on this.\n\nEnd (I KNOW the dev will make a comment but this is the final review)","December 22, 2015","false","4.8"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

That's ALWAYS a good sign!\n\nGreetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the new management sim, Game Tycoon 2!\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4O8-UyW-cA\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nVERY early access. Wait and see. Grade: Incomplete (0/5)\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nWell, frankly, this will clearly be one we come back to again later. For now, I'd stay FAR away. I tried to give it about 2 weeks before completing this review. Why? There is merely 5-10 minutes of actual gameplay, if I am being generous. Trying to edit down a 5-minute review without re-using footage was almost impossible. It is simply too rough and too raw to be on the marketplace for $10. I do understand this is an Early Access game, but this is not even a demo.\n\nYou cannot complete the tutorial (only the intro part even works). You cannot publish a game. 2 locations on the map are functional. The tutorial (so far) is in dire need of an editor/translator. You can hire developers. You cannot really see how it effects anything. The art style is pretty nice and the music has a nice retro feel some will enjoy. However, this game is just way too incomplete to be on the market. I have found games in Greenlight that are significantly farther along than this. The idea is there, the publisher and developer have a good reputation, so let's pick it up again later and see it when it's been fleshed out better. For now, we will simply grade it out as Incomplete. $10 for what is here is a leap of faith from the gamer. Truly. Wait it out. We WILL return to this later.\n\nFor now.....","November 11, 2015","false","4.3"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agentblue42/recommended/404640/","agentblue42","Agentblue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agentblue42/","358 products in account","Game Tycoon 2 is a tycoon game, developed by Sunlight Games, about making your own game with your own video game company. Sounds super fun right? Because you know, you're a gamer, so that means you gotta have the game about making games for gamers, right, right? Well, not with this game. If you really want a game development game that's good, five dollars less, and more polished, get Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nGame Tycoon 2 has interesting concepts. You have your office, development office and the accessibility to a bank, lawyers, an advertisement agency, the local university, a shopping mall, your own home, and also a production warehouse to create box art and ship the games. You better look at the tutorials because I didn't on my first play-through and had no idea what I was doing. I assumed they'd teach you through out the game, like other tycoon games do, but they didn't. Aside from the tutorials, they have a “campaign”, and an endless mode. Now, I say “campaign”, because it's a “mission” where you have to achieve one goal. There is no way of telling you that you've failed either, you just have to go bankrupt.\n\nI think the main problem with this game is that it's very unclear on what to do because it's not like other tycoon games I've played. The different offices and places available are cool, in concept, but don't really execute well. You can sign a contract to have a company publish or distribute your game and it has a deadline, but you can't make your workers work faster unless you make them stop or train them, which already takes too long. I don't get the process of researching technologies, they still cost the same when you're trying to develop your game. And the main thing that bugged me was the UI. I don't get how it could be that buggy. It was the most difficult thing to assign members of your staff to projects. They made it so complex, for some reason.\n\nThe graphics weren't a big deal to me in this game, but I think the character art is pretty weird. Just saying. Now, I sound like I hate the game but I think it could definitely be a good game. The concepts of being able to make your own box art, sign up employees from the local university, advertise your company or game, make contracts, get a loan and buy shares of other companies, surprised me. It has the concepts that could make a great game. But, it's just so hard to get things done with the UI, to me. It makes the game hard to navigate.\n\nThe sound of this game is, whatever, average. I can't see myself buying this game for 15 dollars either. Maybe 5. This game just needs to be easier to learn, easier to navigate and have some extra functionalities like speeding up the process of creating the game, despite the quality of the game worsening like in Game Dev Tycoon. With that and other things, this game could definitely be something worth 15 dollars and have good replayability.\n\nBy Hakuyer","May 14","true","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

These two games may share similar topic, but the concepts are different. *\n\nI'm recommending this game, because I enjoyed both first and second game in series, and there are only few games of this genre available. Sure, it has it's pros and cons, but I think that true fans will find a way to enjoy it.\n\nThe game it self may be clunky, with not so sharp graphics, but underneath it is a true tycoon game. Tutorials may be better, but at the end it is us who needs to discover the whole game (yes, game developers wanted to be mysterious).\nI struggled at first, like in the first part of the franchise, but ultimately I found the way to become a true "game tycoon".\n\nI'm happy that there is still support for the game, and that my voice was heard, so I'm waiting for the promises to be delivered on the next patch.\n\nOne thing I don't like is that the game development was spread too much. Developers tried to add "gimmicks" but I think that time/resources could be better spent on core parts of the game. Gambling on investments is cool, but stock market is too shallow. Apartment is a feature from the previous part of the game and I still don't see it's purpose.\n\nAt the end, despite all the flaws, I still recommend this game for true fans of the genre. I will continue to play it, because I saw that under "gimmicky" front, there is solid tycoon game inside.","May 11","true","25.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I say it again, but, just to say, there is no info about cost of running your studios, or info on how much a console sale...\n- Poor and very simple AI... just to say: it didn't manage to create good games, but get really good "reviews" (in real, seems quite strange...) also, you can manage pretty soon to create great engines, but you sold very little, also selling it at the half of the normal price... no feedback on advertising effectivness... and so on...\n\nI've already played too many hours to get a refund, as I hoped the game improved more, but it seems that it would not happen soon.\nThe developers are working on it, but this needs work!\nAt the current state, not worhing the selling price, and it's simply beaten by other games of this genre, also some that are still in Alpha stages!","April 16","false","11.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","5"

Well because this is a simulation game, you should do tutorial if you want better understand how to be successful here. Tutorial is well managed, explain all important aspects of game, when you complete it, you will get a basic knows about "game developing".\n\nA gameplay  well managed, you can easily find all what you need to resolve all the queries the game ask you to do it.\nAlso the big feature of the game a deep economic system and wide possibilities of the "game developing".\n\nGraphic is nice, carton styled.

However this is in early access, at the moment you will find a lot of content too. If you are a fan of this genre, you will like a deep economic system and game developing possibilities.

There is a lot of strategy in planning your next contract to take on.\n\nSome games only require 29% quality, but you don't want your reputation to drop by putting out a low quality game, so you put your programmers to work and spend a little extra money on features to make it a good game.

This game has the ability to be something spectacular, You probably have gone a little over board with the 3d graphics side of things, it reminds me about of simcity 3 map. I would personally prefer say crisp clean 2d graphics and a better game play engine. remember this is a simulation sandbox. the more 3d in it the heavier the gpu load.\n\nPlus by having 2d graphics you open the door to it running better on mobile device. Also you could implement a feature later on upon developing consoles that allow a infinite number of upgrades buy the upgrade and the cost just adding + 1 for the upgrade and + X amount + X for the cost.\n","January 24","true","0.8"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","6","23","0","2"

It means that the game is still in development, in case of Game Tycoon 2 it's even under heavy development. Around 60% of the game are missing still, but the Developer is working on it. Just recently the big update to 0.2 released, adding several new features for you to test.\n\nAnyway, so far you can't do much in it, Early Access still, but you can see what it is possible or will be possible. You can create Engines, Games, Sequels, Patches, Demos, research new Technologies etc.\n\nPlanned is even to buy other game companies, getting on the stock market etc.\n\nReally, give the game a chance and give the Devloper the money they need to continue working on it!","November 30, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 30 people (30%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","30","9","30","3","0"

And I like the game, sure it has some minor bugs and needs some polishing up, but the amount of detail and the depth in wich you can make the games are awsome! And for this price!? If you like tycoon games this is most def worth a buy!\n\nSome of the cons I found in the game though:\nEven on easy mode the game is really hard and you can not release a game without any contracts, wich takes away a lot of freedom, but I imagine that that will change once you've made enough money ;)\n\nI like it and I look forward to the full release!

However the mechanics added since then seem to have steadily help solve this slow problem. I still don't feel confident on being able to play a full playthrough or indulge myself into this until the game comes out 100% I don't want to judge it. When  it is full access I am sure that what the game developers have set up will mean that this game will be a good one, I just can't play it right now until I have the full game but I love the idea and hopefully they will see that through which is why I brought it and helped support the game developers.","November 17, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","7","1","14","0","0"

You can read our full review for the game here: https://www.universalgamingreviews.com/game-tycoon-2-overview-and-review/\n\nTo start the summary I'll be honest and say that I wasn't really sure if I was going to enjoy the game going into the review because I'm pretty skeptical of post 2005 Tycoon games and have played very few that really wowed me. I still don't think the game matches up to the likes of Zoo Tycoon 2, The Movies or Rollercoaster Tycoon but what's available is quite fun if you're a fan of micromanaging type games.\n\nThe game puts you in the role of a game developer trying to reach the top of the market starting in 1980 and going all the way to 2050. The game's main mode is endless mode which allows you freely create games, manage your development studio and keep track of everything. The game has a suprirising amount of depth to it and there's a ton of stuff to manage. It took me a couple games to get the hang of things initially through trial and error.\n\nThe game is surprisingly addictive and I had quite a lot of fun playing it even though I don't think it's the best tycoon game I've ever played. With some improvement it could be excellent and if you're a fan of management style games it's worth checking out but it might not be something everyone will enjoy.\n\nThanks a lot for reading our summary and full review folks, happy gaming!\n\n-Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!","April 8","true","6.7"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","4","23","0","0"
