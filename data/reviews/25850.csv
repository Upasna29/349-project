Those few times, the entire battle experience is ruined. But most battles don't include this at all. The units are done right and everything is predictable enough to concentrate on the theory and practice of the economy of battle.\n\nStories normally get in my way especially for tactics & strat games, but EL's plot moves along nicely, giving you skippable events that drive you to the next fight. A few forks in the road allow you to choose different paths which adds to the replayability of the campaigns.\n\nRPG elements like magic artifacts and hero units are useful without making the other units useless. Your units get experience that carries over for the entire campaign and may upgrade to a stronger unit type. This is one of the reasons why I mostly play campaign, because it is fun to have pride in your units and try your best to preserve them. But the game also offers scenarios as one-fight deallys, and a scenario editor, and multiplayer, all which I havent even gotten into due to being all about campaign/ story mode.\n\n\nTo my dismay, the game adds out of the way objectives that break up my 'exercises in maneouvre," but the game does a surprisingly excellent job in making them a tough challenge, without wanting to bash your head in. Usually. There will be some frustration if you want to get Perfect missions / all objectives but, hey, it's supposed to be tough, right..  Overall very well done.\n\nOther thoughts\n-runs your gpu a bit hard for the level of graphics\n-you can save and load at will in sp, which I very much prefer, and I don't care about peoplw who whine about 'save scumming'\n-full voiceovers for the story parts, not too bad at all\n\n\nIf you want a tactics game that offers a lot more possibilities than a 5 man game can offer, your best bet that I know of is Elven Legacy, and the earlier game done by the same guys, Fantasy Wars, of which everything in this review also applies.","August 29, 2014","true","35.8"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","44","53","0","2"

Released as a continuation of Fantasy Wars, you don't need the original game in order to play it. This game combines two styles of play that have proved to work perfectly, and put them in a well built fantasy world. Although it could hardly compete against the masters of the genre like Total War or Civilization series, it won't be weird if we were to meet future releases of this new series. Elven Legacy assures us several hours of fun featuring elves and many other creatures or monsters, rich colored graphics and a nice background story.Fans of the SRPG genre looking for something nicely slow-paced will find the game perfectly satisfactory, if not necessarily particularly special.","April 4, 2014","true","5.6"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","2"

In my review, I praised the turn-based battle system and story, but criticized the difficulty and creeping sense of sameness, and eventually concluded by advising gamers to ‘Try It’ for the main game. Since then I have replayed it a bit here and there, and my fondness for the game has grown – it is still difficult, still not as good as King’s Bounty: The Legend, and I would still rate it as a ‘Try It’. After its release, Paradox Interactive announced that they would expand Elven Legacy with a trilogy of $9.99 DLC modules rather than a single huge expansion. It is an interesting concept, and I’ve enjoyed the first two, so let’s see how they did with the last add-on, Magic!\n\nA comment about the reviews for these add-ons: because they are specialized and limited DLC that pertains directly to the main Elven Legacy game, I will not spend too much time rehashing the core game in terms of how it works and plays and what it looks like. If you are interested in those things head back to my original review of the game. What I will do is address the changes the add-on makes to the core game, and also the elements of the add-on itself.\n\nAs the last add-on, Magic naturally deals with the final chapters in the story. The end of the Siege expansion opened up a wave of demonic energy that is sweeping the land and having a terrible impact on the world and is driving the Arcane Masters insane. The Holy Inquisition intervenes in order to stop the spread of darkness and madness.\n\nElven Legacy: Magic features a single campaign with 15 missions focused around a single hero class: the mage. The focus is around a single new hero: the Archmage supreme Alfred Brennock. There are also two returning heroes, so that you once again have three playable heroes. But the real story here is Brennock, who gets armed with some powerful new skills, spells and runes.\n\nThe game really caters to those who love playing a mage – the game introduces powerful new spells and summons that are also nicely complemented with stunning visual effects that are truly massive in scope. The scope of the world is every bit as huge as in Siege, as you are trying to save the entire world from sweeping forces of darkness.\n\nElven Legacy: Magic unsurprisingly continues the trend of not having any voice acting. At this point it is no big deal, and remains a fair trade-off to get such a large expansion with such a breadth of content for such a great price. The graphics and controls remain largely untouched from Siege. Once again, this add-on depicts some truly epic battles that nearly stress the engine to its breaking point, but again I found that it was more satisfying than frustrating.\n\nThe difficulty level of Siege was punishing, and with Magic we see that the lull in difficulty in Ranger was a momentary lapse, never to be seen again. If you haven’t discovered it by now, it is really important to do as well as possible in missions, which typically means repeating them for better results. However, for many folks (certainly for someone like me who likes strategy games but is no grognard!) it often means repeating missions just to survive and THEN repeating more to get the Gold victory!\n\nMore than ever, getting those Gold victories will reward you in the end. The completist in me just wanted every possible mission, but what I got in the end was a bonus mission that tied together everything from the series going all the way back to Fantasy Wars! What a great way to end the series!\n\nThat said, Elven Legacy: Magic changes nothing about the things that will make you love or hate the series. It is a great value, but really depends on you having played the original game and both add-ons, and benefits even more if you also played Fantasy Wars. Like the previous expansions, if you already enjoy the original game you’ll love this third and final add-on too!\nPros:\n+ Solid turn-based combat system\n+ Great value for the price\n+ Decreased difficulty\n+ Decent story\n+ Solid graphics\n+ Possibility to win … but still lose\n\nCons:\n- No voice acting\n- Poor translations cause occasional confusion\n- Time limits can STILL be frustrating\n\nGame Info:\nPlatform: PC\nPublisher: Paradox Interactive\nDeveloper: 1C:Ino-Co\nRelease Date: 12/1/09\nGenre: Turn-Based Strategy\nESRB Rating: Teen\nPlayers: 1-4","June 29, 2014","true","0.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

The early missions aren’t too bad, but the very late ones are incredibly hard – and never allow you to deploy your full army at once.\n\nElven Legacy is basically a Fantasy General style game, but with better graphics and with more choices for which upgrades you want for which unit, with different unit types getting different choices.\n\nFor the expansions for Elven Legacy – Siege in particular though – the difficulty level is insane on many missions. When playing the expansions be prepared to reload a lot and try different ways of doing a mission. I find i have to save the game at the start of each turn and at the end of each turn (before the computer takes its turn), as there is a lot of luck involved, and reloading can lead to very different results from an identical situation.\n\nFantasy Wars, the game that came before Elven Legacy, was also too hard and limited you to to few units that could be deployed at once, but it wasn't quite as insanely difficult as some of the Elven Legacy expansions.\n\nThere are some of the missions in the Siege expansion that i could only complete by using cheats - and that let me manage to complete them in the "bronze" number of turns rating. Completing  almost any mission in it in gold is simply not possible. If the difficulty had been a bit more sensible on the later missions in the main game, and many of those in the expansions, this would probably have been a much more popular game.\n\nStill worth trying though, especially at the minimal price it now sells for.\n","January 6","true","4.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I have very fond memories of Fantasy Wars and as well as Elven Legacy.\n\nThis game have some interesting feature. I love building and upgrading my army throughout the campaign. I easily grow attach to different units and troops in my army. The setting is simple enough. But I love the simplicity of it. There is a certain charm of the setting. Good vs Evil. Orc, humans, elves, dwarves and etc.\n\nThe difficulty makes it harder to enjoy the game to the fullest. That and how you are forced to rush through a mission in order to get the highest reward, when you should be taking the time to win a battle.\n\nOverall, Elven Legacy is a flawed gem. But it is a childhood game of mine. Maybe nostalgia is preventing me from being to critic it properly. But that doesn't change the fact that I had fun with the game. It is definitely a game for gamers who love strategy.","December 15, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yevgeniy0490/recommended/25850/","Yevgeniy0490","yevgeniy0490","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yevgeniy0490/","83 products in account","https://youtu.be/zOXsXWCNTQI\nMade by professional individuals from Ino-Co[www.ino-co.com], Elven Legacy is the definition of a classical turn-based strategy wargame that has a minor amount of RPG elements added into it. Essentially being a standalone expansion for Fantasy Wars, Elven Legacy portrays the world of Illis from the viewpoint of a "Higher Race" - Ancient Elves whom players are tasked to command in the single-player campaign. Originally released in 2007, Elven Legacy, along with its predecessor, is a title that possesses both quality and an addictive, albeit somewhat straightforward game mechanic. However, by no means does this simple gameplay make Elven Legacy less engaging or challenging, and experienced wargamers will find the difficulty level of this title much to their liking.\n\nMost of the gameplay process concentrates on turn-based battles set in a high-fantasy world of Illis, a magical world where Elves, Men, Dwarves and Orcs have waged war upon one another for countless ages. Each of these races bear their own army with a wide variety of different units, spells and abilities. Combat takes place on maps that consist of hexagonal cells, with armies being limited in troop size and in terms of economy. Gold is the main resource and can be acquired throughout missions by means of scavenging and capturing (units are able to capture towns and scavenge ruins or other places of interest for gold, items and artifacts). Additional reinforcements can be hired for gold and are then deployed in cities which the player has under his control. Units are divided into several separate types - Infantry, Archers, Cavalry, Sky Hunters, Bombers and War Machines. Heroes are also present in this game, and are often crucial for the achievement of victory. All units in Elven Legacy, including the mentioned heroes, are able to gain experience throughout battles. Experience plays a critical role in the improvement of the player's army during both the campaign and skirmish missions. Upon gaining a level, units will be able to obtain various skills, will acquire better stats, and will ultimately have the possibility for an upgrade to a better unit. Spells, although present in the game, are nonetheless a relatively rare occurrence, for they are limited in charges, and the power of spellcasters is thus meant to be used wisely. All armies, along with their units, have their own strategies. Elves, for an example, are a mobile striking force that relies on archers, with their melee units being more of either a first line defense, either a distraction for the enemy. Human armies, on the other hand, use heavily armored cavalry while possessing weaker ranged units. As a conclusion, it can be added, that all races in the world of Illis have their own means to wage war, and when the player chooses his own army, it is going to take him some time before he gets used to leading it into battle with success. Terrain, as one would guess, plays a major role in this wargame. Throughout the entire campaign of Elven Legacy, players are going to use the cover of forests to their advantage whilst commanding the elven army, for as it should be, elven units get a bonus to their protection while fighting amongst the trees (and additional bonuses to their other stats as well, depending whether a unit had certain skills chosen prior to using the woods as cover). In Elven Legacy, different types of environment can either provide your troops with an advantage over the enemy, or quite to the contrary, might actually worsen their defensive capabilities by exposing them on open ground. Certain types of terrain can also hinder troop movement, and all of these factors add gameplay depth and realism when it comes to playing the missions, forcing the player to rely on tactical decision making while managing the actions of his forces. In a nutshell, Elven Legacy is a classical turn-based wargame, and all of the elements which are present in the game necessitate the player to think strategically, calculating his each step with attention and thoroughness.\n\nThe single-player campaign which is present in Elven Legacy can be described as both difficult and short. Composed of 10 missions, Elven Legacy will have the player saving and reloading quite often, especially on the "Hard" difficulty setting, where running out of turns equals to failure of a mission. As a sidenote, it should be taken into consideration, that all games that were developed by Ino-Co (Majesty 2 and Star Wolves are a great example of this. The latter was developed by a different company, but most of its team members later formed Ino-Co) are very difficult to beat. The campaign, even though only 10 missions long, is still very time consuming. Elven Legacy is not really a game for a casual player, a person who would like to simply enjoy the graphics or spend a tranquil few hours relaxing and clicking the mouse while managing his army in battle. Instead, Elven Legacy is a game that requires a lot of attention and patience, and to a certain degree, even stubbornness. During most, if not all of the missions, the player's army is going to be outnumbered, but if the player wishes to finish the game, he must nonetheless keep the casualties of his army to a minimum, otherwise he will find the game impossible to finish. This is because the gold that the player gets for the completion of missions will not compensate for high casualties, and the player is therefore bound to take great care of his own warriors. The plotline that is present in Elven Legacy during the campaign is unclear and vague, and the translation from the original Russian language to English is not the reason behind this, because the translation was done relatively well. Rather, this is because the story has no clear sense as such. During all 10 missions of the campaign, a much respected Elven general by the name of Saggitel, along with his magically gifted assistant Gylven, is going to hunt down a runaway renegade wizard that stole a dangerous spell. This turn of events, gradually, will lead to Gylven going rogue as well, with her seemingly benevolent attempt trying to restore a great elven tree, the giver of all life. In short, the storyline isn't particularly bad, rather it's average, but many things are mentioned quickly or are simply left unexplained, and this leaves a negative impression, that the entire plot was written over the course of an hour by one of the game developers instead of professional story writer. The overall setting of Elven Legacy, just like Fantasy Wars, was developed with both attention to detail and skill, but is still somewhere within the boundary of your average game. When playing Elven Legacy, you can not leave unnoticed an impression, that even though Elven Legacy was developed by talented people, the game was still made within a small budget. This game (and the entire franchise for that matter) had all the potential to become something much more acknowledged and popular, but unfortunately, never did.\n\nMultiplayer is also implemented, and, as one can only assume, it would really make Elven Legacy shine, if this game would have ever become more well known to a bigger amount of people. The possibilities with all the strategic battles between players in this game seem to be very great, if not endless, and there are over a dozen multiplayer maps available to choose from. Unfortunately, playing Elven Legacy over the Internet appears to be impossible, and if players wish to test their skills against one another on the field of online battle, they will need Local Area Network emulating software such as Tunngle or Hamachi.\n\nElven Legacy is definitely a worthy game, worthy of being played and liked. It could have been designed to look better and more polished, but i still recommend it to all\nplayers who like turn-based strategies, especially difficult ones... You won't be disappointed!","May 11","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
