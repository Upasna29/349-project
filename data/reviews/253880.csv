or hes going right into plasma cannons or air units?\n\nYou can manipulate the terrain , create trenches to block enemy vehicles, flatten the terrain, build bridges, and...construct an entire tunnel network...yup...u can literally dig under fortified enemy bases for back-door attacks.\nMost weapons require ammuntions, so u need to consider this when fighting far from your base (supply depots and aircraft handle ammunition delievery).\n\nCampaign-\n\nThe Beauty of the campaign is that its no entirely linear; you are set with a global objective of getting a large amount of credits towards the evacuation of the planet.\nWithin missions u need to find the balance between building an army and researcing tech, to sending credits to ur spaceport for the main goal, if u fail missions the game doesnt end, sometimes u just lose the tech/content that u could have received withing that missions, and in some cases u are presented with different missions on the globe due to the one u failed.\nyou only fail the campaign if u fail to achieve the required credits when the timer runs out ( and you have plenty of time, the timer doesn't pushes you to rush missions at all), i finished the first campaign with 109 days left (out of 183) and i took all the time in the world in each and every mission i played.\n\nThe missions vary from destroying enemy bases, sneaking and exploring huge tunnel systems, recovering artifacts and prototypes, testing new tech and the usuall destroy your enemies.\n\nYou can finish the campaign earlier, u dont need to reach "final mission 20" to end the game, its all up to your methods.\nyou do u have general time limit before earth goes boom though..\n\nWhen the global timer gets close to zero, the map variety changes as well, forests map turn into lava maps with hot terrain,\nwater maps are almost non existent...and so on.\n\n\nIts also worth to note that during the campaign, the enemy faction also research their weapons, just like you, the AI doesn't have advantage over the player, and excluding a few techs, the AI research advancement depends on your playstyle.\nTurtling usually lets the AI finish all hes availabe research and keep up with the player, sometimes bypass you.\n\nPlaying aggressively, and attacking research centers or finishing missions early, sets the AI back, not allowing it to finish its research, creating an advantage for the player in future missions.\n\nin total, there are around ~30 missions..yes....THIRTEE missions PER faction , and they usually take more then 30-40 min real time to complete.\nJust to give an exmaple, it took me around ~20 total hours to complete the campaign with one faction.\n\nIts insane how much content and variety this game has for something that comes up in 2002, most of those features the RTS games of today doesn't even have, and the content they provide is much more thinner.\n\nYou are always driven forward to continue, if its by the tech and the new units that come available, the missions, the story and so on.\n\nI wish studios today would develop games like earth 2150, and its concepts that completly change the course of how RTS games work. rather then squeeze as much $$$ as possible for its costumers and giving them the minimum content to please them.\n\nIts amazing that im enjoying this game even more when i first played it..12 years ago.\nFor a miserable price of 7 bucks which includes the expansion packs as well, its so much worth it.\n\nIm playing this game on Win 7 with no problems at all, if its crashes for u its due to resultion, and there are plenty of solutions to that in steamforums/internet.\n\nTL:DR\n\n\nPros:\n\n-Non-linear campaign\n-Very long campaign\n-Multiple ways to approach missions\n-Unit Costumization and a very large research tree\n-Air force, Navy Units and Ground Units, its all there\n-Tunnel digging\n-Minefields\n-Terran shaping and manipluation\n-Very intresting to play factions, all balanced and differ from each other\n-Hige Replay value\n\nCons\n\n-Old controls and lacking mouse options (you canno't invert the mouse controls - right click command, left click select)\n-Sometimes clunky units behevior (units shooting rockets into mountains etc..)\n-Not alot of players in mutiplayer these days\n\nOverall 9.5/10","April 11, 2014","true","92.1"," 56 of 63 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","56","63","2","0"

The resource system works brilliantly and forces the player to chose between finishing the game sooner and researching/building more units to help with future missions. This combined with the timed story, as in you only have a limited time to reach your goal, puts the pressure on the player troughout the game and forces the player to make quick decitions and not spend ages planning. Without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time.","November 27, 2013","true","8.2"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","3"

The lurnar group is hover low armor/high shield output, the ED are heavy tanks with high armor/low shields, and the UCS are robot mechs with a med armor/shield output.  This gives a 3 factions that play in their oun way.\n\nThe vehical system is where this game blows the rts walls open. Make a vehical tha way you want it not the premade idea some one thought up. Like rockets add that to the tank, like heavy guns change it to heavy guns then build it.  Want a combo? Yea heavy guns with a rocket on top, it dose that(for real!!! best tanks for ED)  The weapon combo system with a med weapon system added on top of a large weapon makes for vehicals that are your liking.\n\nThen they put ammo in, you need to reload your vehicals with air drops from cargo choppers linked to supply depo's.  With energy weapons needing time to recharge, lasers, spark cannons, sonic guns(hate that aoe), it makes for a good balance.\n\nSave your crew, this isnt much in the muti player but in any campaign if you keep units alive you can transport them back to a main base and reuse them on the next mission.  This leads to the exp, as you keep units alive they make kills and gain more armor,hp, and damage with each lvl. The quick way to see this is make a unit with a banner, it adds 2 lvl's to units around it, very use full early but wont add past lvl 4 if a remember right.  This will show give an example of the added damage/hp a unit has at higher lvl's.  The next thing is a unit that will let you upgrade units with new tech, better shields ready add it on and upgrade it. Some units you cant, but that up to you to find them the starting unit types.\n\nThe game was ahead of its time and I dont think any rts has come close to following the way it plays.  The line that describes the game with 150 missions and 9 campaigns is true but thats ED,UCS, and LC X3 games so each game has a campaign for each group.  I would start with ED on ESCAPE FROM THE BLUE PLANET to learn the game, it has the easy start, the UCS and LC through you in.\n\nThe bugs are mosly sceen size issue's, the game wasnt made for todays HDtv screens/widesceen issues, search for the fix its out there.","March 21, 2015","true","2.5"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","35","42","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/253880/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Earth 2150 is an old 3D Real-Time Strategy which has expected core gameplay with some few unique features. Trilogy consist of original Earth 2150: Escape From Blue Planet and it's two stand-alone expansion packs: Moon Project and Lost Souls.\n\nSo, let's see how Steam rerelease fares. Well, it was released on Steam in "as is" state, which is never a good idea for early Windows games.\nUnless you configured it properly, it will crash when you try to open research or unit construction windows by pressing F2 or F1. Which are very important to gameplay, you will not even get military units without it. Thus you have to open up configuration and then set resolution to 4:3 ratio. Also set driver to OpenGL. This should fix it all.\nAlso, you will not be able to multitask or chat while playing this game. It does not allow alt-tab. After fixing the game the steam overlay will not work. Windowed mode steals mouse and is just clunky.\nMovies don't work in Expansion Packs. Only in original E2150. No idea if that's because they weren't included or because of bugs.\n\nMultiplayer is known not to work there. I didn't look past registartion, to be honest. Now, looking over forums, some people suggested some ways to get it working. Fan patches and tools. But I don't feel that it's worth it, to be honest. Doubt that anybody plays it regulary nowdays. And then some people still couldn't get it to work, so eh.\n\nThe plot as follows is that ED, Eurasian Dynasty, devastated UCS, United Civilized States, base on north pole with nuclear weapon, in order to win the war that was started by UCS main computer due to some error. The huge explosion altered trajectory of Earth and soon it's going to get closer to the sun, burning everything alive. LC, Lunar Corporation, which previously was sitting on a moon cut off from Earth's war, realized that they will burn up as well and joins the fray. All of them need Earth's recources to build huge space shuttle in order to evacuate to Mars.\nThe plot itself in a game isn't anything to talk about, it doesn't have any big storytelling. Though, it does have some here and there, but it's all text at the beggining of a mission, no big cuttscenes. I msotly enjoyed reading them because they show the unique relation inside each faction, giving them more personality.\n\nNow, basis of a game itself is a fairly standard RTS game. You build base, you build power stations, you extract money from sparce recource fields and you build army to crush another player.\nInterface quite old. A bit awkward, with big windows and having to use left mouse button to both select and send command. Still better than in Earth 2140.\nThe scale is old-schoolishly spammy. You know, where you build 5 Mines over single field and 8 Weapon Productions Centers and then make them all produce your varied army. Whoever doesn't agree will get crushed by AI. Then again, it's much needed, since game's pacing is a bit slower. You don't build a single unit in few seconds, it may take a whole minute to get a tank rolling out, so you will not get overwhelmed.\nThere is a fair amount of usual micromanagement too. Usual stuff of having to send transport that carries resources to mines as soon as they spawn. And putting all 3 of mines of a tiny field. And such. At least units don't have special abilities to manually use, it probably wouldn't fit there. It matters more during battle. You see, most of units can attack while moving around, even without command to do so. And if your enemy uses projectile weapons, like grenades or plasma, then it's sometimes better to just use cheaper variant of speedier machine with less HP and then circle around, delivering fire while not getting hit.\n\nAnd then there are few features that Earth 2150 tried to do. First, you actually have to assemble unit before mass-producing it, allowing you to be creative. Well, actually, not exactly creative, you are limited by few selection and by what you researched, but Single-Player people will still enjoy this aspect. You just pick a chassis and equipment. Sometimes you get to put second equipment as well.\nYou can also build bridges and tunnel. Bridge building is quite simple and does as you expect. For tunneling there is a serapate underground map under the main map. You build tunnel entrance and then get inside it, where you can also build tunnels in these caves and forgotten labs, to build tunnel exit leading to another place. Like backyard of enemy. Or to get ground forces behind mountains. Yes, you can fight underground if you meet somebody there, just not build anything. Oh and you can also affect surface anymore, by either creating trench or by flattening terrain to remove it. No, you can't flatten mountain.\nAnd then there are smaller things, like changing weapons on top of some buildings, researching slowly whatever new stuff you want or building headquarter building, which will handle some things. Like, auto-upgrading all defences. And whatever gadgeds that msot players would find not worth bothering with.\nAnd yea, compared to E2140 they removed infantry and automatic research. Which is good, more focus.\n\nAnd three factions look differently and play differently in some ways. ED and UCS are quite standard RTS factions, being different in nuances. ED uses tanks, UCS uses mechs. ED has to build fwe power sources, while UCS get enough from a single station which can be upgraded. ED needs mines, refinery and machines to deliver crates, while UCS needs only harvesters and refinery.\nLC playes much more differently there. All units can hover over the water and it doesn't have economic units. You just place buildings where you want, they slowly descent from the space. You just put mines over recource fields and complete forget of them. This all makes them possibly more powerful at times than they should be, as you can pretty much scout and then grab up all the recources on the map for yourself. They just lack a bit of main base focus, maybe.\n\nMain differences between Earth 2150 games is campaign. Original is very pleasent, starting off easy and slowly teaching you of new researches and units by making them available one by one. It's also great that you maange both main base and mission map at same time, sometimes sending reinforcement. Sadly, your mission is to send certain amount of recources on each level to main base and seeing how you can't know much of recources fields on each level is, how strong is enemy and since you can't sell any building or unit, only auto-destroy here, well, you can get stuck. So, often you will have to restart mission.\nMoon Project is proper expansion, introducing new units for everybody. It also has more normal campaign. Still with main base. But without recources requirements in each mission. So it's a good one, just isn't good as introduction to the game.\nLost Souls only adds campaign and it wants to wreck you.\n\nYou can also play Skirmish. Sadly, you can't preset AI into each team. And they seem to always refuse to be allies with you during the game. I wouldn't be surprised if they only want to target player base. Just expect duels. It's not so cheating, outside of knowing where exactly your base is and such. It's quite nice AI, can counter whatever you send.\nActually, the only way I won most battles is by grabbing all recources on the map and surviving long enough for AI to run out of it's recource field. And then denying AI's attempts to get more, until it can't even produce units anymore. Yep, it's the main weakness of this AI. Pretty hard otherwise, it sure knows how to go big and spammy.\n\nThere early graphics of 3D were great for it's time. They now look outdated. Until night comes in and you see everything activating lights. Always digged dark/light playes. Soundtrack is also nice, each faction has it's own set.\n\nIt's a good RTS. Sadly you can't alt-tab and that game is slow-paced at times, so I will not be playing it much. Has nice ideas otherwise.","August 4, 2015","true","11.0"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_the_pyro_/recommended/253880/","_the_pyro_","MeanderingBeing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_the_pyro_/","151 products in account","Absolutely one of the BEST RTS games out there. I've bought this game three times already... In any case, the gameplay is just as innovative now as it was back in... Well, I don't remember. I was literally a kid then. Games are only just now starting to pick up on the complexity and customization that this game brought to the table, and its graphics honestly still look pretty damn good, especially considering its age.\n\nOn the note of graphics, on both my hard copy and GOG.com copy, there is widescreen incompatibilities that will crash the game. This is simply because widescreen didn't actually exist when the VooDoo APIs (remember those beasts?) were written. Fixing it is fairly simple though. Look up nGlide, download the driver package and executable, configure and enjoy. Basically what it does is trick that old VooDoo software into thinking it is still in 4:3 while you're running 16:9 or 16:10 formats, plus it'll work with any game that was programed for those old VooDoo GPUs. Mechwarrior 3, here I come!\n\nGameplay wise, this game is both forgiving and unforgiving. The campaigns are long, and its amongst the few games that allows you to continue the campaign even after losing missions and battles. That's the forgiving part... The unforgiving part is that the game is basically a resource rush, battling relentless and challenging AIs over resources and trying to mine them out and send them back to your main base. While the game gives you plenty of opportunity to achieve your goals, the AI is very intelligent, and will stop at nothing to end you. Failing and/or fumbling battles too much will result in watching your people die in a firey apocalypse, and there won't be jack ♥♥♥♥ you can do about it. That being said, there is a huge number of missions for each campaign, some of which are only available under certain circumstances such as "Lose here..." or "Win there..." or the like.\n\nThe game provides a huge variety and complexity in units, weapons, and research, all of which makes for customizable units to a degree unseen in RTS with the exception of maybe Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. Throughout the game, whether in single or multiplay, you're have to balance cost, quality, quantity, and power for your units, weapons, and research, and rushing tech is much more complex than you'd see in other RTS like StarCraft or Dawn of War. Overall, each faction has a huge variety of units and lacks the over-simplified "this unit counters this" dynamic that seems to be so prevalent in RTS these days.\n\nIf this game has shortcoming at all, and obviously I don't think it does, it would be in its story. The game runs on a simple premise, described in the manual, box, and on the Steam page, of "The world was nuked to death by UCS Robots, and its orbit was disrupted enough that it's orbit has started to destabalize and move ever closer to the sun... So GTFO of dodge." Granted, a little bit more story is conveyed through mission briefings which are simple emails that you can read, but they can be generally skipped and are rather dull outside of the odd running joke. You make your own story in where you choose to go in the capaigns, and how you choose to handle each battle. Personally, I prefer this method, as games like Homeworld 2 get obnoxious with their incessant in-game cutscenes and endless hand-holding. I'd rather play my game, not watch it.\n\nOverall, I'd say that Earth 2150 is the most innovative RTS out there, and certainly amongst my favorites along with Dawn of War, Homeworld, and the first StarCraft. It surpassed its predecessor "Earth 2140," and set a high bar that its sequel, "Earth 2160," sadly fell just short of. If you're a hardcore RTS player, I highly recommend this game.\n\nI forgot to mention a couple things... The controls are quite unfamiliar. Being amongst the first 3D RTS games out there, they messed with the controls quite a bit. Being that this game lacks a tutorial, I strongly suggest downloading the manual, or finding a quick reference guide for the controls. Also, the prerendered cutscenes in this game are pretty damn awesome. Sadly, they are compressed to hell because they use the old bink codecs, but the quality really is top notch. Think about what CG looked like in 2000, then compare it to this... Really, the only places you'll find better is in studios like Blizzard.","March 29, 2014","true","0.2"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

I love the research and production feature of the game where you can design your own units by building them from different components. It has a day/night cycle and dynamic weather which is a really cool for such an old RTS game. Units and buildings auto turn on lights at night and it looks awesome especially in a heavy night snowstorm. It's definitely worth it's low price as of now.","April 19","true","15.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Trenches, walls, bridges to build and use\n- Tunnel area below the surface. Good for getting behind defenses or attacking with earthquake generators\n- Unit voices giving them real characters just by reporting\n- Unique music for each faction\n- Day/night cycle influencing the sight range (lights too)\n- Weather, going from wind and rain over thunderstorms to meteor showers\n- Some very nice cheats if you cant get it done\n- Cool mods giving you even more units, weapons, maps and modes (I love Operation X)\nand more...\n\nTwo downsides:\n- The pathfinding is quite annoying sometimes, especially with large groups. (Alt+G shows grid ;)\n- "Destroy the base" means destroy every one building, including the small tower 5km away in the middle of nowhere. Sometimes the remaining enemy units should be taken care of too. For these few cases you should use the cheats to proceed\n\nRegarding the engine, you may want to play The Moon Project first, as it and Lost Souls use an upgraded engine and have some improvements in UI, unit management and so on. Since it has a side story you won't get spoilers, instead some things are better explained than in Escape from the blue planet. Lost Souls plays directly after this, so you should play it last. Also, in Lost Souls the campaigns are linear, so you should first go for ED, then LC and UCS as last.\nAlso, Multiplayer via MoonNet server is working most times, if you are interested contact me :)","July 27, 2015","true","81.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had no idea what to do half of the time I played\n-	Game play feels too slow and sluggish\n-	The ammo sluppying while interesting,it gets boring really fast\n-	To me the AI seemed too hard because of the steep learning curve.\n-	No real sense of achievement after completing several missions\n-	Each mission is a big time sink and becomes boring\n-	Your army can be immediately killed if it is facing some type of enemies\n-	The fighting targeting is horrible because of the path finding\n-	Your units will keep being hit and move around to position themselves before attacking\n-	There is a lights on/off on buildings and units which seems completely pointless\n-	The maps are too big and annoying to navigate through\n-	The minimap layout is extremly horrible,rotation makes even more confusing\n-	The minimap is basically uselss,as it doesn’t help you at all during missions\n-	The multiplayer is obviously dead and its  game modes are severely outdated\n-	The story fails to deliver in the end\n-	The cinematics are pointless and too cheesy. They don’t add any value to the story\n-	Game feeling bounces from really like it or really hate it too frequently\n-	The expansion moon project  worse than the original game in most aspects : especially story\n-	The terrain and movement on the terrain is agonizing to look at and wait upon\n-	Unit selection is faulty when you have a lot of units on screen\n-	The game feels too often like a chore than actual fun\n-	Missions rarely vary from gather resource/destroy enemy base/escort transporters\n-	The fighting music is too irritating and repetitive\n-       The ending for each faction felt anticlimactic and non emotional.\n-	Last impression was that game missions take too long and don’t have enough to keep you wanting to come back\n\nOverall,I cannot say that I would recommend this trilogy.

If you can get it working there’s no options, no tutorial and it gives you no idea what you’re doing or anything. The graphics setting are out of the game but are exceptionally buggy (I have two monitors and it defaulted me to 640x864 (not a typo) when one is 1360x760 and the other is 1920x1080, by turning the 1360x760 one off, it defaulted to 640x864 as well) After messing in config files for 30 mins I got it to work at 1080p (which is one of the settings, it just doesn’t save it when u start the game) and starting the game showed me a 360p video (stretched so looked ugly as hell) an a menu that looked just as bad, with no options for mouse settings, key bindings or anything, the game barley works and should not be bought.\nFinally getting it working to a reasonable standard and find that there’s no tutorial, and the game gives me no idea what to do, the UI is clunky and the mouse sensitivity is WAY too high with no way to change it, brilliant start...\nSo far I've managed to start a game with a bot but with no instructions and only 5 buildings to choose from, I have to question the other reviews, as there is no way that this can be an 'amazing rts' to quote one of them.\nIf I’m missing something, please tell me, as I have no idea what I'm doing and a tutorial or guide would be nice. so would a graphics setting where the ground has a higher resolution that minecraft.","June 14, 2014","false","0.1"," 7 of 31 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","7","31","0","7"
