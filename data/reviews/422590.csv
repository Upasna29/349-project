A little rough around the edges but captures the spirit of the first game and builds upon it's strengths.\n\n8/10 for now, menu is quite glitchy sometimes, and hopefully we can get a map editor and workshop support for this...these two things would make it an easy 10/10.","May 22","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd wait on this one.
