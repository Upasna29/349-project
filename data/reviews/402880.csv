It needs a lot of work.\n\nThe controls need severe tightening up - especially when it comes to executing the special moves, which seem to come out sometimes and sometimes they don't. Also, your character moving just a smidge faster would be helpful, since some of the enemies can move faster too.\n\nSecondly, the game is bugged to hell and back. It needs a lot of fixes. It seems to have issues regarding the edge of the screen. Enemies tend to back away all the time like cowards, so you'll often push them to a screen transition - but wacky things can happen there. The worst is when your rescued maidens end up carried to the edge of the screen - especially in areas where you aren't allowed to go back yourself... for some stupid reason. They can be picked up by spanwing bad guys and you can't reach them to save them.\n\nThen there was a weird issue I had repeatedly in the first stage, where taking the upper path would lead me to a dead end, but the game wouldn't let me go back to the rest of the stage. What the hell, man? I had to quit to the menu and enter the stage again. I tried it multiple times thinking maybe I just missed something or perhaps it was a glitch - but no. So, that needs to be sorted out too. I choose to believe that was an oversight rather than ♥♥♥♥e design.\n\nOh, and what the hell do the blue gem things do? They don't have an item description and using them doesn't seem to do anything. Also, the shop needs to be translated in english. That would be handy, maybe we could see what they do there.\n\nAlso, why did the kick move have to be fwd+low attack? The low attack has easily the longest range, and it doesn't miss smaller or ducking opponents, so it'll be your go-to attack, but with enemies that back away all the time, you'll be chasing them a lot trying to hit them, and the kick will constantly come out, sometimes even when you let go of fwd to press the low attack button.\n\nThe priorties of the buttons also seem to be all over the place. Many a time I've had my character stop mid-combo to throw a switch or open a chest or something. Make the interaction a different button, for the love of god!\n\nAnd this is my primary beef with the gameplay. The minotaur boss fight is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. He's not hard, he's just annoying. He has a kind of inexplicable repelling force-field that constantly pushes your character away from him so your attacks fall just short. This is bad design. And it's annoying enough on its own, but if you push the ♥♥♥♥er too far to the right - which you will do, because he keeps pushing you away - he'll disappear off the edge of screen and you can't finish the fight. Fix that too.\n\nAnd this is a minor quibble, but it would be nice to see it sorted out - the game is a little rough around the edges, sometimes loading screens show windows borders and mouse cursors and stuff... not technically bugs, but still, it does make the product seem amateurish.\n\nAnd here's a tip: when you pick up gold, it seems like the game is pretty generous - but when you go to the shop after finishing a stage, you might be wondering why you have so little gold when you could have sworn you were picking up roughly 100 gold a pop --- well, it's because the amount displayed when you pick up some gold doesn't represent how much you picked up, it shows how much you have in total.\n\nWhen those issues are sorted out, I'll have no problem recommending this game, because it's a very cool concept and quite different to other platformers out there. The subject matter also suits me right down to the ground, so I really want to see the game polished.\n\n\nEDIT: A patch claiming to address some of the issues I've mentioned has been released. I'll give it a go as soon as I have some time and update my review if necessary.","June 3","false","3.5"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","50","61","0","0"

I am very happy with the art style and combat system. My gf saw me playing it and although she enjoys much of the same stuff as me, she did comment it seemed a bit too sexist, but then again in the 80s were this game takes its inspiration, things were. As I did point out, whilst using the scantily clad woman warrior, the priestess falls at her feet too. But to be honest so would I...\n\nHowever, after an hour the bugs did start to frustrate. Yes there are a lot of bugs, but as your experience and items are kept if a level fails (like a boss walking off the screen never to return, or a tree not letting you chop it down, and mystery items being in your inventory) then you don't feel too bad for playing through the same levels again. There are also secrets and bit of extra exploration you can do along the way.\n\nMy other criticism as made on the boards already is why there is no co-op mode (even if it was just loacal). I am happy to play it single player but think this would have added to the expereience. Even a two player duel mode tagged on would have been nice. Maybe unlocking enemies from the game as you defeat them, pokemon style.\n\nI think it is a testament to the game that even with the bugs I kept coming back for more. I am just about to load it up again after downloading the second patch. This is good as it seems like they are trying to fix it, even though a bit more testing should have happened before release.","June 5","true","4.5"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","23","29","2","1"

This game cannot be considered even remotely finished--it can barely be called playable.\n\n- Bosses can be pushed off-screen and cannot return, thereby preventing you from finishing the fight. The only current solution is to restart the level.\n\n- Some floors are obviously supposed to be walked on but lack actual collision, leading to bottomless pits and unjustified missed jumps.\n\n- The low attack button and use button are the same key, often leading to you hitting a barrel or finishing a downed opponent instead of swinging your weapon at an actual threat.\n\n- Controls are hit-and-miss depending on which control method you use. Either way, the game is not nearly as reponsive as it should be.\n\n- Translations are not done. Some text is in surprisingly decent English, while other text is in assumedly the developer's native tongue.\n\n- Random bugs and glitches, such as losing control of your character and them walking to the right after defeating a boss.\n\nThere's potential in the game itself, but the developer may very well likely lack the skills to properly make this the gem it could be. Wait for the majority of bugs to be patched, or wait for sale. As of now, the game isn't worth it at all.","June 4","false","2.7"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"

From what I could play it seemed reasonably well done, some minor graphical design issues but other than that the controls handled smoothly. Combat SEEMS to be reasonably well done (3 strikes, 1 parry, ducking, jumping, cartwheel/roll, kick and several combos) you have an endurance meter that limits the amount of attacks you can make before it needs to recover.\nBUT a bug prevented me from progressing beyond the intro story and others report general issues starting the game.\nSo if you do like the general topic of the game you CAN try your luck, but id advice to rather buy only when at least the mayor bugs have been smoothed out.","June 3","false","1.1"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","33","52","2","3"

In other words, you want to experience Arnie (or some derivative) going around killing everything in sight for (add plot item here {revenge, gem, woman, magical item}).\n\nBeing a huge fan of the Barbarian and Barbarian II games by Palace Software, I was very excited about this title and looked forward to some good old fashioned decapitations, naked barbarian chicks, monsters, and muscle-bound warriors screaming "aeearrggghh" at every turn.\n\nThis game definitely does not dissapoint on any of these elements (I mean it has dinosaurs shooting lasers from their eyes, all arguments are invalid). It has everything an old-school S&S fan could want.\n-The plot is simply, basic revenge story, but it works. I love it!\n-The platforming for the most part is smooth and enjoyable\n-The fighting is good, although the keyboard controls could use some work\n-The graphics are simple, but they do what they're supposed to (basically show you breasts, monsters, and guts, what else?)\n-The finishing moves are gory, and you really feel the 'crunch' as you swing your sword and cut an enemy's head in half\n\nNow to talk about the problems.\n-Bugs, bugs, and more bugs.\nIn all fairness, the developers are actively adressing the problems and have been quite active in the comments. However, it would be nice if they didn't use their customers as beta testers. I would be more annoyed, but this seems to have become the norm now.\n\nPersonally I would recommend this to any fan of the genre in a heartbeat, despite the bugs, as these are being addressed as we speak. For fans of platformers, I'd say take what I said with a pinch of salt, as there is a nostalgic factor that biases my opinion. For the rest of the potential buyers, all I can say is, if you get triggered by the lack of political correctness in games, or if your homepage is set to tumblr, then I'm inclined to suggest that you give this one a pass. Otherwise, wait a bit for all the major bugs to be ironed out and then pick it up.\n","June 5","true","5.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Everything from the soundtack to the choice of graphical asthetic portrays the love and passion developers Crian Soft have for this genre.\n\nI have the original version of this game and I must say the "Extended Cut" upgrade was worth the wait. The controls are much more fluid, and combos are easier to pull off. There are new and extended cutscenes telling more of the story. New characters and voice acting, a travelling merchant, and a campfire added to the beginning of levels are all welcome additions. A tutorial mode has also been added to help learn the controls and the overall difficulty has been balanced. (I cannot comment on mid to end-game content as this game was sooo bloody hard.)\n\nThere are some issues with the game at launch, some spelling and grammar mistakes, some menus are in Italian even though english is selected. I am sure the small issues will be ironed out post-release and are really not game-breaking.

There is nothing top notch about it. The story is weak. The characters are one dimensional. The graphics and animation is as bad as 1990s Super Nintendo. The gameplay is FRUSTRATING. And yet I don't hate it.\n\nThis is not for children. There's nudity. Both male and female. Very sketchy scenes happen involving the female protagonist and a certain evil sorceress that straddle the fine line of art and pornography. Guts, gore and awful platforming will take you through a journey that should last about 5 hours minus the game BREAKING bugs. This game will test your patience. I've literally run the gauntlet of bugs to finish the game just to see what very short ending there was for my lady barbarian.\n\nAs far as controls go I played this on a keyboard and got fairly good at it near the end. The game gets a lot easier the higher level you become. I found that the moves execute over three-fourths of the time when you press the right keys. Sometimes though a move will fire off that you definately didn't press the keys for. Overall the combat is serviceable. Unfortunately the AI for the enemies and bosses is subpar. You'll be dispatching the everyday thug with ease after a few levels but there is one boss in particular (was inexcessible until they patched it) that is inexplicably tough and literally kills you with a laser beam to the head in one hit. In general the bosses just spam a few power hits and die most of the time getting caught in animation loops as your barbarian hacks away at them. The main thing, however, that will drive you crazy is the 2-D platforming. Its no good. The designers will place a ledge nearby and inexplicably not allow you to grab it. Your hapless barbarian falls to his/her death costing you progress and also your sanity. Traps are there to avoid but are poorly placed sometimes right in front of area transitions so your barbarian walks into his/her death simply because of level design. So much of this can be remedied with a little more care to designing these stages.\n\nWhat I do like about this game is the idea. It's simple. You have lots of action. You have lots of combat. A little exploration (something they should expand!!!!!! What's the point of being a barbarian if you can't roam and explore the world?). This, like the game Exanima, is a taste of what something could be. Players want mature games like The Witcher, Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls, Fallout and Mass Effect. We don't shy away from violence, nudity or gore. We seek it out. Age of Barbarian strives to meet those wants but falls well short. Still, if you are looking for a little distraction for a day or two this is not a title to miss. A little tightening of the controls here, improved level design there, some better animations and a bigger overall world would make this a far more enjoyable experience. And if you do not agree, then "the HELL with YOU!" - Ahnuld Schwarzenegger.","June 6","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
