"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeonBallroom/recommended/104700/","NeonBallroom","Maddo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeonBallroom/","319 products in account","Okay, so after finally pouring 100 hours into this game in such a small time, I've decided to actually write a review on this game now. This review is rather lengthly. Sorry for being boring.\n\nThis is not a pay to win.\nFirst off, the description for this game is outdated. It is not updated weekly, and has been 'abandoned' by the developers. There has not been an update since early 2013. Uber Entertainment said multiple times on their forums that if they have a small chance to revive the game, they will. For now, they shall focus on bigger projects. Let's hope they keep that promise. Now to the review.\n\nAfter acquiring over 100 hours, I can say this game is PURE HELL to get into. The game has been 'dead' or rather, has a low playerbase, and has done for about 2 years now. There are the occasional new players, but they don't stick around after what they find.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad\nSo, before you decide whether or not to play this game, or dive in blind and think 'Yeah! This'll be great and fun!' I'm going to post all the negatives so you don't have to experience them getting thrown at your face first hand.\n\n1. The Community\nAs I have previously stated, the playerbase for this game is rather at a low. Due to this factor, you'll find most players you run into will be fully geared to the teeth (completely cosmetics.. except for endorsements, but we'll get to that). Now, I'm not saying every experienced player in this game is a huge butt, but most of them are.\n\nYou'll find people will find ways to get angry in almost any situation. Whether their team is winning or losing. They'll find ways to insult you, no matter how. Be it your interests, name, how you type/play. You name it.\n\nI'll probably go as far to say the community on this game is worse than Dota 2 or League of Legends. However, this doesn't mean you can find... "nice" players to run into. I can name a few, but I won't mention any names in this review to respect people's privacy.\n\n2. Endorsements\nOkay, so. Endorsements! I'll give you a quick run down on what they are.\n\nIn SMNC, you start off at level 0. Every 4 levels, you unlock a new Endorsement slot, getting up to 25 slots in total. You can go above the level 100 mark, but this will not unlock any endorsement slots.\n\nNow, Endorsements themselves are small buffs with a positive advantage, and a negative disadvantage. These can be bought with coins, and are permenant, so you can buy and keep as many as you like. Mixing and matching different Endorsements at level 100 can help in giving you a huge advantage against players.\n\nNow, here's the thing.\n\nAs I have previously explained, playerbase is rather low. So you'll be finding if you're a new player straight off the bat, you'll be running into all these powerful and experienced pros... With all of their Endorsement slots filled.\n\nThis feature alone is probably one of the single handed reasons along with the community that I hate this game.\n\n3. Matchmaking\nNow, this is what I feel to be one of the game's biggest flaws.\n\nAs explained above, most of the community is experienced players. Now, if you get new players joining, or less experienced ones, this won't change anything. Matchmaking is COMPLETELY random. It won't pair you up against players based on their level/skill/endorsement sets, it'll just drag and drop you into a list and not care.\n\nThis leads to cases such as having a completely new team, fight against a team of experienced players.. Utterly getting slaughtered in the process.\n\n4. Conclusion of Bad Points\nAs you may have guessed just by reading this...\nThis game is incredibly hard to get into. To the point of masochism. It's easy to get stressed out over the various negatives at this game.\n\nNow, you may be wondering... Why did I go through with it? Why did I continue to play, despite the horrible negatives?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Good\nI can't deny it. This game is special. Something is so fun and quirky about it.\n\n1. The Atmosphere. I'll get this out of the way first.\nSimply put, this game has an amazing atmosphere. A futuristic combat sport set in an arena, crowd going wild, announcers with funny voice lines, fitting situations well. What's not to love?\n\nThe Crowd is dynamic. Say if you were to make a kill, make something happen, or an event happens in the map, the crowd will respond. Being either cheers of joy, or jeers of disappoint.\n\nThe Announcers are fun to listen to. They sometimes share interesting stories, talk about what is happening in the match, and will respond to any kills/killstreaks/annihilator use. It all feels so real, and well done. The voice acting is great in this game. That is undeniable.\n\n2. Gameplay itself\nMost people end up mistaking this game for a third person shooter... and end up raging in the process.\n\nThough it may feel strange or possibly even unnatural at first, SMNC has a really great feel once you get the hang of it. A MOBA with Third Person Shooter hybrid elements? At the time, it was pretty new. Fresh, too. I'm not sure if there have been any since.\n\nEach pro has three abilities, all bound to SHIFT, Q and E by default. It's simple, really. Each pro is easy to understand, and there are many to choose from.. Although there are no longer 'free pro rotations'. I've had fun playing a lot of them though!\n\nAll in all, I feel like this is one of those games where you have to 'play it yourself to understand' it.\n\n3. Conclusion of Good Points\nI honestly don't think I really need much of a conclusion here, as most of it is explained above. I can give a bit of advice though.\n\nYou can't learn if you don't play, so keep on trying! And play for fun. Ignore the occasional butthead you might come across who will call you a 'feeder' or a 'noob' or anything of the sort.\n\n\nAnd that concludes my Super Monday Night Combat Review! If you've read this far, I'm amazed. Thank you for reading, as I appreciate it. Sorry if I might've bored you though. Have fun playing!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TaytoSeal/recommended/104700/","TaytoSeal","Tayto, the Seal King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TaytoSeal/","131 products in account","I wanted to enjoy SMNC back when it actually had people. I couldn't though for the same reasons that's driving new players away today.\n\nThere are two reasons. The first being the complete lack of matchmaking via skill/experience. This should have been priority for an MOBA where extreme teamwork is important. Match the players who were new with the other players who were new and the more experienced against the more experienced! This should have just been common sense. Uber did not make this a priority and SMNC lost a lot of the players who would have been really interested in this game when it first came on steam.\n\nThe other reason I stopped playing was because of the pile of dogshit this game calls a community and the fact that I hear it's gotten worse as the game dwindled down to a small one tells me that the absolute death of SMNC is imminent.\n\nYou would think that the small veteran community nowadays would band together, grow up, and attempt to build the playerbase by ACTUALLY BEING PLEASENT TO PLAY WITH, but no. Let's all be a bunch of angry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and dig the hole a bit deeper with every single match until there is literally no one who wants to play this game.\n\nThe terrible matchmaking early on wasn't enough to make me stop playing, but the horrible attitudes of the community along with it was enough to make me uninstall. So congrats there, veteran community. You keep driving away any chance of this game making a comeback because you can't stop being ♥♥♥♥♥ to the new players (and eachother) who might have actually enjoyed this game all because you want to, "win".\n\nWell congrats! "Your winner"! What's the prize? AN EMPTY GAME TO GO WITH YOUR INFERIORITY COMPLEX!\n\n+1 for getting the Big Rigs reference.","October 9, 2014","false","10.7"," 350 of 414 people (85%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","85","350","414","44","17"

Yes it is true, the community is mostly dead and those who are still here are way better than you are. Play it anyway. I'll explain why, and then I will explain how.\nWhy should you play SMNC even though it has no population and you will get spanked:\nThe SuperCrossfire mode came out in spring of 2012 and there is still nothing like it. SuperCrossfire is intense, and will make you incredibly angry, but it is the most satisfying game I have ever player. Don't play SuperCrossfire, PLAY TURBOCROSS. When you see these reviews saying that they can't get into matches, or get into them infrequently, they are talking about SuperCrossfire which requires a full team before the match begins. In a perfect world, we could play that mode, but the world sucks so we have to play TurboCross.\nEven though TurboCross is watered down SuperCrossfire, it still has no equivalent. Believe me, if I could find a third-person shooter MOBA with jumping, dodging, grapples, and class-synergy, then I would be playing it instead (assuming that more people played it). Here is the low-down, Uber spent millions on this game and it shows. Unfortunately, they didn't make money from it so it has been abandoned. But again, there just isn't anything like it and what it does is amazing.\nThe basic idea is that you and your team are supposed to help your bots advance in two lanes in order to take down the shields of enemy turrets and eventually take down the money-ball. There are two lanes, so even though you may be pushing one really hard, you have to worry about how the other is doing. All of the maps are symetrical. Now, a lot of players just don't understand how important it is to kill bots. Killing bots is the most effective method of winning the game. Of course the other team will try to kill you while you do it, and you don't want that to happen. Why don't you want that to happen? because while you are dead, you kill less bots. Kill bots, push your lane, take out their turrets once the shield is down, do the same to the money ball. If you see that the other lane is having the same done to it by the other team, switch lanes and push it back to atleast the middle.\nOh I forgot to explain why this is fun. It's amazing. When you and 1-3 other teammates are pushing a lane together and you make progress even though the other team is trying to kill you, you feel like you are making something happen. This is a different feeling than coming in first in a race or having a high kill-to-death ratio. Pushing a lane is slow and must me sustained. When I die, I worry about how far back my lane is going to get pushed and whether or not we will be able to push it back to where it was. It's different than k/d, it just is.\nOther third-person shooters just don't offer this.\n\nHow to play with a low population:\nPlay a Pickup game of Turbocross on the North American server after 5pm EST preferably on the weekend. Yes, I know that this is limiting, but it's what you have to do to play this game that no one else has made yet and is ahead of its time.\nIt will take maybe 10 minutes to find your first game, but after that you are in rhythm, so most of the players of your last game will show up for the next. You will see the same names on different days, there are not many of us. Be nice because you will see them again. They will not be nice to you, I am sorry. Stay near your team and kill-bots. Stay on one lane until you know the maps. Eventually you should ask someone what the annihilator is. Good luck.\nIf people knew what this game was like, there would be a lot of people playing it, but it looks like Team Fortress 2 and when it don't play in a similar way, folks think it is a bad game. SMNC has major flaws, but there just isn't anything like it and what it does is valuable.","February 14, 2015","true","413.7"," 118 of 128 people (92%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","92","118","128","13","9"

(Heros) all of them bring unquie styles of gameplay, like the quick moving Assassin, to the grapple monster Veteran, to the beatboxing Robo Hobo, to the charging Tank, to the bot pushing Leo and a lot more!\n\nLike I mentioned, this game is one of a kind, a 3rd person shooter MOBA with lots of bots you can spawn, like Fuji bots, Bouncers and the Jackbot.\n\nThe commentators are some of the best in gaming, both feel genuine and are so much fun to listen to, I never get tired of thier lines, despite listening to them over a thousand times.\n\nA lot of music! From hawaiian music, rock and roll, digital music, banjos and a lot more!\n\nMascots who give you bonus items! Like Bullseye gives you money, churros and Bacon! Juicebot who gives you fruit which fills up your juice meter! And Chicky Cantor who gives you a huge boost when you defeat him.\n\nYou can get some free items and boosters! You can connect your Facebook profile to SMNC and get a free assault kit! Which includes the FIreball set, 2 taunts and I think a booster too! There's also a guide which gives codes for boosters too!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=261880839\n\nUnquie looking maps!\n\nHas a unquie sporty feel that no other game has created so far.\n\nVoice acting is really good and the personality of the characters are great! (Except Gunslinger who is boring and Combat Girl who is just a Sterotype and boobs)\n\nCons:\n\nThe low population  (Like I mentioned) and the only gamemodes you will be able to play is Turbocross and Blitz, Supercross is 100% dead, you have a higher chance to win the lottery then to find a Supercross match, Blitz is also hard to find matches, speak with players in the chat and see if they want to play, also the most common players you will come across play this game a lot and stomp games over and over, or new players who have no clue what to do... speaking of which...\n\nVery steep learning curve, this game is hard to learn due to the lack of a good tutorial, there is one called Training Camp, but you don't learn anything major, like Products, Endorsments, which pros are more deadly or HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KILL BOTS!\n\n(Judging by Turbocross since Super is dead) The balance is all over the place, all the heros (Except Leo and the Veteran) have something OP in them, from Gunner's rocket, Tank's Grenades and charges, Karl's burst, Gunslinger's r*t*rded DPS, Support's Airstrikes, Combat Girl's and Megabeth's.... EVERYTHING! There is at least one OP thing about most Pros, and you will notice them quickly.\n\nDo not buy any items, you can unbox most of them thanks to a glitch, if you use a key on a chest/crate/treasure ball, the key doesn't disappear, meaning you can get thousands of rare items.\n\nThe community is bad, mostly filled with as*h*les who complain and b**ch about everything, there are nice people, like when I came back to this game, a friend gave me some items! Thanks again!\n\nSmall amount of maps, there's Gun Mountain, Loco Moco, Bullet Gorge, Downtown Spunky, Grenade Arena (My fav,) the Training Camp, and the Blitz map, the normal maps have tons of exploits of them, like Downtown Spunky Megabeth can rocket jump onto a building and attack all the turrets below, Loco Moco's mid can be spammed by Sniper pros and Supports, you can attack the money ball UNDER the map with Assault on Grenade Arena and more. Plus Gun Mountain is the worst map in the game, for $750 you can activate Shelly, aka clear a lane with no effort.\n\nThe Devs are very shady, while they said they cannot update this game due to the lack of funding, they went on to kickstarter and got their next game funded called Planetary Annihilation, during 2014 they attempted to fund another game called Human Resources, however Planetary Annihilation wasn't close to being finished as it was missing promises from the Kickstarter, which was one of the biggest reasons why Human Resources fell, addtionally they ditched the orignal MNC IN THE SAME YEAR IT WAS RELEASED ON STEAM FOR THIS GAME! As of right now they have pretty much been silent with MNC franchise, just a word of warning when you buy some of their products as they aren't trustworthee, sorry Uber but you lost A LOT of trust with A LOT of customers.\n\nOverall this game is one of a kind, lots of upsides and downsides, and I can understand why you don't enjoy this, but give this game a chance, hard to learn, but a lot of fun in the end.\n\nIf you want to see the current population check the link below.\nhttp://steamcharts.com/app/104700","June 15, 2015","true","717.2"," 134 of 153 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","134","153","10","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/estro2/recommended/104700/","estro2","Estro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/estro2/","459 products in account","Its dead jim, but seriously it was good at one point then the devs decided not to update the game anymore.\n\nThe Good\n1. Maps are pretty good and well designed (with supercross in mind)\n2. Character balance for the most part is alright\n3. Good skill ceiling\n\nThe Bad\n1. Small playerbase that is divided by 3 seperate game modes (try dividing 50 players into supercross, turbocross, and blitz)\n2. Supercross thier bread and butter of the game is dead. Why is this bad you may ask, its because all of the maps, characters, and even products are balanced around this gamemode. (hell even the bots are balanaced for supercross)\n3. The team comp in higher level play will allways have a assault simply because he deals high damage from a far range, can chase and the sky is the limit for him. His jetpack recharges rediculously fast and it can be angled to go higher then intended by  charging into ramps or by granade jumping. Using the jetpack has no set backs for assault, no aiming penalty like in the first game. TL;DR Assault is OP.\n4. Massive Air is still a broken product that they haven't fixed even though it was reported months ago. To put it simply it turns a bad player into a mediocoure one, by speeding them up (which was unintended) and making them harder to grapple (another unintended side effect). To people that don't know what Massive Air is its one of the products in the game that was only intended to give you better jump control.\n5. While I'm on the subject of products most of the products in the game are useless. A product to the people that never played this game are passives which activate on certian conditions and even only activate on certain levels. (example parting gift, it activates from level 1 and on and only activates on your death, it heals your team for 350 health and scales with the teamates level) You will only see the products money magnet, juicy spunky, and over armor being used in this game in higher level play or Massive Air for the above reason. Any other product is seldomly used.\n6. If you took a look at the chowder (beta builds for SMNC) forums, the devs never really listioned to the people who were trying to balance the game, they instead opted to make more characters and more gamemodes instead of fixing the pressing problems in the game which I listed some above. (also one of the devs got wrecked in a beta scrim and opted to nerf veteren out of spite and not game balance)\n7. The community has divided into two parts, super try hards and people who just wanna have fun, the sad part is the latter part of the community for the most part is dying off or going to other games. Really don't bother unless your are decient at the game which can only happen if you managed to play it before supercross died off for good.\n8. This is probiblly the killer of the game but doesnt apply anymore since the ques for supercross are dead but still could bring to light why supercross is dead. At level 0-20 when you first get the game you are put into ques with people of your own skill level (aka a newbie camp) so you dont have to worry about vets stomping you. The moment you reached level 21 you are put into the general que and many many people would get stomped, causing them to quit the game because they weren't ready.\n9. The in game voice chat is dead, and has been dead for over a year now. (stopped working Novemember 2012) The devs still didn't fix this issue.\n10. The game hasn't been patched for almost a year from me writing this review even though they got a volunteer to fix the bugs in the game (apperently they messed up the coding really really really badly in unreal 3) said bug fixes from the volunteer never got into SMNC, and the only person who was working on the bug fixes got reassigned to work on thier other game Planetary Anhilation.\n11. The free character roster has been the same 6 characters for 9 months from me writing this review, the rouster is supposed to change weekly to let people try out the 18 characters before they buy them.\n\nAll in all DON'T PLAY THIS GAME UNTILL UBER FIXES IT (which sadly will be never).","December 26, 2013","false","077.4"," 203 of 249 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","203","249","0","2"

I bought Monday Night Combat a few months before Super MNC was released, and enjoyed a few hours of it but never got into it addictively. When Super MNC came out I was all over it. It was free2play, had a lot more options, characters, and got quite a bit of hype from a tie-in with Team Fortress 2 and one of the first games to incorporate Steam trading. It had a multitude of modes, a competitive but somewhat friendly community, and there were little to no problems besides a few occasional glitches to ruin the experience.\n\nThen the devs/publishers threw the community under the bus. They insisted while they were working on Planetary Annihilation that they'd continue support for this game, even if it meant just minor updates/champ rotation/fixes. But they outright lied, and never officially announced abandoning the game and left the cash shop open. The matchmaking is completely broken, there's some BS number in-game that states how many players are on, and the community is just a few random vets with complete newbies who have no idea the game is dead, with a huge gap of experience/character upgrades between these two groups.\n\nUber is by no means a helpless small indie developer that doesn't have the resources to continue support for this game. Uber received over 2 million US dollars in Kickstarter money (with a project goal of 900k) for their new game, Planetary Annihilation, which has turned out into a slight disappointment in my opinion; although a few people in the Steam User Forums will insist the game's poor performance and their promise of offline -play is only because "they [Uber Entertainment] just needs more money/time". After receiving this large sum of money, Uber also charged $90 for alpha access to those who did not donate to their Kickstarter, and $50 for beta, all the while keeping silent on Super MNC and continuing to let it rot. This gives you an idea of Uber's recent shortcomings although you're free to look into them yourself and come to your own conclusions.\n\nAnother recent Super MNC reccomendation writer stated that Uber has stated on their forums they have interest in reviving this game if "given the chance", but they've had plenty and I hope these are not empty words. I'd love to continue to convert friends back to this game, even if Uber didn't do content updates but fixed matchmaking and updated Pro rotation.","October 6, 2014","false","40.7"," 152 of 192 people (79%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","79","152","192","11","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apockyTawok/recommended/104700/","apockyTawok","a_drunk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apockyTawok/","268 products in account","At this point in time, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.\n\nFor starters, it has been abandoned by the creators.  The game revolves around a set of classes, or "pros".  Back in its heyday, the pros would be a free rotation, where 5-6 of them were free, a few of them were on sale, and the others were full price.  Since it was abandoned, the free pros haven't rotated at all.  This leaves you backed into a corner of hoping you enjoy one of the free pros, or spending money on a pro you have no idea you'll like.  Not that I recommend you even get that far.\n\nSecondly, the community is completely cannibalistic.  In higher population games, this isn't a problem.  This genre in particular (MOBAs), has quite an inclination to rage fits, ♥♥♥♥ talking, and general immaturity even more-so than you'll experience in Call of Duty.  Again, in higher populated communities, this isn't a big deal, you'll just move on to another game and have less than a .01% chance of running into the same jackass twice.  Well, SMNC has less than 200 active at peak times, and all the people playing this game are a rotating cast of alphas, betas, and pro players.  So if you like getting your ♥♥♥ kicked by the same pub stomp team over and over again, dive in!\n\nThe chief game mode this was designed around doesn't even function anymore, due to low population/lack of interest from alpha/beta/pro players.  They would rather instant-gib you on the more deathmatch like "Turbocross" game mode.  There's a sick sense of enjoyment they get from stomping the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of new players, regardless of the fact that this drives them away within an hour of play.  If you don't believe me, sit in on them while they converse on mumble, or spend a few minutes on the Uberent forums.\n\nSo, if you like getting stomped, an impossible learning curve, horrendous population/matchmaking, and no further development from the company, this game is for you.  In its prime, SMNC was unique, fun, and had an awesome community to be a part of.  Calling it a shadow of it's former self would be an understatement.  A year or two ago, this game was a 5/5.  Now, it's a 1/5.\n\nTawok\nwww.GuildLeaders.com","January 3, 2014","false","103.8"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","60","68","0","0"

It's a huge shame Uber has a habit of making games and never fleshing them out. This could have been an extremely popular game if they didn't abandon it. While "MOBAs" are not for everyone, this one combines FPS elements into the core game. This makes for the best FPS/MOBA on the market in my opinion.

The source code has been given to someone outside the company who is not being paid for his work and therefore content patches are nearly non-existent. On top of this, there are still numerous issues within the game and the fact that the community is also nearly non-existent does not help; SMNC was quite popular at one point, but now since the dev's don't care and are working on another game (namely Planetary Annihilation) many players have obviously left for greener pastures, myself included.

The problem is not that the balancing is broken or the lack of players. The problem is the community! It is just toxic, you will hardly ever find a person that is not toxic. I even know a few people that had a worse life because of this game. I don't know if this is a coincidence or the community's fault. It is still interesting never the less. If those parts do not bother you, here is a review for the actual gameplay!\n\nGameplay:Super MNC is a Moba + tower defense + Third person shooter and like most mobas a Free2Play game which is NOT Pay2Win. It still has some problems that could might be considered as Play2Win, since you need like 50 hrs to unlock most characters and some chars are seriously overpowered, like the gunner. Also you will get a slight advantage if you have been playing this game for hundreds of hours and be getting a permanent stat boost and the only real thing you can buy are cosmetics.

I've given it a shot 3 times and really, it just failed to capture my interest like TF2 did. Its got quirky characters, a good art style and fun weapons, its just I'd rather be playing TF2. Like a MOBA game, there are bots on each map that allow you to level up your character so you can actually have a level advantage over other players on the map. So basically attack bots and avoid players until you get a level advantage to take out players all while collecting experience. Its a good system, it just made me want to play TF2. There is a lot of player customization too, which is nice, but eh.\n\nWhile I have only played 15 or so hours, I felt that spawn killing was far too common, because so many new fresh players come to Super MNC hoping to get TF2 hats that they don't understand how to play. A skilled player can just dominate an entire map and one player can overpower an entire team. The tutorial was pretty bad and I didn't really still didn't understand the game upon my 3rd time playing it. I feel a lot of people must not understand it, because there are players asking what they do or why the other 'players' are so dumb they walk into shots fired, when they don't understand the 'players' are bots, not actual humans.\n\nReally, just get your TF2 hats and get out or don't bother playing this game. TF2 is a superior game, but if you understand MOBAs and love 3rd person shooters.

In fact, the only reason (granted, quite a major reason) that I'm not giving it a thumbs-up is that it's essentially dead. Its developers have adandoned the project entirely, and the last time new content was added was about 3 years ago. That means that almost nobody's on, and the few that are tend to be salty tryhards that are too stubborn to admit the game is long dead. Valve, while not necessarily taking into consideration the desires of the community, constantly updates TF2, and for that reason it's more fun overall.

Just one important thing:\nDO NOT START SUPER CROSSFIRE GAME MODE.\nBecause of the small playerbase it will take forever to get a match at Super Crossfire. Just play TURBOCROSS.

They each have their own skills and pros and cons. You can upgrade your skills, as well as your offensive (more damage, etc.) and defensive (more speed, etc.) (for the match being) in the heat of battle. There's a mascot that contantly runs around dropping money (which can be used to buy powerups in battle) and health items, and juice. Get enough juice, you become overpowered for a short time.

The gameplay mainly centers around killing bots on a lane to escort your bots to turrets and eventually the opposite team's moneyball. Fairly straightforward, but it takes a few rounds to learn how things work. A lot of playable characters so there's sure to be someone who fits your playstyle, and they're adding more all the time.\n\nIf you feel like trying something new, this is for you.

Maybe you can it also describe as a Moba. The aim is to destroy all robots of the other teams. For that you can built-up turret and uplevel them. Your character is important, too. You can choose Assassin, Supporters, Strikers or Assault. Many things in this game are fancy like gorillas as chars or to kill a chicken or the juicy boy. Guess that should be funny.But for Newbies it's a lot of distraction from the main game concept.\n\nThe easiest mode is Blitz with 5 players destroying waves of robots. After round 20 it's getting nasty. Here can only the Pros survive. You'll gain a lot of XP here.\nThe other mode is Crossstrike where 1vs1 to max 5vs5 can play. you have to check everytime the map and support your robot armys on their way to the other team's core. That makes fun.\nBut for some reason you will get in this mode only about 10% XP of Blitz mode.\n\nThat wouldn't be neccessary to explain, if you don't need the XP to equip you char with better endorsements. And though the game is F2P you can buy XP for real money 6500XP = $3. The prices are annoying. For a complete outfit you can pay $15.\n\nYou should test it once and try to reach all achievements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thunderpizza/recommended/104700/","Thunderpizza","Thunderpizza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thunderpizza/","46 products in account","The Monday Night Combat series consists of two 3rd person mobas.\n\nIf you need a refresher on what a 3rd person moba is, then go take a look at Smite.\nSmite is directly competing against other, big name mobas such as DOTA2 and League of Legends.\nWhat makes it special is the third person perspective.\n\nSuper MNC brings a LOT to the moba table, but at the same time, leaves you with so little...\n\nWhile other mobas are all stuck in a self-perpetuating cyclone centering around the high fantasy artstyle, Monday Night Combat is sports themed. Thats right, kids. Sports. They even have commentators and sponsorships\n\nThe world of MNC is robust with many sound assets and nice, shiny icons. However, after a week or so of playing, its easy for any gamer to distinguish a clear lack of content.\n\nThe "Pros" (otherwise known as "Heroes" or "Champions" in other mobas) all have their own unique abilities, weapons and roles making teamplay a very interesting and engaging experience. Fighting 5v5 alongside an army of lesser warriors to achieve a common, territorrial goal. Just like any other moba.\n\nThe big difference that you will see after prolonged play in Super MNC, is the clear lack of pros. Big name mobas will release new characters once a month, on average. These competitors also sport enormous rosters, all tweaked for balance. Though I will argue MNC is balanced to some degree, there is no customization outside picking from a pool of limited characters. The downfall of this game is a clear lack of community involvement in light of the limited roster.\n\nUber went into this with the best intentions, and for a while it was good. However, the moba genre takes an incredible amount of maintenance to keep things fresh. Especially in a market so competitive.\n\nIf you liked this game, or want to see what a 3rd person moba can do, check out Smite. Otherwise hope on DOTA2.\n\nThis game will always hold a special place in my heart. I bought the original, I played with friends. I made new friends. I laughed at many of the voices, and many of the gags in this game will always bring back warm feelings. The sad fact of the matter is that mobas cannot stand the test of time. When we look at it, every multiplayer game will eventually reach its demise.\n\nFarewell.","February 2, 2014","false","27.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The Sharpshooters are the ones you CANNOT be good with off the bat like Artemis, Gunslinger, and the Sniper. The enforcers are the big guys of the group like creston the badass monkey, Gunner, Robo Hobo, Tank, and Veteran. The Commandos a random group of random people like assassin, Captain spark, and don't forget wascot. And the other group of random people, assault, karl, megabeth. And last but certainly not least, the Defenders the group you have to have or someone will get mad if you don't is combat girl, Leo, and support.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrDementile/recommended/104700/","DrDementile","DrDementile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrDementile/","90 products in account","Pros:\n- Brilliant concept. The game presents itself as a future sport like The Running Man or Rollerball, leaning heavily towards the aesthetic of Smash TV.\n- Beautiful game in every way. A bit light on art assets, but what's there is gorgeous to look at and listen to.\n- Compelling Gameplay. The 3PS/DotA mix works much better here than the original Monday Night Combat. Metagame and strategy are equally important to shooter skills and teamwork.\n\nBalance: (not really a pro or a con)\n- The game is "fun". It's not really set up for competitive play. There are lots of random elements, such as bacon drops. Damage is slightly randomized. For most things this can be forgiven, but when your Jackbots can spit Bacon right into the enemy base, things get extremely crazy.\n- The cash shop. This is why the game is free to play, and also why the game never made money. The ecomony, while robust on paper, is infinitely exploitable via Steam Trading. The game needs to retain players to sustain the cash flow and - for the reasons listed below - that never happened.\n- Super Blitz mode is a decent way to farm Combat Credits and work on your PvE skills, but it will MELT YOUR FACE. It's impossible to win by design. The "goal" is to keep your Moneyball alive for as many waves as you can. You will fail eventually. You can buy tokens to repair your Moneyball and turrets during the round, but that's sort of cheating.\n\nCons:\n- Matchmaking is completely broken. There is no "ranked queue". Everybody above level 20 gets thrown into one gigantic free-for-all and it sucks for new players. Newbs don't have flexible product loadouts or any endorsements (runes) worth mentioning. Combined with being generally unskilled at either the shooter or DotA elements or (god help you) both, newbs consistently get rekt every game until they can scrape together a decent understanding of the game mechanics and unlock most of the pros and products.\n- The Practice Game mode doesn't work. At all.\n- The tutorial is terrible, to the point of being arguably non-existent. The Training Camp is essentially a museum that showcases the various gameplay-related objects and lets you practice interacting with them to an extent. The ability to practice against Jackbots and Chickey Cantor in nice, but there isn't any particularly useful information to be found here, apart from what everything looks like and what each thing supposedly does.\n\nWhat I would suggest after touring the Training Camp is running a few solo Custom Games so you can at least figure out how lane bots spawn and why killing them is important. Then close SMNC and watch a few gameplay videos. Perhaps uninstall entirely. Your call, really.\n\nTurbocross is the only mode with decent queue times at the moment, and that's due to the drop-in/drop-out nature of the mode. Turbocross is rebalanced to play like old MNC, minimizing the importance of the DotA elements. If you're REALLY DESPERATE for Overwatch, you might enjoy killing time here.","January 19, 2015","false","478.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Matchmaking is the only real way of playing, but the problem with it is that you are pretty much guaranteed to wind up against people far out of your league and paired with new players who are just as confused as you are. You should learn to play with friends.

It was comedic, interesting (I had no idea what a MOBA was at the time) and just fun.\nThen it died. Nobody plays anymore, hitting about 150 at peak play times. Try dividing those into 3 different game modes. The classes (Or "Pros", as they're called in-game) are varied to a degree, enough to make them different, while fitting into the same basic archetypes. They were pretty interesting as characters aswell, such as a Superhero, a stereotypical gamer, a gorilla in a tux, Leonardo Da Vinci's clone, things of that sort. They used to switch every week, letting you play as 9 of the 18 or so classes, and you were able to buy the ones you liked enough to keep playing as with real money. The current pros haven't changed in at least 6 months because Uber doesn't care about the game anymore.\n\nThere's customization abound, with each Pro having a good 9 or so weapons, and enough costumes to keep you looking different from the rest, if you're willing to spend the large amounts of money to buy them. This game was very, very Pay to Win, no weaponry aside from the standards could be used for free, but you could enjoy yourself none-the-less when you were losing.\n\nThe camera was a little wonky and the gunplay wasn't the best, but it was a good game when it came out.\n\nAs said, I really, really liked my time with the game. So why am I giving it a Not Reccomend? Because nobody cares anymore, that's why. How do you play a multi-player only game with no community? How do you try every Pro when the Developers don't think about switching them anymore?

The mountin of issues of this game didnt phase us, we wanted to see more, and we couldnt wait to see it improve.\n\nThe developers Failed us and many others on a hardcore level that can only be rivaled by the likes of duke nukem and half life 3. i come back after some time and check the reviews and i find out that the game has been forgotton all about in favor for a game that in early access cost £60. That bieng the case, Super monday night combat now has broken ingame chat from what i read, inaccessability to modes that require que's. and has not recieved any new content or updates for too long.\n\nThe game's fans have been ignored, let down, and forgotton about, a game that had potential to soar with popularity, earn the developers bucket loads of bucks, and grant its fans hours upon hours of mindless and intense fun.

Guns, blood, guns, chicks, more guns, weird red-headed (literally) dude who talks about weird ♥♥♥♥, and of course more guns. Seems fun right? Only if you have high-processor, a gaming computer, and a something that will act as a blocker for anything off-screen that will slow your game. WHAT WAS THAT? SLOW? GAME? Yeah, it lags alot for most computers, and you usually have to adjust the options to the lower degrees and turn off optionable mechanics, which pretty ruins the game's look. It looks cool, what with all the tron-like outfits, space marine suits, and the colors available. The voices.........are ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Some things are just random, though i can't say that's a complaint since it's heard in tf2 and borderlands 1 & 2 yet is very entertaining and likeable. But some of the things are just eeeeeeuuuuuuggggghhhhhhh. I don't want to really get into that. The music isn't really that enjoyable either for the majority of anyone who'll play it and not many people will since there's many other multiplayer shooters that are good like TF2, HL:DM, CS, Quake. Most people would play those games (or CoD ♥♥♥♥ing-whatever-edition) and usually a online shooter that works in thirdperson doesn't usually work very well, though many games have an option to select firstperson and thirdperson. In the end due to a lot of lag issues for pretty anyone, bad voices, and low amounts of true imagination and inspiration SMNC proves to everyone that maybe we need to really tighten the hose that's spraying multitudes of online shooters like Black Friday deals, and look at the shooters of old or the shooters of the newer gaming generation(s). Hell, maybe just play other genres of games (I'm kinda referring to CoD addicts right here), or you could just go outside, or (if you're old enough) go to a strip club! Actually I don't know about thew club, it'll probably be pretty dirty in ways you wouldn't enjoy and if you broguth a black light in there? ♥♥♥♥ me running. So there you go, SMNC is not worth the option-managing and playthroughs, not unless major updates come out that add new default looks, change some things around, and improve the quality of the game. Until then, we should just sing Kumbayah.","August 10, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you are, shame on you. If you thinking about playing this game, I highly recommend it. It's a very good TPS with with many strategic elements. Each character plays a big role to win so each player as each respective character plays a role. Theres a standard death match which is pretty dead, a horde mode where you must work with a small team to take out numerous waves of enemies, (my favorite), and a Attack/Defend mode where you must take out a generator while defending your own, You can upgrade yourself and turrets, transports, (etc). This game mode is played the most by the community mainly because its the fastest way to get the in-game items you can earn and buy. The announcers are MY favorite part of the game, hearing them talk makes happy and feel like I'm at a football game when I play. (the difference between this and football? I get to kill people. Need I say more?) . But I can only recommend this game if your willing to invite friends to also play it. This game, sadly, is pretty dead. In total, around 800 people in the US are in-game. Where are the rest? Playing TF2 probably. I encourage you play with your friends so hopefully they'll tell their friends about it and so forth and so on. And hopefully they''ll be nice. One major issue that I hate about this game is that in EVERY game  I've been in, theres always someone complaining that the other team is cheating, or the team this person is on is complaining his teammates are horrible or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In TF2, I don't see it happen as much as I do in SMNC. I'd play this game more if the people playing online weren't jerks 24/7 on public chat. But that can change, MORE people need to play this game. (If your one of those people I was talking about who complains, you should be ashamed of yourself)","March 9, 2014","true","9.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Then after that, dead, they uninstall the game.

But for some reason, I kinda got bored of it and didn't feel like going back to it ever again. The idea was original (at least to my knowledge), becoming a world-wide sporting league of the future. The Characters were unique and were fun to play, and the arenas each had their own unique spin and had showed different ways to outmaneuvering, and outsmarting your opponents with Traps, Turrets, and Bots. The game was fun for a while, but it never really stuck to me, as probably what happened to most people.

This game is niche and has quite a small userbase. This isn't a brain-dead game unlike Call of Duty, no sir. Not at all. The Super Crossfire Mode really relies on teammates. If you want more action than strategy, go with Turbocross. Only when you've learned the basics of playing this game properly, and having PATIENCE, in turn, this will be a good game. Compared to other F2P microtransactions, almost any item you can get is fair game with the exception of Treasure Balls... (Which works just like... Crates in TF2). Only a very few items you can get are Treasure Ball only and cosmetics never give you stat ups. They are mainly there for looks.\n\nGive it a shot if you want to try out an adreadaline rush, shooting-MOBA hybrid.

Though I can only vouch for it's Super Blitz mode. Which pits 5 players of various player-chosen classes against hordes of robots while the announcer of Super MNC yells and cusses you out. So far I have only reached round 47, but the action is still incredibly fast and packed with bullets and explosives.\n\nA very fun play once in a while, otherwise it's very repetitive. Class customization allows you to boost your character how you want to, but not without it's side effects in the case of 'Endorsements'.\n\nI would say that if you have an interest in Team Fortress 2 or Gotham City Imposters, you should give this game a try as it's also Free-to-Play.","September 16, 2012","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Choose a Hero, join a team of 5, push creep wave's into enemies base, win game. First and foremost - this game is difficult - it's a full of FPS and if you start doing badly, by not killing enemy creeps etc, you will be lower level than enemy Hero's. And then they will eat your face. It's a game very high on teamwork. It's a game you have to sit down and give a while to learn, before it starts rewarding you with joyous victory. Stylistically, this game is one of the most lushest, comedic experiences I have come across, F2P or not. Each character is voiced differently, and the commentators who run throughout the game are both Awesome and incredibly varied. As a F2P game it should be noted that only vanity items cost any money, so feel free to give the game a go, if you feel that this is a genre you could enjoy.

In addition to competitive, there's also a cooperative game mode to change things up. I would recommend this game to people who enjoy Team Fortress 2, DOTA, League of Legends and anyone who enjoys a strategic third-person shooter. Let's revive this gem.","December 14, 2013","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monofthedead/recommended/104700/","monofthedead","Monofthedead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monofthedead/","483 products in account","One of my favorite free to play titles!\n\nDo you enjoy class based shooters like Team Fortress 2 or Tribes Ascend?\nDo you enjoy MOBAs such as DOTA 2 or Smite etc?\nIf you you said yes to either or both of those questions you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot.\n\n\nRight when you start they have an optional tutorial level where you can test out hero abilities, learn about the different AI controlled enemies (called creeps usually, bots in this case), and get a feel for the environmental weapons and events to help ease you into this hybrid style of game. Naturally a veteran of any of the previously mentioned games will want to skip over this, but you can leave the tutorial from the menu anytime so I recommend checking it out at least for the environment attacks.\n\n\nThere is also a co-op horde mode which can be used for increased training before the real deal or as an alternative to regular matchmaking should you find high wait times* or have a more PvE minded team. It lacks the strategy of defending towers or spawning creeps, but is a good way to practice shooting, coordinating team abilities, or having absent minded fun.\n\n*Wait times are currently ridiculous in the 5v5 modes due to low player count\n\n\nSuper Crossfire is the name of the game's main entree. You only have two lanes and one jungle so team fights happen often and are never far away from you. One lane usually has 2 people and the other has 3, causing one of the lanes to be constantly pushed and therefore in need of defending. Alternatively you can have a fifth man roam between the lanes seeking the enemy roamer or hiding for surprise attacks. In the middle of all the fighting and pushing, events are constantly occurring in the jungle like a free money spawning "enemy", a Roshan like boss that gives a buff on defeat, a creep wiping laser and more. This gives the game a perpetual feeling of motion and speed never allowing boredom.\n\n\nThere is another game mode which takes the premise of Super Crossfire and makes it more shooter-esque. Damage is increased, speed is increased, turret shields do NOT come back, health regen changes from DOTA-like to Halo-like, and other changes to creeps and players. This mode is great if you want a faster match or are less fond of the strategy layer.\n\n\nIn Short:\n\nPROS\n+ Great Hero Variety\n+ Multiple Maps\n+ Multiple Modes\n+ Map Events\n+ Perfect Balance of Action and Strategy\n+ Excellent Humor with Top-Notch Voice Acting\n+ Amazing Art Style and Graphics\n\nCONS\n- Long Matchmaking/No playerbase - game abandoned by devs. (The developers would like to revive it though)\n- What's left of the players are the most toxic of the community\n- No new content planned (heroes, maps, etc.) again due to abandonment\n- Matchmaking isn't separated by skill so new players can get destroyed by long time players\n\nIf you can get 4 friends to try it with you a great game is waiting to be discovered even if you stick to the horde mode. If you can find 9 friends you've eliminated virtually all of the cons to this game.\n\n9.5/10","September 23, 2014","true","100.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Why? Simply no players, miss Queue is just lost and doesn't know what is she supposed to do with these 10 people online. All games are created as custom games with no exceptions, and invitations are sent through chat.\nThere is no tutorial, just bulsh*t youtube video that says 3 words about each thing in the game, leaving you wondering about 80% things. That's how developers respect new players. Not even all controls are explained (and you can not change controls as far as I know - I played few training games and 1 multiplayer before someone finally explained me how to switch weapons, Jesus.\nRules are so complex that after watching this 7 minute video you still won't know anything. Go to Practice mode, and spend good 30 minutes running around the map clicking on green rays (about 20 of them if not more) - then tutorial voice will tell you information about different things in game. But still, even if you manage to remember all this sh*t, don't expect knowing everything about the game.\nThere are hero classes (heroes are called 'pros' here), minion types each with weaknesses and advantages, turret types, level ups and abilities (usable or toggle), different jungle mobs, super-powa self-buff, different vendor machines on map selling stats and buffs, purchasable jump pads, deploying minions, map objectives like 'annihilator' that destroys all enemies when used, items providing unique bonuses and more - I don't remember everything honestly.\nVisually game looks nice - futuristic cityscape arenas in sport style, minions looking like droids of different shapes and sizes, and characters looking slightly close to Team Fortress 2 guys but less comic. And of course cosmetic things you can buy make it even more beautiful. But.. there is no point doing so. Game is so dead you can't even try it.\nI never tried original B2P Monday Night Combat, but I'm afraid that if Super MNC is so dead than orinal is nothing but a ghost town...\nClass: III - Dead Bread\nVerdict: No\nReviewed: 1.11.2016\nApproach: Steam - PC\nTime: An Hour\nDeeds:\n1 Multiplayer Match Played (Don't laugh great achievement in such conditions)","January 11","false","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Lots of scenery & colorful things to look at, easy to spot enemies, numerous buttons to press to activate certain things that'll slightly support your team! Unique classes as well, and to be honest, there is ALOT of Team Fortress 2 in there. But hey, that doesn't matter here. The gameplay is honestly easy to manage, very smooth.\n\nDuring PVP, its easy to get caught up in a fight when you're in a lane. But as I said earlier, it is extremely easy to spot enemies, they stand out so much - Which isn't always a bad thing.\n\nGameplay Cons:\nMajor M1 Attack bug, I'm sure this is known as well. If you fire a full round and it auto-reloads, the next round you fire will be non-existant until you have at-least 5 bullets left in the chamber. No damage will be done during that time, and it even does the firing animations/muzzle flashes!\n\nHorribly unbalanced! And for all the long-time players out there, you better agree on this too; Endorsements are a thing in this game - Basically gives you anything you can imagine, Attack Speed, Reload Speed, Attack Damage, Jump Height, Reduced Damage Received, the list goes on. Meaning, if you barely started this game and you enter a PVP match against someone who has at-least 40 hours in, you will get shredded.\n\nSoundtrack:\nI do enjoy the soundtrack in this game, just like the old Monday Night Combat it kept the genre of Rock. Otherwise it wouldn't of made sense..Although there is some conga music there..\n\nVoice Acting:\nThe voice acting is good, could use some work here and there but for the most part, it's good! I grew tired of hearing the Annoucer's voice though, he's so damn annoying. If you lose a damn match, he'll jump on you for it. "OHOHOH, HAHA. I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER BECAUSE THESE GUYS..SUCK!"\n\nConclusion:\nI played this game to Level 20 for a Team Fortress 2 hat, as much as I LOVE Monday Night Combat - Super Monday Night Combat was meh.\n\n6.5/10","June 29, 2015","false","12.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

The characters and the concept of it were just perfect and i coudlnt wait till this F2p second coming was gonna be on steam.\n\nBut, sadly it just didnt get the players it needed. People right outa beta just crub stompd the poo outa the newer players and i think i left people to not wanting to come back. Sadly you couldnt fix it though, at its peak it only had around 3-4k players i think? (maybe a lil more?). You cant exactly make skill based match making with so few people imo.\n\nThen they started adding different game modes which was the beginning of the end for this game. You cant add 2 diff game modes and expect it to not cripple your player base by taking a small community and then spreading it out even more.\n\nFinally the last straw for me was when they decided to just jump ship and start on PA, completely dogging anyone who put any money into this game (i didnt spend money but boy did they get plenty of my time). They said (UBER ENT) that they wouldnt just leave this game while working on PA, they could do both. Well 2 months after they said that they gave some swan song forum post about how all their resources need to be on PA and they will go back to super monday night combat when PA is in a good place.\n\nNow im pretty sure this games about dead with prolly like 100 people playing if youre lucky (maybe 2-300), they are liars, would love for them to prove me wrong, but why would they come back to a dieing game. I bought a computer JUST to play this game, thats how much i loved it. But UBER said FU community, we got your cash, off to the next ponzi scheme/half finished game with a premium shop. For this they get a big fat NO. Not because the games not fun, but because these goofs dont deserve a good review or anyone elses money. Anything theyve made is dead.

The player base is primarily composed of hardcore players that spent hundreds of thousands of hours playing Monday Night Combat, as well as people that spend too much time playing MOBAs as well.\n\nEssentially you have a toxic envoirment for any new players; no one will "teach" you how to play and expect you to know how everything works from the get-go. The mechanics and even the controls aren't explained to you - I had to be told at least THREE DEGREES from friends that knew how to play that there was even a button to assign skill points!\n\nJust as well, there is no tutorial system whatsoever, there isn't a balance between setting players up that have barely started playing versus those who have hundreds of games under their belts, and all in all they seek to make the game less fun for newbies like me.\n\nIf this gets out of beta safely it will be a marvel.","February 16, 2012","false","2.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Dominated by trolls and made to capitalize on Team Fortresses success, the only reason i could think of playing this game for is the two team fortress hats. Rather than wasting time with monkeys in first person shooters, play team fortress. I give this absolute abomination 1/10, the meager amount of playable classes (because half these things arnt playable) and lack of humor. You'd expect that bugs wouldnt ruin it for you, but they do. this thing sucks, dont even try it. Half the time spent is waiting to enter a match, once youre in a match you rage quit 5 seconds after and then enter another match, cycle continues. The learning curve is steeper than this dumbass monkey's face and impossible to get any practice unless everyone agrees to go ewasy on you. Summary of the game: getting your face batted in by people who have learned a few tricks. If you like this game, your definition of quality is "Bug ridden piece of ♥♥♥♥, long waits, tf2 ripoff, minimal effort, minimal playable characters, stupid classes, vulogar humor, etc.."

Sadly you couldnt fix it though, at its peak it only had around 3-4k players i think? (maybe a lil more?). You cant exactly make skill based match making with so few people imo.\n\nThen they started adding different game modes which was the beginning of the end for this game. You cant add 2 diff game modes and expect it to not cripple your player base by taking a small community and then spreading it out even more.\n\nFinally the last straw for me was when they decided to just jump ship and start on PA, completely dogging anyone who put any money into this game (i didnt spend money but boy did they get plenty of my time). They said (UBER ENT) that they wouldnt just leave this game while working on PA, they could do both. Well 2 months after they said that they gave some swan song forum post about how all their resources need to be on PA and they will go back to super monday night combat when PA is in a good place.\n\nNow im pretty sure this games about dead with prolly like 100 people playing if youre lucky (maybe 2-300), they are liars, would love for them to prove me wrong, but why would they come back to a dieing game. I bought a computer JUST to play this game, thats how much i loved it. But UBER said FU community, we got your cash, off to the next ponzi scheme/half finished game with a premium shop. For this they get a big fat NO. Not because the games not fun, but because these goofs dont deserve a good review or anyone elses money. Anything theyve made is dead. Let that be your guide into wether or not you should consider planetary annialation.... UberEnt - money grabbin like its hot since 2008","January 17, 2015","false","535.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Who ♥♥♥♥ing cheats in an almost dead game? Jeez, some people... Get a life.\n\nBest MOBA ever. The objective of the game is to push your bots (minions) to the opposing team's base center (called "moneyball"), by destroying their defensive turrets (note that only bots can remove the turrets' shield). Only the bots can bring down the moneyball so you can shoot it. Killing the opposing players is good, but keep in mind it is not the objective of the game. I've seen teams with a lot of kills lose the game because they forgot to push their bots. This is not CoD ;)\n\nThis game is so fun and underrrated I could cry. Since I discovered it I cannot stop playing it. It has a good dose of humour, gameplay is very good, player base is hilarious (don't take anyone too seriously), balanced matches are very intense. Game relies a lot on teamplay, although very good players can tip the balance.\n\nSadly too few players, but usually you can find turbocross matches, although these matches can be a little too harsh for newbies sometimes, as usual players are already somewhat experienced.\n\nSome bugs appear from time to time, but nothing really annoying. Cheaters sometimes appear to ruin the match. These sad little kids with no life or skill have nothing better to do than cheat in an almost dead game. They think they're so 1337 because they can cheat. My main strategy in these cases is just leaving the match, not worth your anger. But don't confuse good players with cheaters ;)\n\nShame on Ubersoft for not caring about this game anymore.\n\nPS: if you're new please don't pick assassin, it's not a good class for beginners. Good players ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you with assassin doesn't mean you can play her as well as they do. And btw cloaking is NOT invisibility.","November 27, 2014","true","392.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Uber hasn't updated SMNC in about 3 years.\n\nIf you are interested in obtaining the Flamingo Kid and the Triclops hats in TF2, it takes approximately 224 afk games of Custom Blitz (a mode which you can play by yourself.) Just leave your computer open and start a new match every few minutes or so, and you'll be able to get them fairly quickly.\n\nOh, and the game itself it a mess. There are too many conflicting art styles with the characters and game; even the main menu music can range anywhere from smooth jazz to hard metal rock. Animations are very choppy and get stale after a while. I can't really comment on the gameplay (as I only played a very few matches with actual people,) but I can say that grapple spam is very prominent, and basically lets you stun-lock your foes to death if you time it right.\n\n3/10 Overall. So much potential, it's a shame the developers let the game go so easily.

I only played one game, and I think I'll die before I get the level 20 hat. Oh well. Basically, I have no fun playing it, and it takes 10 minutes to find a match. And when you are in game, you realize how lazy the developer is. The game looks like a bad copy of loadout. Or a Team Fortress 2 wannabe. When you are done with the game, it is one of the biggest reliefs you get in gaming as now you know you dont have to play this crap for the next minute. You get a prize with incredibly annoying music at the end of a round, and its usually something useless that you will never use. Not to mention, when I am looking through the people online, its the SAME 20 people from yesterday evening that was online. Oh, and don't even get me STARTED with the announcer. At first I thought he was the only good thing they did to this game, but later figured out I had to mute the announcers voice to prevent my ears from bleeding.\n\nFinal Summary: Puts the UNREAL engine to shame with it's lazy developers and annoying announcements. 1/10 Would NEVER play again after getting the hats.","July 12, 2014","false","3.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","8"

Where did we go so wrong?\nOh, I know where.\n\nThe game died out some time ago, which is quite aggrovating. I only played this for the free TF2 hats (glad I got the Flamingo Kid), but I also wanted a game to play for a long time. This obviously wasn't my first choice. You got people sending random game invites, which are quite understandable, because the game's become a ghost town. The skill levels are heavily imbalanced, with newbies facing off against the P2Ps and the Higher-Ups/Vets.\n\nDon't download/install this game, unless you want to be in the game of lost hopes.","May 27","false","2.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There are NO players, the game is put together more like a tf2 clone than a MOBA, and the tutorial is worse than not having on at all.\nThis sums up my experience: Wait 15 minutes for a match, then someone is global chat FINALLY responds to me, telling me people ONLY PLAY TURBOCROSS. So I queued up, got into a game, and proceded to get rekt. I asked for some helpful hints, and all I got was someone calling me a noob. Duh, 1st game.\nAside for the face that there are literally 6 people on at one point, they are very toxic. The fact that this game even has the audacity to ask for my money makes me extremely upset.

I went to download this game because it looked alright, but truth is, it is almost the worst game I have ever played. There are NO players, the game is put together more like a tf2 clone than a MOBA, and the tutorial is worse than not having on at all.\nThis sums up my experience: Wait 15 minutes for a match, then someone is global chat FINALLY responds to me, telling me people ONLY PLAY TURBOCROSS. So I queued up, got into a game, and proceded to get rekt. I asked for some helpful hints, and all I got was someone calling me a noob. Duh, 1st game.\nAside for the face that there are literally 6 people on at one point, they are very toxic. The fact that this game even has the audacity to ask for my money makes me extremely upset. I waited a half hour to download this, and played for an hour. This is time I will never get back.\nTake my word for it, this is a horrible game, and you will only waste your time. Get Dota/Smite/Lol/Strife/Heroes of the Storm instead.","April 22, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Going from something like Borderlands or Dota that has that ♥♥♥♥ on lockdown to this is a ♥♥♥♥ing headache. Expect to waste your abilities constantly as you try tro do something as simple as sprint. Which you can't do, because that would require too much work from the devs.\n\nSo, obviously while waiting in queue I did a bit of research, and it turns out that all 33 patches lost money, so the dev abandoned it. Its literally the definition of a dead game. Some poor guy tried to make patches for it himself with the sanction of Uber, he said that the problems are so extensive, they can't be fixed without an overhaul, which he isn't going to do in his spare time, because in the f2p game where they are still charging you for clothes, they can't possibly give any money to this lone guy who is obviously their biggest supporter.\n\nIts like someone had an idea to make a freemium game, and copy everything possible from Valve, down to the treasure chests and keys, and innovate as little as possible.\n\nIf you want this style of game, Sanctum is better, Dota 2 is the great satan in the room that they tried to copy some of the MOBA elements from and TF2 is right over there, and Overwatch which promises to have at least a properly scaled and logical UI instead of the trash in this game.\n\nIt really really sucks guys.

Going from something like Borderlands or Dota that has that ♥♥♥♥ on lockdown to this is a ♥♥♥♥ing headache. Expect to waste your abilities constantly as you try tro do something as simple as sprint. Which you can't do, because that would require too much work from the devs.\n\nSo, obviously while waiting in queue I did a bit of research, and it turns out that all 33 patches lost money, so the dev abandoned it. Its literally the definition of a dead game. Some poor guy tried to make patches for it himself with the sanction of Uber, he said that the problems are so extensive, they can't be fixed without an overhaul, which he isn't going to do in his spare time, because in the f2p game where they are still charging you for clothes, they can't possibly give any money to this lone guy who is obviously their biggest supporter.\n\nIts like someone had an idea to make a freemium game, and copy everything possible from Valve, down to the treasure chests and keys, and innovate as little as possible.\n\nIf you want this style of game, Sanctum is better, Dota 2 is the great satan in the room that they tried to copy some of the MOBA elements from and TF2 is right over there, and Overwatch which promises to have at least a properly scaled and logical UI instead of the trash in this game.\n\nIt really really sucks guys.

The gameplay was great, for me. The comical commentators were great to listen to while rolling around as the assassin, stabbing FACE! I love this game, absolutely love it.\n\nUnfortunately the game is dead. There are 603 people online at any given time. To be fair I rarely have a problem finding a game but there just isn't anyone on anymore.\nAlso the interface is a bit confusing. It looks pretty bad but once you get used to it, it's easy to navigate.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to people.\nCome back and play!\nThis game needs a community!!\n^_^","July 5, 2014","true","277.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For example:\n- You can grab enemies in melee range and perform a cool animation which makes them lose a chunk of HP. Sounds neat, right? While doing that, everyone can shoot the two players and the poor victim can be grabbed afterwards. There are issues with who grabs who first and in the end of the animation, the victim gets kicked forward, so he can fall into a pit & die. You can make it worse by getting a product, which sets anyone who you grapple / grapples you on fire.\n- There is a class skill in the game that spams your screen with colorful, spinning ads (from the game, not actual ones) while also covering your HP which is in the upper middle of the screen.\n- Some classes have trap skills. Those can't be destroyed by enemy team as far as I know.\n- Some of the items, skills deal either terribly little damage or way too much.\n- Some bots have pretty huge AoE attacks that throw you back. Often out of the field. Respawn time takes up to 40 seconds later in the game.\n\n* The game is a bit dead.","October 5, 2014","false","7.6"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","3"

No chance of winning unless you've been playing for a long time.\n\nHigh levels have tons of extra advantages and do nothing but steam roll everyone. Your damage is like 4 hp per shot while their damage is like 1/3 of your health. Even when you play safe, you have no chance of even getting a kill while you can't even leave your spawn.\n\nThe shooting is no better than mediocre and the MOBA elements do not satisfy anyone.\n\nI thought this game being broken and unbalanced were just beta problems, but even now the game is horrendous.\n\n0/100","November 27, 2013","false","2.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","1"
