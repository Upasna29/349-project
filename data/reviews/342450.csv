"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/342450/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","Sword Daughter is a visual novel adaptation of the 1980's Choose Your Own Adventure-style game book in the "Dragon Roads" series by Rhondi Vilott.  As such, the writing and story direction is very similar to what one might expect from classic entries in the genre.  Unfortunately, the game has received somewhat of a bad reputation due to its lack of depth and shallow characters, but a fully fleshed out visual novel with intricate plotting and rounded characters isn't what the game is supposed to be.  For those who've spent countless hours as a child discovering your love for reading while devouring Choose Your Own Adventure books faster than your parents could buy them, you'll find Sword Daughter to be quite familiar.  The style hearkens back to these old stories with treasure, tragedy and monsters behind every page and the path to adventure entirely up to you.  Anyone expecting more of the game is going to be sorely disappointed.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=396100500\nYou take on the role of Tyrna, a young woman trained and raised by her father as a sword daughter.  Competing in the Warrior Games was all she ever dreamed of, that is until everything forever changes when a group of raiding orcs ambushes her caravan and takes her companions prisoner.  With a mysterious elf by her side, will she seek vengeance, truth or love in this exciting adventure?\n\nAlthough the story has elements that place it in the otome category, I do not feel it's a very good example of the genre.  Aside from one dimensional characters with barely any development at all, the romance has absolutely no build up and comes completely out of left field.  Oftentimes one of the characters will start talking about love and being "more than friends" when they've barely known each other a few hours.  This can be off putting and uncomfortable (not to mention kind of creepy), but if you can get past the love-at-first-sight awkwardness, it's bearable.  I enjoyed some of Tyrna's inner monologue as she works through strange new feelings at being accompanied by not only a man but a beautiful elf ranger, and there are a few lines of steamy yet innocent writing that will tease mild feels.  However, if you're expecting an amazing love story, this probably isn't the right place for you.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392115564\nThat said, while there is nothing here we haven't seen before, the setting and world building is really well done.  Although each route is rather short with a few of the endings popping before you've barely begun, it takes playing through the 3 main story branches and 22 endings to grasp the full scope of the overall plot.  Every character, object and location has a history,  and even though we don't get to read about it here, you know it's there because the small details given them hint at something more.  It's this attention to detail that gives fictional worlds life.  The lore behind the story is fascinating.  Granted, your standard fantasy tropes are all present, but the interesting twists on old ideas are refreshing.  I only wish we were able to further explore the back stories of the villains who were more compelling than the heroine and her companion.\n\nSword Daughter's presentation is phenomenal and possibly worth the price of the game alone.  There is real talent behind the images that accompany this story, and to express in meager words how beautiful the artwork is does a disservice to the artists, but try I must.  The hand painted character images and CG's have a slight impressionistic feel to them which conveys a story-book like quality to the game.  However, it's the breathtaking backgrounds that steal the show with their detail, subtleties and emotion.  Some of these images could serve as hanged canvases on their own!  The soundtrack is high quality as well, with some lovely ethnic-inspired selections that help transport the reader to a far away world filled with magic and dragons.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409513393\nAlthough short (4 hours to complete all endings, and I'm a slow reader), this Choose Your Own Adventure story is worth it, especially for the price. You're not going to find a better representation of the genre in visual novel format.  I just hope the game sells well enough to allow for more adaptations in the Dragon Roads series, but only time will tell.  It's definitely worth a look if you're able to appreciate it for what it is and not for what many critics expect it to be.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for those who appreciate classic "Choose Your Own Adventure" style writing as well as anyone who enjoys beautiful fantasy artwork.","March 22, 2015","true","4.6"," 127 of 134 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","127","134","3","13"

Read at your own risk.\n\nAt first, I would've said I wanted there to be an "ehh" option between the "Yes" and the "No" options. Then the elf shook the mc until her (already bruised) head shook back and forth, stopped when she involuntarily teared up, and asked her to trust him.\n\nClassic abuse 101 srsly game WHY.\n\nIn a game that promises me the role of a female warrior, I was sorely disappointed. The protagonist takes on a supporting role--even though she's known the main companion for all of 24 hours, at most. She's also been trained as a fighter, but she rarely gets to use her abilities. The men in the game a) assume she must be protected, as she is female; b) brainwash her with spells, and c) drug her.\n\nSorry, spoilers. I'll put a warning at the top.\n\nI would've been ok with this game, because it's very pretty and I don't mind dating sims--which, btw, is basically what this is. Did NOT expect that. As I said, I expected to be a warrior. Instead, I got something that I can complete in two hours, where the only decisions are slight variations on one path.\n\nNot what I was expecting, at all--the description made things sound like I could conquer a kingdom during my life-long quest.  (Spoiler alert: you can't.)\n\nI've chosen almost everything at this point and only unlocked around 15 routes. Certain choices will just loop back to a route you've taken before, and unless you want to restart from a previous save you're not going to accomplish anything by playing it over again. There don't seem to be any additional options once you hit familiar dialogue.\n\ntl;dr: not worth it. Also romanticizes a guy who wants you to be a good girl and stay at home in the kitchen. That's not even an exaggeration and I /wish/ I were joking.\n\nMan.

This game is SHORT. First playthrough took me about 35 minutes. I've played 10 of the endings and some are shorter than that, but none are longer. (My gameplay time is off, I've played a good 2 hours into it.) For me, its not much of a game if it doesn't last me a solid hour. Afterall, I did pay the same as a movie ticket--so in my opinion I should get at least an hour of play.\n-Too absurd, and not terribly amusing. The plot moves way too fast and relationships happen in a matter of what? 10 sentences? I can forigve bad and implausivble writting if I still get something out of it though--like humor.

Allowing me to pick another option upon death right away is great. But the "section map" that lets me jump straight into a scene AND keeps track of the choices I made is pure genius. I wished Choice of Games or others would adapt this. Makes exploring different story branches real fun while keeping the paperwork on my end down to zero. This also makes it the first stop / must play for people that are new to the whole interactive fiction / digital gamebooks thing, just because it is SO practical to navigate and devoid of any tedium of replaying / clicking a ton that other digi-gamebooks have.\n\nReally well done and close to perfection as far as I am concerned.","July 30, 2015","true","0.5"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

Backtracking in the story to reach all the endings is made easy with 12 seperate save slots and a skip feature that will let you quickly pass over bits of the story that you have already read.\n\nMy only real complaint of the game has to do with some of the sound effects. The horse souds like a pig, sword fights sound like a guy banging two spoons together and several other odd effects distract from the game, though most are not too bad. But seperate audio sliders for the music and sound effects do solve  this problem nicely.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Choose Your Own Adventure books you will enjoy this game.","February 14, 2015","true","4.0"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","32","40","2","0"

Had it started this way I doubt there would have been so many comments/complaints about character development and short storylines.  Truthfully what fairy tale really does have in-depth character development or that much of a plot?\n\nStoryline: Tyrna, a young woman (a maiden) has been trained by her father all her life to be a warrior.  On the way to the Warrior Games (a tournament to basically earn the right to be called a warrior) the caravan is attacked by orcs.  She is knocked unconscious fighting orcs and because of this is the only remaining survivor of the massacre her father dies in.  Gavin, a half-elf/half-human ranger (on patrol) comes upon the carnage and revives her before the orcs return or wild animals find her.  Of course it is love at first sight, what fairy tale does not have love at first sight.  The adventure and mild romance (mostly of the happily ever type) begins here.\n\nVisually adapted story, though I would say illustrated would be more accurate, from an 80s Choose Your Own Adventure D&D (Dungeon and Dragon) book from the Dragon Roads series by Rhondi Vilott (Thanks Chudah for that information), this game "plays" in the same way the books "read".  Make a choice (or many choices) and follow the storyline to the end.  Unlike modern visual novels there are no "bad", "normal" or "good" endings.  There are no points to earn, algorithmic based choice lines to follow, no gimmicks to keep the reader's attention and no extra "hidden" finale ending.  There are only endings, a few that even lead to death (though most are the 'happily ever after' kind).  Each choice takes the player down a path, and through the quest based adventure of actually two people, Tyrna and Gavin.  Both have quests to fulfill and both have the will, tenacity, stubbornness, and skill to accomplish them.\n\nThe best feature of this game is Jump To A Section.  Here the player can see the endings that need to be found (as ??), and paths that have yet to be traveled (red x).  No need to make a flowchart or perpetually save the game at every question choice.  The player can click on the section and begin the adventure there at that choice, instead of all the tedium of skipping massive amounts of beginning dialogue or loading up a saved game.  There is also a feature called Controlled Skip which allows the player to skip all previous viewed dialogue and stops on new dialogue.  What a time saver that is.  Between both of those features the game plays very smoothly and very quickly.  There is even in-game achievement page called Have You Done This? with things to do like ride a dragon, become a queen or get stoned.\n\nThough many comment on how short this game is, 22 endings that do not contradict or confuse is a fair feat of tight story telling.  I highly recommend this game for its simplistic approach and fairy tale overture.","January 20","true","5.0"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

As a story, it's meh. Although the title suggests an active warrior protagonist, Tyrna spends a whole lot of time having stuff happen to her and getting rescued by the main love interest, who's actually kind of a jerk. (Particularly in the bad endings, and when Tyrna kisses him first instead of just waiting for him to make the moves on her.) The fact that Gavin tags along with Tyrna for most of the story means there's lots of dialogue, which probably made this more suited to adapting into a visual novel than a solo dungeon crawl-type game book would be; but I was still disappointed by the lack of a good romance.\n\nAs an adaptation into a visual novel, however, I think Sword Daughter is quite good. There's plenty of save slots, as well as a section map that marks the scenes you haven't read yet and lets you easily jump to them. (It took me under two hours to reach all the scenes and endings.) I don't think the music is original, but it's fitting. The art is Western fantasy instead of anime-style. It's distinctive for a visual novel, and pretty, and there's a good amount of CGs. (And I kind of want to use Gavin's portrait for my next Baldur's Gate character, because he's a nice-looking elf even if he is a dbag.)\n\nIf you like visual novels and don't mind the flawed story, I'd recommend Sword Daughter for the art alone. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing other game books adapted in a similar style.","October 9, 2015","true","2.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

Boring. Repetative dialogue (even when making different choices at key moments), dull characters (I honestly don't care at all whether we rescue the slaves, or whether the protagonist dies or not) and emotionless scenes make getting through this game a chore, which is suprising because it is so short.\n\nIf the player can't connect with the protagonist, then you have failed. The protagonist is supposed to be an extension of myself, and if I choose the option to fight, hoping that she would die so this particular storyline can finish, well that is a bad reflection on the story. Although it is not labelled as such, this is a graphic novel, and while the graphics are up to par, the story isn't; hopefully whoever created the artwork for this never collaborates with the author again and can move on to much better things.\n\nWhen the summary asked "will you be tempted by elven romance?" I presumed that meant I would get a choice in the matter, but it seems that only in the endings where you die do you actually not have to suffer through this 'romance' that the game is trying to force upon you. The creators have obviously never seen any anime; the loner type, who of course is the pretty boy elf, is supposed to be awkward and standoffish to the person he likes before eventually, EVENTUALLY, letting them in enough to see that he is a good person underneath. This doesn't happen in a matter of hours as seems apparent in this game.\n\nThe graphics are pretty, but that is the only upside.","February 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/342450/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","Sword Daughter is the latest visual novel released by Hanako Games although the story is not a Hanako Games original.  It was originally written by Rhondi Vilott, and it's representative of the 1980's "choose your own adventure" type of series.  I bring this up now to keep things in perspective.\n\nAlthough I'm giving this game a positive review, there were some aspects that did annoy me.  So I'll comment on the negative things first and then highlight the positive things.\n\nAs anyone who's read my reviews of VNs by now, story is the most important aspect for me in determining if I will end up liking a VN.  Although I do like the genre somewhat (I like some fantasy aspects although not all; I'm one of those people who isn't a LOTR fan), the writing did put me off at first.  It's rare for a story to use the second person perspective, simply because it is difficult to pull off.  But I think that the author used it to make the reader engaged more in the story.  Most of the characters are either likeable or tolerable, and I thought that the main character Tyrna was in the middle.  Now as for the potential love interest Gavin, I didn't like him from the start.  He finds Tyrna and depending on the choices that the player makes, Gavin can either be helpful or an obstacle in helping to advance the plot.  Aside from that, I really didn't like how in a lot of paths, Gavin would suddenly proclaim his love for Tyrna.  I mean, really?  No one falls in love that quickly unless they're extremely young and then I don't even think they would fall in love that fast.  Gavin annoyed me so much that I wish there was the option to punch him in the face.  That would have made me happy.  lol\n\nHowever, these are the only negative aspects I found.  So moving on to the positive aspects.  The art is extremely beautiful.  It's different from the usual art found in VNs but I think that this is fine because of the genre.  The music was great, too, and fit pretty well with the scenes.  I liked that there were 22 different endings to get and there were enough CGs to make it worth replaying for them as well as the endings.\n\nAs I am aware that Sword Daughter is the first in the "Dragon Roads" series, I do hope that the next book in the series will be adapted to a VN format.  I look forward to trying it out and have more hopefuly expectations for it.  So yeah, I'm giving this game a thumbs up because I hope to see more.","May 6, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is a great throwback to the choose-your-own-adventure book series that could end swiftly and randomly at any time during your adventure. While there are some endings I liked better than others, they can be easily seen as parts to a whole story instead of drastically different scenarios. Instead of being discouraged by my short first playthrough, I delved immediately back into the story seeking to learn more about the setting and characters with the next re-telling. The writing, art and music are all up to standard so I was a bit baffled at the uneven recommendations. As I fan of choose-your-own-adventures I implore you to make silly decisions or to rationally plot out your actions-the luck factor is half the fun!","September 18, 2015","true","4.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It is simply too short for that; the first playthrough took me about half an hour. Everything, especially relationships, happens way too fast to make any sense. There is simply not enough time to get attached to any of the characters. Speaking of which, I kinda expected Tyrna to be a fierce warrior (since the game is called "Sword Daughter" and all), but she just ends up getting saved by her elven companion most of the time. The story is a bit bland, but enjoyable overall.\nWhat I fancied about the game was the art; it is beautiful. Soundtrack is pleasant to listen to as well and your choices truly matter! All of the 22 endings differ from each other. Perhaps not always plotwise, but you get a new piece of dialogue.\n\nIf you want to play this game, wait for a sale (like I did).","March 5","false","3.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Yes, you can argue that the art is nice and the music is almost good, but everything needed to create a good story is lacking in this game. The first play through you're almost interested, waiting for action or a proper climax, but you're let down and the game ends. So you figure, okay, maybe I just made bad decsions being that there are 21 other endings. In less than an hour I've unlocked six different endings and none of them are better than the last. The characters are poorly developed, a connection between the player and the character aren't developed, scenes and dialogue are heavily repetitive, many times there are little variation between endings, some choices lead you in a circle which is tedious, and every ending is abrupt and unsatisfying. I highly warn against playing this game, even if it was free, it still wouldn't be worth it. I had high hopes from this game and each and every time I was let down. The only reason I will continue to play it, is to simply complete the game because I've already started.","February 22, 2015","false","1.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Initially looks promising then goes from bad to over in 10 seconds leaving you asking "is that it?"\n\nThis casual game is easy in difficulty and extremely short in gameplay. I completed all story choices, endings, and achievements in an hour and a half including a few times I left the game running and went to do something returning to the game 5 - 10 minutes later. While the illustrations are beautiful and the sound effects/music enrich the story/atmosphere be aware that this game is all reading dialogue/descriptions that result from the "choose your own ending" mechanic.\n\nI do not recommend this game because although the main character Tyrna is described as a skilled and trained warrior and set up to appear a strong female ultimately every obstacle she faces is remedied by her stalling and the male protagonist Gavin popping up at the last minute to save her. Why make her a warrior in the first place if she needs someone to save her??? Just make her a stereotypical princess and avoid the bait and switch I fell for. In addition to the damsel in distress situation I disliked that there is a romantic element between the 2 protagonists that just seems like the creators added it just because. Literally a couple choices in and Gavin is grabbing and kissing Tyrna (depending on player choices of course) which doesn’t compliment the story and feels artificial. "But Babydollpinup does that really impact the gameplay?" YES! This game style focuses on the high quality of story telling so YES the bad romance aspect is a major flaw in this process and turns it into a sloppily written story with cool graphics/sound that ends quickly.","February 23","false","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The adventure aspects of this game were mildly entertaining, but other aspects were a major let down. Most of the endings are romantic ones that I found myself rolling my eyes at...not because I'm against romance, but because I'd expect a female warrior-in-training to be more interested in becoming a fully-fledged warrior rather than arm candy to some half-elf-man she just met. *Insert strong female protagonist role rant here*\n\nIn a nutshell...\nAdventure - check\nMythical creatures - check\nQuality soundtrack - check\nDecent art-style - check, although repetative\nSound and visual effects - very basic...what does a collapsing cave sound like? Someone clapping. What do swords clashing sound like? Someone clapping...\nHumour - nowhere to be found\n\nVery much a 'chick click', so I can't see many guys enjoying Sword Daughter.\nIf you want to get into visual novels, this might not be the best place to start as there are more engaging and visually appealing options out there.","December 30, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

The choices  rarely seemed to be the main character's, with the elf male usually making the decision instead and the girl just following his decision.  As a female lead, she was very dissapointing, especially as a supposed warrior, since she needed to be saved almost every time and the elf would often insult her for actions in a supposed form of affection.  The romance was also very unnecessary and dry - the handsome man and pretty girl fall in love just because for no actual reason.","February 25","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Whenever you choose an option where Tyrna goes off on her own, the elf dude ends up catching up with her and scolding her, and whenever she attempts to fight with her sword, she's ineffectual or nearly gets herself killed and then the elf dude saves her. Only one line in the description references romance, and it makes it sound like you have a choice in the matter, and the preview puts emphasis on the fantasy setting of the story. I don't think I've gotten the ending that included the title image of Tyrna charging ferociously with her blade, but she probably trips and falls on it on the following page, causing the elf to have to rescue her *** and bridal carry her off to the nearest clinic.\nI ended up wandering when my choices would actually make a difference, or at least go somewhere I wanted.\nI liked the art, especially of Tyrna. The music and sounds also did a pretty good job at immersion. The idea of a dungeons and dragons type game done in a choose your own adventure novel is fun. This didn't have the story to hold up the potential-- it was sorta dry.\nI got it for like 2.49 during a sale which seems fair considering I liked the art. Still I'm considering a refund.\nIf you're still interested, go into this knowing that it's a romance!","March 8","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
