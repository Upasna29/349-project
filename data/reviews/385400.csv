Parts don't fit (or atleast they don't look like they fit)  No  way to make money other than taking the $2000 and building a crappy gun and making about $17 evertime you go to the shooting range.  I built a rifle that couldn't hit a taget 2 feet away.  AWFUL physics!\n\nTimer at the range starts even before you approach the bench.  Spent about 20 minutes playing this game, and will never play it again.   Thankyou Steam for having refunds.","July 15, 2015","false","0.2"," 78 of 93 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","78","93","8","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGasMask/recommended/385400/","TheGasMask","GasMask","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGasMask/","2002 products in account","I really loved the idea. I missed a game with "Pimp my Gun" style. But this game is awful, let me tell you why:\n\nFirst (as a IPSC shooter experience) you don't weld barrel with the receiver, stocks and sights. Most of the gun part is assembled not welded, so you can clean and mantain the weapon. I could let it go if it was a wrench instead of a welder.\n\nSecond, and this is why i didin't recomend this, the controls are awful. You press "E" to pick and drop a weapon and it works sometimes and when works, it's when you're not intended to do it.\nThe final nail in the coffin was when i gathered money to buy a stock, i picked it up and tried to assemble in the bench, but instead he picked up the weapon (and dropped the stock on the floor). So i tried to place the weapon in the bench and he dropped the weapon and (get this) fell in the floor right where the stock was. And when that happened the stock disappeared on the floor. I just lost the equipment and the money.\n\nSo ok, i decided to let this pass and tried to go to the shooting range to get more money tobuy another stock (my balance was $1), so i picked the weapon (with some difficulty) and went to the door and pressed "e" to go to the range. Now the thing gets fun: Instead to go to the range he dropped the weapon and it got stuck in the door and dissapeared!\n\nAnd guess what? I have no money, no weapon, and i can't get more money to build another weapon because i don't have any to go to the range.  So now every time i boot the game up i spawn in the workshop with empty bench and no money. Thank dev...\n\nIf this game get more polished and clean the bugs out, i'm sure i'll give a good mark. But for now, avoid this game.","July 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 58 of 70 people (83%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","83","58","70","14","1"

It does, however, have exactly what's advertised in the trailer as well as a lot of potential for future improvement and expansion.

I had gained access through giveaway.\n\nTo break this down, you start with enough money too buy a cheap clip and a cheap barrel. If you go expensive, you can't continue the game. You earn money by shooting targets with your gun.\n\nNow, let's describe some mechanics and stuff.\nThe game itself only has two or three attachment-styles in each "attachment" area. Also, there is only one weapon body-type, meaning that you can ONLY have a full-auto weapon, in which is an assault rifle. No possible way to create a bolt-action rifle, semi-auto rilfe/pistol, or a level action rifle/revolver/shotgun.\nThe way you pick up weapons is by pressing "E". Now, you HAVE to be looking at a specific part of the weapon's base to pickup said weapon. Now, this result in a minute to five miutes worth of trying to get the gun, that you pressed "E" two times to get off the stand by mistake because you couldn't find the pick-up box, off of the floor. Also, putting a silencer onto a rifle-barrel is basicaly impossible. It still says "Silencer", showing you should be able to put it on.\n\nBasically, too sum it up, if the Dev were to work on this game and fix these issues, I could revise this review. Also, for now it's not worth the $5. It doesn't even have trading cards.","May 21","false","0.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Last update as of the time of this review was on July 2015.\n\nThe current state of the game is basically a room where you have a workbench, a welder and a computer where you can buy randomly-generated-stat weapon parts online from, attach them to a single type of weapon frame(losing the previous attachment on that slot) and create a weapon out of them to test it on a firing range that gives you money for hitting targets. The only design consideration implemented is cost - and a more expensive part always ends up performing better regardless of its practicality. The end result once you throw enough money is a laser-accurate sniper machinegun. The problem? it's possible to get enough money to build one in less than an hour of gameplay, after which you hit endgame and there's no point in playing the game anymore because that's how limited in scope it is.\n\nThe game also has a lot of annoyances. It's possible to accidentally lose your weapon by dropping it through a wall, for example, or run out of money with an unfinished weapon. The options menu consists only of a music volume slider(which is a godsend as the game's music is absolutely annoying), and options for SSAO/Motion blur/vignette/bloom/antialiasing.","May 21","false","1.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

You make a cheap and dirty gun, and shoot it at the range, make money for scoring hits at the range.  Make enough money; make a new gun to make money quicker. It has a lot of potential, to go either way.  Only a hand full of customization options (at the moment) and only one base.   Refresh the screen to get different stats most different for the cost only, and there are only 3 choices of mags (ak, m4, and rifle), the same three choices of barrel, 2 butt stocks, 1 silencer, and 3 sights.  In it's current state, the game controls not unlike a drunken cow in a shopping cart.  If they keep at it this will be one hell of a game, but it isn't quite there yet.\nAs an aside to the devs; you do not weld the barrel, site, or stock to a guns receiver, it's that because it is built to receive these parts, also you wouldn't use a mig, you would use a tig welder for seems work in gun smithing.\n","July 21, 2015","false","4.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Yes, I did earn this game in a giveaway. And it is pretty impressive on the outside, but there are many flaws (Most you probably know).\nHere is a list:\n\nLack of options menu for otherstuff than sound and visuals.\nThe music? Probably needs something to be able to turn off and back on (Possibly on the computer).\nThe movement of the player is sluggish.\nThe items on the wall should be able to be grabbed, giving new players a head start.\nThe invisible boxes around what you want to pick up are extrememly small, too small.\nMoney earned from the practice is too low. Needs to be their score (Rounded) and multiplied by either 2 or 1.5.\nMail box needs to be open (Possibly your package can take a few minutes, and you get a email about it).\nPackage could have a delay between when you buy it and get it.\nDoor in room (Window one), should maybe be able to be opened? I don't know, not like I'm trying to say "Shoot bystanders" or anything like that.\nThe gun can be reloaded while ADS, could be a problem.\nSome items are not able to be put on guns, no matter how hard I tried!\nThe gun can glitch out if you tap (button to drop), then again, and grab it again, and then drop it again, it can glitch and go crazy (Phasing through walls, vanishing, etc.)\n\nI hope this was helpful, of course some of these were possibly features for the future, but I am trying to give constructive feedback, as this is a great game!

Honestly, this game is awesome and it has a really nice potential!\nKeep it up, always listen to the community, no DLCs, consult your gun dealers for more content (and ofc, give them a lil' credit if they want it:P) In the community hub/Discussions add a new section "suggestions", check it daily looking for good ideas.\nHere's a "startup" suggestion! Add e system which detects the weapons/parts if they fall out of the room to spawn them back in. (I accidentally presed E while looking out the windows and my gun flew out xD)\n\nAnyway, very nice game, keep it up and I love it! :D\n\nP.s: How should I call this?
