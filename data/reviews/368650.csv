That uses stealth and survival horror conventions to materialize the fears living in our subconscious through abstract and geometrical shapes inspired by the paintings of Rothko\n«It’s always night, or we wouldn’t need light» - Theloniuos Monk\nDo you remember the first time when you played Super Mario Bros 3? And while you were running through a prolonged and almost infinite hill, pushing the jump button you realized that now Mario could fly. And then, you were amazed with this magic sense of discovery while you explore a vastness sea of pixelated clouds. Creating the magic illusion of exploring a new world in which every single element is full of novelty, an explosion of the senses.\n\nOur gaming memories are full of this accomplished moments of realization. Like the first enemy that you glitch in Axiom Verge. The first kiss you give in Yoshirou Kimura’s cult classic Chulip. Or when you rewinded the time in Braid to reach an unattainable floating plattform for the first time.\n\nDark Echo has one of these memorable and most captivating single moments experienced in recent videogames. In the form of the first time that you keep pushed the action button, and releasing it you can see how an explosion of visible and corporeal sound waves helps to materialize a previously occult and cryptic hidden dimension. With a plethora of abstract and evocative geometrical forms dazzling our eyes with pure joy. An intense array of emotions are concentrated in this mere act of pushing a single button. As an expression of why the videogames are considered art.\n\nIn its first hours, this magic sense of realization never ceases. An absorbing sensation that creates an oppressive feeling in the player, while he’s surrounded by invisible menaces laying in the shadows. An universe where the most feared ghosts plaguing our subconscious are waiting for us surrounded by darkness. Waiting to become corporeal with the mere stimulus of a sound.\n\nWe can only figure the world that lies beneath Dark Echo via the materialization of sounds, this fragmented instant of time when a a wave elongates making tangible a mysterious and almost cryptic alternative reality that lives isolated in a corner of our memories, close to our childhood traumas. Playing Dark Echo is like doing a unconscious journey through our fears and hopes, only using our imagination in a synesthetic way, associating sounds and its geometrical effects with inner terrors. And all of these sound elements are augmented by one of the most cohesive artistic designs seen in a videogame, clearly influenced by the paintings of Rothko in its constant use of the black and red colors.\n\nIts level structure is not so distant of a stealth game, where we need to generate geometrical forms thorough sounds to confuse our captors. With a perfect difficulty curve that adds new elements and functions at a very slow pace. The 20 first levels serves as a tutorial, and from 20 onwards, you should prepare to die a lot. It’s like an even more minimalist approach to the VR missions seen in the first Metal Gear Solid. Also, Dark Echo shows its smart design nature by using the name of each level as an evocative clue to resolve its main obstacle. A demonstration of the love and care that its creators have put in the development process.\n\nMaybe Dark Echo can be seen as a small game. But it’s a game in which every single element has been created with an ambitious and creative approach. A short but extremely polished experience that tries to not saturate the player with irrelevant content. Over the years and with the consequent saturation of the gaming market, I appreciate games that really try to be small but memorable journeys. Significative creations in gaming history that we will never forget.\n\nNote that Dark Echo isn’t the first experiment created in the videogame medium to recreate the experience of being a blind person. Previously, the japanese punk videogame designer idol Kenji Eno created Real Sound: Kaze no Regret for Sega Saturn. A game that was designed with blind people in mind, using only sounds and with not a single image. In his next game, Kenji Eno will use the sound as a design fundamental again, with the release of Enemy Zero. A survival horror with invisible enemies, that only can be detected by using a sound radar.\n\nSadly, Kenji Eno passed away in 2013. But I’m sure that if he lived today, he would become fascinated with Dark Echo.\n\n\n( The writer of this review is not an English native. So you should expect occasional grammar errors.

It feels like a flash or mobile game in the sense that each level is a short path to victory with a tiny variation on the same theme. This is not a bad thing in and of itself but a game that relies on atmosphere should not present you with a transparent series of easy puzzles and little else.\n\nI appreciate the game's clever design but I don't enjoy the gameplay. It didn't feel particularly scary, either: Red blobs make spooky ghost sounds and if you touch them they will eat you and restart the level. That is the sum of this game's horror elements. They will chase you if they hear you but they are stupendously easy to avoid. Holding shift makes you invisible to them and you can throw rocks to draw their attention away from you on a whim.\n\nSome of the levels make interesting use of the game's premise but most felt tedious.\n\nWhat I liked:\nClever concept, some levels were intriguing, perceiving your environment requires effort\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nLack of tension, mobile game level design, one-note enemies, lack of meaningful variation","May 14, 2015","false","1.3"," 82 of 137 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","82","137","3","6"

However, conceptually, it is pretty cool, and in practice, the game mechanics work well.\n\nBasically, it is pitch black with the only light coming from sound, which bounces off the walls and objects, thus illuminating your path briefly. Also, your footprints leave a trail. Sadly, the sound also serves to attract an all consuming evil, in the form of red lights. Normal sound is represented by white light, doors (and I guess treaure although I'm not exactly certain how that works) is represented by yellow, and water (the bane of your existence in this game, lol) is blue. Somewhere around level 20, you find rocks which you can throw to distract the all consuming evil, which is especially handy when you also have to cross water (which also slows your movement). Each level basically ends by finding the exit "doorway" which explodes with white light when you step into it.  Oh...and you can also move with stealth, which reduces your sound radius and helps you to sneak through that pesky all consuming evil.\n\nThere are some other nuances so far, such as needing to use rocks to break through walls, and certain levels where you cant hide from the all consuming evil and simply have to run for it. The level I am on currently, you have to cross waterways which actually push you into the awaiting evil (I guess this is the waters current).\n\nThe game does have full controller support, which is how I play it.\n\nAnyway, I actually think this is a stellar game, and minimalistic perfection in what is essentially a unique puzzle game.\n\nI give this game 8 muffled footsteps out of 10 with the remaining 2 betraying you to the all consuming evil, which I will simply dub as Shoggoth.","August 11, 2015","true","3.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","19","24","3","0"

Don't be put off by it's simple execution or think this may not be your type of game until you at least try it.  I found it engaging, fun and (dare I say) somewhat dramatic?  Think echo-location from the movement/sound of your footsteps to provide you with a limited visual slice of the immediate surroundings.  Sometimes you'll find doors, othertimes you'll be chased by a swarm of deadly red hate - and that's when my pulse started to quicken, but all you have to really do (insert evil laugh) is find the exit.

Dark Echo is a brilliant mobile game that managed it's way to Steam. The game is minimalistic at best and was created in a short 48 hours for Ludum Dare's Minimalism Contest eventually placing second place. Out of 1600 entries. This is a much more refined and improved version.\n\nThis game creates horror and suspense, being one of the most creepy games I've played so far, all while retaining it's simplicity.\n\nThe game starts  out by placing you in the footsteps of a blind person alone in the dark. It doesn't give you a clue where you are, what do you encounter and who are you. It is all up to your imagination.\n\nSee those red lines chasing you? You don't know who they are. Could be a monster, a zombie or maybe even a serial killer. It is all up to your imagination to find out.\n\nThe only clue left is the game's engaging soundtrack - dripping water, doors, creaking bridges, the growling of monsters - it all provides an engaging experience and feel to the game when you play it with headphones, which is recommended by the developers.\n\nIf you're one of those who get this through the App Store, I'd recommend getting this through Steam and consider $10 a non-optional donation; They deserve it.","May 16, 2015","true","1.2"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","18","25","2","2"

The sounds you create ricochet around you in the form of coloured lines. You goal, naturally, is to escape the darkness, and escape whatever the hell is in it with you.\n\nI found the gameplay enjoyable overall. The difficulty curve is just right - with a bit of persistence and some careful planning, navigating the darkness can be fun, sometimes scary, but achieveable for everyone. Controls consist of basic movement, throwing stones for decoys, clapping your hands (with various degrees of strength, depending how long you hold the button down for), and stealth. And you'll probably be using stealth quite a bit.\n\nYou have your white, regular soundwaves for normal surfaces, yellow for switches. But the real fun starts with blue and red soundwaves. Blue is for water, which is something you'll want to avoid on account of it being so noisy, and red you'll also want to avoid, on account of it being able to kill you at a touch.\n\nAnd oh my god, if you die. The first time I died I almost leapt a full metre out of my chair. The death scream is perfect. In fact, most all the sounds are done to perfection. From your echoing footsteps to the sound your hands clapping together, it is very well done.\n\nDark Echo really is a worthy addition to any gamer's library. While it lacks a story of any sort, it does do everything else right, giving us a new take on fear, exploration and stealth. Even if it doesn't sound like fun to you (I don't imagine how this could be) get this game and give it a try.

It's suggested to wear headphones to be more immersed in the atmosphere and better hear the sounds or in what direction something might be at.\n\nOverall I do like what I've played of this game so far and I could recommend it to anyone who may be considering getting it.

In actuality, the game is a top-down casual adventure game with sound built into the graphics. Yes, it's unique, but the game quickly runs out of material and becomes irritating to finish. The low price helps, but it's not a game I'll likely remember.\n\nThe core gameplay is to reach the exit, avoiding red traps and pushing yellow plates to open walls. Detecting objects requires sounds, so most of the time you will be sending out foot pings to map out rooms. The real gameplay opens up when enemies are introduced, and sounds become a risk of detection. In the best moments, Dark Echo is about outmaneuvering enemies and feeling smart about your moves.\n\nIn the worst moments, Dark Echo is about trial & error memorization of traps and enemies, since the optimal playstyle is to make no noise. Issues come up when the game throws in more enemies and more water, forcing you to drag groups further out of the way so you'll have more time to move. Enemy detection also shows issues, as detection is dependent on sound lines hitting enemies. Sound lines may be pretty consistent, but it would make more sense to be doppler waves for consistency. Rock tosses will generally miss at medium range, unless the rock hits a wall to amplify. Too much time is spent spamming rocks to move enemies just right, and waiting on the slow death animation.\n\nAlthough the game has 80 levels, half of them are repeats with added difficulty. The survival horror concepts are lost with the flood of identical enemies and repeated deaths. The puzzle elements are minimal switches, and no real mental challenge outside memorization. The lack of tension and challenges leave the game feeling like a grind to finish, despite being short. It would take closer to 5+ hours to complete, and I left the game idle overnight. I suppose the game isn't too expensive, but I wasn't impressed or pleased by the second half. Sadly it's another artsy game that says nothing and puts style over substance.","February 7","false","11.8"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","19","30","0","0"

This game was produced as an indie project and it was certainly well made. In this game you play a blind man lost somewhere, because of some reason and now he has to escape somehow because everything in this place is trying to murder him on as soon as the things in question. Everywhere there are things that are making spooky noices, fitting and actually creepy noices.\nThe gameplay is simple and easy to learn. You can only see be making sounds. Now, there were some interesting things done with this concept. you can only see hazards when you make sounds and many of those hazards will come to the source of the noice and straight out murder you. This forces you to think about almost every move you make in this game and creates tension, but if you ♥♥♥♥ up you're ♥♥♥♥ed. The sound design is incredible. No music at all, but every sound effect in this game helps to create this tension, which you can easely cut by breathing to loud.\nBeing a blind man really makes this entiry game really interesting. going back on what I said before, you know absolutely nothing about what is going one. 'Who am I?' 'WTF is that?' 'WTF was that?' 'Where the ♥♥♥♥ am I?' None of these questions will be answered. You your self will try and fill in the questions, this too will help make the entire game even more tens, if that's even possible.\nIt's is a pity that a while in the game it will be more trial and error than anything else. It won't be to frequent but you will notice it and you will be anoyed by the stupid, unnecessary deaths.\nA good thing though is that, like a good game should be, the game gets gratually more difficult, excluding the trial and error levels.\nThis game is short, but it's cheap as hell. I fully recommend this tense as ♥♥♥♥ game.","June 16, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Drawing you in with atmospheric sound design the world around you begins to take shape, from a drop of water rhythmically falling from the ceiling to the deadly monsters lurking around every corner. The controls feel very tight, every single foot step has a weight to it. As the levels go on the game remains fresh, introducing new concepts and challenges at a fair and even pace. If I had one complaint it's that the elements of horror don't feel frantic enough, running away from monsters feels more like a jog through the mall than a life or death situation. Perhaps this is because the game wishes to be more of a puzzler than survival horror. Still loved that loud DEATH SCREAM though!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/368650/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Dark Echo is a minimalistic exploration game. You are shrouded in darkness (or, for the second half of the game, in blinding light), and the only way for you to navigate through the levels is the echos of your footsteps (represented by colored lines which radiate out from where you’re standing). You have the ability to stomp your foot (making louder echoes), walk silently (to avoid alerting enemies to your presence), and throw stones (to make echoes in a remote location to lure enemies away).\n\nThe game is very simple; there are only a handful of mechanics. There are red enemies who move towards the last sound they were in range of earing, there are pits of water which slow you down and which make a lot of sound to move through, there are red areas that killed you if you moved into them, there were walls that would collapse when you made a loud sound (opening an area but also attracting enemies), and there were moving blocks which pushed you around.\n\nMostly, the game worked fairly decently; you are introduced to all the games’ mechanics gradually over the first half of the game, and navigate through a series of increasingly-difficult levels which force you to combine the mechanics in increasingly interesting ways.\n\nWhile the game was mostly fairly solid, the moving blocks mechanic was probably the most frustrating; while it only appears in a handful of levels, the fact that the pushes are so difficult to see ahead of time is kind of frustrating. Eventually you figure out how they work (for a while, I just thought they were sloped areas that I was skidding down), but at times it felt like the game broke its own rules, such as one level where you had to navigate up little ramps that felt like they actually were sloped areas on the sides of the room.\n\nMostly, though, the game played very fairly, and even the frustrating levels were mostly quite short. After beating the game, you could hunt back through for treasures, or play through the “light” versions of the levels, where additional enemies were added in to make you play more carefully (as well as the layouts of some of the levels being changed to make them more difficult).\n\nThat said, the game is nothing super special; the gameplay isn’t really amazing, but it is decent enough. Ultimately, this is a sort of time-waster game – the sort of thing you’d play while chatting to someone or doing something else, sporadically playing it. It was originally a mobile game, and I suspect it is better suited to that platform simply because of its “play in short bursts” nature.\n\nStill, it is okay, and if you’re looking for something to do between doing other things, it isn’t a bad choice, and goes to show that just because you don’t spend a whole lot on graphics doesn’t mean you can’t make a visually striking game. Just dont' expect it to be anything more than a distraction.","February 9","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's surprisingly simple but effective mechanics, are used to their fullest; where it's not a matter of just rushing through a level, but in most cases you are using stealth. Where you are blind, and the only way you ascertain where you are is making or picking up sounds and echoes, represented by white (or black) light vectors. Sound is very minimalistic due to this, but adds to a somewhat unexpected atmosphere of slight horror. It's not a long game - I've spent about 2hrs and completed half of the levels, but it's also a fairly meagre price. As an added incentive, and a bit more replay value, there are hidden "treasures" to find throughout the game, though not on every level.\n\nMinimalist in design, solid in execution, I wholly recommend it.","August 20, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I started with "You Have to Win the Game", and I suppose I might as well continue with Dark Echo.\n\nNow, I'm not recommending Dark Echo because I think it's a bad game. Dark Echo is an incredibly unique game with a stealth system all-it's-own. I just personally don't like it. But if you think the points I bring up won't bother you, then by all means buy this game.\n\nDark Echo is a stealth/horror game built around the idea that you're blind and have to rely on sound to guide your way through what I think is a castle with a ton of enigmatic monsters living inside it. The mechanics are very unique. If you choose to move quietly to not disturb the monsters, you won't be able to see far ahead and predict incoming obstacles. However, if you choose to be loud and find out what's ahead, you might attract monsters who will eat you. But all this challenge and fright is pretty much diminished by the rocks. Once you get those all the levels that follow are an absolute piece of cake.\n\nDark Echo is certainly a horror game. It plays well with what you see as well as what you don't see, and uses sound to amp up the atmosphere and tension. But without a story, context, or building challenge to the monsters I didn't find myself sweating with terror at the end. I felt relieved, sure, but I know if the game put a little more oomph! into it, Dark Echo could be so much better, and so much scarier.\n\nAgain, if this sounds appealing to you, go nuts. Dark Echo is still an incredibly unique experience. But beyond the sometimes blandly simple levels and lack of story to really put things into context (and the added on padding where you simply play through all 40 levels again, but in the light), it just wasn't a game for me. But it might be the perfect game for someone else.","January 24","false","1.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I would recommend that you buy it, play it, and get a refund, for reasons you'll see later.\nFirst, though, the game is mostly an excellent experience. Suspense is created very effectively, as well as some mild horror. The game's mechanics are very polished and nice, with it's slightly randomized sound wave direction, so that no walk will be exactly the same; the sneak mechanice's effectiveness in water could be adjusted for more realism, but i understand that it's wave length is so expansive for the sake of the suspense and challenge; the enemies' speed is just enough to provide great suspense, and the large enemy is certainly a great fear that the game always gives you a chance to avoid (or rather, run from). The simple style of the game provides a nice ambiance, so that if you stop making sound for even a few seconds, you will be lost until you make sound again, likely putting you in danger.\nNow on to negative points. First off, the game is NOT worth $2.99, since there is simply not enought content, in my opinion, to be priced that high. $1.49 maximum. The game is inconsistent in the later levels(30-40 mainly),in that it "throw's away" the machanics it has taught you from the beginning. one level leaves you stranded in a widely expansive empty map, following sounds of dripping water just beyond your view. no other place in the game requires you to listen for direction or guidance. another level leaves you in a room where you must obeserve the pattern of moving landscape to find an opening to stop the motion at a specific time which will allow you to progress (harder than it sounds). My biggest point, though, is level 37: "lost", in which you are placed in a large landscape of rough-walled caves where you must walk around blindly until you randomly find the exit, with other paths leading you to dead ends with enemies.\nThe game also has a "light mode", which is simply a negative print of the game with enemies added to nearly every room, faster enemy movement, turned rooms, or some rooms' layout changed. The game's achievements also consist of "beat normal mode", "beat hard mode", and "collect every secret". The game is good, but mostly due to the extravagant price and lack of both general content and replay value, i'll put it this way:\nI should have my refund soon.","June 2","true","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The following 7 hours of gameplay left my heart beating a little faster as I snuck, tricked, and bolted my way for the exit. I found all the levels to be interesting and fun except that one level at the end with too many moving parts where I died a lot and if you've played you know what I'm talking about. My biggest complaint about the game was just that your character is limited to only facing 8 different directions which makes creating effective distractions at the right place a little difficult sometimes. Given the simplicity of the controls however, the 8 direction limit seems appropriate. Overall I loved the game and hope to see many more like it in the future.","May 29, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/J_DULL/recommended/368650/","J_DULL","MinedroidPro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/J_DULL/","86 products in account","Okay so lets be honest. This type of game is somewhat unique but isn't an original idea. It has been done before but not in this atmospheric horror fashion. Frankly I didn't feel the atmosphere that everyone talked about in the reviews. It was more annoying than anything. The game is trying to challenge you with certain aspects but it just ends up being boring (when you get to the stealth portions of the game you'll see what I mean).\nThe horror factor isn't all that great either. The reason other indie horror games (Take FNAF for example) are actually scary is because they always keep you on your toes. You always know that there's a monster right outside your door and you have .25 seconds to react. In this game you only feel annoyed by the enemies; like their purpose is just to distract you from your goal, rather than trying to eat you.\nThis game was a nice concept, the sound of footsteps to show paths combined with atmospheric horror, but it just didn't seem to live up to its potential. Now I feel like I've bought a game just for the achievements or collectibles, and that isn't how its supposed to be.","May 19, 2015","false","4.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","2"

It is an unbelieveably simple game and concept, but it is entralling and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I'm not sure how many levels there are yet, but there are more than 30.

Your steps make noise and the noisewaves show you your surroundings, but can also lure monsters to your position. The game can get really hard at some points and when you complete it, you unlock the light mode which is basically the same game but in way harder. In this mode you will have to be way more strategic and a fast thinker. Throughout the game, there are 15 hidden treasures that unlock an achievment when you find them all.\n\nAll in all, Dark Echo is a simple made, but challenging 2D game with 3 achievments that are easy to get in 3 hours of gameplay, but are still very satisfying. I definitely recommend this game to fans of the genre or people searching for a challenging and cheap game for their spare time.","February 12","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PizzaDeliveryCat/recommended/368650/","PizzaDeliveryCat","PizzaDeliveryCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PizzaDeliveryCat/","280 products in account","This game has an excellent idea behind it.\n\nI haven't necessarily seen this type of game before, so I would say that it does have some originality. I'm sure there's someone out there who doubts its originality, or has seen it before, but I'm not one of those people.\n\nWith that being said, I enjoyed the game for the time that I played it. I got all the way through the darkness, but I didn't go further than that. I think that at some point I will go back through and do the light levels, because I'm sure that there's something I might have missed.\n\n\nMeat of the reviewI don't necessarily go by a rating system whenever I review games. I consider: Is it reasonably priced for the level of enjoyment I got out of the gameplay? Does it have a unique quality about it that other games don't have? Will I ever be able to go back and replay the game?\n\nThose are three questions that I consider whenever I'm playing a game. Those are three fairly important questions to me as well.\n\nFirst question: With a price tag of $2.99, it is very affordable. Not only that, but I was riveted to the game and I was determined on finishing all of the levels, I won't spoil how many. If you want to know here's the number:  30  Which I thought was a great amount of levels, and the variability of the levels was incredible. Not only is the game innovative, but the level design is complex and dynamic. The levels challenged my awareness and problem solving.  Of course, I think it is very reasonably priced for the level of enjoyment I got out of it.\n\nSecond question: Dark Echo is a game where  you are blind  and the object of the game is to find the exit using  your sense of hearing.  I found the game fascinating for this reason. This quality of the game gave the title of the game some depth. I thought that the nature of the game stuck to its title. The game is definitely unique in the respect of bringing gameplay to the table that hasn't been recycled over and over again.\n\nThird question: As far as replayability is concerned, I'm going with that I'm not sure if it does have replayability. For me I didn't necessarily play this game for very long, but for the amount of time I played it I think it justified the price tag. But the light levels are something that are worth looking into for people who are potentially looking at this game and aren't necessarily sure about it.\n\nVerdictOverall I think that the game is worth at least looking into. In all of my reviews, I tell everyone who gets this far to have a look at it. Don't take what I have to say and just go out and buy it. You should go look up videos, or look up other reviews. You and I might not have the same tastes as far as games are concerned. Enjoy Dark Echo!","May 30, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, it does not fulfill its promise. I liked the beginning a lot, but becomes boring and tedious later on. I played the dark levels on Android and some of the white levels on PC, so I can compare both versions.\n\nThere are 3 main mechanics in the game (tapping, sneaking, throwing rocks). They are interesting early on, but no other concept is introduced later on, and there are no new mechanics introduced in the later levels (maybe except moving objects). The game seems to be a half-finished, with so many interested things that could have been introduced in the game, but weren't.\n\nThe number of levels is low. There are 40 dark levels, which you can finished in a couple of hours, and 40 white levels, which are the same levels with many more (and bigger and faster) enemies, and a very uncomfortable full-white background. There's not much motivation to play the white levels. Also, one wonders why there aren't more unique levels than 40. Given that designing new levels seems extremely easy, their current number feels more like a demo than a regular game.\n\nThe controls are unfortunately very poorly implemented. On touch devices, it's very hard to sneak, and sometimes you perform a regular step instead of sneaking, which means instadeath in later (white) levels. Imprecise controls on touch devices was a reason why I switched to PC version for later levels. On the other hand, on touch devices you can very easily throw rocks into arbitrary direction, and it's very easy to precisely position your enemy. Mind-bogglingly, you can't do that on PC. Even though it would be very obvious to use mouse cursor to throw rocks, you can't, and you can only throw to 8 basic directions using the keyboard. Also, you always need to face the direction you're throwing into, so you can't distract an enemy by throwing a rock to the side when running away, as it would be natural. With gamepad, you can throw to arbitrary directions, but as is usual with a gamepad stick, aiming is hard. So while PC version makes it easier to move, it makes it harder to aim compared to touch devices. In none of the versions you can control your character well. Controls were my number 1 frustration when playing later levels. The ideal controls seem so obvious - left mouse click to walk, shift to sneak, space to tap, right mouse click to throw to the exact direction. Yet it is not there.\n\nHopefully someone will use this concept and make a great with it, with more interesting levels, more enemy types, more interactive and environment objects (I can imagine e.g. terrain elevation changing sound waves reflection), better controls, more fun.","February 10","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like how simple it is without being easy.  But, I would say the game was a little too short.  It could've used a little bit more variety with enemies, and the difficulty sort of "caps out".  What I mean by that is there's only so much the developers can do to make the game harder without it being tedious or impossible.  There are many scenes that *seem* like they'd be hard, but I know there is no other way out, which makes the obstacles less challenging than they appear to be.","May 7","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
