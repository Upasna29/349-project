Plays like a retro arcade game, with the graphics and sound really suiting the mood of the game nicely.\n\nGameplayThis game is set out to be a Retro Arcade inspired game, and it exceeds that expectation really well. It implements a few of the mechanics that you would expect to be in a retro arcade game. These mechanics are setting high scores, being able to collect powerups, multiple choice of what ship you want to choose to be ect. The game, for me, set high standards when I first opened up the game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is much like a arcade game. Your main objective is to try to stay alive for as long as possible and get the highest possible score that you can. The game includes a multiplier system, whereby if you get hit and lose a life you multiplyer goes back down to x1. Now for me, there are a few criticisms that I want to point out. I understand that this game is trying to be like a Retro Arcade game, but there are just some things that in today's gaming standards people wouldn't really like.\n\nThe game includes a brief tutorial that explains how to control your ship, your main objective and the powerups that are included in the game that help you throughout playing the game. It does well to tell you about the game in a brief and easy way to understand.\n\nThe game seems very limited to where you can fly around. There seems to be these glowing purple lines that line out your perimeter of where you are actually available to fly about in. This space is a fairly small size. I sometimes found myself overwhelmed by enemy ships and being trapped in a corner to die and lose a life. I feel like the game could've been better with more space to fly around to give you a bit more mobility through the game.\n\nSomething else that I feel is missing in this game is the speed even though the description of the game says that it is suppose to be slow paced. I would expect for the game to have a bit of pace to it so that the player would have to think quickly and react quickly, especially as the game description says that it is a bullet hell. Unfortunately, for me, the game doesn't have this fast pace feel that I would expect. It feels slow and although the controls are responsive and well implemented, I feel like the game is holding out upon the pace of how everything is working.\n\nDespite some of these criticisms about the game, it does have a small range of ships that you are available to choose from that have different sort of stats that can fit the way that you play the game. There are three types of ships that you can play as, the stats that are on the game is Attack, Speed and Acceleration. One of the ships is basically generally alright at all these stats, while the other two are more towards a stat but suffer in another. This is a nice option to give the player, and depending on your play style of the game will depend on which ship you will choose.\n\nI feel like the graphics really pulls this game together. The game has a rather nice Retro feel to the game, with the character ship and enemy ship all having the same sort of style to them that brings back that nostalgia feeling that you get when you play older retro games. As you progress further into the game you will encounter more tougher enemies that are shaded in a more dark colour which really differentiates them from the normal enemies you will also encounter.\n\nSomething else that also really brings this game up is the soundtrack that is played throughout the game. Its music also adds to the nostalgia factor of the game, as well as it really suits this type of Arcade Retro game. There is a nice amount of soundtracks throughout the game so it won't get too repetitive throughout the game\n\nPros+ Plays like a Retro Arcade game\n+ Implements a few mechanics from Arcade games\n+ Three ships with different stats to choose from\n+ Really nice Retro graphics\n+ Nice fitting music\n\n[/h1]Cons[/h1]\n- The text that tells you about the boost is too small to read\n- The game seems fairly limited to where you can fly around\n- The game is described as a Bullet Hell but slow paced, for me doesn't work that well\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsThe final verdict of this game. I feel like this game has the potential to be a really good Arcade Retro game, there are some things here and there that could be worked on to improve the game. But the graphics and the soundtrack of the game are excellent throughout. I would recommend this to everyone especially those of you who enjoy Retro Arcade games.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","May 17","true","6.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","21","26","4","0"

I usually find nothing, but today I found Space Codex! It's normally $.99, but I got it on sale for $.59. Even even if a game doesn't look that great, who could pass it up at that price? Not I. And it even had good reviews! Wowza! (There were only six reviews, but everyone seemed to like it)\n\nSpace Codex is a straight forward, top-down twin-stick style arcade shooter. Bad guys fly towards you and you shoot them, that's just about the whole game. There is a handful of power-ups and a few different enemy types. There are also three different ship types to choose from, each with different stats.\n\nThe basic gameplay is simple but pretty solid, and the music is surprisingly good. There is a pretty good variety of tracks, too. With a game this small, they could have easily gotten away with a single repeating track, so the variety is appreciated.\n\nNow, here's a few of the gripes I have with the game:\n\n(A couple hours after posting my review on Steam, the dev commented on it and told me he'd fixed a lot of the issues. I'm very impressed!)\n\n-Once you choose your ship, you can't go back. You have to reset the game\n(Apparently, you just have to hit escape, then click "Select Ship". This wasn't even an issue that actually needed fixed. I just didn't think to hit escape because I'm a dummy.)\n\n-Power-ups are hard to see against the stars in the background. The shield especially, since it's just a light-blue circle.\n(The dev added a nice glow effect to all the power-ups. Not only are they easier to see now, but they look cool, too!)\n\n-No controller support.\n(Controller support is being worked on.)\n(If you have a Steam Controller, I've uploaded a control scheme for the game, feel free to use that.)\n\n-No Leaderboard.\n(Leaderboards are also being worked on.)\n\n-There is a small window after dying where hitting the boost key restarts the game.\n(You can totally ignore that complaint now. Totally fixed!)\n\nLike I said, the dev very quickly fixed most of the issues I had with their game. I can definitely recommend it now. It's good fun, especially for the price it's being sold at.","May 17","true","1.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","13"

With diverse gameplay, soundtrack, and enemies, you'll be sure to love it.\nLonger ReviewSpace Codex was a very cool game to play, mostly because the developer added several elements to keep it fun. These include the soundtrack, neon graphics, ship upgrades, enemies, and the similarity to an old arcade machine. The controls are clearly shown and they are easy to learn.\nPros\n-Amazing Soundtrack\n-Good Control Scheme\n-More Ships to Unlock\n-Cool Neon Graphics\n-Many Enemies to Defeat\nSteam Trading Cards\nCons\n-Lack of Controller Support. This game would be much greater if it had it.\n-Game Lags Sometimes. A huge frame drop will occur at random points.\n\nA great thing to add to this would be achievements, because that would push many players to keep going.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who grew up playing on arcade machines or even anyone who enjoys the genre.\nMy final score for this game is 8.7/10.\n\nEDIT: The Developer reached out to me to find the problem. He quickly found a small bug that caused the frame drop and fixed it right after. +1 for Developer. Game runs as smooth as silk now.","May 17","true","2.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

It's a twin-stick shooter basically on one level and there's harder and harder enemies and you go until you die. It's a lot like the original Geometry Wars except it doesn't have leaderboards or controller support. If you just want a simple game to play, it's really nice. If you want anything more than that, you'll likely be disappointed.\n\nFull review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gETatp9_92A","May 17","true","0.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noocxcoon/recommended/469890/","noocxcoon","NOoCX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noocxcoon/","31 products in account","Lured by the soundtrack and charming graphics I bought this game yesterday. I was a little bit concerned about the slow-paced speed shown in the video, for the low price however I did not care too much...\n\nMusic is awesome! Really, I would buy the game again solely for the different tracks and all these lovely bling and beep sounds. The graphic also fits my taste, quite simple, quite retro. And the gameplay is fun, not overwhelming fun, but good fun in an addictive way!\n\nEdit: At first I've thought that a slightly higher speed maybe would feel better, but after spending some time with the game I really much like the speed as it is. There are three different ships of choice with different speed and for me it is the high maneuverability in small areas that brings the sexiness. Dodging feels quite good. Power-ups are basic but nice, there is a boost ability which is kinda useful and a charged shot, which I honestly don't use often.\n\nTo summarize it, I definitely like Space Codex and recommend it! The preview pretty much presents the game as it is. Don't expect too much more. If you like what you see and hear, get it! Apart from that: Im really impressed by the fast and friendly feedback from the developer, he's doing a great job!\n\nSmall maybe-point of improvement regarding the power-ups: Moving along to them and seeing them disappearing pixels apart from you feels bad. It would be nice if these could fade out even slower.","May 18","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","9"
