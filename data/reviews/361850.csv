The amazing artwork and the great soundtrack, combined with an interesting story make this game one of the best of this genre.\n\nThe story itself is pretty lengthy (around 6h) and quite captivating. An ancient evil threatens to break through the weakened portal to our world because four of the gate’s seals have been stolen. Vanessa, our main character, is asked to help the secret order of light that guards the gate to find the missing seals and to secure the gate once again. In order to find the seals she travels to several worlds of astonishing beauty: some darker and other brighter, some mystic and others demonic.\n\nThe artwork is centered on angels/demons, several scenes having influences from the Renaissance period. The lightning in some of the locations is simply breathtaking. The atmosphere is perfectly completed by the powerful and heroic music, very fitting for the whole angel/demon theme.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451771208\n\nThere are two types of hidden object scenes in this game: the classic ones that we’re already used to, in which the player has to identify the objects from a list and find them in the scene;   however, there’s another type that I found really interesting: the player is given the objects and he needs to put them back to their places; it’s like a reverse hidden object scene.\n\nAside from the normal Hint system, you have a complete walkthrough together with the solution to the mini games and the HOG/HOPA scenes available in game – this is very useful for people that prefer to play with a guide nearby, since it spares them from tabbing out of the game. But even if you’re an expert HOG player, you might find yourself in need of peeking a bit at the walkthrough because some of the puzzles are really difficult to solve. However, most of the mini games are of easy / moderate difficulty.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451771009\n\nThe only aspect that I didn’t like about the game was the abrupt ending; it left me hanging, with a lot of questions.  There is no explanation about what exactly that ancient evil was or what its plan was. Or how was it helped by some of the suspicious characters that you encounter throughout the story. I thought that the bonus chapter would shade a bit of light upon this mystery but even after playing it, I didn’t receive the expected clarifications. Maybe they will release a sequel; in this case I am looking forward to it!\n\nPortal of Evil comes with achievements that are obtainable in a single playthrough, if you play on Expert difficulty. Note that two of them are currently bugged; however the developers promised that they will be fixed in the next update.\n\nBottom line, I consider Portal of Evil: Stolen Runes to be a must-have for all the HOG fans out there. It is well worth the money, even at full price.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","May 30, 2015","true","18.1"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","38","40","0","4"

Following the advice of a friend, I decided to give Portal of Evil a go. Portal of Evil: Stolen Runes is a HOG from 8floor Games - which I've never heard of, before - and one with the most beautiful artwork that HOG genre is capable of presenting us. Yes, I am pleased.\n\nIt all started with an ominous nightmare and a knock on her door... Vanessa Helsing was pretty much oblivious to the world of mythical beasts, powerful artifacts and mysterious doors leading to other realms, just a couple of weeks back. Her grandfather, Abraham Helsing disappears mysteriously and Vanessa receives an invitation from an archbishop Benedict, to the St. Peter Cathedral in Southern Italy. Growing up with the major mystery of her grandfather's job, Vanessa accepts the invitation and hits the road to discover her family's legacy. Unbeknownst to her, she is about to be the sole hope for a perilous matter that centers a certain door which connects the Hell to our mortal realm.\n\nThe first thing that I'd like to declare is that the artwork is marvelous! I usually try to restrain myself from using such adjectives for this genre, but when I found myself taking a cartload of screenshots and just taking a pause to watch the light moving over the scenery more than once, I make an exception. Developers really gave their best in environment design, with a strong renaissance theme. Cinematics weren't exceptionally good, but they carry a quality that we stumble in adventure game genre, not HOG, so even that is a bonus.\n\nGameplay didn't carry any revolutionary elements. It is your millionth HOG, with generic but beautifully illustrated puzzles. HOG sequences were okay, and wouldn't give you much hard time. Your map is interactive with a teleportation feature, and an available action indicator, so the obscene amount of backtracking wouldn't cut you off from the story. Story itself is pretty much generic also, with some pretty details scattered around. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but the ending - a common downside for the HOG genre at this point - would leave you with a "seriously?" face and wonder if the game really did end there. Oh, and voice acting is horrendously bad.\n\nNothing award winning, Portal of Evil would give you a lazy evening with some really beautiful scenes to watch. Considering I got the game in sale, as part of a bundle, I got my money's worth and added some backgrounds to my wallpaper collection. Win-win.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 2, 2015","true","7.0"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/philstrahl/recommended/361850/","philstrahl","Phil Strahl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/philstrahl/","254 products in account","Exceptionally well designed and beautifully presented adventure with hidden object passages. The gameplay is not too hard although some mini games will get you scratch your head a few times before you arrive at your personal Heureka!-moment. Since the map lets you jump to previously visited places, it'’s easy to get in a flow of “just one more puzzle!”. The cut-scenes are nicely rendered, unfortunately the characters’ facial animation is straight from the uncanny valley, but that’s really minor criticism.\n\nA special shout-out to sound and music. Every object has its very fitting signature sound and every scene its own environment sound which really sets the atmosphere with the gorgeous renderings, the icing on the cake is a symphonic soundtrack perfectly capturing the mood and mystery.\n\nAs for the story, it seems I have played, read and watched a number of variants of it before, but it gives you enough motivation to carry on puzzling and never gets cringeworthy, thanks to the solid voice acting.\n\nAll in all it’s apparent how much effort went into that game as is obvious on all the little details: There are cobwebs swaying gently in the wind, ants crawling on rocks in the wild, particles dancing in the air and each interaction with inventory items has a fitting animation: You can watch nails getting hammered in or doors getting pried open. On top, every single UI element is lovingly placed and animated. In short, this game has its visuals, sound and gameplay polished passionately.\n\nIf you have any interest in adventure games, puzzle games then Portal of Evil is a quaffable and formidable experience. I enjoyed it a lot so far!","June 19, 2015","true","7.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Since her grandfather is missing Vanessa goes there for information.  She is also having terrible nightmares and day-mares and hopes Father Benedict can answer those questions too.  Father Benedict explains her family and ultimately she is a part of the secret organization, the Order of Light.  It is the organization's task and hers to prevent demonic evil from entering this world through a gate door.  Vanessa embarks on a quest to return the four runic seals stolen form the door and to find her missing grandfather who was/is chasing the traitor thief.\n\nGameplay:  This plays very well with amazing cutscenes.  There are ultimately 5 areas with subareas which break down into 8 chapters, plus the epilogue bonus chapter.  The first area is the cathedral from which 4 other areas open via a portal, and another area for the bonus chapater.  Warning: while searching for the grandfather's letters (scrolls) make sure to find all of them in a given area, since once the runic seal is found Vanessa is instantly teleported to the gate door and there is no longer access to that area.\n\nThe game is quite a bit point and click, with some different puzzles types from the standard fare (several quite difficult slides in that "keeping track of where the pieces are supposed to go type" of way).  The HO scenes are of two types: 1) the normal list with a use object (highlighted in red on the find list) and a sub/hidden HO scene with more objects (highlighted in blue on the find list). 2) A reverse list called "It goes where?"  In this HO the gamer puts the clue items (pictures) on their "list" into the HO scene.  For example: A glove on the list would be placed next to its mate to make a pair.  A very different type of HO perspective and the reverse of a standard find.  Note: the reverse HO scene (placing objects into a HO scene) does count toward the Eagle Eye Achievement (find all clues in 1 minute or less).  {Much discussion about this achievement in the threads, and I am unsure whether or not all achievements are possible in a single playthrough.  I personally cannot do this the first time nor do I try to ever get this particular achievement the first time.}  I think every scene gets played twice first as a reverse scene by adding objects then secondly as a straight clue list find.\n\nI think the cutscenes are excellent.  There are quite a few, especially when meeting and talking with the characters.  The game is slightly interactive in that regard since the characters give exposition as well as clues.  If a character is there click on them, and in one case where the character does not leave click on them at least twice to get all the information and clues needed for that particular area.\n\nThis is fairly difficult and relatively long Hidden Object game.  The only real difference when playing on "expert" mode is the lack of sparkles on the HO scenes and the skip feature on the puzzles.  There is an in-game strategy guide so there should be no problems if the gamer gets stuck.  The no-penalty fast travel map comes in handy when looking for missed non-sparkling HO scenes.  There is back and forth travel between the portal world and the real world while figuring out how to get that area's runic seal.\n\nThe only extra find are grandfather's letters in the form of a scroll, 15 in total.  The scrolls are easy to locate and are not "hidden" in the least.  As I warned before find all the scrolls in a particular portal area before leaving by taking the runic seal since portal areas lock at completion and cannot be reentered.\n\nAll in all an excellent game to play.","September 30, 2015","true","10.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The introduction video, the design of the first few scenes and the basic premise all sound and look exciting.\n\nThe plot is fairly basic: the protagonist discovers that her family is part of a secret order, and now it’s up to her to gather four mysterious artefacts before an unexplained evil enters our world. There is some attempt for a few twists with the introduction of a traitor, but apart from the very end, the story pretty much disappears after the starting area.\n\nInitially, most hidden object scenes and puzzles feel fresh, exciting. Then you slowly realise that just like in the story, most ideas were used up in the starting sequence.

The graphics and actual HOGs are fine, and the voice-acting is only moderately bad.  I found the game to be weak in two areas.  First, the story is senseless.  Sure, our heroine has to find the stolen runes or bad things will happen.  So, that's reasonable.  The problem is that there's no reason for the bad guy to have stolen them in the first place (I can't see that he'll get anything out of the situation) and once stolen, since only a van Helsing can travel the portals, there shouldn't have been any way to put them where they were.  The second issue is that the puzzles swing wildly between ridiculously, trivially easy, to bash-my-head-against-the-desk hard.  I'd have much preferred more HOGs and fewer puzzles.  But, that's a personal issue.  Anyway, I got 7.9 hours of decent gameplay out of it (6.3 hours in the main game, 1.3 hours in the bonus chapter, and an additional 0.3 hours getting my final Achievement).  So, I'd say the game is worth it even at its current list price of about $6.","October 28, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are fan of the genre I would definitely recommend this. You play as Vanessa, trying to find several “seals” that seal off a door which prevents evil from entering the world. Not a ground breaking story, but it’s told well and I was into it. There are a solid number of cutscenes to move the story along.\n\nThe puzzles and overall point & click part of the game is very well done. The puzzles are not too difficult but still make you think. The variety is good but I feel like there were too many “rotate these things to match” puzzles. Point & click aspect is great! You can move around the world quickly as the transitions from screen to screen are quick. There are lots of items for you to collect and use. There are times where you need to backtrack to find a HO puzzle that wasn’t there before. However, you have a map that will show you where an action is available and you can even fast travel there.\n\nI would recommend playing this on “Expert” difficulty. The only thing that changes is the removal of the little sparkles showing you where things are. I initially started the game on “Normal” but found that it took away all the fun to be shown where things were at.\n\nArt, environments and music in the game are very good. Each world is detailed, sharp and has a feeling of uniqueness. No world feels like another.\n\nPros\n+Point and click elements are solid\n+Puzzles not too difficult\n+Hidden object scenes are fun\n+Story is told well\n+Great environments, art and music\n+Save and exit at anytime\n+60 FPS\n\nCons\n+Voice acting is bad\n+Abrupt ending\n\nPortal of Evil is an overall solid HO/Point and click game. It is relatively short with a good degree of difficulty. A great addition to the genre.\n\n7.5/10\n\n","March 18","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vardulon/recommended/361850/","Vardulon","vardulon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vardulon/","1973 products in account","Portal of Evil opens with Vanessa Helsing discovering that her grandfather Abraham has gone missing, and quickly thereafter learning that her family is part of an ancient order tasked with protecting the world from a demon invasion through the titular doorway.  This quest takes her first through the bowels of the fake Vatican, then to a series of ancient times, where the door's seals have been spirited to by a mysterious villain. It's a great premise, and the game makes good use of it, switching from time to time and location to location, ensuring that the player will never have a chance to get overly familiar with a given location.\n\nNow, how about some Hidden Object Criteria?!\n\nCriteria 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?\n\nOh god, it's bad. Really bad. The first screen I came across was set in the garden of the almost-Vatican, and it was just a mess. Random, out-of-nowhere objects tossed on every surface, hanging off of walls, seemingly hovering in mid-air. Throughout the church location, there's screen after screen of items that have no reason to be together in places that shouldn't be messy, dropped on the screen to create a completely arbitrary obstacle. The game does much better with its historical locations, keeping anachronisms to a minimum and developing much more logical item placement. Still, it's about as mixed a bad as one can get.\n\nCriteria 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?\n\nIt's all standard 12:1 gameplay, I'm sorry to report. The screen might be well-drawn, but the developers haven't done a great job of giving me a reason to go scrounging through them. Even worse, its features an object placement screen for every HOS. While I can understand the appeal of these screens in theory, they just don't make sense within the world of the game. Where did I get this armful of items I'm placing with others on the screen? Why on Earth am I doing it? Maybe someday a game will combine these two types of puzzle screens, and have me pick up 12 random items on one screen and then use them to complete 12 broken items on the next, but until they do, I'll keep judging these screens harshly. It's called the HOG genre for a reason, people, and it's not because I'm supposed to be putting angel statues together.\n\nI don't know why, but the angel statues turn up a lot.\n\nCriteria 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?\n\nIt's actually a fairly well-structured narrative. While I may have been hard on some of the HOS design, it's all in service of a good story that moves relatively quickly. Likewise, the puzzles all fit fairly well into the story - Vanessa moves exclusively through ancient hideouts and secretive enclaves, so the elaborate traps and locks all don't come anywhere near stretching believability. Also, the game features two of the easiest puzzles I've ever encountered in the history of Adventures. They're so easy they barely count as puzzles. It's actually quite remarkable.\n\nPortal of Evil offers a strong story with acceptably solid gameplay to support it. The HOSs could have been tighter, and a couple of the puzzles are a little more finicky than I'm used to, but the hint/skip button recharges quickly enough that it's never really a problem. The problem arises in a puzzle that turns up in the bonus chapter - which by the way, isn't really a bonus chapter at all, it's really just the end of the story. I can't stress enough that this game's story, without the bonus chapter, is not complete, and releasing a version of the game without it would just be insane. Back to the problem - there's a keypad-based puzzle that's flat-out broken. Vanessa encounters two halves of the code, but when she enters them into the pad, they don't do a thing. I entered them half a dozen times, but couldn't get a reaction - sure that I'd done something wrong, I finally skipped the puzzle, only to discover that I'd had the right numbers in the right order - the game just refused to acknowledge them for some reason.\n\nIt absolutely a decent game and I have no problem recommending it, but don't be afraid to use the skip button here and there.","March 21","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the puzzles were surprisingly hard and there were quite a lot of them! The artwork was very pleasing and even the animations didn't make me cringe. There was a good balance between hard and easy puzzles.\n\nI skipped the story parts. It was something about an arch bishop blah blah blah. Naturally I couldn't care less. It's not like anyone plays these games for the riveting storytelling. Surely not? Because that would be sad.","May 9","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
