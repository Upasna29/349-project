"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/351150/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Dragon stands out with a very inspirational do-it-yourself approach that gets my own creative juices going, and makes me want to create in turn. The rough but very personal style of hand drawn, hand colored sprites and backgrounds compliment a very old school approach to action platforming, the way we remember it best.\n\nTo no one's surprise the human authorities of this world exert their power over the weak with an iron fist, and our easy-going couch-potato of a dragon is the perfect target for the king's misguided aggression. Dragon, however, would like nothing more than to just relax at his girlfriend's place, smoking his pipe and winding down with some good old fashioned trashy daytime television. In an effort to ruin Dragon's day and to hinder the breeding of more of his kind, the king and his reluctant guards take off with the love of his life.\n\nThe map features multiple paths to tackle at your discretion each offering a different style of progression to accommodate all types of players. Some will take you through action packed routes with loads of enemies to fight your way through, while other pathways will take you on more puzzle-based routes where you'll figure your way through using brains as opposed to brawn. Though the stages themselves may be more on the relaxing and often casual side, the bosses are anything but. With some seriously rad attack patterns that feel straight out of a 90's Treasure title, each boss offers an excellent variety in terms of the gimmick needed to defeat them and keeps you on your toes.\n\nPart of what really tickled my nostalgia about Dragon was the soundtrack; incredibly bright, happy, hummable melodies with plenty of rich retro bass all bringing me back to school weekends spent renting and playing the classic platformers of yesteryear. In particular the colorful and adventurous mood of the game combined with light RPG mechanics brought me great memories of the Wonder Boy series, and our scaly protagonist -almost- even makes this feel like a nod to Dragon's Curse (one of the greatest of the greats).\n\nDragon isn't going to challenge the more hardcore of gamers and it certainly isn't going to provide hours of gameplay, but as a simple sidescroller it's a wonderful escape into a magical and humorous setting. The very personalized approach to the game's art creates a very relaxing and nostalgic mood, and especially for those with kids is something worth checking out just to witness how much love and fun can be put into the creative process of game making. It shows that making a game shouldn't be always about perfection, and more about the amount of enjoyment put into making it. Playing Dragon left me with a satisfying urge to go out and create art of my own, and that's a feeling that's rare for me these days.","April 25, 2015","true","5.1"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","53","58","0","0"

That has to be the worst trailer in the history of mankind and probably cost the devs a lot of sales, it does not do this game justice at all.\n\nI went in expecting absolute crap, and instead got a fairly solid (if super easy), bug-free game with great music.  It took less than 3 hours to get all but 5 secrets and beat the game, I imagine finding those and getting everything else might take another 1 hour or less, minus any mindless searching.\n\nThe art style put me off at first, but by the end of the game I kind of liked it.  No voice acting, thankfully!\n\n7/10, a pleasant surprise.","May 17, 2015","true","3.6"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

Areas that don't make a lot of sense, and natural direction does not apply here.\n-Odd bouts with difficulty at times. When I think the game was hard, it turned easy, and vice versa. Difficulty curves take weird spikes and valleys.\n-UI elements don't stand out.\n-Overall, a feeling of something missing in terms of a knockout punch.\n\nIn the end, the charm really stands out, as the style and the overall feel really make the game an enjoyable experience, even with all the problems that the game has. If you're looking for a “good” game experience in terms of mechanics and platforming, then it's not this. But you want a nice experience with some alright gameplay? Yes, DRAGON does the job.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/351150/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4250 products in account","This is a game which is firmly mediocre but shoots for the stars. A lot of really neat ideas are in here, but the execution is lacking. Or horrendously buggy. One of those two. DO NOT assume I am calling the game crap, but I don't really recommend it in the state that it was in as I played it.\n\nThe hand-drawn/crayon-style art is really, really inconsistent. On some stages (the air force base comes to mind), the whole thing gels really well and you get a unique appearance that I can't think of a good comparison for. On others (pretty much any kind of indoor stage), it is horrendous as at least one layer of scrolling is nothing but [solid color on uneven construction paper scan]. The sprites themselves don't seem to follow any real guidelines either, and in a few cases it's really challenging to determine what's foreground, enemy, or just random detail.\n\nI'm gonna spin out of that into what is probably one of the game's worst levels, spent climbing a massive tree. It's the perfect example of the game's myriad flaws in one place: Ranged enemies can fire at you from offscreen with no visual cue to their existence, with you having absolutely no way to know they exist until an arrow/cymbal/etc. flies into you mid-leap. Incredibly tight platforming with controls not meant for it (one in particular is either something I was either doing wrong, or demanded surprising precision from you for a game with such floatiness of movement). Enemies who have suspiciously large hitboxes, resulting in cheap hits when you try getting near to attack them*. Objects which appear to be part of the background, but in fact cause damage on contact.\n\nEven if you want to tell me I screwed up in that one, it doesn't change that the game IS poorly coded. A game with such minimal specs as this should not be having random moments of slowdown/lag on my computer. At least once, I fell through a level into the void, but did not die, leaving me to have to force-quit the game and restart, as there's no "exit level" function. The final boss is a real mess, with at least one attack being wildly inconsistent as to whether or not you can dodge it or not**, then proceeding to kill him left a booming laser sound effect playing over the entire ending, THEN the game crashed mid-credits.\n\nDesign-wise, it's also got some problems. More than once an enemy did a perfect 180 into attacking me with no tell, sometimes flipping themselves around (and bringing the already-in-progress attack) to hit me when I tried leaping past. I don't know if some animations have bugged frames, but at least a few times I just had projectiles spawn in my skull all of a sudden. Most, but not all, enemies end up in a stun animation when you attack them, leading the ones that can still move/strike you while flashing to be real nasty tricks the first time they appear. Basically, it's that inconsistency at work again - you think you know the rules it plays by until you suddenly don't.\n\nI get it and all, the game is basically one dude's passion project with some help from friends, but it doesn't excuse the game just having huge problems. Wait for a sale, wait for a patch, just... yeah. I do not advise leaping on this game.\n\n* In the game's defense, I probably should have used the breath weapons more around these jerks, except for the fact that more than a few enemies would just seem to be immune to them. Which was also a crapshoot.\n** This is not hyperbole. Said attack is a left-to-right sky laser which you are supposed to be able to shut down by shooting a target in time. The problem is that even if you do so before the laser even shows up, the speed at which it vanishes is inconsistent as all get out, and sometimes it will vanish after covering every single inhabitable part of the screen - meaning you are guaranteed to take a hit. Someone else on the game's forums mentioned this being an issue for them too, giving me proof that at least some of this is a known quantity.","May 31, 2015","false","2.4"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/recommended/351150/","celtic7guardian","Celtic7Guardian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/","1158 products in account","A true treasure among the dragon's hoard!\nDRAGON: A Game About a Dragon is indeed a game about a dragon. You play as Dragon, whose quest is to save his girlfriend from the king that kidnapped her. It has platforming and RPG elements, and several levels to go through. Many enemies await, along with a handful of boss fights.\n\nThat may sound like a simple premise, but this game is bursting with novel ideas and fantastic ways of executing them. I specifically requested it due to falling in love with the store pictures. This game has not gotten much attention, and it deserves far more. Look below to see why!\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are one of the greatest things about this game. The entirety of DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon looks as if it was drawn in crayon. It looks like it is a children's picture book, and I mean that as a compliment. The balance of being drawn very well and having small "imperfections" to fit the look is awesome. Each object is properly outlined, so it is easy to tell what is what. With these graphics alone, this game has an atmosphere like no other.\nThe music is pretty good. There is a fair number of tracks and they are catchy. Some levels actually change music as the player goes from one section to another, which is something I don't see too often. I am especially fond of the track that plays at Dragon's home, though I like all of them.\nThe story is both hilarious and sweet. I really got a kick out of the humor, and I was touched by the friendships and romances shown. These elements go very well together and make for a memorable tale.\nIn a similar vein, the characters are excellent. It is easy to fall in love with the quirky and charming Dragon, which made me all the more determined to get him his happy ending. His friends get good development as well. While the hostile antagonists are not looked at as deeply, they are amusing and serve their purposes well.\nWhen it comes to the core gameplay, DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon is especially fun because you play as, well, a dragon. Being able to fly is glorious, but it is not broken since Dragon can only do it for limited amounts of time before landing. Having sharp claws to shred your opponents is nice. What's even better is having multiple breath weapons, including fire, ice, and lightning. You are not just a dragon because you look like one; you ARE one.\nThere are special items scattered throughout the levels that give Dragon permanent boosts to his stats or gold to buy level-ups. These items are often challenging to find, but in a good way. I never had to look up how to get them, yet I spent several minutes at times trying to figure out where some were hiding. In addition, there are some that require puzzles to be solved. These make good use of Dragon's breath weapons and the player's smarts.\nIn RPG-fashion, Dragon has stats that can be improved. Items and buying increases with gold will make Dragon even more impressive. The character sheet he has is both amusing and practical. The options are to raise attack, defense, and support, with support helping various abilities Dragon has. They can be raised at any point on the world map or in Dragon's home, so it is a convenient system too.\nThe two control schemes, for keyboard and controller, are easy to use. I played DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon with a PS3 controller, but I also tried out the keyboard, and it worked just as well. The controls are on point. I never had a death where I blamed the game for shoddy controls or unfair moments. That is what I look at for game controls, and I was satisfied here.\nEach level is unique and fun. They are well-sized, being neither too short or too long. Some possess multiple routes, and combined with the hidden collectables, they are great for replaying.\nLike the levels, the enemies in them are of a wide variety. Many of them are funny, such as the texting knights and dolphin-throwing beach ladies. Their attack patterns are different, and they help spice things up.\nThe bosses range in difficulty, with some being easy and others taking a few tries to get the hang of. They have good tells for what attacks they will use, but they do not have a set pattern. This makes it less of a game of memorization and puts emphasis on reacting in time to the tells.\nThere are 13 achievements, and they range from decent difficulty to being somewhat hard. I like this level of difficulty in achievements. It felt as if I actually worked to get them, rather than being given them by default, and I have not found any too frustrating.\nIf playing as a dragon is not enough incentive on its own, take this in: there is a wool union. That's right, a group of sheep striving for liberation is the deadliest enemy in the game. Their leader even has a beret!\nNeutral:\nSome of the hints on what players need to do to get items are a bit obscure. I was fine with this, as I found that they all made sense. Some players might find it frustrating to have a lack of clues, though.\nThe world map has a fantastic feature of checking off levels players have fully completed, meaning you won't get confused over where to look for missing items. Props also for having the story segments being replayable and skippable. However, I found the PS3 controller was not very good at navigating it. You have to use the analog stick instead of the directional arrows, which was more difficult for me. The keyboard handles it better, but I didn't want to switch over to it just for an easier map screen.\nThere are trading cards. They have cute drawings and are nice collectables.\nCons:\nWhen the controls are listed on the screen, they flicker between the keyboard controls and controller controls. Most games I have played would default to one or the other depending on what I was currently using. The flickering got annoying at times, though it only came up in certain places.\nThere were a couple of loading points that lagged for me. I am not sure whether it was the game or my computer, but my computer tends to run most games pretty well, so I think it is a safe guess that the game is partially at fault. It is not even close to being a deal breaker, but it is worth noting.\nDragon can't use his claws or breath weapons while in midair. I keep instinctively trying to do so, only to fail because he has to be on the ground before he can attack. There are no points in the game where it is a necessary feature, but it would have been nice to have that option.\nOverall experience:\n\nThis was one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have had in a long while. The unique atmosphere of DRAGONS: A Game About a Dragon is going to keep it firmly in my mind. I still need to fully complete it, but when I finish that, I plan to play through it again so I can show it to some of my friends. I really wanted to play this game so I could give it more exposure, and I hope this review helps with that.\n\nRating:\n\n9/10. It's a beautiful, funny, charming, adorable, and overall wonderful game. It is tragic that it has barely been noticed in comparison to so many other Steam games. Do yourself a favor and buy DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon for its absolutely reasonable price. This game is very much worth the purchase.\n\nLooking for more great indie games?

Hand drawn 2D platforming styled rpg is a great way to describe the game.\n\nYou play as Dragon (Duh, who else would you play as) and your girlfriend has been kidnapped by the King and  you must venture forth and save her. Also, Dragon seems to be puffing the magic dragon if you know what I mean (You'll see when you finish a level) so he may be a little lazy.\n\nAs the story progresses you make your way through hand drawn crayon colored art and earn new abilities and skills. In my short adventure I earned the ability to breath lightening and ice! Each has it's own benefits, for instance the lightening will stun mechanical enemies.\n\nAfter some levels you will find yourself reading, a lot. Which I haven't decided if it's a good or bad thing. I'm leaning toward good, but I'd like to have seen it with voice overs. Maybe just a narrator.\n\nThe controls are pretty straight forward, but a little slow. The inability to attack while in the air or jumping is frustrating to me.\n\nHere's a clip of the First Look!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VzIMzMFgBq4\n\nFor $5.99 though, I think this is a must play. The art style is just great, the story is funny and cute, and the gameplay is passable.

Given that this is a game featuring graphics that look like children's drawings, this made me feel even more repulsed. Was I, in fact, playing a game about a dragon that was drawn specifically to be masturbated to? It turns out that the dragon is a dragon who VAPES WEED AND WATCHES DAYTIME TELEVISION AND GETS HARASSED BY THE MAN, but the damage was already done. "Am I playing a thing that weirdos jerk it to?" was the thing that stuck in my head as I played through it.\n\nIn case you're wondering, the game itself is pretty mediocre and unrefined. The developer had a nice thing going with his 'children's drawings' schtick, but that didn't immediately translate to 'what can be jumped on' when it comes to platforming, because the developer didn't bother to differentiate between the two states. So you'll be wandering around the game, trying through trial and error to determine what can be jumped on and what cannot be jumped on, which is REALLY GOOD PLATFORM GAME DESIGN.\n\nHey, you know what people love to do with cutscenes? Read them, because this game is like a children's book, for adults! (which is why it's been advertised on e621). So have all the words! Have all the words in your cutscene, dogg! That's what they're there for!\n\nAlso there's a bunch of obligatory RPG mechanics, just in case you can't hack the insane difficulty of jumping over and running past enemies. But upgrading is a tedious and annoying exercise that requires you to run back into your house, smoke some Puff The Magic Dragon, and stare at a character sheet with too much 'character-building' on the screen while it asks you to choose between trading in some gold for more HP, more flying time, or more dragon breath. Instead of, you know, pressing a button on the map screen and going to that directly.\n\nSo it's a game that's trying to be "Go The ♥♥♥♥ To Sleep" without realizing that the only people who think VAPING POT IS EDGY in 2015 are shut-in Christians and possibly babies, and has also been advertised to people who presumably like to jerk it to dragons (among other fictional and non-fictional animals). If you are not one of these people, you are hereby excused from playing. Go in peace.","November 9, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","19","3","16","4","3"

Do you enjoy hand drawn animation? Are games based on a labor of love your thing? Then look no further than DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon. This game, while not perfect, is a real gem, it comes highly recomended*.\n\nNote the * - the first time I installed this game, it crashed constantly. Re-installing it fixed this issue for me; however, your mileage may vary.\n\nAs far as games go, this one's a real charmer. Lovingly hand-illustrated drawings done in crayon, the visual aesthetic is not unlike that of a children's book. This, combined with the tongue-in-cheek humor sets a whimsical tone for a very casual, pick up and play experience that anyone can enjoy.\n\nWhile the game mostly progresses in a linear fashion, the player is able to go through the game at their pace. While this game is 2D platformer, it has both "Metroidvania" and RPG element infused within it. Basically, what this means is that the player is always given an option to set their own difficulty levels. For example, if you're having trouble with a boss, go back and explore the levels to find any hidden treasures / upgrades you may have missed and level up. Or, if the player is wanting more of a challenge, they are able to face any of the enemies head on.\n\nThis is my first review of a game - numerical values / scores are arbritrary, so I'll simply post my final verdict on it.\n\nI'm glad I gave it a second chance, as the lovely visuals, charming music, and wonderful world and characters have won me over. Also, you get to play as a dragon, which is always good times. Is it for everyone? Of course not, but then no game truly is.  Is it good value for the $5.99 pricetag? Absolutely. There's a lot of game in DRAGON, and even more love.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If you like dragons, hand-drawn 2D platformers, and adjustable gameplay, go pick it up.","November 23, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only problem I had was that at times the controls would stop responding, which is only a problem while going for some achivments (Boss fights without taking damage).\n\nMusic; 8/10 Great little sound track with a nice blend of music, can be a bit repetitive after a while. I wish they made it available for purchase!\n\nGraphics; 8.5/10 Hand drawn graphics are easy on the eyes, its like looking into a coloring book.\n\nStory; 6/10 Basic level of in depth of characters, most of the 'enemy' figures are actually friends with you. I felt that there was a lack in detail, but other then that its ok. Story was simple and to the point.\n\nGameplay; 8/10 Gameplay was enjoyable, with unique level design and enemy type, however there was a large lack of melee based enemies, most were ranged. Boss fights are simple if you learn the patterns, but are random in attacks. Also lots of easter-eggs within the game itself.\n\nReplayability; 3/10 Once you beat the game and seen both endings, there is little else to do other than achivments.\n\nIn the end it only took me about 2.5 hours to beat the game start to finish, and get 12/15 of the achivments, so if you wanted you could try to get a refund for the game if you did a speed run, but I don't think I will, for some reason it has a nice charming feeling for a game of its size.\n\nOverall Ranking; 7/10 Above Average.\n\nWorth the $6? Yep.","July 8, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
