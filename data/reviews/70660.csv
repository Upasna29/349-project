Or at least Team17 seems to have thought it reached that point, because over the years they have been releasing various games in the Worms series which are not in fact anything like the core Worms games. Among these is Worms Pinball, which as the title would have you believe, is a pinball game themed around the characters and themes of franchise.\n\nI don't feel I need to explain how to actually play pinball (that should be common knowledge), as the real question is "is this a GOOD pinball game?" The answer to that is, maybe when it was originally released, but not anymore. In the over a decade long span between then and now, digital pinball has improved exponentially and left Worms in a painfully dated time capsule of what pinball games used to be like. The laughable physics, inhibiting camera angles, and single table to play on are typical of the time it was released, but now that isn't anywhere near good enough.\n\nIf it was drastically cheaper, there is a small part of me that would recommend this to huge Worms fans as a mildly amusing novelty, but at its current price it feels like an insult. With so many other, far better pinball games to choose from (Pinball FX2 and Pinball Arcade come to mind), there is no reason to so much as glance at Worms Pinball. As far as Worms goes, this is one game that should have stayed in the ground.","April 15, 2014","false","0.4"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","34","42","0","0"

The reason why I can't in good conscience recommend that you spend a lot of time on it, is that it's so old by now that it competes against so much better games. You can find better pinball games on your cellphone - for free, with better graphics, and QoL improvements like not having to configure the controls from Windows Explorer (not really a problem, but shows how abandoned the game is).\n\nI'm sure someone will find it enjoyable, but IMO your time is better spent elsewhere.

I doubt there is any spoken text in the game. Don't know about sound cues. Visual feedback is a bit poor.\n\nCons: Max resolution is 1024x768 with 65536 colours. It is still playable.\nOn some system configurations flickering may occur randomly like a stroboscope, causing headaches.\nPhysics feels off. Often it feels like gravity has been cranked down a few notches, making the game feel strangely slow. And yet, in some loops the ball feels like it's accelerated to beyond light speed. Good luck!\nMost of the hits tend to be biased towards the center, makes aiming to the edges of the table rather difficult.\nVisual feedback of the ball hitting things is poor, making it seem like magic sometimes when a ball changes direction!\nThere is no 'pull the plunge', pressing enter just insta-shoots the ball away.\nThe game only has one table.\nPros: The table concept is attractive. Now if Pinball FX2 could copy this...\nSome missions in the game are interesting. There are a few minigames included.\nThe art quality is nice and must've been decent for its time.\nNice to see the evolution of pinball games. (Anyone remember Pinball Dreams?)\nConclusion:After having played Pinball FX2 for a while, this game is quite a downgrade. But then, it's from 1998! Only recommended if you're feeling nostalgic.\n\nIf you manage to get this as part of a cheap bundle, go ahead! Otherwise it might be a waste of money because it's so dated.\n\nIf you want a real pinball game for modern systems, I can recommend Pinball FX2 instead.","December 21, 2014","false","1.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

Nothing more. There is very little content here, even for a pinball game from the late 90s. While the one and only table available manages to embody the Worms theme from the developer's main line of games, the physics are floaty and everything seems to be running in slow motion, especially if you compare it to other much more competent pinball games of the era, such as Epic Pinball.

The pads are responsive, the physics are decent, all the ramps and pits are accessible with just enough practise, and the old-school Worms 1 theme adds the perfect amount of nostalgia factor to make you revisit it from every now and then.\n\nWhat is atrocious though and makes part of me want to give it a thumbs down, is the price. This one used to be called Addiction Pinball with an additional table (featuring a now-forgotten Team 17 game, ‘World Rally Racing’, an even better table) and cost less on disc at release than this one on Steam now.\nIf you can grab it in a bundle, do so, but I highly advise against actually purchasing it even at half discount.","September 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

It's a good table and I had fun playing it, but the fact still stands that it's only one. It's a pretty bare-bones game outside of that one table, too. There aren't many options, and nothing tells you the controls (Enter to launch the ball, Shift keys for the flippers - pretty decent pinball controls, actually). It plays well enough for pinball, and it's fun for a little while. The different modes and events are neat, and I never ran into any slowdown or crashes or other such issues. I could waste an hour or two playing this quite contently. But the fact that it's $8 by itself is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can download Pinball FX2 right now on Steam for $0 and get one table for FREE. That table has online leaderboards, it'll tell you your controls, you can use a controller, and it has multiple camera angles, AND you can get extra tables for $3 for one or $10 for four. Worms Pinball would be fairly priced at a dollar or two. But $8 is ludicrous.

It's only 1 table, but it's a pretty good table. Like any good pinball game/table it starts out somewhat tough, but when you get so you have some control of the ball and knowledge of the table you'll be racking up some high scores. Keep in mind it's from the late '90s, so your options are limited, and may not work on newer setups. I have an older computer I play some old games on (an HP I bought in 2005 with Windows XP), and this game works perfectly on there. On my newer PC I play Pinball Arcade and Pinball FX2, and I recommend those games more, but I'm surprised how much I've enjoyed Worms Pinball when taking breaks from some old games on my old PC.","December 18, 2014","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was first packaged under the title Addiction Pinball and was bundled with at least one other table, a car theme I believe.  Back in 1998 most pinball on a computer was 2D and ran from DOS.  Team 17s 2 tables were welcomed by me.  The thing now is that they, or whoever controls these titles, just dumped them back onto the consumer without any of the simplest of revisions that never came way back when.  How about controller support?  And I see the weird color glitch comes back after you have played some and the only way to clear it is ito esc back to menu and then continue the game; and no I am not using the same PC from back in 1998.\n\nI Liked it more back then\nDisappointed someone feels the need to charge without offering something more.

This game was developed in the late 90s, an era where pinball simulators were popular in computers and other game systems as a consequence of the significant computer graphics evolution to bring more "realistic" experiences. I remember to play the demo version of the game back in 1998 and enjoying the short experience.\n\nOf course by being a pinball simulator this means there is nothing else to be expected so the game obeys to its name and purpose. People that are expecting the classical mechanism of Worms' games are being naive as this is a real spin-off.\n\nSo without big surprise, Worms Pinball is a game for casual and short gameplay. I can only recommend this game to people that are Worms and/or Pinball fans that are ok to kill around 30 minutes of time entertaining themselves. Because in a real scenario it is a game that you will get bored quickly. And people that are smart enough will NEVER pay full price for a near 20-year old simulator that doesn't offer more than what the name implies. Buy it for the cheapest possible if you are really interested in keeping it.","May 25","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is shooting in this game on the back screen panel with the worms fighting other creatures. When you loose a ball the worm in the back screen panel demonstrates how to kill your self with TNT. The music is old school and great. The ball movement is well done. I suggest this little gem to an casual player that enjoys a old fashioned classic pinball game.

I alt-f4'd out of it and it glitched my Steam client until I resized it for some reason, which happened every time I exited the game.  There was no keybindings options to see if I could rebind the flipper keys.  The game was flickering nonstop.

All the classic pinball elements which you'd expect are there. An interesting table layout, a couple of multiballs, various modes with different objectives, nice ramp and orbit shots. Unfortunately, pinball emulation in 1998 was just not that sophisticated and that is ultimately what lets Worms Pinball down. The flippers are slow to respond, the physics are totally inaccurate and the visuals are just not very pretty. It's a shame because the theme is executed perfectly and if it were a real table it would be a blast to play. The callouts and sounds are great, the dot matrix animations are well done and the playfield design is cool.

In 1964 Williams was acquired by jukebox manufacturer Seeburg Corp. and reorganized as Williams Electronics Manufacturing Division. In 1973, the company branched out into the coin-operated arcade video game market with its Pong clone Paddle Ball. In 1974, Williams Electronics, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Seeburg and replaced the previous entity. In 1987, Williams changed its parent name to WMS Industries, Inc. when it made its public offering. WMS is a shortening of Williams, which it also selected for its NYSE ticker symbol. In 1988, it acquired competitor Bally/Midway, which it spun off in 1998, together with its video game business.

No tutorial or controls! It isn't shown in there. Are you supposed to guess the keys on the keyboard? I know that this is an old game, but still.\n\nNothing strange about resolutions. All(3) are 4:3 ratio and max is 1024x768. I can accept old graphics, but this game sucks when you exclude them!\n\nYou use number keys to change cameraview - in my case not the numpad keys. The actual controls are these keys:\nLeft Shift = left side, Right shift = right side, Enter = launch the ball.\n\nYour score is not shown until you die. And when it shows up, you can only enter 3 letters for you highscore name. Guess, how do you enter them?! Shift! Yeah! You start with three A and you press shift until the wanted letter shows up. Then you confirm with Enter! It is oldschool, but also very annoying!\n\nWhen you change camera, music stops playing. There is only one track, but still. Also some worms sounds trigger by your actions.\n\nWhen you lose the ball, you have to wait like 10s for the next ball or the announcement of your loss. Again, really annoying.\n\nAlso, the background of the pinball table is confusing me. It makes it harder to see, where to shoot/aim.\n\nI'm not wasting my time with this game.\n\nTL:DR This game is garbage, avoid it.","August 22, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it is on sale though, it is a very fun pinball game.

There is only one table, but I like it a lot. The ball rarely goes down the sides or the middle, it is well designed in that sense and the controls are responsive. You feel like your skill level counts, and there's lots of cool little mini-games and ways to score points. The music is great, the theme is classic, and it is a great way to fill 5 minutes when bored. I'm a happy owner, but then again I loved this game when I got it as a kid.

It was probably an ok pinball game for it's time, but fails in comparison to more modern pinball machines with missions and such. The controls are not too bad, and there is a side flipper on the far left lane so you don't feel too cheated. The table bumping isn't implemented that well. Also there were display issues with the score and otherwise. Inability to map buttons, that they don't bother telling you. Other pinball games of the day were more engaging. It's just not worth the 2 bucks.","July 12, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm assuming that it also runs at 30 fps because it did not look too smooth.\n\nFor some reason there is a loading screen after every menu, so it takes two loading screens to get to the graphics menu, another two to confirm if you wanted to change resolution, and another two to get back and play the game. There are also no sound options so you will have to adjust in your OS if you wanted to listen to music while playing.","October 6, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
