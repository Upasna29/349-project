However, I didn't anticipate the other horrid aspects of this game. Although Democracy 2 is riddled with small problems that deter it from being a good game many of them can be overlooked - two of them cannot. The first of the two is the messy UI. It's more than user-unfriendly, it's difficult to navigate even after you've mastered the game which makes for a awkward gaming experience. The second of the two issues is a much bigger issue that keeps this game from realizing its potential. The policies you institute in game do not demonstrate logical cause and effect. Why does making alcohol, prostitution and narcotics illegal DECREASE organized crime? If anything this should create a blackmarket for the illegal goods and make organized crime GO UP! A lot of time went into this game, but it seems to lack the deep thought necessary to create a political sim.

This is a game that is over 4 years old now, and still costs 20 dollars. It's ridiculous! Second, many of the in-game options are unbalanced. I have been assassinated, by environmentalists, when I had a carbon tax and strong anti-pollution regulations. Most importantly, I find, the amount of actual changes you can make besides different degrees of neoliberal capitalism is very low. You can't have any kind of socialism(Social democracy is very attainable, but the closest thing to a leftist ideology in the game, and it's still capitalist.), you can't abolish the government, and limited government doesn't work great either. You can't really have fascism either.\n\nEven the sequel to this game(Democracy 3) is still plagued by many of these problems, but slighty less so. If you really want a game like this, just skip this one and get Democracy 3, but the entire series isn't the best, I find. There isn't a really high amount of replayability, either, it all gets to be the same pattern, for me.

I'll give you an example.\nSay that I'm the Labour Party. The Labour party does not make decisions based upon the Daily Mail, but rather based upon their fat cat union paymasters. So when the Labour party starts to impliment these Union policies the Daily Mail doesn't like it and SENDS OUT HITMEN TO KILL THE PRIME MINISTER. The same could be said when playing as a liberal, although you would have to add THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND to the list. You know, the tame and timid church of dwindling numbers and no real passion? OK, OK, it may very well be Muslims, but it wasn't a masque that denounced me a month before my assassination.\n\nTry to impliment the policies you think are the best and you will be killed. Betray your voter base who wants these reforms and you may just get a coup from your ministers. Quite frankly, I agree with my ministers, I want to run a liberal government. It's just a shame that UKIP and the Church of England disagree, because it makes the game dull. To play you must now tow the center ground, pander to all groups and believe in nothing. DId Thatcher pander to socialists? She most certainly did not, nor did Reagan or the two Bush's. Where they assasinated by Socialists? NO?!? WHY THE HELL NOT?\nLet me put it this way, if Ed Miliband came in, do you really think he would listen to the 50 year old UKIP voters who read the daily mail and wouldnt vote for his party anyway, especially given that they dont give him any money? Of course not! So would he be assasinated? The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is not some bannana republic that was just liberated from the tenticles of spain and doesnt know how to run an election!\nWhat this game does allow you to do, is manage the budget, which is reletively easy to do since it devoted over 25% of the UK budget to the military. just reassign the funds. OH BUT YOU TOUCHED OUR PRECIOUS MILITARY, I'M SHOCKED! I'LL BE WRITING A STRONGLY WORDED ARTICLE TELLING OUR HITMEN TO GO FOR THE THROAT!\nI'm one of the only people devoted to politics you'll ever meet, so when I say this game is dreadful, that not even my latent interest in the topic was enough to carry me through, I god damn mean it.","August 2, 2013","false","1.4"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","2"

It's really just about familiarizing yourself with the relationships and dynamics of the various functions withi the game, and then 1) immediately fixing the emergency problems upon starting a new game, folllowed by 2) micro-managing and tweaking these elements, which doesn't change very much from game to game once you've taken care of #1 and have some general control over the country's economy.\n\nThe setup of these dynamics is interesting to examine, and doesn't seem overly simple at first.  But the more you play and see the interconnectedness of the various elements, the more it reveals itself to be simple.  And there's not really much gameplay on the top of everything.  Democracy 2 is good for a few hours of understanding these systems and general gameplay, at which point you end up wishing there were more functional achievements and a deeper game.

As an avid lover of paradox games, I really love to get involved in in-depth strategy games which involve hours of thinking, plotting, reviewing, controlling, etc. I felt like this game was simply a " click here to please the public" game , which required me to make choices to appease the public. I found it slightly frustrating that one problem would resolve, and then another problem would emerge. Graphically, it was not pleasing, nor was the gameplay particularly engaging(every turn you spend your limited "political capital" in order to enact policies, etc. The game was also difficult, but that was not a deterrent.\nMost importantly, I felt like the balancing and the hidden calculations in this game were not right. In other words, I was not convinced that the programmers had a solid understanding of politics, and/or economics.","February 2, 2014","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Try to make a society that works, and you will succeed.\nIf you're not into politics, this is NOT the game for you.\nEvery game you start with a solid debt and a boatload of problems that you have to get rid off. Without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off too many voters. It's a lot harder than it sounds.\nThere's no mercy in this game. If you ♥♥♥♥ off the voters, they'll punish you at once.\nA lot of what you can do has inertia effects, and may take up to two years to come to full effect. Most tax-fiddeling will be instantaneous though.\nYour cabinet gains (or loses) political power, which is what you use to pass laws.\nIf the public are dissatisfied you lose some, and if they're happy you gain some.\nAnd without it, it's very limited what you can change or do.\nTheres 10 different countries to play, and they all have different voters and problems.\nIf you're into modding and know a little programming, you can make your own countries, laws, events; and even choose your own voter behavior.\nYou win the game if you manage to stay in office the full number of periods you've chosen to play (1-10), and you lose by not getting re-elected or by reaching the maximun allowed debt (differs according to country).\nIt's not worth the full 20€ they want for it, but at 4.75 it's a pretty fun little game.","January 6, 2013","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ones that try often go for a grand scale (eg Supreme Ruler) and tend to fall flat. The only quite successful one which comes to mind is Shadow President. Democracy 2 is more confined than most, limiting the outside world and turning everything into sliders and charts. It's a nice try, but aspects of it really don't come off well at all.\n\nSuperficially, it seems quite good. The interface is fairly well designed, presenting most of your key info on a single screen - although the inability to change the resolution (leaving me, on a widescreen monitor, with either bits of the interface cut off or a window which can't be enlarged at all) is frustrating. There are a wide variety of potential policies, each with adjustable levels.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay doesn't hold up. It is far to easy to "game" the mechanics - just pour money into tech and universities and suddenly you are making massive income through technological advantage, which lets you build up everything else to win votes. The difficulty comes from random, arbitrary and unfair events. Random factors can completely decimate your popularity - slowly build up to an election winning lead over the course of years, then suddenly lose half your voters in one turn because the global economy drops.\n\nIt's also littered with grammatical errors, rather unfortunate for a game targeted at a more intellectual audience.\n\nI wanted to like it, but found it a frustrating and unsatisfying experience.","July 19, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
