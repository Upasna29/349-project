Of course I'm an ignorant American, so the culture is pretty much lost on me, but most of the characters seem overly racist just to shove the "don't be racist" message down your throat.\n- The characters' relationships either aren't explored much or just don't make any sense, I honestly don't know why the main character is friends with Zi-Jin, that's not to say that they shouldn't be friends, but their friendship/history just isn't explained very well. Maybe it's just me\n-Some scenes tend to drag on for quite a while unnecessarily, mainly the first cafeteria scene comes to mind.\n-The sound effects are always either bland or unfitting, and the ambience tends to abruplty stop and then loop, of course this isn't a big complaint, just thought I would mention it.\n\nThe game has good artwork, the voice acting sounds great, and while the majority of the game was mainly boring, it wasn't too bad and I've definitely played a lot worse.\n\nBottom line, if you want it for the history/satire aspect of the game, go for it, I'm sure you know a lot more than me. But don't get suckered in by the cute lolis and somewhat misleading trailer.","December 3, 2015","false","6.1"," 95 of 124 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","95","124","7","7"

To this day I can still feel the traumatic feeling of that tragedy.\n\nOkay enough for history, let's just get to the game.\nWhen I saw the game on Steam Greenlight, I voted NO! because I felt this dark history is far better explained by my fellow Indonesian. But It turn out to be wrong, just by playing this game I can see how Taiwanese see this event occured although I didn't know there is a racial issue happened against Chinese and Taiwanese.\n\nFor the introduction part, the game did introduce you with various Indonesia culture especially foods. And yeah that's also the social & political situation back in 1998.\n\nFor the tragedy part, the game really did depict Chinese Indonesian POV. Thought it should be rated R18+ cause the scene is gore.\nNB: People really died IRL (especially women), you can search for the NSFW images via google.\n\nSome points for improvement:\n- The game did have poor english translations but I have no problem at all (I know Chinese [中文]).\n- There is no ending credit/image. If you reach a bad ending, the game will just send you back to title screen.\n\nIf you come for the fun and lolis, I suggest that you stay away from this game.\nBut if you come to learn history or into dystopia, you can pick this game up.","December 6, 2015","true","12.6"," 81 of 110 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","81","110","6","2"

I rarley ever write reviews for Steam games but this game had touched my heart so much that i just had to write a review for it. With that said, i'll now actually talk about the game. Please do note that my review will contain spoliers.\n\nOkay at first i thought the game would be dark with its violence and such but i never thought that it would be this dark to the extreme. What i just witnessed in this game made my heart break and shatter. Yes i know it's just a video game but this game really did hit me hard in the heart. With all the ♥♥♥♥, violence and murder in the game i was just barley able to actually finish the game. The most evil and most heart touching moment of the game was when the Indonesians captured a woman named Miao Pin-Hong. This beautiful woman was stripped outdoors by the Indonesians while she was heavily pregnant and she was forced to be ♥♥♥♥♥ by a man while she was heavily pregnant. To make things worst, they cut open Pin-Hong's chest and stomach and took out her unborn baby from her body and hanged Pin-Hong high on a tree branch with her baby's umbilical cord as a countweight. Then the Indonesian gang group dropped the baby on the ground on purpose and it splattered and died instantly. The mother of the child Pin-Hong died a few seconds afterwards. Basically what i'm trying to say in this review is that do not play this game unless you have a very strong heart because the events that occurs in the game are just beyond dark and evil. For those of you who do decide to play this game, just please close your eyes and try to picture this happening to your close friends and family as well as yourself. I'm not afraid at all to admit that i actually did cry tears to this game. It may even cause nightmares...\nFinal verdict: Don't play the game if you can't handle things such as ♥♥♥♥, murders, cut up bodies and child abuse. The game is just way to dark and is definitely a game i will never forget for its dark story.\n\nEDIT: In a way i liked the game but disliked it at the same time. I liked it for how touching it is. To me a game that's really emotional and touches my heart means that it has has a really good story. The developers of this game made a good job at making us players get the feels for this story in deep but at the same time its darkness and evilness made me dislike it.","December 24, 2015","false","5.3"," 38 of 55 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","38","55","5","6"

I had absolutley zero knowledge about the 1998 Indonesian riots. I didn't even know the event had taken place. I bought the game because i saw someone say "massacre" and "gore" and I thought to myself "There's no way".\nWell, I got more than I bargained for, but i do not regret reading this at all.\n\nThe English translation is bad for the most part. Here's an example: "The god loves everyone equally. We ought to treaty everyone equally as well." It just sounds like someone who is just starting to learn English from another language.\nYou can still understand most of what's being said if you have enough reading comprehension, but i can understand why people would opt out because of this. However, Erotes has said they will work on the translation.\n\nThere is a lack of character development and relationship development. Most of the characters do not develope whatsoever through the course of the visual novel, and it only touches vaguely on how many of them have come to meet and know eachother. Honestly, you may still have your heart (or your stomach) broken regardless of this after the 2 hour introduction.\n\nOnce ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, the entire thing comes off as preachy. I've seen worse, but there were better ways to go about some of it. I myself may only think this because the event had nothing to do with me though. The developers however, have said that it had a large impact on their lives, so that obviously may effect how strongly they try to get their message accross.\n\nAnyways. The game is 7-8 hours long (really just depends on reading speed), seeing everything both from Yu-Chen's perspective and Yu-Chin's (as the second route). Until the translation is fixed, I don't believe that the game is worth $9.99 but it's definetly a steal at $4.99, so I would buy it while it's on sale if I were you.\n\nI do not regret buying and playing this one bit, and it's atrotious that it's based on a real event.\n","December 22, 2015","true","4.8"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","28","39","0","0"

Its got high production value, coupled with an evident amount of care and love. But a plethora of shortcomings and poor development choices run Mayjasmine into the ground before you can learn to appreciate it.\n\nYou play as Yu-Chen, a Taiwanese man who's seen some serious financial trouble back home. After being ripped off by his employer and losing almost all his wealth, Yu-Chen travels to Indonesia. An old high school friend, Zi-Jin, offers Yu-Chen a job at one of his many clothing factories. From there, you hope to earn enough money to return home. But something is clearly wrong in Indonesia. Racial tensions are extremely high between the Chinese and Indonesians, who harbor a great amount of distaste for one another. You'll be witnessing discrimination on a monumental level, and it's only a matter of time before violence ravishes the two ethnic groups.\n\nMayjasmine takes place during the Indonesian revolutionary riots of 1998. There is a lot of history told throughout this game, and if you know nothing about the subject (much like myself), a lot of dialogue is gonna go flying through one ear and out the other. If you want to get invested, I advise reading about some of the history online before jumping in. It might provide a basic outline for the story.\n\nOne thing I really must commend is Mayjasmine's artistic quality. Some extremely talented people were behind the production of this game. Characters and backdrops are teeming with detail and color, and it really is a sight for sore eyes. Alongside the fantastic art design is some fairly decent voice acting. Everyone plays their roles wonderfully.\n\nI really wish I had more to praise about Mayjasmine, but this game's mistakes seriously outshine the overall quality. First, the English translation is very poor. Words are clumped together multiple times, sentences are disjointed and sound silly, and there's plenty of misspellings to go around. It seriously hinders the story and makes it harder to take seriously. Speaking of story, it is EXTREMELY forced. The lessons and morals Mayjasmine tries to convey are way over the top. They might as well slap the words "DON'T BE A RACIST PRICK" across the screen at all times. It comes off as preachy and obnoxious, rather than subtle and realistic.\n\nCharacters go off on wild tangents about random topics that have nothing to do with anything, or they're rambling about ethnic rivalry in a way that is far from believable. And to top it off, the game is constantly quoting the bible and throwing around religious drivel. You know, the whole "God is great and almighty" bull crap. Nothing against anyone's religious belief, but it only bolsters how preachy the game is.\n\nThere were multiple times that left me bored out of my skull. Admittedly, things do pick up in the final act, but by then, I was too tired to possibly recommend Mayjasmine. Especially not at $10. Either wait for a sale or don't bother.","March 18","false","3.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freedomofkeima/recommended/417110/","freedomofkeima","freedomofkeima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freedomofkeima/","6 products in account","It should be warned that this game is not your usual have-a-fun kind of game.\n\nI'm a Chinese Indonesian who lived in Jakarta during this dark age period. It's interesting to see the perspective of outsiders in depicting May 1998 riots.\n\nThe story of "Mayjasmine episode 01 - where is God?" is quite good but I think it's a little exaggerated. From the historical point-of-view, the tragedy occurred because of global monetary crisis. Some higher-ups in Indonesia used this opportunity to end the regime of Soeharto (~30 years as an oppressive leader). To put it short, they tried to manipulate some minority extremists (especially from lower end economy) and used Chinese ethnics as a scapegoat. The number of casualties are around thousand people, including native Indonesian who were trapped in fire during this chaos.\n\nAfter played throughout the game, it seems that the creators try to generalize that almost all Chinese in Indonesian are killed and all sectors in Jakarta are filled with extremists. Personally, I've studied in a public university with 60% of native Indonesian and I need to say that this game was entirely about history, so don't try to judge any side as good or bad during playing this game.\n\nThe music is quite good, except for several parts where sound effects seem a bit off. For example, the sound effect overshadows the actual conversation, since it keeps playing in the background when you try to continue the conversation.\n\nThe graphics (and lolis) are excellent, that's why you are here right now, reading through these reviews and try to decide whether you want to buy this game or not.\n\nThe translations are off in some scenes. Overall, it still quite good except for some grammatical errors.\n\nThe game is quite short, around 8 hours or so. If you want to learn more about May 1998 riots, go ahead. If you "love" to see dying people or a masochist, go ahead too. If you just want to grab the lolis, well, you're coming to wrong neighborhood.\n\n","December 7, 2015","true","9.6"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","22","35","2","1"

The quality of painting is quite good for a product create by the individual develop group. Most voice actors are professional and famous in TAIWAN. Their sounds can be heard in many Chinese translated version Korean drama and Japan comic. I think it’s part of childhood memory for some guys living in Chinese cultural realms.\n\nI don't want to discuss the different historical or political views here because it will only cause argument, which cannot solve any problem. I hope the past and existing misunderstanding, hostility between these countries should be finally solved by the future created by young generation, with the realizing of mutual understanding and tolerance.\n\nI found the skill of telling the tragedy of slaughter is much better than the last product- the rainy port Keelung, because compared with the last one only delivers text message, this time they provide some really discomfort, bloody paintings and much more cruel description by words. As a people played a lot of Japan dark story ADV game, it caused less bad impacts on me (alright, I have to admit it, it attracts me a lot), but the mass killing, genocide and large amount of abuse will certainly scare a lot of people, and I didn’t notice any warning or age restriction. Actually, only 16+ people can buy this game in TAIWAN. The developers enjoy people shock after see the HORRIABLE end hiding behind the CUTE surface. However, steam is a pluralism place and people may have their own concept on develper's performance way,   the basic moral and game publisher standard should be complied, at least the year classification can let player know the game is not a happy story like Nekopara and protect child from this. That's publishers' reponsibility, please do not just like a geek or otaku\n————————————————————————————————————————\nYou may have 100 reasons to dislike this game: the damn lolicon tendency, the mix of serious history with stupid Japanese ACGN style performance, the trick by using pain of past victims in order to serve nowadays political proposal, disagree with this story that may conflict what you believe, or you just hate those guys call themselve Taiwanese, etc. If it real annoys you, just leave and think that is sh*t. There is no doubt it is a controversial product, but i think it is a miracle that this game can be published,  even selling on steam, to make worldwide people know that dark age, It also makes me think and wish to know more deeply than it tells, that's what i gain from this, the importance of communication and perform tolerantly to what you may disagree,that may avoid the tragedy before 17 years.","December 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 113 of 207 people (55%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","55","113","207","12","10"

Some of the comments & recommendations basically said: “Don’t get this one thinking this will be a cute little story”. I was told it was pretty “graphic” and serious. As a fan of horror & other themes like that I hit the “Buy button” rather quickly.\nOh gosh, what a ride it was. I dived in it during 2 or 3 days and it was an awesome but so very sad story.\n\nImmersion in a serious subjectBefore starting the game, the only thing I knew was that it was based on real events, the 1998 riots of Jakarta. I knew little if nothing about the matter so that was what caught me in the first place: a VN about something which really happened.\n\nEverything starts nicely. You are Ho Yu-Chen, just arrived in Indonesia, “the land of opportunities”. You get hired there by your old friend, Zi-Jin, a Taiwanese merchant, boss of a fabric factory.\nHere the encounters with various main characters from different “ethnicities” and cultures begin. I won’t give details to let you discover all those - very - different personalities: Yu-Qing “Papaya”, young daughter of Zi-Jin, Miss Miao, a friendly Chinese teacher, Melati “Cocoa”, a cute Indonesian girl and also the best friend of Yu-Chin.\n\nThe more the story goes on, the darker the tone becomes… and it becomes very, very, VERY dark when the riots finally begin, when strong hate, racism, insane barbary and gruesome violence take place.\n\nA dark story not for everyoneThis is not your “standard” VN. This is NOT your standard story, you know, that one you read a thousand times before. You want something new and have a strong stomach? Please, dive in this experience without hesitation.\n\nThe story is a moving one, based on both real and sad events. To be honest, I was depressed during the next days after I read it plus got myself interested in watching archives on those past events, just to “know” and try to understand.\n\nWhen you complete the main story and enjoy a nice bowl of feels, you unlock a new story path, a relecture from a different point of view. I won’t say anything more but it was great (and sad) as well.\n\nEnglish translationUnfortunately the translation is not very good, there are some typos and grammatical errors/mistranslations. Thankfully it is always understandable and does not spoil the experience once you get into it. Just for the note and if I remember well, the devs said a new translation should be done.\n\nTo summarize…GOOD ASPECTS\nThis is not something you read before. Not a “moe” story. This is about something which happened in the close past.\nIt is a moving, violent story. It is clearly for adult audiences and not for everyone. When I say “violence”, it is not only about graphic gore content but also concerns themes like murders, torture with details, rapes, killings of innocents like children… If you are somehow sensitive, I am not sure it’s a good idea you get into this story.\nDialogues are often straightforward, violent, naïve, especially when they come out the mouth of cute children. Sometimes you become nearly speechless, like shocked, while reading.\nYou really feel the makers of this Visual Novel want to share a strong message coming from their personal experience, it was impacting.\nYou will learn some History, myself I didn’t know a lot about 1998 Jakarta’s riots except that it happened. It made me want to learn more about the subject after I 100% completed Mayjasmine ep. 1.\nGood cast of very different characters.\nNice visuals, fabulous at some “tragic” moments. You will understand what I mean when you experience it. You could print some and frame them at home and people would say “wow, who is that painter?”.\nVoices are good, at every moment.\nSoundtrack fits in and is fine.\nThere are two routes, from two points of view. They are long enough, it lasted _____13+_____ hours for me, knowing that I took my time watching the artworks and listening the voices/music.\nNOT-SO-GOOD ASPECTS\nEnglish translation, too much errors and mistranslations. It remains readable. Devs plan on re-doing it (correct me if I'm wrong).\nNot enough choices that influence storyline.\nConclusionWell, I wasn't expecting something this good, it's very rare when I find a story which moves me like this, I cannot count a lot of them.\nIt was sad with a strong message of hope and tolerance. A great surprise.\nI wish there were more “serious” VNs like this jewel.\nGood job to the team behind this.\n\nRecommended if you can stand strong violence and serious matters.","March 26","true","13.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you are a sensitive person and don't want to see any violence or gore, don't buy this VN.\n\nI think the point of this story is to make you feel something. Good or Bad, may depend on who you are. It's easy to forget how humans can be nice but also so wrong. What we see in the news right now is not different from that story. In all this, there is the people, the real humans. We are nothing and we are everything.\n\nThe duration is great for the price. For the moment i have only played the first route and i needed about 5 hours to do it. After that my game menu changed and i can start playing the second route. If i can give you a suggestion; do a main save before you select an answer from the moment you receive a phone call "answer or not". Because from that moment, every decision will change the story.\n\n*spoiler caution*\nIf the story end like nothing then try the other answers.

Please consider viewing the page on vndb.org to get an idea of what to expect.\nIt's a story based on the '98 riots of Indonesia with extreme racism, gore, and ♥♥♥♥. It starts off slow but gets bloody very, very fast. The ending will leave you unfulfilled and depressed.\nIf you're here for the lolis, bear in mind that they're more like actual children and less like traditional lolis you'd find in anime-styled media. They're not mature and hypersexualized like you're used to seeing them everywhere. If you want that, go read Nekopara or something.\n\n****spoiler about ♥♥♥♥ and nudity involving child characters to those concerned****\nit is implied that yu-qing is ♥♥♥♥♥ in one of the bad ends, but the narrative is very vague about it. in another ending, yu-qing collapses on a sand bank and her top becomes misplaced. there is no pornographic content in this novel.\n\nThe game was developed by a Chinese studio, therefore the voices are all in Chinese. The game is short, but it's worthy of two playthroughs. After you get the true ending, you can start the game again that tells the story from a different perspective(also you get to relive the trauma another time if the first wasn't enough). It showcases the lives of Yu-Chen, a distant friend of Zi-Jin as he travels to Indonesia to seek a job opportunity, and Yu-Qing, the daughter of Zi-Jin as she questions her neglectful father and tries to protect her schoolmate from bullies. Their stories overlap as they meet and spend more time together, before and during the riots.\nSome of the characters are weak, boring, or were just there when they really didn't need to be. As said in another review, the game feels way too racist just to teach you that it's wrong to be racist. There is a lot of talk and questioning of God, peace, war, discrimination, and what is right and what isn't. You really begin to feel for Yu-Qing as she constantly questions  how great God is as everyone is being tortured and murdered around her. It comes as very preachy and forced.\nThe english translation is a bit poor for an official one, but I had no issues reading it at all. Don't let this discourage you from trying it.\nOverall, it's a great novel that gives you quite an experience you never wanted.","March 28","true","19.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

What can I say? It's quite controversial.\nOn the one hand it's a gasp of fresh air after all this generic staff like "Any VN about school\lolis"\nThis VN rises some serious topics and gives you a lot of different perspectives throughout the stories\nand that I should say leaves you deep in thought once you've read it all. I don't remember reading a VN\nthat was be so serious and deep about it, in the majority of them, they would male an elephant out of a moss\nor would just be forcing drama on us with a happy ending, of course. Unfortunately, in the real world not all the\nproblems have solutions. The closest VN about the atmosphere (closer to the end) is the Swan Song, I thing.\nAnd it has similar drawbacks, I'm afraid. I'm not familiar with the events that happened in 1998 in Indonesia but, I believe, the authors went too far with the display violence.\nI would also like to say a thing about the components of the game.\nGraphics.\nAuthors did a good job drawing audience's attention with loli pics. The topic of the VN (national identity disputes in some far east country) simply can't be appealing for the grand majority of people here, so it did its job.\nI'm a bit disappointed though about disproportionate sprite sizes of the kids here. When a 8 yo girl looks bigger than her dad it's... bizzare. Then there are no proper event CGs, they are all made in chibi style, I have nothing against chibi\nbut its such an obvious manifestation of artist's laziness... I just can't keep quiet about it.\nOverall the art is good. But I hope it will be better in the sequel.\nMusic\nCan'y say much about it. It's nice to listen to, but not memorable. There could be more compositions if you ask me.\nVoices\nWell, after japanese VNs've set a high degree of quality, you can't help but notice fake in emotions. It is especially obvious when someone's angry. They sound too reserved , if you don't know what they are talking about you would think it's just a slight dissatisfaction. But what really grinds my gears is the maid's voice actress... if it's a person of course and not a robot. I've never heard such an unnatural voice acting before. It's like they were short on staff (chinese, haha) and summoned a nearby cleaner to read some lines from the script... I was desperately searching for the option to turn it off in the game but failed;(\nTranslation\nA lot of other reviews are spanking the VN for it's bad quality. I can't disagree, though it didn't pose a big problem for myself. I wouldn't even say it's bad in translation, rather in editing and proofreading. The language (except in some places, which are not many) is failry simple to understand and thus easy to read. It's a plus in my opinion, I hate VNs which are overloaded with heavy grammatical structures. And one more thing - I don't know about the degree of swear words in the original chinese but these kids could take on verbally any delinquent in the most run down, gangsta turf.\nOverall\nI guess it is either you read it through or drop it after ten minutes or so, the topic just isn't for everyone, not that it makes it less interesting though.\nI recommend everyone try it, and I'm looking forward to the sequel, the VN breaks at the most interesting part.\nThanks for attention, everyone!\nP.S. Sorry for my english, it's been ages since I wrote something in it.","December 4, 2015","true","13.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","0"

Story was moving,despite silly translation errors breaking the mood a bit.I also really enjoyed how they used quotes and teaching from all major religions, and avoided making any one side of the conflict to have been the absolute good/bad guy,something many people have a really hard time doing. Most problems I had with the game (besides easily understood translation errors and a few duplicate textboxes) are nitpicky (like why the hell does the teacher have 11-12 year olds reading War and Peace, and a certian few cg scenes having a little bit more detail than they really should have),or just that it felt a little short(which since it said its an ep1, may not be a problem at all). I actually highly recommend this, especially if you're looking for a feels trip.","May 2","true","10.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
