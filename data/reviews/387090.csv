Seriously, my whole evening gone in a fascinated trance. I'm quite impressed - and my players will be as well. I was on the fence as my table-topper friends use a similar utility that's been around for a while.\nI'm glad I waited. This is the one. Revolution is way more fun. It didn't feel like work for one minute.\nI can't believe all the resources it comes with right off the bat! It even has enough variety in gaming resources for a palladium or even shadowrun (or other cyberpunk / fantasy style / post modern ) campaign. If you know that pain, get this. Hu- frickin -zzah devs.\nThere are some things that could make it more user friendly so I'll list those but hey, this is way awesome.\n\n1. One command to take a tile and make it the floor for the whole place - anything to save a few minutes, I will edit later if I wanna get fancy.\n2. Mouse-over function explanations. Yes, I want my hand held. I am not a smart man.\n3. Scroll-to-fit  or drag-to-fit object commands . It looked like there was a hard way to do this but see #2.\n4. As mentioned in other reviews, Steam Workshop support must happen asap. The amazingness that could come out the community with R:VS with even limited content sharing is obvious.\n\nYeah that's right, specifics. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to plan out a trip to a fight scene, in a unique neighborhood, in a city you've never seen, on a new planet, in a distant solar system, all in 3d, with robots and dragons.\n\n","July 23, 2015","true","5.7"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","4"

Just WOW!\n\nI've been playing with this system on and off since the early alpha releases, but I wasn't ready for how far this system has come with only a single developer, this guy is a machine!\n\nMy group and I used to use Roll20, but we have moved over to Revolution and haven't looked back since.\n\nPros:\n- Over a thousand objects to build maps with\n- Hundreds of Miniatures\n- The developer is constantly adding content for free\n- The reasonable price\n- Playing with friends in a 3D environment (Thank You Revolution!)\n- So many genre options in the form of Playsets that come with it\n\nCons:\n- No workshop Support Yet (But they say it's planned)\n- Needs more Steam integration\n- Makes 4 hours feel like 10 minutes LOL\n\n\nI can't recoomend this enough. Now that we play in a virtual world we are ruined for other 2D based systems.

I personally love it to death. There are some problems though, most that will be ironed out over time.\n\nThe biggest issue, is that if you ever want to play with anyone but yourself, you have to portforward. No, you can't use something like tungle, or hamachi, you have to port forward through your router. This can be an issue for some people, especially less tech savvy people, and those warry of port forwarding. I for one, am unable to even attempt due to technical issues.\n\nI don't want to out right say it, but the dev claims this is something they chose to do, rather than to have a paid server host. (would you want to? I wouldn't.) I feel that is more of an excuse to not spend money on servers. Instead, leaving it up to the players. I really would rather a refund on this game, but it's not that big of a deal, and I'm not looking for one. If you get this game, make sure you know how to, can, and are willing to port forward your router to play.\n\nStill, don't get me wrong, it's an AWESOME and I feel, revolutionary game.","August 8, 2015","true","51.2"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","22","27","3","0"

Imagine Minecraft but for big people, without all that annoying having to dig for stuff. I akin it to the Forge on Halo Reach, but thousands of times easier to manipulate and control. You also have several themes to work with from fantasy to sci-fi to help keep things fun. The controls themselves look tiny and daunting at first, but it took me less than an hour to figure out everything I needed to do before I started having fun.\n\nThings to know about this game: Don't get it if you want to share it with your D&D group over the computer. It's a real pain in the butt to do because they don't allow it to go through any servers. When ti comes to being a host for a virtual campaign, it has a long way to go. Also, the controls aren't really set for a "walk" mode, meaning if you want to walk your halls and see all the awesome that is in them, you need to move slow and watch your direction.\n\nOther than that, it's an amazing tool for every DM and player to have. You can keep track of your characters, your quests, your campaigns, your special campaign rules and any other technicals like that you desire. A very handy, all in one place resource for your gaming needs.\n","October 23, 2015","true","26.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"

This is exactly as the title suggests. It is a revolutionary virtual playspace. There is a plethora of assets for full customization, and the map editor is just brilliant. I am shocked that one guy, and his musically talented friend, managed to create this. They succeeded where so many CRPG's missed the mark. This is worth so much more than $20.\nI'll be tranferring my D&D 5e game from roll20 to this platform, while still using roll20 for skill checks and spells descriptions. Thanks to the user friendly UI, that will be easily done.\nThe few parts that are rough around the edges are clearly marked for later improvement, and the tooltips are precisely helpful. I plan on purchasing copies for all of my players, so that they can join in on this platform.\nI look forward to sharing modules and playing games with new people through this innovative tabletop RPG toolbox. My desire for a 3D virtual environment to make my fantasy world in is more than satisfied.\n\nMike McDonald and Nathan Thurston are heroes.\n","February 27","true","28.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The optimization is terrible, having to be online in order to play isn't super cool, the map editor could do with improvements, and it could do with more key bindings. (For example: Pressing escape to either bring up options or to exit.) Regardless of its flaws, it does have a lot of assets it seems. Although the 2D models don't look too great in my opinion, the 3D ones don't look bad, even on the lowest graphical setting.\n\nI'm no game designer, so what I'm going to say next is purly from my little knowledge of how games work. I think one way it could improve preformance in the map editor is to, perhaps, ditch the mountains and water and give the player an empty space to just mess around in. I say this because frame rate skyrocketed for me once I turned off the lights, presumably because the mountains and water weren't being rendered as much at that point, but you kind of need to see in order to build stuff, and having to place lights isn't the most conventional way of doing so. And a big pluss would be not having to log in in order to play. If there is a way to do so, then awesome! I also think it could do with a way to edit and play at the same time, however that could be complicated to add.\n\nI got this game hoping to replace Tabletop Simulator so I can play D&D and not worry about smacking my dice into the characters and everything exploding, however I think I'll stick with that until this game improves a bit. I barely scraped the surface of the game, however my first impression wasn't the best. If you can put up with the flaws, then by all means get this game. It has potential to be something great.","May 5","false","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

The "minis" are not 3D models like they appear to be. Character sheets are customizable but very limited. You can edit anything, but if there are not enough slots to add all the data you need to input, bummer times, you can't add in more slots. Once you do get a mini editted and made, loading it into the game is a process. You have to constantly save your character sheet manually if you have a spotty connection or you might lose progress. This may be worth it in the future, but right now, there just isn't enough here, outside of the map creation. On a positive side, the map creation is absolutely fantastic and I really have no complaints. The minis need a TON of work. Instead of it actually being a 3D model, it is just a 2D image that moves as the camera moves, and it has a shadow behind it. Cheap way to go about doing it... Once that part of the problem is fixed, this would be an awesome tool to play tabletop RPGs, but if that makes as big of a difference to you as it does to me, don't buy this yet. It is still in early stages and only have one developer from what I am told, so things may change, but it might take a while. I am not saying that this is a bad game at all... But people should know WHAT they are actually getting because the videos don't really show you what it is. It also says that there is a mini editor... I thought this meant I would be able to create minis to look like my character, but that is not the case... You can just attach a character sheet TO a premade mini.","August 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","16","30","3","0"
