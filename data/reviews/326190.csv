"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/recommended/326190/","infindima","A. Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","I finally managed to complete this game, each time I was so bored I fell asleep. Not because the game was terrible, but because they designed it in such a way that there's no way you would be able to complete it without consulting some form of guide, map or hint system.\n\nLiked\nMusic\nWhile not very rememberable, it suits the scenes for which they play.\n\nStory\nIt was the main reason I wanted to complete the game despite not liking the gameplay. It's a very short story, but I liked the way they unfolded.\n\nPuzzles you can skip\nWithout it, I wouldn't have been able to complete the game. And sometimes I am just lazy, which leads me to...\n\nMap with teleportation\nThe convinience of laziness. This is a very helpful feature as you'll be wandering around a lot in the game and it would be extrmely tedious to backtrack all the way. The map also helps display which areas are yet to be discovered or where you need to complete an objective.\n\nDisliked\nGrainy, low quality Hidden Object scenes\nThe eyestrain is real on these. I swear the quality is worse than the pictures I used to save on 1mb floppy disks. The objects in the scene lacks depth and definition, making it very difficult to tell that they are there at all. A lot of objects are partially hidden behind others, which makes it even more tedious to find them.\nAn annoying (yet interesting) feature makes it so you have to use some of your inventory items to compete certains items on the screen. However, there's no indication of when you are supposed to use them. Sometimes the items are greyed out and you need to go to a completely different scene, then return with a different item. Now try to pair up low quality inventory items with equally low quality items on the screen. An example of how terrible this system can be:  You find a room with a skeleton in a corner. When you find most items, you have to leave the corpse, find a ring somewhere else, come back and put it back on his hands to complete "Dead mans secret". How are you supposed to figure that out? I barely even saw the hand in the first place due to the bad graphics.\n\nAn ending so cheesy it's insulting\nSo you have a pretty good story going and how do you end it? Just toss in a character you exchanged a couple of words with and call it a day. It just... made me so dissapointed I wasn't sure if I was laughing or getting mad because I just couldn't believe how thrown away all your efforts felt.\n\nThe puzzles\nMajority of puzzles relies on you remembering things, which is something that is difficult for me, so I just couldn't enjoy them. Even the logical puzzle requires you memorizing the patterns. The only puzzle I remember liking was linking the same pictures to one another, because at least then I didn't have to remember where the patterns were as they were always in the same place.\n\nBacktracking and illogical problem solving\nThis is without a doubt the worst part of this game. Usually these kinds of games will confine you to a certain area, so that it's easy to keep track of where you can go and what you are supposed to do. But this game feels like the whole world is open and there's no logic what-so-ever as to why you have to go places. Making up my own example, imagine solving a problem in the kitchen, then to complete the task, you have to go to the supermarket and pick up a fork, then go all the way back to the kitchen and place the fork on a table. But to get to the supermarket, you need fuel for the car. So you have to go into the woods and find a key. But to find a key, you need to go to the church and talk to a priest, who gives it to you, then you can solve all your problems and get the fork. There's no logic to having to go through all of that trouble for one item, unless you are deliberately trying to drag out a story which is very short. Which is quite obvious, because all of this sidetracking usually have nothing at all to do with the actual plot. The fact that you have to travel so far between each location for a simple item adds to the overall confusion as to what you are supposed to do next.\nSometimes you can't pick up an item until you have done seven other tasks, which makes it seem the item isn't for use at all. This is another very illogical thing and makes the game annoying. Imagine being in a very intense moment of the game, then you have to go back to the safe area just to pick up a button, so you can advance where your character is clearly unsafe.","July 5, 2015","false","3.7"," 75 of 93 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","75","93","5","0"

But this one, I had to say, was the hardest one I played as of yet.  As usual, the game compels you to look for clues, solve puzzles and search for objects in the hidden object game (HOG).\nWhat made it stand out was its interesting story.  Your character here is being sacrificed by a group of alchemist in order to complete an ancient ritual.  Why? They are basically trying to conquer the world.  You are of course trying to prevent that from ever happening whilst searching for the reason why your foster parents and relatives are attempting to kill you.\nThe game only presents you with four (4) different settings and locations with only a few rooms to explore.\nThe gameplay is like this, you stand in the middle of the room and rotate yourself from left to right by clicking the edge of your screen.\nHere is the exciting part, while turning and trying to look for objects to interact with, you are going to be shocked by ghostly images suddenly appearing in front of your computer screen.  I had several of this WTF moments in the game and I was really looking for these moments in every turn.\nMy only frustrations is when you have to backtrack for items you missed and have to revisit the same area again in order to progress.  Sometimes, you get stuck and run out of ideas on what to do next.  It really FRIED my brain on few occassions.  But that is the beauty of the game, It challenges you to move on.\nI was glad they added a Steam Achievement feature on this game that rewards your effort.  And by the way, there is a helpful Hint button to give you clues.\nOverall, here is what I have to say, the graphics are only average, the story is good, the soundtrack is adequate, the puzzles and HOG are challenging (Magnifying Glass is Optional).  I definitely reccommend this game and it receives a THUMBS UP.","April 12, 2015","true","9.5"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","35","41","3","0"

The story is good. I can't say anything about the music, because I don't really remember anything about it. The visuals are not bad. I like that this game creates an interesting atmosphere. In game some puzzles are easy and some are quite hard. I was stuck in one mini game, so I just started to do everything randomly and somehow managed to complete it. Also I like the design of the achievement's pictures. To sum up, I can say that if you are a fan of hidden object games, you have to play this. And if you aren't a fan, you can still try it. The game is really cheap compared to what you get for that price. Also it's not that hard to get a perfect achievement game for the first time playing this.","October 10, 2015","true","6.0"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

I will be a bit biased about this game, considering the theme picked is one of my favorites - European Mysticism. I know it's nothing marvelous as a HOG but Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends is a well-made little adventure as it lasts, with well arranged puzzles and a charming story. Some quick to grasp story related achievements are only the flavor.\n\nOur main character is Eva, a young orphan who has just came to Prague to discover about her long lost family. In Prague, the throne of European Mysticism, Eva is to find out about the trials of her heritage, learn long lost alchemical secrets and put a stop to the forces of evil. The story takes its basis from the world renowned alchemist duo: John Dee and Edward Kelley, and adds the fiction into mystical history successfully. The characters themselves sadly don't have much in-depth personality for us to witness, and voice acting isn't one of the best, but they are not as annoying as most that we come across within the genre. Aside from the dialogues and the ending being a bit forced and cheesy - okay, it was pure trash - I adored the setting altogether.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is a great success. The environment is old, dusty and mystical as Prague itself. Color choices, the art, the eerie background music and the whispering effects of the ghosts of Prague are all welcoming details. What has surprised me the most, is that the designers went into the full trouble of animating characters aside from cinematic cutscenes. Beautifully arranged in-game animations were a welcoming change in the HOG genre which we do not observe often if it's not Artifex Mundi.\n\nThe gameplay was nicely balanced, between fairly challenging, inventory interactive HOG scenes, and some of the most elaborate puzzles that I've stumbled within the genre. It seems that puzzle setups do change in every playthrough, so it is meaningless to use a walkthrough for puzzles themselves. You really have to think for yourself. The game presents you a useful map to track your progress and gives you means of quick travel for adventure elements.\n\nIf you like the HOG genre itself, this one is a must to experience. Don't rush it though, grab it in sale. The ending was hinting a sequel, so I will be optimistic about the story's continuation. There are tons of unexplained details, so there has to be a sequel... God, please there be a sequel, 'cause I refuse to endure that awfuly abrupt ending!

I would not put it in that class of good hidden object games like those made by artifex mundi but it's not so bad that I would say not to get it. However the ending made me say don't get it.\n\nPros:\nDecent character models\nDecent voice acting\nPuzzles are okay\nStory is kind of predictable but it's not horrid\n\nCons:\nPoor quality graphics\n\nOften times hidden objects will be stupidly hidden, not cleverly\n\nYou need to use items from your inventory for some hidden objects to appear and there is no indication if that last item that is blued out (meaning not visable) is hidden behind something or needs an inventory item\n\nNavigating can be messy and you rely on clicking the map instead of moving\n\nIt has clear this game needs polish, text in game looks like default MS Word font instead of looking like old age writing\n\nPuzzles can be annoying and tedious like matching symbols with far too many to match and the instructions need to be clicked instead of being told to you, the latter part being a minor annoyance\n\nYou are also given jump scares occasionally and there is this girl in a wedding dress that appears often. But unless I'm missing something, I assume she's your dead sister but why is she in a wedding dress? I usually pay attention to plot so either the plot was so uninteresting I glaced over her explination or she wasn't given one. Either way its a con.\n\n\nMajor Con: (SPOILERS)\n\nThis is what made me give this a no for recommending it. The ending scene that you work so hard to get to looks poorly made. There is black text with no background just floating and it's hard to read while your character and the guy in the story who only met once and agreed to go out to coffee together... which they didn't do mind you, say they love each other... Like really? I don't believe this was built up at all and just forced to give the character a love interest. It's just... such bad writing there.\n\nOverall it looks and feels like this game maker has potential but right now the lack of polish is very visable. With some work this game could have been better. If you can get this for cheap go for it but for full price there are far many more better games of this type.","January 17, 2015","false","4.1"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","1"

Some animations look alright but it looks a bit rough at times. I was expecting it to look a little smoother, if that makes sense.\nFor some reason you get strings of ambiguous characters appearing which, while it's fine to string the story out and provide a few jumps, it gets a bit tedious and loses it's lustre when it happens five times within ten minutes.\nYou will often find that you spend the majority of your time clicking between screens, the movement system is clunky and you can rotate around rooms. The next step isn't always obvious, either, so prepare to spend ages per room slowly skimming your mouse over every object to see if you can interact with it.\nThe resolution on this game was the biggest problem for me. It's boxed in like it was made for the old TVs/monitors, and there's no resolution option. The issue this causes is that it makes the hard to find objects even harder to find because they're smaller than I imagine they would be on a smaller screen/resolution.\nAs you can see, I didn't have a great time with this game.\nDespite playing HOGs a lot, I found this one slightly tedious due to the long periods of time purely spent clicking between rooms then scouring them for something I'd missed. You also have a lot of clutter in your inventory that isn't usable for quite some time which adds to the confusion.\nOn the other hand, maybe someone with more patience and a keener eye would fare better.\nI hate to not recommend this game, as I enjoy the genre a lot, but I feel there are much better HOGs on Steam, and some at an even lower price, that are more enjoyable.","March 30, 2015","false","4.5"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","16","23","3","1"

My, my.  That should say something about the game right there.  This game is a challenge start to finish, and the developers took "hidden object" to the extreme.  Note: this is not a Hidden Object game for novices or even the casual player.  It is a serious challenge.  But before I proceed let us start at the beginning.\n\nStory: Eva, an orphan, suddenly is contacted by a now deceased relative's estate saying she has inherited his house in Prague.  Being curious and excited she goes and is met by Anna, the relative's secretary.  The adventure begins here as Eva puts together her relationship with her benefactor, discovers some dark secrets, and has a little romance.\n\nJump scares and romance in one game and an Hidden Object game at that.  Oh Yes.  Quite the departure from the standard.\n\nMy, oh my, this game is a challenge, quite a challenge.  But let us start with what the game does NOT have.  It does not have an easy mode, well not really, beside the "sparkles" and the ability to skip this game plays exactly the same in advanced mode.  Advanced mode simply  increases the number of objects in an actual hidden object puzzle, no "sparkles" (but who needs "sparkles" when one gets a magnifying glass) and no skipping (for the novice, impatient or the easily annoyed this might be a problem in a place or two.)\n\nWhat else this game does NOT have is in-game achievements, extras, bonus chapters, "ghost/hidden/shapshifting" objects or a walkthrough strategy guide, not really a drawback.  It also does NOT have penalties for map use, for hints, for skips, for fast travel on the map and that is a huge Plus, PLUS.  I highly suggest, use the map, a lot, for everything, the map for me was probably the highlight of the game.  Got stuck, consulted the map.  Forgot where I was in game play, consulted the map.  Did not want to walk, used the fast travel on the map.  Could not locate an object I needed to finish a puzzle or hidden object scene consulted the map.  Who needs a guide with a map like that?\n\nAh yes, remember I mentioned the developers took "hidden object" to the extreme.  The entire game in my opinion is one very large, very expansive hidden object scenerio.  Besides the actual designated hidden object scenes, which I will talk about next, an entire room or an entire area was used as a hidden object find.  Sure there is the occassional pick up inventory object but for the most part entire rooms/areas are one huge find and/or puzzle.  Very challenging, expecially if one is used to playing isolated designated hidden object scenes.\n\nNow about the actual designated hidden object scenes, again a "stepped up" version.  There are the regular objects on the list, and the few "puzzle objects" of the put together nature, now add your inventory.  Yes, your inventory.  Items in your inventory need to be added to clear some of the list items.  Very clever, and the first time will cause some head scratching if unaware.\n\nExcellent game, storyline fairly standard with the additional touch of romance, which is unusual.\n\nHighly recommend to those who want a challenge, and I would play on advanced mode from the beginning since there is no real difference.","August 12, 2015","true","18.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The game starts out fun, with simple clicking mechanics and easy to see objects, but as the story rolls on the game gets much harder, and almost impossible to pass without the use of the hint button down in the bottom-left corner. I am recommending this game because of a few fun puzzles that are very well made and very challenging and a story that isn't great, but isn't lame either.\n\nSo what's the problem with this game? Why is the game nearly impossible without that precious hint button? Well, there is an "open world" kind of style to this game. Sometimes you have to find an item somewhere in the world and you wouldn't have a clue where it would be... I found a box of matches under a window leaning on a pole, quite a distance from the objective and there are plenty more examples of that. So your go to option is the hint button. Mindlessly pressing the hint button and then waiting a few seconds for it to load back up again isn't very fun, but that's the only thing you can do to complete the story. This makes it very time consuming and boring traveling around the "map"...\n\nThe puzzles, or "minigames" are fun though. They offer a great challenge, but it's obvious they aren't impossible. Some of the puzzles took a good 10-15 minutes for me to complete, and most of them are random so you can't look up a guide to complete them. This is the feature that really makes the game fun, and the reason I'm going to recommend this game,  even if it's only just. If I had to give it a rating, I'd give it a 5.1/10","January 21","true","10.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/326190/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends, developed by JetDogs Studios, puts you in the shoes of Eva, a girl who is just trying to find out a little about her past when she receives a letter to come to Prague to meet a man who has something to tell her about where she came from, and her family. This is a hidden object game with a dash of adventure thrown into it.\n\nGraphically the game looks like your middle of the road type of game. It looks good, but it's not going to blow you away. You are going to find yourself in different rooms and locations, all of which you will basically be standing in the middle of and will be rotating to the left or right. By rotating left or right you will see more of the room or area and will be able to interact with different objects. Sometimes these objects will be accompanied with a little magical glitter to point out to the player that you can interact with them. You will get to look around a cafe, an antique shop, a house with four different rooms, a graveyard, a crypt, and a couple other places that I can't give away (it would ruin the story).\n\nThere is one HUGE graphical glitch in the game that drove me crazy and that was the journal, in game. In most games, when a journal is involved it, of course, keeps information about what is going on in the game, and sometimes hints to what to do next. Well the issue is that I could barely ever read the journal because of the color choice for the text. Not being able to read something to help figure out an answer, or perhaps where to go to next lead me to lean HEAVILY upon the hint button.\n\nThe voice acting in this game was all over the place, to me it felt like half the people wanted to voice the characters they were voicing, and the other half mailed it in. The ironic thing was that it was the smaller parts in the game that actually seemed to be the best. The lack of emotion portrayed in some of the voices really hurt the game.\n\nThe controls in the game are really straight-forward it all comes down to the mouse. You will pick up, select, and find objects with the click of the mouse. This is about as point and click as you can ever get.\n\nSo as stated before you are Eva, a girl on the look out for something, anything, that would tell her a little something about her past. She will meet a small group of characters, some good, some bad, and it is the adventure that she is unwittingly put on that will allow her to uncover some unsettling, and startling secrets about who she is, and where she came from. For the most part this game chugs right along, there are times, however, where I was completely lost on what to do next and it was only through either checking, usually in vain, the journal, or clicking on the hint button over and over again. You see the hint button, when not near something that you can interact with, will give you freebie hints on which way to turn in a room, and perhaps even where to exit out a room/area. There are also a good number of non-hidden object puzzles that sometimes take a bit of time to work out, but if you get lucky you might stumble upon something needed to help you along.\n\nOne interesting component to the hidden object portion of the game was that there were several times where you were not going to be able to completely find all the items because one of the items required a piece that wasn't even in the scene that you were looking over. It might not even be in the same area as the puzzle, and this is when it gets a bit frustrating as you are sent back tracking through areas to find something that will allow you to advance the game. I understand developers want to allow the players to get the most out of their games, but having to constantly back track, especially for something that just magically appeared just then, gets a bit frustrating.\n\nSo here's the deal, this game isn't going to blow you away. The story is average, the graphics are average, and it took about 3 and a half hours to beat, but it definitely had some charm, and I did want to finish it. Oh and that's the last thing I want to talk about, the ending, ABRUPT!!! Holy crap, what in the world, you have this little engine that could type of pace and then its like the train just decided to dive bomb into the ocean. The ending happened so fast, and of course had the expected twist at the end. So in the end this game gets a 6.9 out of 10.","January 5, 2015","true","38.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

It also had some fairly enjoyable puzzles and mechanics, and there is voice acting that is not bad.\n\nOther than that, I did not much enjoy this game. The hidden object scenes aren't amazing looking, and there is a fair amount of errors in them (such as repeated objects and mislabeled objects). There is way too much back and forth to go back to random places where new objects or HOS have magically appeared, and finding those places is next to impossible without using hints or your map.\n\nMost of the puzzles are very easy, while some are just confusing and rely too much on aforementioned back and forth, while the game doesn't even inform you of what you need to find a lot of the time. More than once, you have to actually backtrack from a hidden object scene to randomly go find something else, and then come back to it later. The puzzles just don't seem to follow a logical order. Towards the end, the puzzles seemed more streamlined and enjoyable, with a bit less back and forth and less random places to go back and look for random things in.\n\nThe plot is flimsy at best, some of the music is nice but the ~super spooky pieces were a bit grating, and while some of the jump scares get you (warning to those who don't like jump scares) the "scary" bits are so cliche, random, and inconsistent that I could not get into the atmosphere of the game at all. Also, I know this is a small detail, but the text/font bothered me a LOT in this game.","January 21","false","4.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Unfortunately, I can't say I have enjoyed any of their earlier games, which tend to have lower production values and are generally much less polished. Alchemy Mysteries is no exception.\n\nWhat we have here is a run of the mill hidden object game, except for the fact that it scores below average in most aspects of its PRODUCTION. With graphics and animation scraping the bottom of the barrel, it at least occasionally manages to score some points in atmosphere. Things continue being standard (as in standardly not great) when it comes to the music and the voice acting, which should surprise no one.\n\nI will not bother getting into the STORY, suffice to say that it is also business as usual, i.e. attempting to be spooky and ending up barely above cringeworthy. However, the designers made a decent effort to create actual reasons for sending you to look at places and solve puzzles. That would have potentially improved immersion - if only navigation was a bit less unpleasant and I didn't end up constantly using the map for quicktravelling.\n\nBut it's the GAMEPLAY that really lets Alchemy Mysteries down.\n\nThe HOG SCENES feel very limited. They are relatively small and I personally didn't enjoy the way the items were drawn and incorporated into scenes. The game only displays 8 of the items you are looking for at a time, which generally means you are more likely to get stuck. There are also several HOG scenes that require you to combine items, including some from within your inventory. While this can be an interesting mechanic, it often means you have to go away from the scene to look for missing items, usually in different random places of the map and without always really knowing what to look for.\n\nAs for the PUZZLES, expect to need a lot of hints, expect to be very tempted to skip many of them, and do expect a lot of pixel hunting. While most of them aren't necessarily bad, I found nothing new or memorable and nothing that I genuinely enjoyed. I don't appreciate the fact that I ended up solving many of them simply by trial and error (or dogged OCD refusal to hit the skip button).\n\nTL;DR: At the end of the day, HOG players tend to have very specific likes and dislikes when it comes to wasting their time searching for random objects. :) So while I personally didn't enjoy Alchemy Mysteries, I can't say it is much worse than many other HOGs I've played. It just isn't as good as I would have hoped.","May 18","false","4.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I see a lot of reviews complaining about problems that aren't really in the game. It has about 3 hours of gameplay if you put it on advanced mode from the start probably less if you play it on normal.\n\nPros:\n-Very few objects are repeated, Many hidden object games use the same objects over and over, this one didn't suffer from that.\n- Easy to follow story.\n- Fast Travel, some complained about spending too much time moving around the map but the game has a fast travel system in the journel that highlights what scenes you can currently do things in and lets you click to go there immediatly. More Hidden Object games could use that.\n- Even on advanced mode the hint system rechearges at a more than fair rate, and if you can't figure out where to go even with the help of the journel it wont even consume a hint and will keep pointing you in the right direction. I only needed to use it a few times and Didn't need to consult a guide at all.\n- Decent voice acting\n- Steam Acheivments and Trading Cards\n- Price\n\nCons:\n- No replayability, You can get 100% of the acheivments in about 3 hours, I guess that's better than being repetitive though.\n- The story while easy to follow is a little lacking and doesn't serve any other purpose than to move you around and give you objectives. But lets face it you aren't playing a game like this for the story.\n\nOverall: 9/10 This score is based on what the game is, comparing it only to other hidden object games I personally have played.","September 22, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I hadn't even known that the genre existed beforehand; I was expecting a point-and-click adventure like, say,  Leisure Suit Larry,  only set in Prague and with no nekkid ladies. So I guess it speaks to the strengths of  Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends  that it not only eased me into the genre in a way I could understand, but also impressed me enough that I've gone on to purchase (and enjoy) other "HOGs" as well.\n\nBriefly, for those that don't know, a HOG is similar to an adventure game except that the emphasis is on  locating  objects rather than using them. You're mostly presented with static images rather than 3-D worlds (though usually with ambient effects like flickering lights or running water), and you have to pick out semi-obscured objects with the mouse cursor. Occasional puzzles and cutscenes are often interspersed between the object-hunting sections. Production values are typically high, they usually tell stories involving magic or light horror elements (we're talking ghosts, not gore), and interestingly many of them seem to have female protagonists.  Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends  fits this description to a tee.\n\nTo be honest, though I genuinely enjoyed  AM: PL  while I was playing it, I don't really have much to say about it now that it's over. It was perfectly charming and well-made, neither too easy nor too hard... and I hardly remember anything about it a month after I played it. Like some other HOGs I've played since then, it felt a bit like a Sunday crossword puzzle: relaxing, enjoyable, and utterly disposable at the end of the day. I seem to recall a golem turning up at some point, which was kinda cool, as well as a kindly old shopkeeper, and also some hunky but non-threatening dude that I probably hooked up with in a PG-rated kind of way at the end. It was perfectly enjoyable, if not entirely memorable.\n\nI hope I'm not damning this game with faint-sounding praise. It  is  good. Buy it if you like HOGs, or are curious about the genre. Your two bucks will get you about five hours of chilled-out, well-crafted fun.","February 6","true","13.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

Many of the puzzles are fresh. The technical side is also different, I think it runs on a different engine, all of the character animation is in actual realtime 3D (60 fps or however fast your display and GPU can handle it). Many locations are in 360 degree graphics, CGI instead of handdrawn as far as I can tell. You can turn in the 4 different directions, and the consistency of the locations between different view positions is high (something that many other HOGs lack). All of this means that I think the production values are pretty high and this game must have cost more to make than most other HOGs. (The Artifex Mundi games seem to have changed to a cheaper production in the more recent games, with the prerendered cutscenes not even having 3D CGI characters but handdrawn 2D ones with crude animation, which I find also visually cheap)\n\nUnfortunately, the engine and visual production values doesn't automatically translate into better gameplay. The hint button is more necessary than in other HOGs, and the HO scenes are not as satisfying. The list of items you need to find is not fully displayed, only 8 or so at a time.\nThe voice acting and the story were ok, nothing exceptionally bad or good imho.\n\nI would like to see some more HOGs of this kind, with evolved gameplay they could really freshen up the HOG market. But since this game was made some time ago (2014 or earlier) and I haven't come across any other game of this kind yet, I'm not sure if there is going to be another one. If you happen to know a HOG with a similar technical side as this one, leave me a comment.","February 22","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Try reading "I am so scared!" with a cheery voice. Yep. Very scared, I see.\nThere is a lot of backtracking and things seem to be just randomly thrown into the story to make you go waaaaaaaaaay out of your way to find something simple. Also, you can't play without using the hint button very, very frequently because the story is so busy with the backtracking that it forgets to... be a good story and tell itself. xD\nI liked the hidden object scenes and the fact that some objects had to be "assembled" during those. Unfortunately, some of the items to assemble have to be in your inventory, and there things get strange because... how the hell are you supposed to know what is in your inventory just to be used in hidden objects scene? Some times you have to start the hidden object scene and then leave it to find another object somewhere else so you can finish the first one. Not to mention when the "assembly" labeling doesn't make any sense AT ALL, as in the skeleton part.\nThe puzzles are nice, but the ones close to the ending are quite difficult.\nGraphics are ok, but in the hidden object scene they are either too fuzzy or the "hidden" objects pop out screaming in your face I'M HERE CLICK ME. The inventory has a sidescroll that complicates your life, I ended up clicking the menu or back buttons too often. Also, the screen went all black twice during gameplay, so I had to restart the game to be able to finish.\nAND WHAT'S WITH THAT ENDING? Idk. I think I could sort of take it that a silly girl would get the hots for any guy that was nice to her, altough it is still too silly...

The HO scenes themselves are a little grainy and hard to see, but once you get used to that it is no problem.

Thumbs sideways.\n\n[edit] :  On reflection, this game does have one amazingly good gameplay mechanic, that helps you figure out what to do if you run out of steam or get confused.  The map screen has on it every room you can currently or hypothetically access, and surrounding each room are a series of nodes : one for each sub-screen where you can look at something up close.  Every one of these rooms and nodes is color coded; grey question marks for places you haven't been, yellow and red ! for places you've been and have completed or can't /currently/ do anything at, and green ! for places that you need to do something at.  You can travel around without the use of this map, and the areas you can access are small and reasonably tight so fast travel is never necessary, which means it only gives you hints if you choose to use it.  All games of this type should have that, I think; it's spoiled me terribly.","November 28, 2015","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some things that could be improved upon, such as animations, voice acting (very cheesy, hard to take seriously other than Rudolf), and dialogue. I felt that the story was very good, although it wasn't portrayed correctly. They seemed to rush things, not explaining things well enough, and could have gotten much more deep and memorable. I bought this game simply for the trading cards, but I got a lot more out of it than I expected. You can't go wrong with a $1.99 story-driven, well-made game. If I had to rate it out of 10, it'd easily score a 7. It only took a little under 3 hours on advanced to beat this game, however I DID skip a lot, so without skips, maybe 5 hours. Pretty darn good for a couple bucks. I'd love to see a higher budget remake with better voice acting and deeper, more meaningful story.\n\ntl;dr: Great graphics, story, and gameplay for the price.

But Alchemy Mysteries was on sale for $.39 (basically free money from selling trading cards), so I figured I'd give them another chance. And I'm really glad I did, because this game is actually good.\n\nUnlike most hidden object games, where each room has a single background, Alchemy Mysteries lets you rotate around and view all four walls. This was a little disorienting at first -- I'm not used to having to remember which direction I'm facing in a hidden object game -- but it works really well. It makes the game feel larger, even though there's only a handful of areas to explore, and it reduces (but not eliminates) the problem of constantly going back to the same screens for the same hidden object scenes over and over again.\n\nThe hidden object scenes themselves suffer from poor image quality and some bad design. Early in the game, I had to find an object that was practitcally hidden behind the interface, and another that was covered by an unmovable object within the scene, so that it was hard to click on even once I used a hint. But they did fix some of the problems from Sinister City; the object list indicates which objects are hidden or need to be manipulated, and mousing over objects you can move changes your cursor to a hand.\n\nAlso, some of the hidden object scenes involve items from your inventory. I've only seen this in one other HOG, and I love it. It makes the hidden object scenes feel integrated into the rest of the game, rather than some arbitrary task to complete.\n\nThe English version has some minor translation issues, like an object being called "watch" instead of "clock," but nothing terrible. The voice acting's bad (I'll blame that partly on the awkwardly translated dialogue), but at least there's not too much of it. And there's a bunch of weird jump scare moments where a ghost suddenly appears and the protagonist doesn't react at all, which is annoying. But the plot's interesting enough, and even not on sale it's a good price for the length of the game.","August 25, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3as/recommended/326190/","3as","Morgue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3as/","249 products in account","Pros:\n- Nice art IN PLACES.\n- They try to discourage random clicking to get solutions by having a scary face woosh at you. It's cute that they tried.\n- Many objects are re-usable, which is good.\n- The HOG scenes have a bunch of objects all of which are drawn seperately, so I never knew which the correct object was just because it was the only one that didn't gel with the background.\n- The dials in the game all rotate both ways based on left or right click. Much less annoying that way.\n- The alchemical symbols are pretty accurate (within the extent of my knowledge), and that's nice.\n\nNeutral/subject to opinion:\n- The main character, Eve, has an independent mind, and when you pick something up, she usually reminds you what its for Sure, she's just GIVING you the solution to the puzzle...  But also it's good that she's not totally brainless, in fact, with a few leaps of logic, she's almost psychic! example:  "I'll need this horn to escape!"... "Uh... Will you?"\n- You can collect things in advance of knowing what they are to be used for, which is good because it reduces back-tracking and in most hidden object games it's obvious hours in advance you'll end up having to collect something and it's better you can just pick it up rather than needing to note down where it was and come back later. On the other hand, at times it seems deeply weird, again feeding into the whole "Eve's a creep genius" thing.\n- There are times you have to use objects from your inventory to complete the HOG scenes. This left me bemused at times because I was completely stumped looking for something that WASN'T THERE. Once you realise it though (The hints system helps there) it keeps the scenes varied and interesting.\n-The HOG scenes give you a list of 6 and when you find something it replaces what you found with a new item until it runs out, this means you need to find the objects in a certain order, which is bad, but it keeps the list short which is good.\n- Pentagrams everywhere. Probably more historically accurate, but disturbing/offensive to those for whom that's a sincere religious symbol.\n\nCons:\n- The whole game sweats with excessive effort. It doesn't sound like a real thing but it's actually trying too hard. I feel sorry for it. Adds to the comedy though.\n- HOGs are the "Find this item based on name" style, BUT the names of the item are often slightly wrong, such as "Hair pin" instead of "Hair slide" which is subtle, sever instances of "watch" isntead of "clock" but still confusing, through to egregious examples, like one near the end which... I don't remember. BUT IT WAS SUPER CONFUSING.\n- Horrible voice acting, and characters who have wedged themselves into the uncanny valley and installed porta johns.\n- Romantic subplot, which was handled with all the subtlety and grace of mating stegasauruses. (I'm not even rating that to be a spoiler because if you didn't see it coming the second the character was introduced, I'm impressed you can at least read)\n- "Horror" genre is mostly aspirational, and tone is horribly mismatched.\n- From each HOG scene you keep only 1 object, which is annoying when you HAD a pair of scissiors two HOG scenes ago but still need to get a new pair before you can use it because... IDK, your character threw those first scissors away?\n\nI got this game for about 70p, and for that it's good value, an evening's entertainment, you can at least laugh at its awfulness.","June 17, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you can ignore the story and do not mind constantly using the map you may enjoy it. Otherwise I’d give it a miss.\n\nReviewYou play as Eva, an orphan arriving in Prague hoping to clues to her family after you receive news of an inheritance befalling you. Instead you are met by a rude woman and a house full of ghosts and a sect of evil alchemists. To be fair, the premise of the story is not awful and evil alchemists could make for interesting antagonists. Unfortunately the voice acting in this game is atrocious, especially the main character, so even if there had not been a multitude of points where the story faltered, the presentation of the story makes it cringe-worthy. It is poorly written, poorly acted and in the end this ruined the game for me. In fact, I would say that this is a great example of a game where not having a story would actually have made it a better game. Couldn’t Eva just have been an archeologist digging through the remains of a temple abandoned by a sect of evil alchemists that never actually appear but just provided a setting?\n\nThere are also a multitude of “jump-scares” as ghosts and skeleton arms appear around the house… but Eva never reacts to them in any way. They are directed at you, the players, who is very unlikely to be scared by them. Thus like everything else in the game, nothing gives any personality to the woman you are playing as. She is just a vessel for your clicking.\n\nThe puzzles (hidden objects and minigames) are fine for the most part. Compared to many other games in the genre the textures are muted and have low resolution, making the object hunting a challenge. I did like the idea of letting you use items from your inventory in the hidden object screens, but this mechanic is partially ruined by the fact that these places are not in any way indicated (for example by your cursor changing when you hover over it or Eva saying something when you click on it).  Another big problem is that as new areas are unlocked, the old areas are left open and always have objects left in them that you need to find/unlock. This means endless backtracking, which is especially monotonous since moving through the game is incredibly slow… unless you use the map. The problem with using the map is that since it (even on advanced mode) shows you which areas have actions you can do, you never actually have to think about what you need items for. You pick up an item and then instantly teleport to where it is needed. Without this option, the game would be an absolute pain to complete, but with it you actually lose a significant portion of the “item puzzling”. The solution would have been better design to avoid either scenario.\n\nWith frequently using the teleportation option and completing all achievements the game on advanced mode took me 4.7 hours according to steam. Unfortunately, overall I did not enjoy my time with Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends. As long as I could ignore the story I was having a decent time with the puzzles, especially in the beginning when the limited options meant that there was little need to use the map unless I was really stuck. But towards the middle to late stages of the game I was forced to mostly use the map. At that point the terrible story had also started getting on my nerves, to the point where I mostly wanted the game to end. Thus, no recommendation from me.","August 20, 2015","false","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First and foremost are the glitches; my screen frequently goes black (and keeps doing it when I back up and retry the triggering action), forcing me to close and reload the game. Secondly, and almost as badly, is that the next step in the story sequence tends to be arbitrary and entirely opaque - I have to make constant use of the hint button to tell me where I need to go next to make progress. (And I don't mean I'm bad at sussing out clues for the next step; they're just not there much of the time.) Then, the poor resolutions on the HO scenes make many of them a joke, especially when the target objects are misleadingly named (clocks referred to as "watches," for example, or a "pin" being separate from the "hair pin" found in the same HO scene). Navigation is cumbersome, especially when almost every sequence has you bouncing all over the available areas, and things you notice early and should rightfully be able to pick up instead don't become "active" until the appointed time, forcing you to revisit all of them (or rely on the hint button again) to figure out what you're supposed to use next.

I emntion this fact for various reasons. First, it's a HOG game, meaning there's not much playtime, there's lots of hidden object scenes, and there's mini games, and various puzzles. Okay, so the positive aspects of Alchemy Mysteries can be considered as not many in this context. Reasonably well structured hidden object scenes, in which point&clicking all over the screen will do the trick. A soundtrack that is not memorable, but suits the game's atmosphere nonetheless. And a story that, a few of the times, can be considered as "good".\n\nBut, thing is, this title's negative aspects are too many, in contrast with the positive ones. I mean, the ending is cheesy, rushed, and not really adequate to what the main story was aiming for. The voice acting is bad, sometimes even terrible. There are two puzzles that, in my opinion, are not well made and even though I managed to complete them without help, I found them not rewarding in any way. And, finally, the constant backtracking to different scenes, and the existence of numerous items that will probably not even be used because someone will take them from you at a certain point in the game.\n\nI mean, it's really up to you as a gamer to decide whether or not to purchase this game, because it's price point is really, really low. But, in my opinion, I would pass. It all comes down as being a game that, besides "teaching" some alchemy story, has no point and no interesting story to it.

Objects are either to small, too dark or doesn't resemble the regular shape of the object. I play from the couch and  many times I had to come closer to my 55" TV which I find ridiculous :/\n\n2) Some of the puzzles have no explanation at all (vide cafe puzzle), some are just simply skipable.

The puzzles are generally well pitched with a good combination of fairly to simple to quite difficult (although I did get fed up with one of the final ones involving prisms). Some are quite creative so I didn't feel I was getting the same recycled ones.\n\n2. The gameplay length was good at 4 hours.\n\n3. It had a nice mix of point and click and hidden object.\n\n4. Some of the animation isn't bad at all and some of the music/sound is quite atmospheric.\n\nThe things which really let it down were:\n\n1. Really silly dialogue, particularly at the end. It's really twee and feels enormously rushed.\n\n2. My character isn't in the least bit surprised to see ghosts. Nowhere in the intro was I prepared that my character regularly saw these, but she just treated them as a naturally occuring everyday thing!\n\n3. Suffers from usual point and click annoyance that you have to return to earlier areas to get an item which wasn't there before. The 'navigation' system is incomprehensible.\n\nOverall would recommend if it's a couple of quid and you're only wanting a few hours gameplay.","August 31, 2015","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is less visually appealing as far as character design graphics, but it has less bland backgrounds and props. The puzzles are about 75% typical hidden item interactions and mini-games, with only a few that felt unique. The click recognitions are a majority operational, but don't try playing with touch. The audio and dialogue are bland as usual, but the story is ok; not good, just ok. Support for the game is untested, as it was unneeded. I was able to complete the game on both easy and advanced in a total of about 5 hrs of gameplay. It has very little replay value beyond its second playthrough.\n\nIn short, on my 10-point scale of rating games based on Concept, Appearance, Content & Replay Value, Mechanics, and Sound I would have to give Sinister City a 5/10. This is an overall decent game, but has very little replay value, is generic in content, and doesn't stand out as an amazing title from the hidden object genre.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this game more than Sinister City, but still only if it is at least half off, as in less than a dollar. It might be worth fropping a buck on it, since you can make a few cents back on the cards, but it isn't worth full price.","September 1, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Жанр представляет собой смесь "Героев щелкания" (без ролевого элемента) с самыми увлекательными приключениями в духе "охоты за активными точками". Однако в данном случае мы получаем еще и холодящую душу драму ужасов с привидениями, сюжет которой угадывается с первых сцен: жестокий глава семьи, разлученные судьбою близнецы, насилие над невезучим, разврат, похищение.\n\nМы играем за везучего близнеца, что не может не радовать. Героиня игры, видно, тоже наслаждается своим преимуществом, так как голос ее остается одинаково бодрым и звонким даже в разговоре с явным злодеем сразу же после того, как мы обнесли весь его дом, вскрывая стенные панели и взламывая тайники.\n\nВ общем, атмосфера в игре довольно приятная, пока неожиданно не объявится очередной призрак. Так, мило поковырявшись в чьем-то антикварном сокровище и выдрав из него все, что полезло в карман, можно легко изгадить штаны при повороте к двери - настолько жуткие здесь использованы фигуры трехмерного моделирования эпохи правления раннего Владимира Путина.\n\nНазвать игру плохой не поворачивается язык. За 30 рублей самое то. Кроме того, у нее потрясающей красоты значки в виде старинного фолианта - как библиофил считаю себя обязанным собрать хотя бы первый уровень.\n\n***\nAt last I've got to play a hidden object game, russian developers traditionally have a strong school in this jenre. It's a mix of 'Clicker Heroes' (without the RPG element) with the most exciting adventures of pixel huting. But here we also get a blood-chilling horror drama, it's story you can guess during the opening scenes: cruel head of the family, divided twins, violence over the unfortunate one, debauchery, kidnapping.\n\nWe play as the fortunate twin. The heroine is also very glad with this fact seemingly, for she speaks with ever cheerful tone even facing an obvious evil character just after we had burglarized his house, crashing wall panels and cracking strongboxes.\n\nAll in all the atmosphere is quite pleasant, until another ghost arrives. Once in a while, rummaging through someone's antique case, grabbing everything that fits in the pocket and than turning over to the door you could easely crap your pants for the old-school 3d models used here are so scary!\n\nNevertheless I can't say the game is bad. It's cool for $0,5. Also it has wonderful badges resembling an old folio book, of which I'll surely make at least the first level.","July 16, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celebrusd/recommended/326190/","celebrusd","Festive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celebrusd/","247 products in account","Maybe I don't play hidden object games that much, but Alchemy Mysteries consistently disappointed me at every turn. Invariable backtracking, outrageously tedious puzzle games, and a storyline that's plagued with plotholes. The only thing this game has going for it are the animations for characters and ghosts, most of which are ruined by the absolutely awful voice acting.\n\nBacktracking is really the focal issue in this game. It's almost as if they couldn't design enough levels to fit all their useless hidden object minigames. Get the items from the briefcase, use them in another room, go back to the briefcase, get an item, use them in another room. It drones on and on until they breach your monotony with another boring cutscene of someone NPC talking with peanut butter in their mouth.\n\nAlso, I couldn't help but ask my self, "Why the heck do I need all these items?" Maybe I'm just not into hidden object games as much as the next person, but why would I need to get a duster to wipe away some cobwebs, when the main character consistently picks up handfuls of spiders in hidden object minigames? Why do I need a god damn rapier to open up a wall cover when I had a hammer/crowbar in my inventory?\n\nI digress.\n\nI could put all of that aside. The horrible voice-acting, the trainwreck minigames, and the awful storyline. I could give Alchemy Mysteries the benefit of the doubt on everything above, but the one thing I will not are the puzzles. I literally spent an hour on a single puzzle because of how comically difficult it was. Allow me to give you an example of the puzzle because these things pop up like weeds in games like this.\n\nYou backtrack through the game and find two clock hands. Great, you can finally put them on the clock and fix it so you can progress the story. Once you put them on, you're looking at a clockface with three different-styled hands. You have to match all three hands with their respective shadows, but you only have three buttons and each button moves two hands at the same time. That's not fun; that's actually really god damn boring.\n\nMaybe I'm not masochistic enough, but I was struggling really hard to continue this game after an hour of that puzzle. I just kept pressing buttons until I finished the game because there's no strategy, structure, or style to a minigame like that. It's all random and good luck figuring that out quickly. These puzzles, though.. They're littered throughout the game and I kept dreading the time I'd have to do one again.\n\nI cannot recommend this game at this time.\n\nBoring story, horrible voice-acting, bad puzzles, and backtracking that doesn't make any sense. The jumpscares and animations are the only thing going for this game and, even then, it's ruined by the lack of depth and (clearly) money that the developers didn't have to hire someone competent enough to read their lines off realistically. Alchemy Mysteries is not even worth the price on a discount.","November 25, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Early on I found myself trying to arrange items for a ritual that the game never bothered to give me information on. One line of 'yeah you can do a ritual' in a book and apparently the main character psychically intuited what was required, while I had no idea what it wanted me to do and resorted to just using every item in my inventory until one finally worked.\n\nHidden object scenes can require using inventory items on items in the scene but become available before actually obtaining the inventory item, so I often had to use the hint button just to see if I even had what I needed.\n\nThe hidden object scenes themselves are blurry/fuzzy and the objects don't look like they quite fit in the scene, not to mention the occasional misleading wording -- a 'watch' that's actually a large wall clock, a 'shot glass' that turns out to be a metal goblet.\n\nAnd finally, after completing everything, the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying. I finish a puzzle assuming there's a decent chunk of the game left and suddenly the villains are defeated and the game is over, with a short cutscene to tie up loose ends.","January 9","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This may be a pro or a con, depending on what you want.\n\nThere are several bad glitches in the game where the screen goes black and I have to exit and re-enter the area (multiple times) before I can proceed.\n\nOne really handy mechanic is the map and being able to teleport to unsolved puzzles whenever you want. This made traveling very easy, especially since navigating without the map is extremely confusing. However, it does take away certain mystery aspects of the game.

Early on I found myself trying to arrange items for a ritual that the game never bothered to give me information on. One line of 'yeah you can do a ritual' in a book and apparently the main character psychically intuited what was required, while I had no idea what it wanted me to do and resorted to just using every item in my inventory until one finally worked.\n\nHidden object scenes can require using inventory items on items in the scene but become available before actually obtaining the inventory item, so I often had to use the hint button just to see if I even had what I needed.\n\nThe hidden object scenes themselves are blurry/fuzzy and the objects don't look like they quite fit in the scene, not to mention the occasional misleading wording -- a 'watch' that's actually a large wall clock, a 'shot glass' that turns out to be a metal goblet.\n\nAnd finally, after completing everything, the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying. I finish a puzzle assuming there's a decent chunk of the game left and suddenly the villains are defeated and the game is over, with a short cutscene to tie up loose ends.","January 9","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Frankly, the voice acting and writing is just awful. The story itself isn't too bad, but the dialogue is painful.\n\nNone of the puzzles are impossible, even on expert mode. This may be a pro or a con, depending on what you want.\n\nThere are several bad glitches in the game where the screen goes black and I have to exit and re-enter the area (multiple times) before I can proceed.\n\nOne really handy mechanic is the map and being able to teleport to unsolved puzzles whenever you want. This made traveling very easy, especially since navigating without the map is extremely confusing. However, it does take away certain mystery aspects of the game. But since knowing what to do can be extremely vague at times, I am in full favor of the teleportation mechanic.\n\nOverall, not a bad point and click puzzle game with some nice jumpscares and hidden object puzzles.

Not because items are cleverly hidden, but because they're sometimes really hard to tell apart from the background (I'm looking at you tweezers). Plot is not so great and feels quite forced. I did like how you can explore around and gather items from different locations to use them later on (enter the shop, proceed to pilfer everything that you can and only after then call for the owner).

Unfortunately I don't recommend this game.  Mostly because there's a pretty bad bug where upon advancing (or turning) to another location, or using an item in an hidden object area, will cause the screen to go black.  The UI is present and the dust motes overlaying the entire game are there too, but everything else is black.  You can bring up and close the journal or map and the picture will return, but only temporarily.  And that method isn't working in an hidden object scene where I have to fix a magnifying glass; every time I pick up the lens the picture goes black.  I've read that quitting and restarting will temporarily fix this, but it shouldn't be happening in the first place.  I'd refund the game, but for $2 I guess I will manage.\n\nThe HO scenes can be very tricky on the advanced setting.  Some objects are hidden behind the UI buttons on the top, others are 90% hidden by other objects in the scene.  This leads me to clicking on every sliver of anything I cannot identify in case something I need pops out from behind something else.  The game also employs a non-traditional mechanic where you must use items in your inventory on other items in the HO scenes.  That always trips me up; I'm not sure whether this is a good thing or not.\n\nThe story is interesting enough that I don't notice how small the game world really is which I think is great.  The graphics are fairly well done although the HO scenes tend to look like Photoshop collages.  The game has a map which shows you areas you've completed, areas which have tasks to do, and has fast travel.  Unfortunately the map legend is rather complicated.\n\nThe puzzle adventures vary quite a bit in difficulty.  Some are straight forward.  Others task you with fixing game-unique objects without telling you what you'll need, so you have no idea what to do since they are not real-life objects.  Puzzles can be quite arbitrary too - at one point you have to hit a gong but neither the hammer in your inventory nor the bell clapper you find in the area will do it.\n\nUnless you get this game at a good sale or are so lacking in other HOGs that you desperately need something to play, I'd avoid this one.\n\nedit:  finally finished the game.  Took me about 5 hrs.  I had to restart the game several times due the black screen bug.  One puzzle (the prism puzzle discussed on the forums) was super finicky.  Getting the light to the crystal wasn't too hard but it took some unnecessary adjustments to get the solution to trigger.  The ending was a bit abrupt and out of the blue mentioned some tower (???).  While I liked parts of this game, I can't recommend it mainly due to technical issues.  Oh, the computer I'm playing on isn't great, but it is above the minimum specs on the store page.","May 16","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
