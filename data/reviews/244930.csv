No, it didn't quite ' Cripple ' me, it more left me unable to ever truly put stress on my knee again. For those who ski and snowboard, you know the ability to do so is paramount to actually staying on the damn things.\n\nI found this game just today, watching funny little youtube videos, coming across a bunch of guys messing around with it. While it illicited some laughs, I was interested. ' What is this game? And why the hell has it been under my radar this whole time? '.\n\nAfter about a half an hour of playing it, I can say it's decent. It's free. The ragdoll physics give me a laugh or two, and the first person doing a 720 left me breathless.\n\nThank you for giving me my hobby back, at least in this form.","February 3","true","3.6"," 240 of 249 people (96%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","96","240","249","29","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThED4G/recommended/244930/","ThED4G","TheDaG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThED4G/","180 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI got this game after binge watching snowboarding films ( Its January and no hills in Scotland have any snow, I need my fix... ) and deciding to check steam for SSX, NO SSX on steam but it does have this early access game. To say the least I was intrigued. Before I go any further theres a couple of questions you will need to ask yourself\n\nDo you love snowsports?\nDid you love SSX 3 and SSX  ( the newer 1 )? with its freeroamy goodness\nDo you want to experience what pulling a 1080 feels like in first person?\nCan you afford to go snowboarding in other countries? ( I can't :(\n\nIF you answered yes to any of the first 3 questions and no to the last one then this game is for you. IF you answered yes to the last question then what are you doing on your PC? book that holiday to Tignes, Mayrhofen or where ever and do it for real. Read on for a more descript review\n\n\nStill reading? Good now lets break this down\n\nGraphics - The graphics are great, I mean its a freeskiing/snowboarding game so theres no explosions or anything fancy just fantastic looking mountains and pistes. The snows nice with persistent trails from your previous runs and the characters look well textured which is just as well cause you need to show off that fancy piece of kit you just plowed your hard earned credits into.\n\nGameplay - The game is split into offline and online and in either of them you can choose to do events or freeroam. The events cover pretty much every category of skiing and snowboarding with time trial, freestyle etc... and the freeroam... well lets just say your plonked onto whichever part of the mountain you want and you go from there. At the time of review there is 1 mountain and several big air parks, don't let that put you off, the Mountain is huge ( of course it is, its a mountain ) The skiing itself seems fine but can be a little funny at times with some quirky bugs. I started a run and my character was stuck in the Jesus pose until I respawned or the fact that if you crash your body ragdolises as if you were made out of rubber.  I need to mention as well this game plays like a simulation so theres no insane tricks that make your ski's pop off and fly around your head before magically reattaching..... looking at you SSX\n\nMusic - The music is good, it could be better with some extra tunes and maybe some from that previous SSX game but the music they do have is chosen well for the snowscene. It would be good to see the total tracks or be able to skip them as a couple of times during freeroam its played the first track and then stopped. If anyone has been on a mountain without any music they know what thats like. Theres always steam music tho i suppose\n\nCustomization - The customization in this game is snow joke ( I had to ) This is where the game really shines, at the time of this review I am eagerly awaiting the release of the snowboarding part of the game however from looking through the items just for skiing theres is a HUGE amount to pick from. You kit your character out from head to toe literally, Chose hats,helmets,goggles,jackets,trousers,boots,skis,poles face masks & even bindings. Each of these categories have recent kit from most of the popular brands such as K2, Scott & Head to name just a few.\n\nMultiplayer - I actually haven't played much of multiplayer, my first attempt was met with huge lag. Second attempt and I saw 1 other person on the mountain which i followed in the hopes of showing my mad skills to. got ahead of him and prepared to hit a kicker unfortuntately I ended up hitting him and we both bailed. Which would of been fine but for some reason in multiplayer you can only restart at the top of the mountain and not where you bailed. Needless to say he bailed from the game. The developers are aware of the connection issues and are trying to improve it so hopefully it will be sorted soon as this is an integral part of the game, Imagine you and a couple of buddies on the side of the hill with a kicker taking turns at hitting it. For me that sounds perfect\n\nTo sum things up this game has huge potential, they are adding in snowboarding soon and If they add in the same amount of gear for snowboarding as they have for skiing I will be a very very happy person. As with any early access game theres still a long way to go. However again I highly recommend this game for any fan of snowsports or the SSX games.\n\nSome things i would like to see in the released game.\n\nAbility to get off skis/board and wander around + the ability to spawn in objects & move them ( such as ramps, tables etc ) for limited amounts of time to make your own jibs etc kinda like what SKATE had\n\nIf you use a chair lift can we maybe be able to sit and watch from it as we go back up ( with the ability to skip ) sounds boring but its actually quite entertaining seeing whats going on from them especially when people bail :p\n\nSnowmobiles, currently used much like the chair lifts when you interact they take you to certain spawns instead maybe when we use them we could actually drive them to where ever. Would open the game up alot more.\n\nWeather and snow conditions - Everyone loves a bluebird day however in Scotland getting a bluebird day is a rare thing and i presume its the same for places everywhere else? Stoked had a fantastic weather system with storms that altered the snow conditions. It would be great to see the same thing done here\n\nMountains - More mountains... can never have enough mountains","January 5","true","9.8"," 239 of 257 people (93%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","93","239","257","59","19"

It's ridiculous. Espescially seeing all the complaints about things like speed and physics when in reality this game has WAY more realistic speed and physics than any other snow games out there like SSX Shaun White Snowboarding etc. All those games have horrible physics and DO NOT replicate real life snow sports what so ever. The funny thing is I have snowboarded all my life and didn't even care much for skiing, so I was dissappointed that snowboarding isn't in the game yet, but I went ahead and purchased anyways because I couldn't wait any longer since there are no other games out there like this one. Long story short this game actually made me like skiing for the first time ever in the 18 years of my life of being a snowboarder. I've also been waiting for a game like this forever literally. NO COMPANY has ever made a snow sports game so realistic. I needed a game like this so badly and it's finally here. So here's my review:\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Very realistic physics. (Speed going uphill is a little bit off when tucking since you barely slow down but is not a problem because it allows you to find more lines. Going downhill is perfect. Please do not change it devs, do not listen to idiots.)\n\n- All tricks are realistic as well. (You can finally cork your spins. Never have I ever played a snow game that I could actually pull a double cork 10 that looks exactly like it's done in real life. In Shaun White Snowboarding the closest thing to a cork is a rodeo...no corking was implemented in that game... like wtf.)\n\n- Real life brand clothing and gear replicas. (Armada, Head, etc.)\n\n- Real life event replicas. (Nine Knights, Jon Olsson Invitational, etc.)\n\n- Real Life sponsers. (Red Bull, Monster, etc.)\n\n- Vast mountains to explore, and I mean it. The current mountain Sialia actually takes about 10 minutes real life time to get from top to the bottom at full speed making it very realistic. Also this mountain is ski - able in all directions, North, East, West, and South. Each direction has different types of terrain, including a terrain park, my favorite, that takes about 4 minutes to get down.\n\n-Lots of cool different lines you can take. The whole mountain has lines hidden away for you to find. Above I mentioned the terrain park which has multiple different directions you can take that lead you into different parts of the terrain park and back into the same parts if you wish. The choice is yours as there are so many variations to this terrain park it's truly endless fun.\n\n-Legit first person view (It literally looks like real life in first person view when you're corking a spin.)\n\n-Free 2 play coming soon. (People complaining about microtransactions yet the whole base game is free. The only thing you get if you buy into the microtransations is cosmetics and vanity. You don't gain any advantages to your character in terms of speed, power, or skills. NO PAY2WIN here. The skill is in the players hands.\n\n-Devs are super friendly and helpful and respond very fast to any problems or bug reports. (I submitted a bug report and got a response within the first day and then I responded again because I didn't give accurate information and they responded within minutes.) Most importantly they actually listen to their community.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Few bugs. (Sometimes your character bails even though he landed perfectly, which happens very rarely like 2 times in a 4 hour session. Not a big deal) (Skiing switch in first person is a little buggy since the shoulder gets in the way when tucking. Not a big deal.) Sometimes when you spawn on a drop point you get stuck until you respawn again. (Not a big deal.) (Games crashes in multiplayer sometimes as well as desyncs, which kind of pisses me off but I sent in a ticket and  devs noted these crashes and are working on fixing them, also new servers are coming very soon.)\n\n-Price of gear is just a little bit expensive but I have no problems with this at all since there is no advantage to owning this stuff. The game is free on January 27th and I will buy some just to support the devs. Obviously they can't just work for free.\n\n-Not enough advertising. I really want to see this game succeed but I only heard about this in December, yet it's appearently been out for 3 years now. I had to search deep to find this it was literally like digging for gold and hitting the jackpot. I was stuck with all these other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games for 3 years when I could have been playing this.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nIf you are like me and are looking for a snow sports game that actually replicates real life skiing and snowboarding, then this is the game you're looking for. This is the game you have been waiting your whole life to play, but couldn't because it was buried in a search engine full of bullsh*t. Do yourself the favour and don't waste cash on all these mainstream AAA garbage games made in China. You'll just come right back here realizing how much of an idiot you were to even bother looking at them.\n\nHope you guys find my review useful. Thanks.\n","January 19","true","103.0"," 186 of 214 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","186","214","13","16"

The game is in alpha, there is no sound, yet I still enjoyed every second skiing down the mountain. If you like skiing you will love this even in its unfinished state. It can only go up from here.\n\nEdit: So I'm going to add a little more to this review because apparently people are actually reading it.\n\nHere's what you can complain about: Lack of sound and snow effects.\n\nSound's no big deal, just play some of your own music in the background for now. It's the effects that really throw everything off. Your character is basically just on the mountain, as of right now there's no interaction between the skis and the mountain; no tracks, no little specks of snow going everywhere as you might expect from skis in snow. But I'm sure that's in the works, and honestly once the sound and those little effcts are in the game is more than recommendable if you enjoy the winter sports.\n\nThere's a little bit of a learning curve but I'd venture a guess and say it's easier to learn to play this game than actually ski.\n\nEarlier today they put out a big update and really cleaned up a lot of the UI. The menu isn't all over the place and flicking out of view and they have the basic framework down for the multiplayer. It's looks really promising.\n\nNow of course there's bugs here and there, the previous update completely broke the options menu but I have yet to encounter any crashing while actually playing the game itself which is something.\n\nAs I'm writing this there are no negative reviews so that should tell you that yes, if you're unsure whether or not  to buy it and it seems interesting, but you're afraid it won't turn out great down the road; I'd recommend it even in it's current state.","November 25, 2013","true","7.1"," 152 of 190 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","152","190","0","0"

This game use to be good, when it first came out on early access. I even paid for the founders pack. the physics, speed, and style of this game are not there anymore.

Now? No.\n\nThe latest update - the "Beta" update on March 10th completely changed the game from something good with lots of potential to.. something that feels less like a game and more like a cash grab. They've added microtransactions for any sort of cosmetic item. Anything that one could originally use on their character for free in the Alpha has been put behind a paywall. As of now, you can only get these items through purchasing a "credit pack" and getting them that way.\n\nThe developer says that they will eventually add ways to earn these items in the game, but to release a major "update" with the microtransactions in-game for people like myself who already spent money on said game is a red flag. I know that the developers need to make a living and game development isn't cheap. On their forums, a developer has said that it was economically unwise for them to charge $15 or so for the base game and have everyone unlock the gear from the start - thus the microtransactions. However, I fail to see why exactly this business model has been adapted - it would have been much easier to just increase the price of the game accordingly - instead of adding a microtransaction system.\n\nAgain, I realize that the developers need to make a profit. That's fine - but the current business model is not the best way to go, and if a drastic, negative change took place from Alpha to Beta, it makes me skeptical about what the future holds. Only time will tell. However, as of now, the game does not appear to be something worth investing in.","March 19, 2015","false","6.6"," 95 of 128 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","95","128","3","2"

But now the game constantly crashes for me, they added micro-transactions and they made the movements worse than what they were in the beggining... I also have to add that the biggest part of the fun (with the launch version) was to explore the mountain with the "cheating mode" that was a mode you activated while pressing F1 and could drop your character anywhere you wanted on the mountain.

Most of the negetivity is due to either:\n\n1. They found out they have to pay real money to customize their skiers looks\n\n2. The latest update has a few glitches that need to be ironed out.\n\nHowever, consider that:\n\nA. The game will EVENTUALLY be free to play, and they will fund the game on in game purchases. It currently is not because the game is still in early access. You are paying extra money to access the game early .. NOT TO BUY THE GAME. You might think that is stingey, but this is an independantly developed game by a company with LIMITED RESOURCES .. they need your money to make the game!\n\nB. Early Access = glitches .. welcome to the world of modern game development.\n\nIf you can get past those 2 points and have more patience than a 5 year old whiner, then this game is the BEST Skiing game ever made, and IMO the BEST Winter sports game ever made.\n\nThe major selling point is that the game takes a more grounded "less arcadey" approach, while the physics are still a little loose to allow you to pull off some silly jumps, it mostly gets there and it does it well. You can explore a full mountain with little to no restrictions, which includes a resort complete with lifts (which will be rideable eventually) and an entire back country area. There are a plethora of ways down the mountain, and nothing limits you in any direction.\n\nThis is the Skiing game I have been wishing for since I was 5, and I fully recommend it.","March 27, 2015","true","103.0"," 62 of 88 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","62","88","3","0"

I'll update this review once I've had a chance to try it out.

Now, however, if you want to try the best bits of the mountain, you need to grind XP which is still insanely slow in Free Roam mode.\n\nI may be wrong but I get the impression that once the game is Free2Play, the devs are worried people won't hang around long enough to spend money. Unfortunately, it's turned a fun, relaxing game into yet another slog.\n\nI do still recommend it, just.

The other reviewers seem to be angered by the microtransactions, however, these transactions are only cosmetic for the players character model/skier. So no, there are no BS microtransactions that give another player benefits over others. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet/explainable as possible.\n\nPROS:\n-Beautiful graphics\n-Decently optimized / Runs GREAT on higher end PCs\n-Open World\n-Lots of details and things to look at\n-Fun Gameplay\n-Good physics (Sometimes glitch out and act weird)\n-GREAT atmosphere\n-Good soundtrack\n-Navigation is easy\n\nCONS: (DunDunDun)\n\n-Multiplayer is lacking, while it's there it just seems thrown in at the moment\n-Wacky Ragdolls (This can be a con because of how hilariously your player model flails about the mountains/slopes.)\n-Small amount of maps at its current state\n-Grinding doesn't seem to work well\n\nAll in all, SNOW is a great game at it's core.

Recommended for anyone looking fora quality skiing experience on PC.\n\nFULL REVIEW\nSNOW boots you to the main menu where you'll find freestyle skiing, and a store to customize your character. You also find some upcoming features, like Competitive Events. The store is filled with lots of good looking gear, and hopefully much more will come. When you hit Freestyle, you are able to select from a Mountain, the Tutorial, and an olympic themed course. The tutorial I found to be quite confusing, but most of the game is quite simple once you get the basic controls. The mountain is beautifully designed, with great views and jump points. It also has hidden easter eggs like the Yeti and Castle. The olympic course looks pretty good, and can be alot of fun to pull off tricks. Speaking of tricks, air stunts in this game flow well, and there are a great number of them. One problem with this game is sound has yet to be an implemented feature. I'd also like to mention the console's cheat commands, allowing you to slow gravity can be very fun. In conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good skiing game on steam.","July 15, 2014","true","4.4"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

Runs absolutely terribly and they ruined the entire gameplay because now you have to unlock the areas, after playing it for roughly 1 hour or less trying to find out how to unlock the areas, I just couldn't. I don't know how.\n\nThrough out the playthrough I've found waaay too many bugs (Understandable for a EA game) with both gameplay and controls. With the 360 (And XBone) Controller, it would either not work half way through the game (And I'd have to restart) or it would just crash the minute I used my controller. Keyboard and Mouse controls were fairly decent, didn't notice much of a problem other than a imput delay but it was "Alright".\n\nHere's my opinion about microtransactions, there should be a way to earn credits instead of having to buy these credits.\nThis would really dim down the whole micro-transaction part, or maybe add a way to earn these clothings that you can buy with these credits\n\nMy overall rating without my microtransactions review: 3/10\nMy overall rating with my microtransactions review: 2/10\n\nWhen new updates are released, I'll change my review depending on the updates.The updates have rolled in and I just installed the game after not playing it for... a couple months maybe?\nLet's ignore microtransactions completely, because the game it's self is actually pretty fun (now atleast), I'm still using the same build since I wrote the quoted review and the performance is flawless on the max settings. (Average of 120 - 200 FPS, frames do drop below 100 for me when I'm in forest-like areas.) Now, about the whole speed loss n' such after the engine change, yeah, I'm noticing that's kinda gone, but after the latest updates, it looks like they brought it back.\n\nI'm actually in love with this, mainly the multiplayer though, it's so damn fun playing with your friends in this game, honestly. I'd say pick up this game for you and a friend it you wanted to have fun, playing solo is still fun but sorta bland.\nThe ragdoll physics are abit wonky but are actually pretty funny, assuming that's not intentional, I hope it stays like this, I love it. Skiing physics in general, I'd say they're solid, a few "Hard to control" things here and there, but overall works fine.\n\nNow, I'll get onto the bad of this game. The UI really needs some tweeking and reworking, in it's current state, it works with SOME flaws, the UI in general is somewhat barely useable by mouse, but fine with keyboard and controller, hoping that this is not meant to be played with just a controller (Despite me using a controller mainly). The arrows to select between settings is rather annoying to click on the mouse, but perfectly fine for a controller.\n\nSwitching settings is tedious as hell, I was trying to change my graphics settings and the screen the game was on, but the settings would either 1) change to what it was on before, 2) go back to defaults or 3) just go to some random setting I didn't select. YET AGAIN, this is another mouse & keyboard problem for me, using the controller for the settings, then applying them and they're set to what I chose, which is making me feel this game is very... "Controller-required" if that makes sense, mainly for the UI.\n\nAs much as I said "Let's ignore microtransactions", I want to bring it up just this once;\nYeah, sure there's microtransactions, but that doesn't mean dislike the game, all the items are cosmetic, they do not provide and sort of "Boost" of some kind, not saying I'll give them money for this type of system. But looking at the leveling system, it seems they give you items AKA unlocking parts of the map and the cosmetics, which I really like about a game filled with microtransactions. I will point out that you can unlock other areas of the map by skiing around or in them, which is a huge plus for unlocking areas. But this also means you are limited to certain areas for some time, getting around isn't entirely that hard though.\n\nMy overall rating without my microtransactions review: 7.5/10\nMy overall rating with my microtransactions review: 7.5/10","December 1, 2015","true","7.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

You can change the way your character looks and reshape the mountain to your every wish. Scroll to the bottom if you just want to read the general review :) Time for the review:\n\nGraphics:\nThis is an early access game, remember that. This game still has amazing graphics and lighting in every aspect. The game graphics are amazing. The low graphics settings ups the performance a lot but still looks very nice, and dont even get me started on how great the "very high" setting looks.\n\nControls:\nThe controls are pretty straight forward, just takes a look at the player guide to figure everything out, but becomes very simple after you get the hang of it.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game runs out really smoothly, with glitches here and there, but just remember to keep in mind that this is in PRE-ALPHA state, meaning that the game's core mechanics and gameplay are still in development. The game still has very realistic physics and skiing experience.\n\nPerformance:\nSNOW has very good perormance most of the time. The only problem you might have is that when you load a mountain when you are on a different one the game occasionally crashes (at least for me).\n\nSound:\nYes, it has been added. a lot of the other reviews are a little outdated. The sound is SO realistic for an early-access game. It sounds just like it would on the mountain.\n\nGame Size:\nThis game a healthy amount of varied features that help counter-balance the glitches in this game\n\nMultiplayer:\nSNOW has a multiplayer feature but you usually end up in lobbies with little to no people inside. Once the game goes F2P then it will likely get a lot better. This is at least how it ends up for me, but maybe not for others.\n\nMountain design:\nSNOW's mountains are very well made and have lots of ridable features. The features in the Lo2 park have full jumping/grinding capability, and the backcountry, like the observatory or summit have many obstacles such as boulders and rocks.\n\nOVERALL:\nI recommend this game to any gamers who love to play freestyle sports video games, open world games, or just love playing glitchy games for the fun of it(they'll get fixed soon, please dont fix the funny ones :3). If you don't like games that are very glitchy then i would wait until the game reaches beta. Same goes for people who dont want to pay for the game. I had a really fun time playing this and it probably wont go out of early access for a while anyways, so...................................... 9.5/10 would review again :3","December 29, 2014","true","4.1"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","23","30","4","0"

You gotta love every detail in this game's graphics. The panorama is actually so beautiful that it makes you loose your focus on riding itself! But then comes the downer side, riding feels great and all, very realistic, until you hit a rail or fall down and glitch your body half way through to the Matrix. I think there should be a button for sliding like in Tony Hawk for example, otherwise the rider looks just plain bored, standing all straight and stuff. Or, there actually is a button for this but I didn't find it because there is no way to check out or adjust the controls! That is kinda unacceptable, but I do understand this is a pre-alpha and I'm not gonna judge it so harshly until the whole thing's out. I can't wait to review this later when they put snowboards in it. I am a passionate SNB rider myself and it would be great to performe some tricks on PC that I'm scared to try IRL.\n\nI'll edit this when it's out.","December 17, 2014","true","1.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

Not like me nvidea 600 series :S because the time of that series is really over, but its possible to play if u have other good stuff in your PC, like me 1st series of i7.\nEnough about the PC, the person model it self is a little bit stiff, but otherwise it would eat more ressources, so i take that because the scape is more important!\n\nGameplay:\nAwesome, first you will feel back in SSX with the keysettings on controller (if you played), but with improvements, because you can decide where you Grap your Ski's (ski only, Snowboard & Snowmobile will income). Playing with Keyboard feels rediciulous, but also possible and i used it enough to say that's ok (since yesterday 30.03.16) you are also able to make new keybindings :D\nGaming Modes you have are: Soloplay (with Awesome Features), Multiplayer (for the fun and showtime with friends).\nIn the Soloplay you have Events to get first cosmetic stuff, challenges (witch i could play till yet) but its like a check list of tricks u have to do and of cause u have the freeroom where u can check out the whole mountain. The Multiplayer has No Drone, No own Respawn Point, but its for cruising with friends.\n\nSo for your decision, if you like to explore Mountain's in Winter and do some Tricks, take that Simulator, because it looks like u driveing a skiing pro, never saw some compareable, exceptable is SSX for Playstation, but the difference between those two are the focuse of the Gamedeveloper, Snow is more the Simulator witch is Focused "Ride the mountain on your Own" and make it beautiful with nice Jumps. And on other Hand SSX is just more like Tony Hawk, Arcade highscoring.\nFor over 10 Years i was Every Year in Austria, Skiing / Snowboarding and for me its an Awesome game for relaxing but at the same discover new areas and try Awesome Jumps from rediculous Drops.\n\nThank you for reading my first Review\nPlz give me some Feedback,\ncritics also welcome :D","March 31","true","23.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","17","21","6","0"

Then came the infamous "cash shop" update, that also changed the existing physics to something horrendous. The controls got slippery and manouvering in the game world got tedious. And, ofcourse, the prices. Coins were way to expensive for the amount of goodies you were able to get. Right now you get 1000 coins for 10$. A full set of new equipment will net you around 1,2-1,5k. That makes 15$. Don't get me wrong, that's a lot of cash for some digital clothes. Especially for an early acces game that might never be finished...\nOn the other hand, other developers sell cosmetic goodies for up to 30$ (you know who i'm looking at here...) and people buy it.\nSo i think supporting the only company that seems to have atleast some interest in a skiing- and later on snowboarding game, no matter how long the developement will go on, is a good thing.\nAnd let's be honest... The game, at its core, is enjoyable and fun to play.

Excellent graphics, lots of maps which are very large, especially the Mountain which has more than 10 spawn points all in different areas, with each one having so much to explore than the others. You can be a pumkin head with epic shoes doing a backflip just to land it perfectly and - just in time - take a screenshot. The optimization might not be the best, so I just put it onto medium-ish settings. And I'm telling you that if I can run Titanfall on medium, I should be able to run this on high! Wait... look at that snow, all these textures! It's so good looking! Nevermind then, if you take a closer look SNOW is very strong in the category of Graphics.\n\nGraphics\nIt's a beautiful game, very impressive for a game which costs this little. You might say to yourself "Heh, that's nothing. Have you Seen GTA V?" and to that I said that I have seen it and played both games, SNOW and GTA V. GTA V is a costly game which is a finished release with some updates. SNOW is a cheaper game in earlier developement with way more snow. It's just very nice to see that you can change time ingame. I love to set it to sunrise. All those pinkish colors on the snow, those brighter shadows. It looks almost like a film or as if I'm an actual Skieer with a camera strapped to a flying bot following me. An easy 9/10.\n\nSounds\nThe sounds remind me of the Skate series. Skate is about skating, SNOW is about skiing. Both have magnificent sounds about their genres. The snow sounds realistic as if I'm cutting it up, which I sort of am in the game. The music is excellent, just, one of the best soundtracks, Burnout Paradise in front of SNOW by only a few points. The sounds are very high quality. A simple 8/10 for sounds.\n\nPayment\nYou can pay for cosmetic items. since I have recieved the Starter Edition from the kind developers, I do not know if you start with any ingame credits.  Anyway, there's definitely quite a bit over 100 items in total that you can purchase. The average itme is around 50-70 credits. Some items cost a bit more (up to 200 from what I have seen). So you could buy a lot, trust me on this. I got an epic Pumkin Hat for very cheap. It looks awesome. You can get more credits by using real-life money.\nPros vs Cons\n\nPros:\nExcellent graphics\nCheap for such a good game\nItem pricing is low enough to buy a ton for little\nUpdates are not too rare\nSounds are very impressive\n\nCons:\nNot the best optimization\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

The features in the  new L02 park are fixed to work most of the time.  Grinding and jumping from rail to rail looks incredibly smooth.  Spinning off of rails and boxes is a lot of fun.  The big airs aren't super massive to where it's unbelievable anymore, but the realistic approach works so well for this type of game.\n\nThe rest of the mountain has improved much, although, I wish there was still a castle.  Maybe there is?  Maybe I haven't found it yet?   Another great feature of this game:  replayability.  I have spent hours taking alternative routes and  hitting yet another crazy line.  The mountain is huge and every nook and cranny is worth exploring.\n\nOverall, I believe this game is an incredible purchase $15.  With the fact that it will also be coming out for PS4, this game will make drastic improvements and additions within the next year (maybe months if we are lucky) including multiplayer, more mountains, new items, and snowboarding.  The ultimate ski sim.

Analog sticks are absolutely essential, the M/K controls are complete sewage, but you could probably guess that.\nApart from that, the game is a really fun, fast-paced, and generally intuitive skiing sim. Combos require enough skill in timing to be genuinely satisfying to pull off, the maps are absolutely gorgeous (CryEngine ain't no slouch in the visual department) and there are very few other games that so accurately recreate the feeling of flying through a forest at breakneck pace. It makes the moments of triumph all the more fun to achieve when they're punctuated by your character inevitably crashing into a tree and his ragdoll shooting into space.\nOn that note, the game can get frustrating at times. The camera is angled slightly downward by default, and the way the maps are laid out makes it very difficult to actually see past bigger inclines. That means that if you're going for the biggest jumps (and why would you not be?) you're taking massive leaps of faith every time, and it's almost impossible to predict whether your angle is going to send you into a fluffy patch of snow for a perfect landing or into a rock so your character can make another trip into space. Meanwhile, the combo system gives out points for tricks and penalizes mistakes, but the amount it penalizes doesn't seem to have any correlation to the severity of the mistake you made. At one junction, I had just pulled off a cork 1440, earning 80 points in the process, and had landed right next to a row of trees, so I had to do a little weaving to avoid a crash. I didn't quite get out of the way of a slight incline in the ground, though, and my character tripped up on it, so I rewinded about 20 feet to turn a little harder left and avoid it, for which the game penalized me 120 points. So my net profit for one of the biggest jumps and longest combos I pulled off in the game was -40 points. I don't know how it calculates those penalties, but that formula needs an overhaul before this game finishes its Early Access run.\nTokens are ridiculously hard to earn without microtransactions, but that much was predictable just from the fact that the game has microtransactions at all. Of course they're difficult to earn without paying, that's the whole point. But what bewilders me about the microtransactions is that the only things currently available in the store are a paltry handful of challenges and cosmetic bonuses, neither of which really seem enticing when the game already comes with six maps and a bunch of unlockables. Mind you, only one of the maps that comes with the base game (Sialia) is actually an open world for exploration and the rest are just challenge runs with one or two jumps in their entirety. It's not like I expected Skyrim for the asking price, but when the game sells itself as an open-world skiing experience I would like a change of scenery every now and again. I was never a fan of jump events even back when I was on a ski team in real life, and exploring giant mountains at high speed has always been my favorite part of the sport. It's not a deal-breaker, because Sialia is a pretty good map with a lot of places to explore, but I'd definitely like the game more if it had more open areas like that. Moreover, it wouldn't make the store itself feel completely vestigial.\nSo in short, it's a little bit buggy and a little bit of a cash grab, but I can't really begrudge it because the core experience is still rock-solid as far as skiing games go. Definitely feels like an Early Access title, but it's at least got me interested enough to hold out until the full release. Make of that what you will.","February 18","true","28.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

And the potential for SNOW is immense.\n\nWhile most winter sports games are about racing or chaining together ludicrous jumps, SNOW is a more level-headed approach focused on the actual riding. Not that it doesn't feature its own share of ridiculousness: Surviving a drop from 30 meters with both your legs intact is just another day at the office. And due to the game's open approach, it's up to the player whether he does alpine skiing or just ♥♥♥♥♥ around at the half-pipe.\n\nDespite the game being in a very early stage, it already captures the sense of freedom and speed more than adequately. It's a blast just shooting downhill and dodging obstacles or finding new routes during freeriding, all while relaxing electronica is playing in the background. SNOW treats winter sports with respect and transports much of the fascination to the player.\n\nIt's needless to say that there's not much content at the moment and the little there is still requires a lot of work. Right now, a purchase would be less about your own pleasure and more about supporting the devs.\n\nWith that being said, the core of SNOW is rock-solid, which is why I believe the game deserves support. Even in its current state, SNOW offers a glimpse of greatness and I wish the team the best of luck for this project.","January 3, 2015","true","2.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

Unfortunately, Poppermost Productions does not seem to be a company that's able to pull this feat off.\n\nSNOW, before the most recent update (~01/04/2016) was an unpleasant but playable game. The currently only option to go is skiing - which was fairly enjoyable (albeit fairly repetitive) on the game's large mountain range. You can respawn in a manner of unlockable locations or on other players on the server which works most of the time (but can be frustrating when someone respawns on you and you lose your bearings :/)\n\nAfter this update, the playability has gone and now it's a buggy mess. If you can make it into a multiplayer game without crashing and needing to restart your PC, you're faced with countless bugs - from falling through the world to being completely overwhelmed by truly horrific hit detection and scoring.\n\nThe game is unbelievebly unstable - both in the menus that overlap and cause the game to crash and the game's reluctancy to safely Alt+Tab in and out of the game. This can kind of be explained by its 'Early Access' disclaimer, but the game has been out since 2013. SNOW feels like a severely unfinished 'My First Game' that has overrun on its budget both on time and money - as, of course, there's a fully functional store where you can buy in-game licensed products such as skis, gloves, and jackets.\n\nTL;DR: SNOW could be a great game, but its seemingly random untested patches, poorly written features and quick gameplay burnout cycle are a fatal concoction that's destined to fail.","April 2","false","9.8"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","4"

Fitting music too. The mountain is HUGE! I instantly fell in love.\n\nYou gain experience from free roaming and doing events based on the tricks you do. The exp levels you up and unlocks stuff.\n\nThere are plenty of different events for you to do. Races, time trials, freestyle events, Speed runs, etc.\n\nThe amount of memorable moments I had in the first 20 minutes of playing.... it's insane... Crazy jumps off waterfalls and frozen riverbeds, off-piste manuvours that made me crash in hillarious ways, jumping off massive clifs and landing on houses, hotels. Oh man..\n\nMultiplayer is brilliant. You can spawn on any players instantly after dying, or at any of the usual spawn points. Plenty of fun moments like accidently crashing into each other at high speeds, mid air.\n\nIf this were a demo I would happily buy the game.\n\nIt's early access.

The visuals are nice to look at, the skiing with others can be fun, and the game-world will keep you busy for hours exploring.\n\nAs of writing this, the restrictions for this free-to-play is primarily cosmetic related, and nothing that stops you from playing really. The prices for cosmetic items aren’t unreasonable – maybe 10-15 pounds to outfit your entire outfit with whatever you want, sort of the price of a typical game. There is no pay-to-win items, as it’s simply cosmetics, and no consumables, so really once you’ve got your looks sorted, that’s likely all you’ll want to spend. Not that you really need to spend any money at all to simply play the game.\n\nSo if you want to go skiing, or maybe just want to see some snow, then SNOW delivers, with no cost involved at simply trying it for yourself.","April 24","true","23.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

With every minor update my FPS increases by 10-15, the UI (whilst still buggy) is now 'functional', and the graphical tweaks here and there have really made a difference - this game does genuinely look 'good', not spectacular, but a decent 'good' rating. The controls keep on being tweaked too; I can now compitently get down the Sialia course without having to respawn a billion times and even throw in some 'gnarly' tricks here and there. :D\n\nThat being said, the game still lacks motive. What am I supposed to be doing? You get to the bottom of each course and nothing happens. No leaderboard announcement, no objectives to meet - gravity pulls you to the bottom of the course... and that's pretty much it. There is an arbitary score counter, but it doesn't mean anything.\n\nI want the 'Closed Beta' to be big. I want a lot of people to come and play this game because it has impressed me, it's come a long way, and it deserves a bit of recognition. There's nothing else like this game on Steam.\n\nI REALLY WANT TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME, POPPERMOST; I HONESTLY, HONESTLY DO.\n\n....but I can't - £10.99 for this game is crazy. I picked it up two years ago when it was in early Alpha for about £3 (because why not?) £10.99 for Early Access to an F2P game is insane, especially when all you get is some exclusive clothes. If people are playing this game because all they want to do is play 'dress up' with a wireframe, then good for them, but it's getting to the stage where I'd like to see more in the form of 'an actual game' from SNOW and I hope the Beta will show me this.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*UPDATE 25/09/14* The 'M4' patch for this game makes it playable (lol). It's still got a long way to go, mind you. The big addition in this patch is 'sound'. Fitting drum & bass beats over the crisp sloshing and scraping of snow; it's damn good, actually.\n\nThe new map they added is completely unoptimised, so I got a steady FPS of 4 out of it, but this is an alpha, so it's to be expected.\n\nThe no. 1 addition for me in this patch is that it proves that there is progression in this game. I'm not readly to 'recommend' it just yet - it is still alpha, but I am hopefull for the next patch. Let's just hope it doesn't take another 10 months.\n\n*UPDATE 14/09/14* This game is still completely unplayable. The commands work half of the time, the procedually generated map is not 'procedually generated'; it's just completely random. There is still no sound in it (as in, the game is completely silent - even the UI), and the UI is buggy as hell.\n\n*ORIGINAL REVIEW*\n\n'Currently in development' is a complete understatement. This game is the reason why the 'Early Access' scheme should have some kind've assurance that the game is even playable.\n\nThis game is not playable.\n\nCome back in a year's time, don't waste your money.","December 29, 2013","false","2.2"," 61 of 111 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","61","111","0","11"

Played it for more that 100 hours. But they slowed down production and for a while it seemed the project was dead, so I stopped playing. A while later I went on youtube and saw that it was all over my front page and I was super excited because I thought they came out of beta and added all they promised! But the reason it was on the front page was because they completely broken the game and all of its physics (or lack there of). I was dissapointed but still had some fun with my friends. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OSEQj2VqdQ&ab_channel=XenoBurger\nJust today I got a message from steam saying that they finally added snowboarding, the one thing that I wanted from this game, but seemed like an unachievable goal.

The controls were very weird and janky and the menus were glitchy.\nAfter hearing it is going into closed beta, I checked it out again as I was already in the closed beta.\n\nIt got better... I guess... but it still didn't deserve $30. The graphics look pretty nice, and the moutains/courses look fun as hell. If only I could play them... Just kidding, you can play them.

The controls in the closed beta weren't any different to the alpha, which is a dissapointment.\n\nI think the only improvements that should be made which will make the game 1000x better are:\n\n-Better controls\n-More tricks\n-Feel faster (going down a hill feels slow as ♥♥♥♥)\n-Easier to navigate menus (It's hard as jeopardy)\n-and free, exclusive dlc to those who actually BOUGHT this soon to be free-to-play game.\n\n(That last one may be asking too much)\n\nTo Poppermost, fix your game.

Although the concept is awesome, and I'm really excited to play this when it's finished however - this is not a playable game just yet. Lots of bugs, lots of errors, lots of crashes.\n\nBide your time for a little longer and buy this when it becomes 100% ready to play. I see great things for this game in the future, but no, not right now.\n\n********\nUPDATE: 1 YEAR LATER (April 2015)\n\nI bit the bullet and tried playing this game again, and I must say it has improved massively since a year ago as I actually managed to ski down a slope. Some progress at last! However, it still lacks a certain oooomph. You have to pay for extras, which is absolutely ludicrous. I feel like they could have done a lot more to the game in the whole year that I have been waiting to play again. In my opinion, it's STILL not ready to be released as a full game, as it just feels unfinished to me.

That is, once you actually figure it out. The controls on the menu doesn't work for me, so I had to look them up online. WHAT GAME DOES THAT?! The game is still very buggy, with the constant skis fading through snow and your character flying after crashing(which I think is cool). Not to mention the issue where full screen will constantly mess with you if you go back to desktop, or the field of view doing the same thing between drop points. I don't care about the micro transactions. If you actually play the game for that long where you want to buy them, you may need to reconsider your life, but hey, that's all you. I personally enjoy the game for the bugs it has, as it makes the game a little enjoyable, and I love skiing and stuff, so I find this game cool. Not to mention the soundtrack, which pulls the player into the game to a great extent. However, I feel that you take too long to speed up and stuff like that. I want to be at breakfast speeds, pulling off huge, gigantic combos, not rapidly crashing, breaking my combo, which should be fixed, as many angles which look natural and ready to fly off of don't work. There also should be more mountains. I like the idea of one, huge, custom mountain, but the other tracks also need some love. I am amazed by this game, but for the average gamer, I do NOT RECCOMEND this title.\nEDIT: A major update has occured, making the game run smoother (at least for me) and added 2 new mountains. This brings up a few more issues I have with the game, or at least these areas. These areas are way too bland. There is no character or style to these new "mountains". It looks like a white floor with mountainy walls. Unlike the big, hulking mountain, which is named whatever, that one has all of these areas that at least feel a little bit special. I actually feel like I'm on a mountain. Another big issue, or suggestion I have is to add snowboards to the game. This would basically just be a cosmetic change, but it would make sense since the game is called SNOW and not SKI. Still wouldn't reccomend.","March 21, 2015","false","6.1"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","3"

The comments since the update have strongly put me off playing the game again.\n\nIt's a shame that this is advertised as a Free-to-Play with customization, because by the looks of it, all the customization is paid now. I probably won't be playing this again unless I see a change in optimism from people who have played the game more recently.\n\nThe game, not being released to the public for free yet, still has time to change. My advice to the devs would be to listen to the feedback being posted here, and my advice to the players would eb to make sure the devs hear your voice, because this will be vital to both your experience playing, and the developers success.","March 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","17","30","0","0"

The mechanics and the tricks feel decently saticfying, and the secondary focus on exploration gives an interesting side objective, because the locale for SNOW is actually quite pretty.\n\nThough, it's pretty open-ended, and there isn't much you can do at the time besides explore the mountain and practice new tricks, which has kept me interested thus far.\n\nBut on the other hand, There is an inane number of glitches, from being frozen in air on spawn, sometimes falling through the map, and, most notably, those friggin` ragdolls, are probably what earned this game a mixed review.\n\nI understand that the devs are trying to work around the core aspects of the game mechanics before improving the look of the game, and that's understandable.\n\nGive this game a shot, I think it has some potential, but it was released a little early for its own good.","January 1","true","47.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Like pushing up on the analog intending to do a frontflip results in a backflip which is confusing, and should be addressed. There aren't any rail sounds either with the snowboard. Both skiing and snowboarding have issues with uncontrollable choppiness when somehow "stuck" moving through the ground (hard to explain but you know what I'm talking about). Can't believe the snowmobile wasn't provided for free to those of us who actually paid for the game before it was made free to play. Other then that its a great game with lots of different terrain and the graphics are great.\n\nOh yeah, and adding support for Oculus Rift CV1 and Vive would be amazing.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that I am limited to placing 2 drop points and this is extremely frustrating since you can't select which one to override with a new drop point, as it will always override the older one. We should have unlimited number of drop points, as well as the option to select and delete them.

I originally bought it in the early alpha stage, and their were many problems. The game was somewhat unplayable at times. Menus were terrible and hard to navigate, and their was only one mountain. Their was also no clear indecation how to play the game. The controls are slightly strange so if it wasn't for some steam guides i would have no idea what I was doing. That all changed when the beta came out. The menus are beutiful and easy to navigate, and the game is way more playable. Their is just one problem, the inclusion of micro-transactions. In the Alpha all the asthetic gear was free, now you have to buy them. I understand that they are aming for this to be a f2p game, but they should of added the micro-transactions when the full game was released. They didn't even give the people who payed the $10 price tag any credits to buy gear. That aside, this game is VERY FUN. Their is nothing like jumping off a giant cliff doing a 360 truck driver and crashing head first into the beautiful world. The visuals are amazing, so if you can get over the minor flaws, pick this game up now.","April 5, 2015","true","6.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Its gameplay has always been very good and I have had a lot of fun over the years. But the fact that items (mostly skies and jackets) are so expensive made me a little disapointed.\n\nI think that the event system could be further exploited by adding prises for getting a medal. For example, if you put the prices of the skies and other items up to a realistic price(mabey their actual retail price) you could give a few bucks for each medal earned. That way there would be a chance to obtain items whitout buying credits by being a good player and not just a rich dude. This would probably solve a bit of the crisis you have on your hands.\n\nAlso, i think that the level system you were talking about is interesting you should mabey ask the community for their favorite items and put those ones in the level system.","March 14, 2015","true","76.7"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

Just running it feels like I'm using the slowest, jerkiest FPS ever invented. Nevermind getting actual gameplay accomplished, I simply can't get to it regardless of how low I place quality settings threshholds. Admittedly I *do* use a non-gaming dedicated system, but I *can* play a ton of games with even huger processing demands than this thing with no issues whatsoever. Mind you, all of these performance issues were forgivable given that I did buy in with the knowledge it was a work in progress, and I even touted that as such to friends who normally steer clear of anything that could even remotely sports-related. However, what put me off completely was that it's obviously a failing project and becoming nothing more than an overrated skiing version of Farmville with cr(app)y in-game purchases. No thanks, guys. I don't care if you are indie developers, if you can't make a decent game I'm going with a big cash-cow company that can. Heck, I'd rather play Kim Kardashian's game, at least it works and is up-front about wanting your money for nothing.","March 20, 2015","false","0.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","13","23","2","0"

The game we've all been waiting for, for a long time. I have always wondered as to why there haven't been too many "realistic" (or even close to it) skiing/snowboarding games. It has always been some sort of jumping over mountains doing sextuple backflips. Why? I don't know. I first heard about this lovely game from a friend, when I was asking him that very same question. He pointed me towards this, I watched a couple of videos and then fell in love.\n\nThis game is just perfect. It has a huge variety of tricks you can do, a huge variety of rails you can hit and just  a huge map to shred! I love the first person mode (especially with changing the FOV to 110) while riding. Riding through the woods at a massive speed is really exhilarating. The game plays really well. The tricks look cool, the park is smooth and... awesome and the epicness and softness of freeriding is exquisite. I have played the game for almost 50 hours now, and I keep on finding new places to ride and love. The level of customization is pretty neat too (even though there are no khaki pants whatsoever).\n\nBut even though the game has all that, my favorite part is the devs. I have contacted the team numerous times through twitter and they have always been super fast and helpful with their awnsers. Just the other day, I suggested that they add movable lights to the game (for street spots and such), and their awnser was "That's a great idea! We'll make sure to include that". I also remember asking them on a livestream of the game in a super early version about building kickers and stuff, and they said that they are already working on it. All this from a super small team from Stockholm!\n\n8,5/10 (Because no khakis)\n\n*Note* I'm a snowboarder waiting for snowboards to be implemented. The review was based on skis. Probably would've forgiven the khaki issue if the snowboards would be in it already.\n\nGreat job guys, we all love you\n-Haze\n\n\n*Edit 9.03.2015*\n\nAs a un-biased reviewer, I have to mention the fiasco that is S-Games. The devs told me on twitter that the map would be released at the end of January. Now that it is early March and there is still no sign of it, I am a bit disappointed and sad about it. I was also super excited to try out the open beta on the 10th of March, but just noticed that it is only available for Tester and Founder pack owners. I totally understand why they are doing this, but when they first released it, I understood that it would've been released for all of us - and so did many others.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still think it's an amazing game, and you should totally get it, but I had to bring these issues up. Let's hope S Games comes with the open beta (god knows when that will be).","February 1, 2015","true","76.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It was a promising early release, but this most recent update has ruined my hope for this game. I paid 15.99 for this game when I originally purchased it. Back then, all customization was free and a fun aspect of the game. Now the customization is riddled with micro transactions and I'm being told that the game I paid $16 for is soon to be released for free (and is also cheaper now then when I purchased it).\n\nAll in all it truly is a great game with a TON of potential. But the developers going money hungry is causing a turn for the worst, and I am no longer optimistic of the future of this game.

It is a freeroaming game all about skiing. You can tricks jump half way down mountains. you can do relaxeing skiing down smooth slopes, or do some hardcore skiing down extreme, rocky grades. The game works very smoothly, the players movements arn't jerky, it actually looks like how a real skiier would look. hopefully in the future players will be able to create there own maps for this. If I were to compare this game to any other, it would be like Skate 3, but skiing.

As you might suspect clothing and equipment is hard to comeby, and you can obtain alot by paying for geting ingame credits, should you do that? Well thats up to you.\n\nYou can obtain exacly 625 credits after reaching max level (which is lv.60)\nIf you're patient enough, you can spend few hours doing spins on ice jumping in place like derp, and you can hit lv 40-45 easely later on its harder obviously, but i think lv.60 requires around 400-500k points total. But if you want buy some clothes, well thats one way to do it fastest f2p way. (for some reason achivment for reaching lv60 didint kick in on my steam profile yet, hope it will later.)\n\nThe controls can be bit wonky, and tutorial where you need to do advenced grab 720* spin is pain, found my friends have huge problem with that part, i did it just becouse i was lucky after many tries, so i suggest skip tutorial and check controls to learn keys.\n\nDidint had anny issues playing game in single player mode, however it has to be said that multiplayer got own problems.\nWe tried with friends get to same server, and with limit to 12 ppl per server it can take while. And if we finaly menage to get into same server, we all get crashes at same time at some point after playing 20-30 min, so i assume the problem is with servers itself.  I think easy solution for that might be to be able host own private sessions, and i hope developers add such option in future.\n\nWe had good laughts after dying on spot, litelary dying and turning into gravestone and as fun as it is - its still glitchy to die on spot like that upon touching a stone gentle, or each other, definitly being able going through each other might be nice idea, also having ragdoll (Becouse in SP ragdoll works) would be more convinient, i hope this be changed in future too and its just temporary solution.\n\nBeside multiplayer crashes - for me - game works fine, friends also said its well optimized so might run on slower computers. It needs work, and i hope developers will work on it becouse potential for fun multiplayer game is there.","February 1","true","8.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The concept is smart, but it has been poorly executed with numerous technical glitches, difficult control scheme, and little overall gameplay guidence. Yes, I understand that it is a skiing game that doesent need a lot of guidence other than go down a mountain, but the lack thereof gives the game a very, VERY empty feeling. I am asking for a refund for this game, but since I got it over the 2 week limit (which I find a very discriminitory rule, especially for games that were gotten before the refund policy was enacted) its iffy. At this point, I find very little interest in the game, and hope that the game picks up and that I be proven wrong in future.","May 27","false","1.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","3"

To start with the least annoying aspect of the game; there's no way to look at the controls. I realise this is early access, and I accept that, but it doesn't tell you what they are in the tutorial apart from "w to move forward". Really needs to either have a completed tutorial or an option to view the controls. Then we can move onto the complete lack of ingame music, and because of that, a buzzing sound is in its place. There are plenty more problems, including paying EXTRA to play with friends, and the achievement for finding Nouk not actually granting the achievement.

If you do not have an audio set up (ie. speakers or headphones), dont expect to run this game as it will crash when attempting to start it up. When navigating the menu, you will also find that clicking on certain options will crash your game aswell.\n\nJust as you think this game couldn't get any more awful as it progresses through its beta stage, you're way ♥♥♥♥ing wrong. This games optimization when it was first released on steam was prestine. First time I went to start it up, I could run on my settings maxed with a solid 60 frames; now, with an even better rig, this game stutters and hiccups every time I attempt to play and enjoy a 30 minute session.\n\nFor now, please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME.

A f2p mmo snow-sports game. My main interest was its odd combination of the genres along with a curiosity for how the f2p model would look. Obviously there would be cosmetics, but will there be passes to ski down certain mountains and enter tournaments? Most likely.\n\nIn its current state it feels very "in-developement" in lack of ways to describe it, which can make it feel empty at times, but I check in every now and then and its a slow but steady process of improvements.

Less said the better maybe. The idea behind the game, and the promise is there. However, this game is also a very good example of what's wrong with the gaming industry these days, and also how Early Access games can be so wrong.\n\nFirst of all, the whole notion of paying to test a game, is a weird one. Then paying to be able to test a future Free 2 Play game seems a bit out of order. People buying into this for 55 EUR, do need to love the game, to defend the use of money.\n\nSo, what about the actual game then, it does not have any sounds, what so ever, not placeholdersounds, not any background music, not a thing. There is a big lack of options, and while they might not want you to rebind the keys at the current moment, you should be able to look at the controls, to at least know what to click.\nThere is a tutorial in the game, that is somewhat small, and it does contain spelling mistakes - makes the game look unserious. But you won't be able to know everything to do by the tutorial.\nThere are no visual effects in the game, in the way of snow being kicked up, or traces of skis - the same skis that you find to be just as often under the snow, as up on the snow.\nThe game also have random errors, sometimes things work, sometimes they don't. This goes for the tutorial, the cabin, graphics settings.\n\nAll things are stuff that can be added before the release. However, there has not been an update in 2.5 months, and it seems more and more like a distant dream to see this game in it's full pride.\n\nThere is so much promise behind the idea - but there is no guarantee that anything will work out.\n\nEDIT: As it turns out (by the dev.response here), it does get updated more often - it just doesn't show on the store page or on the community page (high up), so you would need to check the discussions to find it.\nHowever, I will still say that this is a good example on why Early Access games are a bad thing. And that if you really want the game, wait for it to be F2P. It's not worth the price for it, at current time - sadly.\n\n-Myrvold","January 4, 2014","false","3.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","5"

My reason? Because SNOW markets itself as a ski MMO; the multiplayer was basically my main source of intrigue.\n\nUpon reading through the descriptions of different purchasable (packs before paying my £5.99), there was no material to suggest multiplayer wouldn't be available in the cheapest possible purchase. Imagine my disgust when the multiplayer option in-game demands more money in order to become available. What's more, there is no obvious forum where I could (if I had no self respect) through more money at SNOW to acquire multiplayer. Having quitted the game frustrated and confused, I notice that at the bottom of this page, under the "Planned Features" sub-heading, the developpers have placed 'multiplayer'; if this is their disclaimer that we are indeed paying money for a feature that isn't yet in game, then they need to do a bloody better job of getting the message across. Something like 'multiplayer not yet available' would be GREAT up at the top right where they promise us that SNOW is "alone or with friends".\n\nAnother disappointment was the promise of in-game challenges, both in multiplayer AND single-player. In fact, "Solo events and Challenges" is under the "Key Features" sub-heading, showing that it should be available already. So where are they? What challenges have been set? Even after a 1.5 hour sitting I found myself still floating around with no direction as the game doesn't appear to offer anything in-game or in the menu other than an "exclusive event" - which also demands more money.\n\nFinally, to top off my own personal experience: in the character customisation it appears to be impossible to see the player's head, which makes headgear and goggles impossible to customise, and other than the (god-awful-doesn't-even-deserve-the-name) tutorial, the only map available seems to be Sialia. Thinking this is a personal (inexplicable?) problem as other disappointed reviewers still seem to be able to get 3 maps...\n\nAll in all, SNOW had a great concept which I loved enough to dismiss the bad reviews, hoping that its coolness (*cough* MULTIPLAYER) would pay off for the lack of sound, or bad gameplay. What I didn't expect was to invest in a product which failed to deliver on aspects it Had promised, and leave me feeling cheated out of aspects it Appeared to have promised. Maybe it was down to bad marketing on Steam, but either way this "game" is not worth its selling price in its current state. Once they've fixed key issues, installed multiplayer, improved customisation (hey maybe even throw in a female skier/boarder?) then maybe it could be worth thinking about parting with £8.99. Right now, I'm frankly disgusted that I spent £5.99 on SNOW.","December 28, 2013","false","2.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

But anyway let's get on with it.\n\n-Does it play good ?SNOW is pretty much just an open world skiing simulator and just like skiing it takes a while to get into but when you do it is truly fun to just ski around exploring all of the map and finding little marks around it and an ocasional skiing pal.\n\n-Does it look good ?Yes SNOW looks amazing. It does an amazing job at using the cryengine to it's fullest. The game looks amazing and it runs incredible smoothly at it's maximum settings.\n\n-Does it sound good ?SNOW's sound track asside from the typical SFX is highly reliant on having you listen to several tracks while you play. I myself found the mix pretty decent and fitting to the action although I could clearly see this coming to personal taste.\n\n-What's the problem with it then ?There are no real problems technicly asside from the ocasional T pose ragdoll or slight collision bugs but these are really rare and tolerable I guess since it is a beta. The problem comes in the game's F2P system. It's a pure F2P system meaning you get all the game has to offer without having to pay anything (like dota2) wich means it's reliant on selling it's cosmetics and advertisement. This will really make or break the lifetime of this game and was my prime reason to write this review seeing as I would like to see this game go far and suceed.\n\n-Final Note and Score.SNOW is a game that should be experienced and I really recomend giving it a try when it's out. I'm sure the current issues will be sorted out with time and maybe some more things will get added to it like dismounting your skis so I can have incredible long snow walks or go uphill.\nSnow gets a solid 7/10.\nIt's good but it's only catering to a specific crowd so keep that in mid.","April 22, 2015","true","0.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I did see a developer say that this would be fixed today when responding to someone else with this problem so I'm more than happy to try again later or tomorrow.\n\n(THIS IS NOW FIXED) I also can't complete the skiing tutorial, when you complete the 720 attempt and complete that section the game puts you at the beginning of the 720 tutorial again even though you did it and the game registered it with the green tick.\n\nAfter playing a little while longer it seems there are some problems with controller support. Controls will just stop working completely if I crash into something and then I can't exit unless I use the keyboard (also can't exit from the main menu with the controller, have to use the keyboard). Pausing the game while playing with the controller also doesn't work as the Pause screen strangely swipes from right to left on the screen with the assigned button so you have to use the keyboard ESC key to actually get the Pause screen. If I get to a point that I can end the session properly (default hold Y on the controller) the game will then stay on the "waiting for server" screen forever and then you have to alt-tab out of the game and close it manually. The "Exit To Desktop" option also causes the game to crash.\n\nChanging the time of day doesn't work either, hitting Right on the D pad causes the time of day to continually loop extremely quickly. It would be really nice if the time of day could be selected from the settings menu!\n\nMenus are very messy while in game, sometimes the pause screen randomly overlays while you're playing or doesn't appear when you want it to, and will overlay when you restart from a checkpoint - while your controls still function with the controller you have to hit ESC on the keyboard to remove the Pause Game overlay. The replay function is also very twitchy and often doesn't respond to commands at all.\n\nWhen the controls do work they seem sluggish and a bit clunky with the snowboarder. Over-rotation is a huge problem and there seems to be little you can do about it (if realism is the aim here then that's fine). It's also incredibly difficult to get any speed up unless you start on the edge of a cliff. Controls with the skier seem much more polished. (I did notice that snowboarding was a very recent addition so that would make sense).\n\nGrinding/sliding rails etc needs a lot of work, the "jump at the rail, turn and hope" approach is a bit messy, your rider/skiier's legs just stay straight the whole and in replays it doesn't look like they're sliding anything, just that the rail happens to be there while the rider is going through the air. I hope this is something that the devs are working on.\n\nIf there were some text/image/video-based tutorials in the menu of the home screen that would be fantastic because the play-through tutorials aren't all that thorough at the moment.\n\nso far it's a bit more frustrating than anything else. The snowboarding aspect of the game needs a lot more work, skiing is much more polished and a lot more fun so far.","May 25","false","24.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","3"

Since the patches, SNOW feels like a brand new game almost. Most of the buggy stuff has been resolved, and it feels very smooth and runs very well. The difficulty has increased now; when you move the game eases you in and out of the movements a bit more, just barely (probably more realistic to actual skiing), and most of the time when you hit rocks it will almost always knock you off, like it should. Although, on some of the rocks, it would be nice to land on top of them and not get knocked off, that seems a bit unrealistic and it ruined a few nice places to land jumps, imo.\n\nOverall, SNOW is amazing and it's cool it will be free, I don't think the whole pay for skiing accessories thing will be that big of a deal.","October 1, 2014","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It entered a market that's pretty much been dominated by EA, but was able to develope a game that's more enjoyable. The character customization is some of the best I've seen in a sports simulator. I believe the game will really take off once it begins the multiplayer addition. It's very clean cut and not overcrowded by XP, etc. Currently, the game is playable but just basically the overall structure. I'd say it's worth following it up as it's developed.\n\nAlso, here is a quick first look video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biaQ8_avbIw\n","May 15, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would mention 3840x2160 but the only 4k HDTV I have can't run 60hz.\n\nSeriously this like Eurotruck is one of those games you spend 20 minutes looking around at the start.

No sound but it hardly subtracts from the fun you can have by skiing down mountains on and off piste. There are plenty of spawn points to choose from depending on what you feel like doing.You can just take a relaxing ski, perform tricks or just go super fast to then perform a huge air at the end.

What you get is a Free to Play open world Skiing game with abilities to customize your character and eventually you'll be able to build snow jumps on the side of a mountain!

The UI, models, and mountain itself with all its parts are gorgeous even on the lowest settings, which still beat up my GPU/CPU - no complaints as I'm using some older gear. There's a radio-style soundtrack that plays some great stuff that I want to get in my library - sorta electronica styled, I heard some vocal tracks, too. Reminds me of Chairlift or Bloc Party. The swoosh of skis and - though I haven't grinded rails or pulled off crazy jumps - the grinds sound real and constant enough to immersify me.\nAs a cross-country and downhill skiier of 8 years, the game targets my demographic of speed-seekers - but I can see the appeal to anyone who likes an open world where you can choose your fun. Meditatively ski from point A to B, gazing across the valley - or shred hard and fast off-piste taking opportune upward slopes to show off your aerial skills. I'm eager to virtually ski again, eager to get better gear to play full-screen on high graphics, eager to see every patch of SNOW there is to be seen.","February 8","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Painfully simplistic and in general, lacking. I'm reminded of early 2000's era mmo characters or FPS games of the same early time period. Further the number of Schumacher moments your rag doll character will have when it falls or crashes are more than a little comical. To the point of almost being embarrasing.\n\nThe above said, I fully suggest the game be tried and played around with. It's such a wonderful, easy to experience, touristic environment that the frailties of the characters can be ignored.","February 14","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Saying that, I still do have concerns with this game.\n\nPros:- Very large open world to explore with multiple mountains and drop points.\n- Clean UI and a fantastic soundtrack.\n- Hidden secrets and locations to come across (caves, castles, etc).\n- The graphics are great, not mindblowing, but it certainly looks "next gen".\n- Atmospheric. I can imagine this being very immersive with VR...\n- Simple controls and fun gameplay.\n\nCons:- The biggest concern for me is that from what I know, there is no way to get credits without buying them with real money. Especially since the developers boast a high level of customisation and character creation. Paying $15 for a new set of pants and a jacket simply isn't worth it, and if they look at games such as Payday 2 and Killing Floor 2, they will see that expensive microtransactions can drive a supportive fanbase away.\n- At the time of writing this, there are a lot of bugs. I have had the game crash on my multiple times during my time playing.\n- Multiplayer isn't great. It's not bad, but needs improvement.\n- Grinding doesn't work very well.\n\nA few reccomendations - Add an additional way to get credits.\n- Needs more animations. Not my biggest issue, but a lot of other people feel the need for it too. Take a leaf out of SSX's book.\n- Being able to interact with the world around you would be great. Taking a ride on the lifts, meeting your friends in a cabin etc.\n\nTL;DR - Is this game fun? Definately. Is it worth paying $10 for? No.","January 20","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFazzaMan/recommended/244930/","TheFazzaMan","Fazza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFazzaMan/","340 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRecently got this game for $1 through ♥♥♥ and honestly I didn't have very high expectations, but after only 2+ hours I have been suprised at the level of detail in the environment and the amount of effort the developers have put in to SNOW. Saying that, I still do have concerns with this game.\n\nPros:- Very large open world to explore with multiple mountains and drop points.\n- Clean UI and a fantastic soundtrack.\n- Hidden secrets and locations to come across (caves, castles, etc).\n- The graphics are great, not mindblowing, but it certainly looks "next gen".\n- Atmospheric. I can imagine this being very immersive with VR...\n- Simple controls and fun gameplay.\n\nCons:- The biggest concern for me is that from what I know, there is no way to get credits without buying them with real money. Especially since the developers boast a high level of customisation and character creation. Paying $15 for a new set of pants and a jacket simply isn't worth it, and if they look at games such as Payday 2 and Killing Floor 2, they will see that expensive microtransactions can drive a supportive fanbase away.\n- At the time of writing this, there are a lot of bugs. I have had the game crash on my multiple times during my time playing.\n- Multiplayer isn't great. It's not bad, but needs improvement.\n- Grinding doesn't work very well.\n\nA few reccomendations - Add an additional way to get credits.\n- Needs more animations. Not my biggest issue, but a lot of other people feel the need for it too. Take a leaf out of SSX's book.\n- Being able to interact with the world around you would be great. Taking a ride on the lifts, meeting your friends in a cabin etc.\n\nTL;DR - Is this game fun? Definately. Is it worth paying $10 for? No.","January 20","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And the fact that it's free to play is why I can forgive so many things.\n\nGood:\n+ open world\n+ ways to get to the summit or top of a track instantly\n+ bunch of gear to stand out from the others\n+ snowboards included\n+ a myriad of tricks and flips to do\n+ changing time of day\n+ replay/rewind available\n+ first person where you can see your body and the board\n\nMeh:\n~ no grind sounds for snowboard yet\n~ no weather effects\n~ servers sometimes have higher ping, but multiplayer is otherwise functional and enjoyable\n~ launching the game connects it to the servers, what if your internet goes down?\n\nBad:\n- when you tap W w/ a snowboard in first person, the camera looks down to the lower left, it's disorienting\n- sometimes the game freezes and unfreezes, sometimes you have to close the process because it will not unfreeze, this makes you lose all the points that weren't saved (End Session), which is frustrating because it's more satisfying to go on big score runs and then end the session before you stop playing, rather than every time you pass a tickets booth just so you don't lose any points\n\n\nGreat game, would recommend, and if they update it more it will get even better.

The game also plays alot better with a controller, even though you can have tons of fun just playing on the keyboard. My only major gripe is the many crashed that can occur, making you lose your points, atleast in the multiplayer part of the game.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty good for a f2p and the landscape is simply amazing, from castles, to huge statues, to plain ski resorts and even a sunken village! The animation isnt the best out there, but for what it is, it's entirely acceptable. There is also a library of copyright free music that is quite relaxing, and you can modify your clothing to resemble popular skiers or snowboarders, such as Candide Thovex.\n\n\nOverall, this game is certainly worth a try, especially considering its free.

However, my first impression is that the core game mechanic of simulating skiing is AWESOME! I have skiied a ton in real life and this feels super authentic. It is extremely exhilerating to zip past trees and take huge jumps. The tricks are really intuitive, you will figure them out just by playing around. The feeling of speed is quite visceral, especially given the fact that there is....\n\nNO SOUND! Surprise! As of now, the game has absolutely no sound, so you will have to make whooshing sounds yourself for now.\n\nAnyway, at this stage I'd say SNOW has a ton of potential. Ran well on my machine with minimal slowdown, and no crashes so far. If you are an avid skier this game is probably for you.

Cryengine does this game well. FPS drops occur occasionally, but overall it's not an issue.\n\nGameplay is meh. The one playable mountain as of right now looks nice, bit its hard to get down the different trails to explore the mountain more. Controls are very loose, making it hard to get where you want to be, be it jumping onto a rail or just going down a trail. Tricks are pretty basic, with some grabs and spins. Multiplayer and 'events' are being added later, and (hopefully) some of the falling through the map will stop.\n\nCustomizations is pretty good. There are a lot of options to customize your skiier, from hats and gloves to bindings and poles. You can sort by category of equipment or by brand, and a lot of major skiing companies have their equipment represented in the game.\n\nVerdict: Wait it out. If you want to support the devs, go right ahead. Just be warned that 1) This game is going to be free-to-play on release, and 2) This game is playable, but not for very long. The gameplay is fun as a time waster, but IMO not for its current pricetag","November 16, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I started playing this game because a friend of me told me it was a really fun game. After I spent over an hour to complete the tutorial (I know I suck) I started playing online with my friend.\n\nFirst of all I need to see that the map is very very very big. It has some really nice views. When you are just a beginner you start playing on courses on the buttom of the mountains. When you gain enough XP you are able to select a different drop point. If you do have enough XP you can start completly at the top.\n\nEventhough I sucked at the tutorial I did manage to stay alive for quitte a while on the server. The amount of people is limited to 12 (Not that much for such a big map) but everyone who playes it is really nice. I asked some really noob questions and the answered me like it was normal. After a few more hours playing with my friend I started to be good at it. I even managed to stay alive even longer than him :D. Skiing is not that hard anymore when you play for a little while on a server or offline.\nIf you do manage to stay alive you can do tricks and all kinds of cool stuff. Even though the game is early access it does not have mayor bugs. My experience was just a little glitch were I could get out of the map, nothing more.\n\nI really do recommend this game not only for skiing but also for the nice gameplay online. People get curious if you join a server and before you know you are surrounded by other people. Really nice :)\n\nAnd before I forget I heard they were busy with adding snowboarding as well :D","February 24","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I knew anything the community would find and panic over was fixed in major bug fixes, which has currently reached M4.

I had a lot of fun figuring out how to do tricks on the infinity pipe, which was a lot of fun, and it made me think how much better this game will be with a fully completed map and snowboards, and more options to customize your character.

I have played this game on and off for about more than a year. The environment design is nice, the character design is nice as well. The controls on an Xbox 360 controller are fluid and responsive. When I started playing this game, there was no sound at all. The music and sound effects that have been added are well done. There's a persistent leveling system; I think it's used for unlocking cosmetic items and extra spawn points on the main mountain, Sialia. It's a nice open world game with plenty of opportunity for exploration. The physics are not perfect. Sometimes I stumble on a tiny bump and break my face, and sometimes I fly off a cliff doing a ridiculous stunt and land on top of somebody's vehicle and somehow get points for a perfect landing. Multiplayer was recently added, but I have not tried it yet. Good, fun game. A nice ski sim...Just what I was expecting when I bought it. It's a nice change of pace from shooting dinosaurs. The development team is responsive and continuing to put out patches and work is coming along nicely toward the version 1.0 release.","December 14, 2015","true","18.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's still got many bugs, but as a free to play early access that only to be expected. There's a huge variety of maps, and the controls are relatively easy to get the hang of.\n\nHowever, the new update has caused my character to die whenever i get dropped off, meaning only snowboarding works as an option, which is very frustrating as skiing feels more fluid at the moment. Also, the charcter model has completely disappeared (if intentional this really detracts from the game), so my skier has is merely a floating hat and gloves, with no body.\n\nWould I recommend? Yes. its free, so why not? There are many bugs and it's certainly still in early stages, but there is huge potential here, and a finished product could be outstanding.","May 24","true","16.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I have had this game for about 1 year now and i've enjoyed every minute of it. There are so many great things about this game, for example the music is awesome and I love listening to it, the graphics are amazing for an early access game in my opinion and the main mountain is huge and there is so much to explore. I hope they add multiplayer really soon because a few of my friends have this game and im dying to play with them.\n\nThe only cons of this game that i found were that now you have to pay real money to customize your character (unlike the good old days where everything was free) and the fact that the game is still buggy (but dont let this discourage you from buying the game because its still early access and its expected).\n\nOverall, at the moment I think this game is worth buying because the bugs make it hilarious and its so open world and nice to look at that even just going down a mountain casually is loads of fun. Dont think that this game is a waste of money because its buggy since it is in early access and thats expected (like i said before). If you arent sure about buying this game then i think you should wait for them to add more things (like multiplayer) and fix the mechanics or just wait for the game to officially release and become free to play.","June 13, 2015","true","24.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I also tested some of the boundaries, and I was impressed that there are a plethora of ways to go down the mountain in every location.\n\nBrilliant game and I look forward to its future.","June 12, 2015","true","11.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

From being something where I was like ' This might be cool' to now, where I'm like 'This is so freaking cool'. I don't think words can do this game justice. As a snowboarder I am in love with mountains and the aspect of being able to ride across it, sadly I can't snowboard all the time. This game more/less makes up for that. With amazing graphics and beautiful sounds the team behind this has created what can only be described as a masterpeice.\n\n2014 :This is a real snowboarding/skiing free-roam game, worthy of the title SNOW. Graphically stunning visuals make it a must play. SNOW in my opinion is up there with 1080 degrees, for the environment that is there and the amount of customisation. The developers are also very public - anwsering questions and relaying news on the latest update.\n\nSNOW is shaping up to be a real 'must have' for skiiers or snowboarders. When the work has finally finished it will have the biggest mountain ever created to ski/board on, multiplayer, events, ski lifts, custom spawn points, replay system, halfpipe, trick parks, collectibles, and those are just the confirmed bits. All of it can be viewed here: http://snowthegame.com/2013/10/21/early-access-feedback/\n\nI really think this is worth getting - I've spent 78 hours ingame up to the 19th of May 2014, this is most likely going to increase by a long way over the upcoming years.\n\n10/10","October 10, 2013","true","123.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

However, this is a very disappointing game, even for one in Alpha.\n\nThe controls are sh*te. It is near impossible to get any sense of speed. However that is a good thing, as when you do finally get some speed up, I dare you to keep it that way for more than a few seconds.\n\nThere is no sound, and barely any visuals settings, even though they are the only options you can tweak at the minute. Even if there were any visuals options, they wouldn't change jack-sh*t, as the game is fairly... Ugly. It can look very nice, with some beautifully rendered trees and rocks, however the snow and the surroundings (Mostly snow) look horrendous.\n\nIt astonishes me that something this poorly put together is on Steam. This is not an Alpha, this is someone barely putting together an engine for a game and releasing it.

It's early access, so you know what to expect.\n\nSecond, this is going to be a F2P game, and although many people argue that paying now for a F2P game is not smart, I have to disagree there. With buying, you're making sure that it doesn't need to be milked out as much as Pay2Win games. And, developers need to eat as well.\n\nHaving said that, the game is actually quite enjoyable. I loved the first person camera mode, and I can only imagine how great it'll be when I buy an Oculus Rift (Which it supports).\nIn this state, all you can do is set up your graphics settings, and ski on this huge-♥♥♥ mountain. It is bigger than expected. If you buy any of the 2 tiers, you can access Multiplayer right away, if you choose for the cheapest tier, you'll have to wait a little longer. But looking on their websites, and the upcoming features, made me excited.

The physics still need work, they're are quite a bit of glitches and animations still need some work.

All there is to do is free roam the mountain with no objective, and really, nothing is of interest other than the few trick courses. It gets really repetitive just seeing trees and rocks over and over again. Furthermore, the game has no audio, which will just further add to the monotony. You might be able to extend the experience by messing around with the gravity in the game files, but really, as it is in alpha, this game only has about three hours of enjoyable content at most. Hopefully future updates will make the game an enjoyable experience, which it does have the potential to become, but just don't buy it in alpha.

This game is incredible, but noticably unfinished, but that's ok. This game, being in beta, obviously has a lot of quirks that need to be ironed out, yet in the state its in, is still an interesting and fun game. I'll try to update this review as I play some more, and as updates come in, but as a first impression, here's what I have:\n- The vastness of the mountain is incredible: So far I've been able to access one mountain with 4 "sides", with their own parks and trails. The size and structure of the mountain is very large, and if and when more are implemented, will give this game more than enough variety.\n- The character customization is really cool: You have a large selection of real life gear, from head to toe. Each piece costs credits, which you can buy with real money, but is really cool nonetheless. Having microtransactions for cosmetic items is a great way to generate revenue in a free to play game.\n- The tricks are cool, but there are quirks: I'm still learning how to maneuver well, but the tricks are generally well done. Airs are decently well timed, although you do pretty much land anything as long as you're not upside down. The rail slides are pretty broken to be honest, there's no real feedback that you've done a railslide, and hopping on to rails isn't exactly satisfying.\n\nOverall, the game is alot of fun in its current state and I'm super excited to see how it's going to look once all the quirks are ironed out.","December 19, 2015","true","61.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In multiplayer the devs  should make an option (when you enter the ski lift) to either\n1. Wait for other players to fill the lift seats.

It is really important because I wanted to explore the different areas but the skiing looks stiff and the gameplay is rather boring.\n\n-This game lacks in animations. The animations are also super important because if you pull of a sick trick it has to look really badass. Not some locked animation and the model just rotates.

This game, being in beta, obviously has a lot of quirks that need to be ironed out, yet in the state its in, is still an interesting and fun game. I'll try to update this review as I play some more, and as updates come in, but as a first impression, here's what I have:\n- The vastness of the mountain is incredible: So far I've been able to access one mountain with 4 "sides", with their own parks and trails. The size and structure of the mountain is very large, and if and when more are implemented, will give this game more than enough variety.\n- The character customization is really cool: You have a large selection of real life gear, from head to toe. Each piece costs credits, which you can buy with real money, but is really cool nonetheless. Having microtransactions for cosmetic items is a great way to generate revenue in a free to play game.\n- The tricks are cool, but there are quirks: I'm still learning how to maneuver well, but the tricks are generally well done. Airs are decently well timed, although you do pretty much land anything as long as you're not upside down. The rail slides are pretty broken to be honest, there's no real feedback that you've done a railslide, and hopping on to rails isn't exactly satisfying.\n\nOverall, the game is alot of fun in its current state and I'm super excited to see how it's going to look once all the quirks are ironed out.","December 19, 2015","true","61.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And I haven't been playing for long. I just saw it for it's silly ragdolls. But as I played, I saw something more beautiful. As I sped down slopes and looked around at the landscape. I was left in shock to it's beauty. I eventually learnt how to pull of amazing flips and stunts! I would dash down hills, mountains, forests, cliff faces. And do some wacky things. This game feels awesome, everyone should give it a try.\n\nThough this game isn't perfect. Our lovely developers thought it would be a good idea to put a high price on cosmetics! I would like to customize my character to as an acurate version of me in my snow gear, as possible! But Because I don't want to blow off 20 dollars, No thankyou! It would be much better if we got credits as we leveled up! Or if every run we did, we would get points for it! I get you guys need money, but this isn't a good way to do it! Also, you guys have us to buy events... And the only reason anyone would buy an event is because the item you get for getting Gold on it. I'm pretty sure you can buy the same item for less... In most cases.\n\n\nThat was the only complaints I had. 'Tis a fun game. Try it some time!

I wouldn't be surprised if the devs choose to go for a Skating Genre or Surfing genre on the next game because they successfully did it on this one. This is definitely a cool game for an Early Access and I would love to see more from the Devs.\n\nThere is one thing that needs to be fixed in the game, which is the CURSOR. It camouflages within the Menu sometimes. Maybe change it to a Blue or Cyan\n\nApart from the Windows 10 looking menu, and using Cry Engine it really does succeed in reaching the goal of being a Snow-sport game.","January 28","true","6.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A beautiful snow covered mountain is the setting as you and your skiis glide down steep slopes and dodge through wintery forests. SNOW is a beautiful game.\n\nHowever, it is in alpha/beta stage and its all very basic at the moment, you get the distinct feeling that they are struggling to update this game in time for release, it has its fair share of bugs and glitches but on top of all that is a distinctly beautiful experience with a great sound track and a game that is unrivaled in what it sets out to do. It is a Skiing game that captures the beauty and speed of skiing, and it is the best on any console right now.\n\nHopefully the developers will cross the finish line with a game that we can all be proud to have played, but until then, its a waiting game.\n\n\n8.5/10\nPro's -\n* Has the potential to be the best skiing game ever\n* Amazing mountain sandbox\n* Graphics\n* Has multiplayer\nCons-\n*They havent made it yet.\n* gltichy and buggy (including the physics)\n* Future is uncertain\n* Multiplayer is laggy at the moment (devs have stated this should improve with server improvement)","January 3","true","14.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You all basterds, look at the game!! The developers are awesome and they update it a lot, I bought the game before 2 days or so, and the Multiplayer Servers are VERY active! at least 3 players everyday in a server. (Now I know 3 players isn't a lot but this game is a Beta + people don't buy it just CAUSE the character lookin'..) Anyway to the point:\n\nPros:\n*Great Lookin' Menu - Really nice to the eyes!\n*Character Lookin' - Listen, You can just add $15 and you will have your dream character, + don't listen to people that CRY over character lookin'... C'mon are you a baby?! :/\n* Tricks - There are A LOT of tricks in the game, tricks to the GROUND and in to the AIR.\n*Free Roam - The Free Roam is so beautiful, it really is I recommend you to check it out! There isn't only 1 mountain there are more + there are some parks and events. (as well challenges).\n*Multiplayer - As I said, not too much to say cause the multiplayer has all I said now ;) but yeah it is really nice that there is multiplayer, you can have some new friends do some tricks together, chill out and have some fun!\n*Controls - You can choose what to play with, Keyboard / Controler, I think it is really nice!\n\nP.S Awesome game but! For all the people who think this game is ♥♥♥♥ and they judge it cause of the character lookin' are pretty much..♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you stop the game improving it self just CAUSE you CRY about character lookin'...Go *** ok?\n\nCons:\n\n*Physics - The physics are a bit clunky when you Crash but overall when you just play without crashing they are good.\n*Controls* - Not really a con :/ I just want to say you can't yet change the controls on PC, but I don't know what about Controler though, But as I said it really isn't a con it's just you can't change them yet!\n\nOverall!\n5 Pros.\n2 Cons.\n\nOpinion about the game:\n\nReally it is my opinion but I really hope you will try it out guys, seriously you are not homless it is only $10 bucks! c'mon show some help for the "Updating Developers" :) they really do update a lot which is a Pro isn't it? oh wait!\n\n*6 Pros.\n*2 Cons.\n\nSo I hope I made it a little more sharper for you! Please buy the game and help it improve, it's only a BETA BTW if you didn't know! so yeah have a great day and I hope you will listen to me! Cya :D (If you wanna know more add me to friends I have a STEAM GIFT OF THE GAME Yes!!! so yeah cya :D)","December 9, 2015","true","25.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Lulz @ skiholes who didnt like my review because of snowboard comments\n\n\n~OPEN BETA UPDATE~\n\nAfter a rough start the devs pumped out multiple hotfixes within a day and have the game up and running. definately worth checking out.\n\nalso remember to harass the devs to add snowboarding like they said they were going to.\n\n\n\n\n~WRITTEN DURING CLOSED BETA~\n\nIn a world where realistic extreme sports games are no more, especially on PC, SNOW is a light in the darkness. Thats not to say its without its problems though.\n\nPros\n-Physics. I've worked as a liftie in Vt and can say the feel of being on snow/rails/boxes is all solid and in line with really cruising down a mountain\n-Optional First Person Mode. Why havent more extreme sports games done first person? there arent words to describe hitting a double cork 1080 in first person.\n-Open Mountain. you literally have accesss to the ENTIRE mountain. want trails? they are there. want a park? there are a few. want backcountry, go nuts.\n-Ragdoll Bails. While these arent the most realistic animations in the world, they will leave you cringing and laughing after you smash a rock at speed\n\nCons\n-No Snowboarding. This is a big one for me. when this game was on kickstarter the devs were promising snowboarding was going to be added as soon as the basics of skiing were in. this has not happened and there has been no news to hint that it is still planned. it leaves the mountains feeling like those douchey ski only resorts. wheres the boarder love?\n-rough multiplayer. the devs announced that they will be upgrading thier servers when the game goes to open beta. this is very much needed as a random lag spike can kill an amazing run down the mountain or ruin a nice freeroam follow the leader session\n-microtransactions. there are a lot of them. essentially everything to customize your rider costs real money (not much compared to some other games though) there also appears to be some "events" that you buy into with real money (havent tried these so i cant speak to much on them)\n-wierd snow behavior. i know i know, its a beta. but sometimes snow will magically leave a trail in the air behind you when you jump, and it stays that way even on your next run down the mountain, this isnt a major issue but can cause issues lining up jumps and grinds in the parks.\n\nOverall: is SNOW worth it?\nif you have been craving some realistic extreme sports or if you are a mountain lifer then this game is definately for you. if you like exploring in a relaxing setting this game is probably for you. if you want somethinglike tony hawks pro skater on skis, you should stay far far away.","January 14","true","30.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

I will just be saying how things are (for me and a lot of other people, not everyone).\n\nFirst off, SNOW is a lot of fun, singleplayer and (sometimes) multiplayer are great and the game has a lot of potential and it would be an amazing game if only...\n\nIt worked, which it kinda doesn't at the moment.\n\nThe game is constantly crashing (for me and a couple of others who tried out the game).\n\nMultiplayer is a mess.All the servers are mostly full because of the 12 players cap and they will always display that they have over 300+ ping when they actually don't. When hovering over someone's name in the spawnmenu the game will put a camera on them like you're spectating them. If you scroll through the players (unintetionally) the camera will glitch out and it might crash your game because the FPS drops to 0-2. Sometimes when you spawn, there will be random invisible walls right infront of you completely blocking your movement and it takes away all your points if you jump because of 'bad landing'. Sometimes the walls are placed a bit infront of you so after you gained some speed you instantly crash because of the god damn wall. Sometimes when other players spawn on you, it will make you crash instantly.\n\nThese are the multiplayer problems I'm having, some might have the same, some might not.\n\nSingleplayer/EventsSingleplayer is a lot better than multiplayer in terms of the game working, but it gets easily boring skiing around by yourself. So you either jump into Multiplayer, or you go do some Events! (Since leveling up gives you no credits at all and you can unlock a yellow outfit through the events that are free. Now I warn you, if you haven't played the game or Events, this will frustrate the living **** out of you. Some Events are fairly easy, and some will make you rip your hair out. I'm not going to get into a lot of detail about this, but it kinda sucks that the events don't give you credits so you can buy your own gear instead of a boring yellow outfit.\n\nWith all that said, the game is still worth downloading since it's free and it is fun, when it works.\n\nLike I said, I know this is a free to play beta and you can't expect too much from it just yet. I know the game will improve and I am definitely looking forwards to it.\nThat's all I'm going to write for now..","February 5","false","35.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Just seriously, so many glitches I encounter, making me not getting to a save point, losing all of my points... This game isn't really something that you spend tons and tons of time on, as you will get frustrated from the glitches. Sometimes when I jump off, my character freezes and cannot do a command except for basic ones like, turning and really nothing else. This could actually be fixed by wiping out, but most of the time as I try, it doesn't happen. Only get this game if you have tolerance for its glitches. I can see that you might be saying; "IT WAS MADE IN OCT 2013!" Well, its 3 years from then, and they should've already fixed them. It is also really hard to level up in the game too, which makes buying new gear and making it easier, requiring for 10s of hours. Only get it if you like to just play around, not going for a highscore or something, as I know a glitch will mess you up. Also, I can see that they have been doing some fixes, but FOR ME it says the last update a month ago FOR ME. And they have pretty close updates too. So really, they probably don't know how to fix what is happening to me (and us) meaning they have a bad team. No offense. I have also heard that in MAY 2016 it still is in BETA after 3 years. I don't see any potential in the game, as other devs work harder than them, releasing the out-of-BETA version out in 3 months to 2 years MAX. Only buy this game if you just do it in your freetime, not to break your friend's highscore, as the glitches will mess you up.","May 9","false","3.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

It is broken and unplayable. Yes, you can say the game is in it's early alpha stages and I should expect bugs and general annoying gameplay. But when the developers announced that the game would be ready by Febuary of this year back in October of last and it isn't, well that just shows how little care they have for the game.\n\nI bought into the this game as the original discription that was on Steam at the first release of this half arsed early access, was snowboarding. At first they never pointed out that the snowboarding would be implimented later on in the game's life. All that was stated in the original discription is that the game was in early alpha and that it had some issues.\n\nI am sick and tired of developers throwing their game onto Steam as an "early access". It is terrible marketing and has already made me want to not play the game when it is fully released. If that ever happens! I shall remind you, this game was supposed to release as a free to play in Feb. It is no April and the game is yet to be released.\n\nIf you are in need of money as a developer just to finish your game. Do not release it as an early access. Hype the game up, get better funding and make sure your target market knows about the game. I would have had no idea about this game as, from what I know, it has only been marketed on Steam.\n\nGet your ♥♥♥♥ together, developers! Stop releaseing paid, half arsed early access games with no guaranty that the game is even going to be release on time or even at all. I invested in this game because I thought at least one developer may get it right, but no. Just like the majority, they screw up and seem to have little to no care about the game itself and only the money.\n\nNow, after that rant, I can say some good things about this game. The graphics are beautiful. They really give the feeling of gliding through soft powder on a beautiful day. Or at least it does when it actually lets you spawn. The character customisation is actually good, with a wide range of branded products to chose from. Like K2 and Vokl. The mountain looks real and outstanding, especially in the highest settings. The game seems to run well with very little hiccups, even maxed out too.\n\nI honestly want to see this game succeed in a big way. But the way it is now and the way the developers failed to deliver a Febuary launch just take hope away. I am truly wanting a good snowboard/skiing sim to play as none that I have sunk any time or effort into have been rewarding. Games like Shaun White Snowboarding and Stoked are good but not outstanding. If the developers are able to pull all of this out of the bag, even with all the issues that it shouldn't have this far into the development of the game, I will recomend it. But right now, with all the issues and my personal hatred for early access game at this time, I can not recommend this game to anyone.\n\nI have hope for this game eventually turning out fantastic. But for now, it is slim. Every month I will pop back onto the game and give another test. And each time, I will edit this review. I hope for the better.","April 9, 2014","false","11.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

The recently implemented new mechanics are not as good as they could be, but the developers already told us fixes are coming with the 0.5.1 patch.\nWell... After the closed beta update, 0.5.0, people are whining a lot about the new changes. Especially because they can't get their cosmetic items (for free!), which does absolutely nothing, besides making you look a little unique. You can still ride all the mountains, try out all the events, and you're certainly not limited by any micro-transactions gameplay-wise. You can use all the grabs, ride just as fast, and compete in just as many events as you want to - FOR FREE!\n\nThis is what I would like to see in EVERY Free-to-Play game. Where you ONLY have to (optionally) pay for cosmetic items. Here in SNOW, as it is in 0.5.0, you can't pay to get BETTER. You can only look slightly 'cooler'.\n\nOn a whole 'nother note, here's a few quotes by a few developers from Poppermost, the company who makes the game SNOW, regarding the new shop and the new mechanics:\n1. Asurao: "We have no plans to charge you for new levels/mountains. We want everyone to be able to ride together whether they've spent money or not. This is core to the game." and "There will be many ways to earn credits in the future".\n(>>Source<<)\n\n2. Rubadubdub!: "I can ensure you that there will be other ways of getting new gear in the future, so you'll still be able to get pretty good gear just like in TF2, CS: GO etc."\n(>>Source<<)\n\n3. Asurao: "As we continue working towards Open Beta (0.6.0) we will be adding player progression (a leveling system) so that you can earn items without having to buy them"\n>>Source<<\n\n4. Asurao: "I agree that the break-turn isn't working as intended and overall speed management feels very sporadic. We're looking into this and will make improvements in future updates."\n(>>Source<<)","March 13, 2015","true","62.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Since the Closed-Beta update, this has become one of the most amazing games I have ever played.\n\nThe main thing they have added is a first person camera, which adds so much immersion it is crazy. The controls are now a lot more smoother, simple, but very diverse and allow you to carve it up very realistically.\n\nOne of the main problems I encounter frequently is texture pop-in and missing textures. There is nothing worse than dropping in and having a rock appear 3 metres from you. These are teething issues that are sure to be fixed down the line. Another personal issue is the added store feature, but since this game will be free to play at full release it is something I can live with, hopefully the Alpha and Beta testers get a lil extra ;).\n\n\nIn conclusion if you have any interest in skiing whatsoever you should absoluteley buy this game to support the continued development. If you aren't, or you don't want to deal with Beta bugs, hold out for the F2P full release :D\n","March 20, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Sadly, when i bought this (Febuary 2014) I must have been tired and not have realized this.  If it had been in the genre of F2P (Like it should have) then I never would have paid a penny.  I actually beg the people reading this to wait until it's fully F2P before deciding to give them money.  It's bad. . . really bad.  You'd have more fun with Bad Rats.\n\nNow on to the game play.\n\nWhen I went to customize my character, all the logos and designs were blurred out and looked horrid.\n\nSo I got character set up in his blurry clothes and went to play.  It stuck on the loading screen for a few minutes and CRASH.  No error message was given. The game was closed and here was my desktop.  So I loaded it to give it another try.  Third person view seemed okay.  I did a backflip in midair and i did a grind on something.  Nothing impressive. I've seen better in the original tony hawk pro skater.  Fooled around a bit and that seemed like all i could figure out how to do other than crash and make my head flop around in a goofy fashion.\n\nAfter the first shot, I decided to try another track.  I don't know what I did, but I suddenly found myself in 1st person view.  This seemed kinda badass and actually easier to see what i was doing.  I actually kind of liked this. Almost had fun for a few minutes, then it wore thin and i closed it.\n\nMaybe in ANOTHER year or two they might have this up to the point of being playable. . . but not yet.

It gives me a vibe of SSX and Skiing itself. The Physics in the game are decent, and the VR is a cool feature.\n\nThis is where I hate this game, and will cause me to give it a negative review.\n\nPaying for Credits.\nNow people will actaully try to defend this, and say it isn't necessary, but this is something that everyone in the game wants to achieve, allow people to buy, and EARN credits. I know you want money, but you still still have people buying credits about as much, because most people who have money to burn, would buy credits anyway, and are mostlikely the only ones in the game buying credits.\n\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Physics.\nI understand that sometimes landing on a slop wrong will get you wiped out, but this is stupid.

It's a fun lil snowboarding game that almost reminds me of the SSX and Amped: Freestyle that I played back when I did the console thing.

It is early access but I gave into the extra tester pack, I thought I should just give in there, no point in playing anymore. I had troubles with controls, and got stuck several times, but I prevailed and gave it a few more hours. I was sincerely surprised at how amazing it was after figuring out the controls and getting onto the actual mountain. The views are wonderful, theres tons of small easter eggs and a book a tricks that keeps getting bigger. Is this game complete? No, but the developer(s) are part of this community and are actively trying to fix bugs with the help of us. This game already looks beautiful and is a must have for skiers and boarders alike.

Having sound would be an awesome addition, i can get by just listening to tunes while i play, but some sound would really make the experience more complete.

No half-pipe and no snowboards yet, fingers crossed for next large patch.\nThis game is going to be the best snowboarding experience since amped 1/2 and i can't wait to see whats in the next patch.

SNOW is not flawless, and does have its fair share of bugs. One major flaw is that there is no audio, but one good fix I found is to have some music in the background, something fast paced, as you ski past all these rocks and obstacles that never seem to stop coming. Controls need a little bit of work, and they will arrive in due time.\n\nI honestly reccomend this game to people who like sking/winter sports, or just enjoy crashing their skier into a couple hundred obstacles.","January 2, 2014","true","12.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But...\n\nSo far, this game still isn't at par with most simulator type skiing\snowboarding games that have already been on the market.  The character is stiff, weightless, and too obviously procedurally driven.  It looks and feels like you are controlling the skiis not the rider.  The controls are very binary when they should take advantage of modern analog controllers. For instance, regardless if you tap the steering controls or hold, the character drops right into the extremity of the turning poses.  Same for grabs and any other feedback coming from the character.\n\nThere is no sense of speed unless you are in the trees. The levels feel wide open, flat, and tricking opportunities are sparse. The jumps in the parks feel dauntingly huge and are seemingly too big for the lack of speed even at max speed.   The physics feel just as binary as the controls and don't work well with the level design metrics for the terrain or park obstacles.  Rails riding is quirky and the rider looks dorky. Halfpipe riding is frustrating and it's nearly impossible to get any speed\air.  The radgoll is just broken, and bailing in any game other than EA Skate isn't fun. It's punishing and wastes a players time.\n\nThe best parts of this game are the jump on the right thumbstick (thank you EA Skate) when it works and doesn't give you an awkward emote instead. As well, a huge plus is having the generous ability to customize the ingame camera.\n\nThis game has a long way to go before Beta.","September 14, 2015","false","8.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunatly this is a purchase I very much regret for now.\nWHile it looks and plays fine in 2D for an Alpha product, when you enable 3D via the Oculas Rift I found the game unplayable. This is the only time i've found the experience better in 2D than in 3D through the rift.\nGeneral complaints are:\nLow Framerate (Even when all settings are set to low)\nVery Flat "3D" objects. Such as Trees and background. (Looks like a flat picture as the background)\nDistancing issue with objects (The moon appears about 4 meters away from your head and closer than other objects)\nVery sparse amount of 3D objects so you get a very poor 3D feel.\nView disorientating. (If your character is infront of your view. Head tracking does not work correctly) When in "First Person" any character movement affects your view.\nOverall I would not recommend this game for use with the Oculas Rift as its a disappointing experience.

I missed all the "extreme" sports games that the consoles used to have. Games like 1080 Avalanche and Tony Hawk Pro Skater always had a nice mix of sick tricks and groovy clothing options that always allowed for a fun time. This game has both and its doing it in the right direction.\n\nFor start, this game is in early access and there are plenty of bugs. With this aside, the dev team is working hard to make the gameplay mechanics, such as the actual movement and physics, extremely polished. As of right now, the skiing elements feel as they should.\n\nYou are now wondering, "hey bruh, wut bout my snowboard?! I want to be the next Dion Blaster....errr Ricky Winterboard...." As of right now the devs are currently working on the skiing mechanics alone; focusing all their efforts before transitioning to snowboards. While this may seem upsetting, I will remphasize that the skiis are nicely done. This aspect should not deter you from giving this game a try.\n\nThe game itself is centered around a few areas and one giant mountain that people can skii around. This I feel is the best aspect of the game. Every location feels new.  Any path you travel lacks the strategically placed fallen tree or mountain face that forces you to go in any given direction. While there are paths to follow, there is nothing stopping you from carving your own trail.\n\nThe game itself looks awsome too. I dont know how hard it was to paint a mountain white, but it is incredibly satisfying to look around while skiing. With this in mind, The dev team is supporting the occulus rift, which is a step in the right direction. I often put myself in first person mood to get a better immersion while going down the mountainside and the rift will probably provide a better experience.\n\nI guess the only "downside" to this game, which isnt really a bad thing, is that this game will be F2P. The game will charge the players for buying different clothing. Who are they to tell me that I have to wear clothes..... pff!\n\nThis will be a more mature version of the "extreme" sports I used to enjoy on the consoles. Knowing this, I cant wait to take all the skill I learned in SNOW and apply it to real skiing.....","August 10, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game ran great with maxed settings  on my overclocked r9 390 without any stuttering. I was met with my first bug in the tutorial when it asked me to preform a trick and no matter what i did it wouldnt register at all so i quit the tutorial with the basics in mind and set out the open mountains.... except i apperantly scrolled through the drop selection menu too fast and crashed my game so that my screen was covered in black nothingness so i had to reboot my pc. Once i rebooted and scrolled through the drops at a snails pace i got to skiing. It was great doing tricks, flying through the air like a spinning top, crashing and watching the halarious glitched out wipe outs untill after every rock and rewind my character would do weird things like get stuck in t-pose or go down the mountains unable to jump brake or move at some points. My final thoughts are if your just there for the scenery or want to spend real money on ingame skins or clothing and dont mind the sometimes gamebreaking glitches then this is the game for you. But if you want to ski arround without having to troubleshoot some weird bug every few minutes than i would reccomend you get Wii Ski Resort and play that because that is better than this hunk of yellow SNOW.","February 15","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The only thing you can buy are extra credits which allow you to unlock extra gear (but you get these overtime anyways). The controls are fluid and very refined making it easy to learn but hard to master. There's just nothing like plowing through some fresh powder or hitting a 540 Corkscrew in first person.\n\nOnly downside is you basically NEED some sort of controller to play it (mouse and keyboard ain't going to cut it) but they're pretty cheap and easy to find.","January 27","true","10.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game ran great with maxed settings  on my overclocked r9 390 without any stuttering. I was met with my first bug in the tutorial when it asked me to preform a trick and no matter what i did it wouldnt register at all so i quit the tutorial with the basics in mind and set out the open mountains.... except i apperantly scrolled through the drop selection menu too fast and crashed my game so that my screen was covered in black nothingness so i had to reboot my pc. Once i rebooted and scrolled through the drops at a snails pace i got to skiing. It was great doing tricks, flying through the air like a spinning top, crashing and watching the halarious glitched out wipe outs untill after every rock and rewind my character would do weird things like get stuck in t-pose or go down the mountains unable to jump brake or move at some points. My final thoughts are if your just there for the scenery or want to spend real money on ingame skins or clothing and dont mind the sometimes gamebreaking glitches then this is the game for you. But if you want to ski arround without having to troubleshoot some weird bug every few minutes than i would reccomend you get Wii Ski Resort and play that because that is better than this hunk of yellow SNOW.","February 15","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

SNOW has everything that makes a good game in one big package. First off the graphics look outstanding, almost as if I'm actually on a mountian. Amazing UI its basic and gets the job done. Multiplayer works and allows you to race with friends and explore the beautiful landscapes this game can offer. I am not a huge fan of skiing and I had a blast, anyone who likes a game that can offer ANY of the above should instantly download SNOW. Its free-to-play but it does not shove its microtransactions in your face. Never while I was playing did I feel forced to buy any credits as the game offers them from regular play. You have nothing to lose by giving this great game a chance and It is a project I will continue to follow and support.","January 30","true","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And since then I hoped for a realistic skiing simulator. And now its here! And even if it is in Beta it is already pretty perfect in my opinion. If you get used to the controls there is nothing that can stop you from stomping awesome tricks. The landscape looks awesome and is also very realistic. All in all I rate this game 95/100. Its super chill, super fun and super ... I don't have time to finish this review cause the mountains are calling for me.

The skiing is really fun and visceral, and doing tricks for points is very fun albeit conventional. There is no pay to win garbage, everything in the game is available to you and the levelling system is generous. Microtransactions only give you a visual change and do not affect the gameplay. You can do tricks and explore snowy mountains and it's really fun to land risky moves and tricks which is pretty much what the game is about.\n\nIt feels a bit incomplete, but it's still in early access and it's free, so the fun trade-off is a no brainer. The controls are a bit wonky, but get easier as you go along. There is multiplayer and ♥♥♥♥ing around on black-diamond mountains is really fun.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game has a very minimal style with a calming soundtrack. It really does feel like it is the 'Forza' of skiing, as the visuals coupled with the white smooth aesthetic of the game really sort of melt together to create something fresh and interesting. The snow in the game actually has prints and you can make trails with your skiis which results in some funny little glitches (like scraping an entire mountain's worth of snow off while you descend sideways, like it's a butter knife).\n\nThe ragdoll weight needs some work, and the game is slightly demanding. However, the developers are very consistent with their updates and each time I find it smoother and better looking as I keep playing. Makes me want to go to the mountains again.","April 25","true","22.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This question will determine if this game is worth the money or not. If you want a in depth game with a ton of content that is streamlined and explained well then this isnt for you... at all. The game is tricky to understand and does not feel familar to skate or tony hawk fans. While the controls work well, they could have been much better. a recommondation would be to make it like skate's right analog stick for tricks and jumping while a boosts your speed. Lets talk about speed. Going fast and pulling off a tough trick is the best part about this game. However there are times when you only go about 50 kps and those parts are monotonous to say the best. The biggest problem is you cant even go faster in these parts, you are pretty much capped at 50. Anyways no sound also is a HUGE dissapointment. This game once sound is added will be very relaxing. I guess until then just use spotify.
