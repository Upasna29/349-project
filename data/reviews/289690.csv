We had an O.K. time.\n\nBut, what made the first game amazing in my eyes is not present in this game. And really, they're the only things this game does; the puzzles and the shooting.\n\nThe first game in this series was an extremely refreshing twin stick shooter/puzzler. The shooting was incredibly solid and the puzzles were INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS. This new Lara Croft twin stick shooter is shorter, the combat is easier, and the puzzles are also easier, less impactful, and recycled from the first game. In the end, this game is about 1/3 the length of the first. Less shooting. Less puzzles. Less fun.\n\nI just want to mention the puzzles one last time. I want to do this because the first game took me by surprise. Your characters have limited abilities but the developers were able to create unique, well thought out puzzles around those abilities. There were points in the first game where me and my friend would have to stop and reconsider the uses of our abilities to figure out puzzles. Again, the puzzles in the first were really well designed. I played this new game with that same friend and we breezed through this game in a matter of days. Such a short disappointing game.\n\nIf you have not played the first game in this series, go grab a friend and play that game. Enjoy that unique co-op experience. Savour that game though because it is one of a kind and you will not find that experience again especially in this game.","December 21, 2014","false","7.5"," 148 of 174 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","148","174","0","5"

Well, if this is the case, then I and my friend were both spectacularly unlucky! This really does seem to be broken.\n\nWe bought the game to play cooperatively, online, on two machines with different specs. Both were well above minimum spec, and yet the issues we found were:\n* Game displays black screen instead of menus etc. (one machine; found a work-around on the forums - this seems to be a common problem)\n* Painfully slow frame rate (both machines, frequently)\n* Cut scene dialogue gets out of sync (one machine)\n* Cut scene dialogue refers to plural people when addressing single person (both machines, single player)\n* Game inserts second character into game for no apparent reason (seen once, one machine)\n* Game ceases to recognise XBox360 controller (one machine, once)\n* Control of characters sluggish (both machines, always)\n\nThose were all encountered in "2 hours" of "play".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vxia/recommended/289690/","vxia","Dennis Riley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vxia/","76 products in account","I've decided to write my thoughts after seeing a mixed public opinion on it. TL; DR version is at the bottom.\n\nTemple of Osiris is the sequel to the action-adventure / puzzle game "Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light," which holds an overwhelmingly positive score on the Steam store. Both games are played from an isometric perspective and have a heavy emphasis on solving environmental puzzles with some action-shooting thrown in for good measure. Gameplay-wise, the two are very similar in controls and mechanics, such as the use of the grappling hook or rolling spheres to certain locations to advance. The big difference, however, is that Temple of Osiris can be played with up to 4 players in comparison to Guardian of Light's two-player experience, and Lara Croft now uses Osiris's object-altering staff to assist with puzzle-solving instead of Totec's spear.\n\nDespite being very similar in its core aspects, it is very clear that the developers attempted to improve virtually every aspect of the game from the first, and one huge change from the first game to this one is the graphics and the aesthetics. Probably the most immediate and biggest contrast from the first game in terms of aesthetics is the menu screen:\n\nIn Guardian of Light, the menu screen is a still image of an open book with several comic panels serving as the "buttons," while some background music played softly in the distance.\n\nIn Temple of Osiris, the player is immediately shown a dramatic, fully-animated scene of Croft and her companions in an intense back-lit part of Osiris's kingdom, with very sharp contrasts in light and color. Lara Croft is standing in a pose that suggests a state of confidence that screams "My body is ready." All of this happens with incredibly dramatic, cinematic music playing in the background.\n\nThe list goes on:\n\nThe first boss of Guardian of Light is in a rigid isometric view that puts an emphasis on puzzle-solving.\n\nIn Temple of Osiris, the first boss features explosions, flames, particles, special effects, and general chaotic insanity galore. The screen shakes at every boom, at every quake of the ground. Even the camera is tilted at a lower angle to show the scene behind the objects in the foreground; a background that is blurred by the depth of field hints at the utter chaos and ancient horrors that lurk below. Unfortunately, I didn't get a good, long look at it because I was too busy dodging the missiles exploding on the ground.\n\nThe difference is as huge as Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy. I almost thought that somewhere in the development team of Temple of Osiris, people were seeking Michael Bay as a consultant.\n\nThe keyword here is "cinematic." The graphics and the aesthetics of Temple of Osiris are clearly intended to be much more cinematic in comparison to Guardian of Light. Depth of field is much more emphasized and commonplace. Ambient occlusion is everywhere. Overall, the graphics have been massively touched upon compared to Guardian of Light. All of these changes to the aesthetics serve to give the player the sense of wonder and adventure, to strike home the point that they are about to explore an unknown yet exciting danger. The chaos during the action sequences and the boss fights emphasize the desperation and insanity of the moment, that the player is literally fighting against the gods with barely anything more than guns. Not a single scene in Guardian of Light gave me that same sense as Temple of Osiris did.\n\nBut games are not all about the graphics, the sound, or the first-impression, and that leads us to the biggest factor: the gameplay.\n\nAs stated before, the two games play very similarly compared to each other, with the only big difference being the manner in which puzzles are solved. However, that difference in puzzle-solving is one of the biggest factors that is causing the divide on the public opinion towards this game.\n\nI will go ahead and admit it: the puzzles in Temple of Osiris are much easier compared to Guardian of Light. This is the deal-breaker for many people; it is the biggest gameplay-related complaint that constantly keeps being mentioned in the reviews. Personally, I believe it to be so for one big reason.\n\nFirst, the nature of the staff mechanic. When Lara (or Isis / Horus in multiplayer) activates the staff, all objects with the symbol of Osiris are "activated" and react accordingly. For example, floor tiles with the symbol will lift higher in height, allowing players to reach higher locations and advance, and time-bombs will have their timer slowed to be safely pushed across longer distances or even used as portable platforms. In Guaridan of Light, the spear is used primarly to ascend or cross terrain due to its nature as a temporary player-created platform.\n\nWhat ends up happening is that the staff mechanic of Temple of Osiris forces the player to immediately look for objects marked with the symbol, which usually end up giving away the answer simply by their positioning and two-way function. More often than not, these objects are floor tiles that stay in one place in the world in which the player only has a limited amount of control over; up or down. In Guardian of Light, the spear mechanic teaches the player to look at the problem as a whole. Because the means to advance is directly in the player's hand, there is no obvious focal point in the puzzle for the player to look for. This in turn encourages players to analyze the situation and create a plan, making mental guesses on the outcomes of each possible plan before actually attempting it.\n\nLooking at the design of the puzzles and the action sequences in both games, Temple of Osiris is clearly meant to have much more emphasis on the action-adventure aspects rather than the puzzles. There are many more "chase scenes" in Temple of Osiris than in Guardian of Light, and the boss battles are much more intense and engaging. Combined with the addition of 4-player co op instead of the duo team in Guardian of Light, it may have been a design choice in order to make the game more accessable and appealing to a larger audience, people who may or may not be avid puzzle-solvers or simply don't want puzzles to be the bigger aspect in the action-to-puzzle ratio. It's anyone's guess.\n\nA very big complaint I do have to address is the control. The controls in Guardian of Light are absolutely fantastic; they are responsive, quick, and fit perfectly in the game. Unfortunately for Temple of Osiris, the movment controls were much more sluggish compared to Guardian of Light, for reasons unknown. I speculate that it may have to do with the turning that Lara does when changing directions, which can easily send the player into situations where he or she is exposed to taking damage or dying immediately. The sluggish movement can be a huge source of frustration for the player.\n\nAccording to other reviews of this game, Temple of Orisis also has a rather sizable amount of bugs and glitches, some of which end up ruining the gaming experience completely. However, I have not experienced any of these bugs or glitches in the game so far, leading me to believe that the game has problems on specific graphic cards and/or computer setups.\n\nWith everything laid out on the table, it is time to answer the big question: "Is this game worth buying?"\n\nHonestly, I think the game is pretty good. It may have some very noticable flaws, but the game as a whole is very playable, and more importantly, enjoyable. I still ended up having the same amount of fun with this title as I did with Guardian of Light, despite all of the reviews that say otherwise.\n\nPlayers that really enjoyed the puzzles of the first game, or are avid Tomb Raider fans may end up disappointed with Temple of Orisis. But people like me that aren't extreme fans of the Tomb Raider franchise who are simply looking for interesting games can definitely find this game enjoyable.\n\nTL; DR: 7 / 10","February 4, 2015","true","19.6"," 128 of 160 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","128","160","7","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/289690/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Lara Croft and The Temple of Osiris is a sequel of the previously published game, The Guardian of Light. This game was released in December of 2014 on PC and both PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nLike the first game, The Temple of Osiris is an adventure game with a isometric view of Lara. This game also includes co-op like the original, but this time offers the choice of more than two characters.  Lara returns with her classic dual pistol setup whilst her other friends have their own unique set of abilities and weapons. The game focuses heavily on puzzle solving, like the Tomb Raider series; but also with a little bit of platforming and gun-play thrown in too. All of the puzzles are easily solvable if you have any sort of experience in puzzle games however.  All of the gameplay elements which were in the first game are in The Temple of Osiris such as grappling hooks and bombs, and nothing really new is added in this respect. It's just more of the same.\n\nGraphically, The Temple of Osiris looks really nice; it's not top of the range graphics as you can see from the screenshots, but it does have a very nice art style, and it fits the genre and setting of game very well.  It looks very much like a Diablo style game. You get to see a variety of different environments and all of them can have different weather effects in them too.  Some of the latter levels really look special, they give you the feel of something epic is about to happen as you are exploring all of these deep and gorgeous looking tombs.\n\nThe story is very linear, you can't really effect the outcome of the plot in anyway; you have to collect "keys" in a specific order. It would of been nice if you could of changed the order in which you have to gather them, just to give the game a little bit of an open world feel to it; however I can see why they stuck to a linear style so that you are fighting against the right difficulty of enemy according to your equipment. I really did enjoy the story line though; the ending is amazing and something which I will remember for a while since the last boss fight is so epic!\n\nThe Temple of Osiris is fully voice acted; and done very well, Keeley Hawes voices Lara Croft - as she did in the previous game, and a number of other Tomb Raider games since 2006 (apart from the reboot in 2013). The game also includes very classic Tomb Raider sound tracks, both increasing the urgency in certain events, or creating a creepy and spooky atmosphere.\n\nI found The Temple of Osiris to be a little easier when compared to the first game, whether this was because I was used to the type of puzzles I was encountering, or just because it is plainly easier, I'm not sure. But none of the puzzles are mega hard and even I didn't have to resort to looking up the resolutions online. Boss fights can easily be conquered once you work out what is needed  to be done, granted this can take a while but the execution is easy. I personally found the platforming aspect to be the hardest aspect of the game.\n\nBeside the abundance of puzzles in each level, you can collect gems which in turn can be used to open treasure chests at the end of a level. These chests hold loot, such as rings and pendants. I really liked this aspect; as it allowed you to customize Lara to play however you wanted her to play. I personally opted for a more speedy build, so had run speed increases and weapon firing rate - so spent a lot of time farming gems in order to find the right equipment in the chests to that end.  Each level also comes with a few option challenges that you can complete, these can vary from completing the level in a certain amount of time, or simply not dying - these too reward you with gems allowing you to open more chests at the end. There are plenty of other items and pickups to find along the way on each level, such as permanent stat boosts to health and ammo pools.\n\nA full playthrough of The Temple of Osiris took me just under eight hours to complete. This game is a bit shorter than the original, however I see there to be more potential for replay-ability in this game. I would be more inclined to boot this game up once I have finished it since I can carry on using my same save file to complete challenges and try to find more loot and collectibles. With the addition of the co-op mode too, which result in you having a different playing experience since a number of the puzzles and events change depending on how many people are playing - The Temple of Osiris is a game which I think you can get at least eighteen hours out of if you really push it.\n\nThe only technical problems I had with this game was that sadly I wasn't able to play it on 4k resolution without frame drops; and even on 1080 I still got the frame drops but not as server, it was only really noticeable when I was in a water heavy environment. Given that I can play more recent graphically intensive games on 4k and full graphical settings, I don't think The Temple of Osiris has been optimized as well as it could. This game is also heavily reliable on you having a controller to play with. It is horrible configured for using a keyboard and mouse and is just downright uncomfortable to play if you do use them. Stick with your controller to get the best out of this game.\n\nTo sum up, I really enjoyed Lara Croft and The Temple of Osiris - whilst all of the gameplay elements are the same as the original; the game's world, story and replay-ability really make this a better title for me. Tomb Raider fans really should experience this game, and anyone wanting an introductory game to a puzzle and action genre style game will get a welcoming experience here too. The price tag of £14,99 may be a little steep if you are just planning the one playthrough; but if you are wanting to have a game which you can get almost twenty hours of gameplay out of when played with friends and aiming to complete plenty of challenges, you should not hesitate to pick this up. Everyone else just looking for a one hit pony, will probably want to wait till it goes a 50% sale.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/youhavetotellthem/recommended/289690/","youhavetotellthem","Soylent Red Is Not People","http://steamcommunity.com/id/youhavetotellthem/","455 products in account","So, I've only played a limited amount of this game, but due to the fact that it just came out, people are obviously going to want some impressions. Also, please note that earlier today I played around the first third of Guardian of Light so I would be prepared to compare the progress made on this game.\n\nTL;DR This game improves on GoL in literally every respect, rendering its predecessor almost obsolete in the process. Breathtaking visuals, refined gameplay, larger and more diverse areas/puzzles, more enemies supported on screen at the same time than GoL really ever managed, 4-player drop in/drop out with public matchmaking support, all for the lowly price of twenty dollars. Avoid using SSAA, as it seems to have very little impact on visual fidelity, make sure you plug in your gamepad, and I can almost promise you will enjoy this game.\n\n*REVIEW STARTS HERE*\n\nFirst, the negative (and trust me, there isn't much).\n\n-Bad keyboard controls return. The scheme is similar to the first game, and for many that will be a bad thing. Keyboard controls just feel unresponsive and awkward, especially since the way Lara gradually turns while running seems to be designed for an analog stick. Get a controller for this game or you will have a suboptimal experience.\n\n-PERFORMANCE. Okay, I've been seeing some initial feedback saying the performance is not very good. I was worried about this (I have an R9 290x Gaming, i5 4670, and 16 GB Ballistix) because nothing frustrates me more than poor optimization when I have a fairly nice rig. After glancing at the video options, I immediately noticed what the issue is. This game offers two types of anti-aliasing: FXAA and SSAA. Most people will be familiar with FXAA. It is very low cost but also tends to blur the image quite a bit. SSAA (commonly confused with the much less performance heavy SMAA), however, is a little bit more uncommon and is an EXTREMELY performance heavy and ham fisted form of anti-aliasing that usually looks great. I don't see much of a difference here other than a distinct performance drop in some areas while having it on. On my rig, I pull an unwavering 60 FPS with FXAA on. SSAA on drops the framerate in only the most demanding cutscenes.\n\n*EDIT*\n\nI feel like I have to add another negative here, if I am to be completely honest. I gave the multiplayer co-op a shot and... let's just say they could have done better. Now, I could see this game TOTALLY being a blast if you and a friend or two get together and communicate. Right now the solo queue is an absolute mess, though. Players drop in and drop out fairly frequently, which halts the action for a few seconds, and if the host leaves then a new one is picked and progress seems to be reset to the last checkpoint, which can be quite a ways away. Adding to the issue is the fact that these puzzles were not designed with four players in mind (it would have been quite an enourmous task to make puzzles that could be completed with one person but challenged four as well). Both Egyptian gods can wield their own respective staves while both explorers have grappling hooks and can use fire (though I've seen an issue where Lara loses fire and only Carter can use it; I don't know if this is intentional). The biggest issue seems to be a lack of communication and ability spam during complex puzzles. The session I was in consisted of one person who seemed to know how to solve the puzzle, myself, who was trying to figure it out but having difficulty communicating with the leader, and two people who seemed to be actively inhibiting progress by messing with switches, dropping mines, and moving the ball of sunlight to places it did not need to go. Fighting enemies with four players is also quite a mess. Fights are chaotic, yes, but not in the good way. Dying seems almost impossible considering the sheer amound of ammunition being simultaneously fired off and mines annoyingly cause friendly fire, which leads to some serious griefing. All in all, with maybe a single friend, this could be fun. Right now solo queue is a nightmare, though.\n\n*END EDIT*\n\nNow, the good.\n\n-This game is breathtakingly gorgeous. I mean, the screenshots look quite nice, but I never expect the same quality in game. This is an exception. From the minute you run out of the temple and outside into the first level, there is an obvious difference in graphical fidelity between this game and the last installment. The smoke effects are some of the best I have ever seen, textures are of above average quality, and the lighting is spot on. Character models look much better than the first game, though not quite as sharp as the environment (which isn't a problem since this game plays from the isometric perspective).\n\n-Gameplay is smoother and more diverse than the first game (based on my limited experience with it). While the first game had the gimmick with the golden spear, which was essentially a one trick pony, this game features a staff that allows you to interact with certain normally static objects in the world so long as they have Osiris's emblem on them. Co-op features two players wielding the staff, which does cause problems (particularly with there only being a need for one staff, so the other player is left twiddling their thumbs). Dodging, jumping, and especially grappling all feel finely tuned. It should also be noted that the UI is cleaned up, and the gear equipment screen is easier to navigate.\n\n-Level design, I feel, deserves its own category. I have only played roughly half an hour of the game and I have already encounterd larger, more open areas than were available in the first game, twice as many more enemies on screen at the same time than there ever were in Guardian of Light, and very well designed platforming sections. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that the first chase scene in the game is far more compelling and heart pounding than anything that happened in my time with Guardian of Light (and I do enjoy that game, as well).\n\n-The story is so corny and I absolutely love it. Clearly this isn't a narrative driven game, but the writers still seemed to have some fun with the script and nailed the "so bad it is good" tone perfectly. Lara, as usual, is her sassy self, but the new Egyptian additions are just a riot, particularly Set. His voice is so goofy and evil-villain-echo-tastic that one could almost not feel threatened by him, if it weren't for the very menacing and threatening demon chasing you for what seems like it will be throughout the game (a wise choice to include this to contrast Set).\n\n-Miscellaneous: The loot early on seems to possess those classic ARPG modifiers ala "Debilitating Iron Ring of Major Grappling" and so on and so forth, which seems to suggest that there will possibly be LOTS of (perhaps random) loot to collect. There is a nifty matchmaking tool in the main menu for online co-op, which is always welcome. Many of the great features from GoL have returned, such as laying and detonating bombs, carrying four weapons at a time, the ammo meter for secondary weapons, and the collection of gems (though this time they can be used to open chests containing loot; a smart addition).\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is fantastic so far and very much worth the low price tag of twenty dollars. Furthermore, you don't have to have played GoL at all to understand the story. Think of this like a 007 sequel. Sure, if you watch all the movies you will notice a broad timeline and catch on to some of the more prominent tropes, but nothing stopes you from watching them out of order and still knowing exactly what is going on. Keep in mind that co-op with strangers feels disjointed, but great with a friend. I would actually encourage you to buy this game RATHER than GoL, as this improves the gameplay in literally every area, rendering its predecessor almost completely obsolete. Anyway, if you got this far, thanks for sticking with me. Hope you enjoy!","December 8, 2014","true","3.2"," 66 of 95 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","66","95","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ultimacy/recommended/289690/","Ultimacy","Spawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ultimacy/","183 products in account","Not much of an improvement over the first game, especially from a technical standpoint. I experienced intermittent stuttering and frame rate issues on an i7 3770K processor, GTX 680 2 GB and 16 GB of RAM at 1920x1200. These slowdowns persisted even on lower graphics settings and resolutions. Several times the frame rate inexplicably got stuck at 10 frames per second for the entire game session, requiring the game to be restarted. Loading times are also significantly longer compared to the first game.\n\nIn the thirteen hours it took me to complete all of the game's challenges (sans the online multiplayer ones) I experienced seven crashes, four instances of the game locking up entirely and three cases of the controls no longer responding in the main menu. I also encountered several gameplay bugs, such as bombs falling through the floor, not being able to climb ledges after grappling to them, getting stuck on geometry and skipping small sections of the game by accidentally triggering normally unreachable checkpoints upon death.\n\nAs for the game itself, it feels very much like the first one. It's a solid game, especially in co-op, but there's little in the way of innovation besides four-player co-op and a new loot system that lets you open treasure chests containing randomized equipment of varying quality in exchange for gems. The majority of puzzles are very similar in concept to those from the first game: grapple up ledges, roll balls, place some bombs, pull a few levers, step on switches. The overall experience was a little too familiar for my taste, feeling more like an expansion than a sequel.\n\nLara gets to bring a torch this time around, but its use is limited to one or two environmental puzzles. The rest of the time you will be using it to compulsively light braziers for a chance at extra loot. The one truly new gameplay mechanic revolves around the staff of Osiris, which lets you manipulate parts of the environment and solve puzzles by reflecting beams of light. Compared to the spear from the first game, the staff makes for a decidedly more rigid puzzle solving experience. While the spear let you solve puzzles in creative (and sometimes unintended) ways, the puzzles that require the staff all have solutions that are pretty much set in stone. There's not much room to stray from the intended path anymore.\n\nI completed the game entirely in local co-op with a friend and did not experience any truly gamebreaking issues aside from the aforementioned bugs and the occasional crash. However, the game does not appear to create a separate save file for local players besides the host. Upon leaving and rejoining a game, others will have their inventory replaced by whatever the host is carrying. After experiencing a crash near the very end of the game, my co-op partner joined again, only to find that his entire inventory had been wiped with no way to restore it.\n\nI can not comment on the online multiplayer, as I have not yet been able to connect to any online games. The handful of games I found through the lobby system (after searching for roughly half an hour) were all canceled during matchmaking, leaving me to stare at the main menu while the game unsuccessfully tried to connect to other players.\n\nIn its current state, I would recommend getting the game only if you are a fan of the first one and are willing to overlook potentially aggravating technical issues. If you're on the fence about buying, it might be smart to wait a little longer and see if a patch will fix the most glaring issues. For those who are new to the series, I would absolutely recommend checking out Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light first.","December 11, 2014","false","13.6"," 66 of 100 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","66","100","2","11"

A top-down shooter, like Van Hellsing or a Diablo 3 Lite, with puzzles and many enemies. It can be played either solo or co-op (I went through it solo), as puzzles do not need multiple people to solve.\n\nLike the last game, LC:TOO is a quick adventure (took me around 9 hours or so with a lot of exploring), with good pacing through the levels, and I thought the level design was well done. Puzzles are not complicated (I think the first game had harder ones), but this allows for smoother pacing, and less standing around. Not a great trade off for some (like myself), but others will be happy for this. Chests in the game provide more rings and amulets to give you buffs (like items in the first game), and you have to spend the gems you collect to open each chest (more gems spent, better chance at a better item).\n\nThe game is not overly difficult, nor is there an option to increase said difficulty. Like the first one, there are challenges for each level, and after beating the game you can go back and run the levels again to try and beat all of the challenges which adds to replayability. Like it's predecesor, LC:TOO also rewards weapons and items for finishing challenges. Unlike the last game, where you had to select a specific level, the map in this game is designed around a central hub, so you just need to run off to whatever tomb you want to take another shot at.\n\nI have seen some complaints on the forums of high end gaming rigs having issues running the game. My specs are average (I think) and are as follows:\n\nCPU: i5 2500k (quad core 3.2GHz - not overclocked)\nRAM: 8GB\nGPU: Radeon HD 7777\n\nRan the game on High settings (which it defaulted me to), and only once did it noticably slow down, but it was only for a couple seconds.\n\nAll in all, the game is a fun romp through a bunch of tombs. I think that's the key thing with this game. It's not challenging. It's not revolutionary. It's just good, simple, fun.","December 10, 2014","true","10.0"," 34 of 51 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","34","51","0","0"

After Croft and her companion grasp an ancient staff, they awaken the god Set and find themselves marked for death at the maw of a massive crocodile-lion beast.  Aided by the deities Isis and Horus (who, trapped in the same network, are essentially human), Lara explores tombs, solves puzzles, beats waves of enemies and tries to restore a statue of Osiris to awaken him and battle Set.\n\nMy negative recommendation for this game is almost entirely based on its buggy nature.  I played through the entire campaign in co-op with friends and, out of the eight hours of play time, almost two hours was spent fighting glitches such as the game not responding to puzzles being solved, display errors and black screens, disconnects and exiting a level bouncing us back to previous save points.  Game play wasn't especially challenging though it was generally entertaining particularly with more interesting enemies and bosses later in the game.  The puzzles and levels reward teamwork and cooperation is key to progressing.  Unfortunately the final battle left us feeling a bit side-lined, clearing trash enemies as a larger battle raged elsewhere.  We were able to solve the puzzles largely unaided although we found ourselves referring to walk throughs several times to confirm that, yes, we did solve it correctly and the game was just glitched and not lowering the gate or raising the bridge we needed.\n\nHad the game worked properly, I would give this a reserved recommendation, citing mainly the short length and weak ending as reasons to buy it on sale.  But, in its current state, this game simply shouldn't have been released with its glitches and errors.  A puzzle-solving game that doesn't recognize or reward you for solving the puzzle isn't much of a game.","October 4, 2015","false","8.9"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

Several months ago, my college roommate and I spent whole night playing this game without even raiding any single tombs, but we still had a lot of fun together. We were just using mines and rocket launchers to destroy those ancient ruins and each other, but it's so entertaining and relaxing than we expected.\n\nLara Croft and Temple of the Osiris is the only game in this franchise that stays true to its roots after they reboot the series. You can hear one of the best soundtrack and head back to the most familiar location, Egypt, just like those good ol' days. The visual is stunning and the puzzles are very well-made, providing with enough challenges but not driving you mad. And if you have some friends to play with, this game definitely worth every penny. You can either play it alone and enjoy the exploration all by yourself, or have fun killing your teammates to beat their high scores, which provides some replay value as the puzzles will change dynamically according to how many players are in your current game.\n\nThis game was not very well received and had some serious bugs and performance issues at launch, I cannot even play with my friend back then. But after some patches I had already killed Isis countless times, in one of my friend's 4 players co-op game. So I really can't find anything that prevent me from recommending this little gem now.\n\nWant a genuine Lara Croft Tomb Raiding experience? Looking forward to some online or couch co-op with some of your buddies? You won't regret grabbing this one, I enjoyed almost every seconds in this amazing adventure. As for any long-time TR fans, this game will be like a time travel ticket, you can find all your lost good memories you used to have with this iconic heroine in this fantastic journey.\n\n10/10 would kill Egyptian Gods again.","May 8","true","22.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

And I say that respectfully, as I loved Guardian of Light and Tomb Raider ‘13. The stellar design and art direction of GOL is missing here, however, dipping the Lara Croft franchise into generic adventure murk with such decidedly sloppy execution. And while a patch may rectify technical problems, this was phoned in as a whole; it’s clear the studio’s attention is elsewhere.\n\nI Paid: $20\nWorth: $5\n\nGood:\n• Exponentially more fun with more players.\n• Mechanically sound enough to enjoy.\n• Egyptian theme works.\n\nBad:\n• Single player suffers due to co-op emphasis, with brain-dead puzzles.\n• Enemies flash a bright white when hit, resembling a mid-90’s arcade shooter.\n• Visual cues abound when your character’s power meter is full: the HUD animates annoyingly, your character emanates particle effects while idle, and your weapon’s effects change accordingly (as they should).\n•Technically demanding, despite being decidedly last-gen. No single area feels like optimized code.\n\nWorse:\n• Environmental detail exceeds the limits of an isometric vantage point, and as a result breakables and hazards get lost in the intricacy. It’s as though the camera was ripped from a third-person view and perched high above, with no tweaking of the assets from the new distance.\n• The world has no sense of location. You never quite know where you are or should be, despite being constantly told by the HUD and never feeling lost. The tombs feel like the overworld rather than a contained level, causing confusion as to what challenges or collectibles you should be pursuing. Progress and a sense of completion feel oddly disjointed, and then suddenly, you’re at the end. It never gels.\n• Loot system is just terrible, and not worth the incentive.\n\nAdvice for buyers:\nTurn off the ridiculous Depth of Field effect; it’s completely wrong for this style of game and hinders play – a classic example of the industry’s “filter over function” problem.\n\nBFG (Busy Father Gamer)","January 8, 2015","false","28.2"," 31 of 50 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","31","50","0","1"

This is an action puzzle platformer/twin stick shooter from an isometric view.\n\nI say these are the more pure form of tomb raiding compared to the 3rd person action games because they seem to focus more on puzzle solving, of course there is still action and boss battles but these isometric physics based puzzles take you back to a time when puzzle solving was the main draw. But on top of that the action feels really good, really smooth.\n\nNow before anyone goes crazy the reason this game is getting mixed reviews is because its very poorly optimized, it hitches all over the place. Frame drops every ten steps. If you have the ability to play this in a non ported version, I'd do that. But if like me you do not have another device to play this on. The technical issues can be overlooked. The game still feels really good. The hitching is not desirable, it is definitely an issue. I by no means encourage this behavior and do not advocate this level of tolerance from developers or publishers but it the game remains quite playable indeed.\n\nThere is a main map that has entrances to multiple tombs in your quest to reassemble Osiris. Filled with extra challenges throughout. Weapon upgrades, rings and amulet slots to alter the properties your your abilities and items. You can also play up to 4 player co-op.

Poorly optimized, INCREDIBLY BUGGY, lagging as hell, this is the next installment in the highly nominated and amazing first part of the adventure "Lara Croft and the guardian of Light", as many of you know the first game was fun and also clever, you need to shoot as much as you need to think, enemies are not the only obstacule, you need to solve puzzles to get to the very end. If you remember correctly the game was impecable, being the only fault of the game not having a window mode, the very rest of the game in particular was fantastic, this is not the case. LC:TO it's a hideous title in witch you will struggle not to fight the final enemy but to attempt to play with friends and enjoy it (if you get pass the connection problems) and you own a really powerful rig, since having less than "Required" will result in really really low fps (minimum are just a joke, game won't run with that). The game is filled with bugs (and they are not the enemies from the game, but the enemy it's the game itself) and runs with a horrible optimization, it's a shame for all those (like me) that happend to have such a good time playing the first title, and the 4 players coop really grap you tho you're gonna find IMPOSIBLE to make it happend.\n\nMetascore: 24/100","April 21, 2015","false","2.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Guys? Hullo?\nI played Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light on my own and in co-op with my sister. Both times it was a lot of fun. When they announced they were making another one of this series I was pleasantly surprised. Months and months ago we bought this one in one of the earlier deals for a 10er or something.\n\nWhat stupid ♥♥♥♥s we were…\n\nFirst thing I noticed was the horrendous performance with frequent framerate drops down to 35-40 on a GTX 970 OC. A 970! But never mind that. The amazing thing, really, is this: After an hour of playing I literally don’t know how the game is because it doesn’t save. Or rather it does save but doesn’t load the saves. I played the first level three times and now I’m done. Which is kind of sad because, from the twenty minutes of level I’ve seen, this looks like more of what I liked in the first game.\n\nAccording to the forums this save bug is rampant, is well known by Sqeenix, by Crystal Dynamix and by Nixxes $hitware and was even addressed by some devs a couple of times in said forums but nothing has been done. Nothing! No patch, no official workaround, no announcements, no nothing. There are some weird sometimes working, sometimes not working and sometimes suddenly stopping to work workarounds from the community but, you know, ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥. I will not reinstall Steam on C drive or do some savegame ballet every time I start the game or boot my computer.\n\nI normally don’t even think about doing refunds when I buy a bad game but this is something else. This is a product not even working in the utmost basic ways. The question is if I can get up the energy to fight battles with Valve over this since I bought it long before the new refund policy.\n\nSo in conclusion in this state this game is worth less than ♥♥♥♥. And since this state will probably be the state the game will remain in the game will never be of any worth at all. Never. Ever.\n\n\nAlso: ♥♥♥♥ Squeenix for conning people out of their money. Nobody can tell me they didn't know about the savegame issue beforehand or didn't deliberately decide not to fix it. Let's see if they realize that times have changed now when they release their next broken game.","July 5, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

On the face of it, this looks like Guardian of Light but with a higher playercount and a more involved "hub world" between stages, and if it was nothing but that, it'd be pretty good! But then you dig in a little more. One of the first things you might notice if you play co-op and solo is the game doesn't (seem to?) have alternate layouts for SP vs. MP. This was a huge thing in the last title because you needed to be able to solve some puzzles or collect all items - unless I've missed something, though, there are some items which seem 100% uncollectable without death in Temple of Osiris without a second player to toss a grapple or lift you or hold buttons.\n\nOkay, but maybe you don't need all the health-ups or ammo+ powerups. You just want to complete the challenges in each level and earn those rewards. Those still exist on every level, and they're varied and the score targets are still around, so yeah, one little issue's fine if it plays the same overall, right?\n\nThen you come upon a chest.\n\nSee, a lot of your unlock rewards are going to be very... spartan. This is because all those gems you're picking up for score are being counted, and you have to spend them on chests of varying degrees which are an item lottery. Boy, you better believe the chests contain better gear than the challenge rewards, by a huge margin. At one point I gambled and got an "Epic Amulet" - health and ammo regen, higher treasure/refill drop rate, faster bomb speed. The best amulet I'd found from challenges, which I was going out of my way for, near endgame? Treasure drop+ and bomb power+ and it made me weak to cold. (Weapon variants are also locked in the chests, which was a fun surprise but explained why my armory was a bit slim.)\n\nAlright, so some simple bad ideas, but you can just cheat up some cash and turbogrind the chests if you need. Well, that's not gonna fix the bugs. This game is crash-prone and abandoned by its devs, with real common bugs still being inside. Collision issues, some enemies not taking damage reliably*, and once I had a camera hang on I'm not entirely sure what, but it wasn't Lara, making that stage a real pain until I reset (killing my score challenge...)\n\nIt's not good, fellas. The best positive I can bring up about it is "the DLC is implemented pretty smoothly and when I went to look for the extra tombs at endgame, I realized I had already found and done them in the campaign without knowing". Second place is "it has post-game content and challenges", except the very first one of those I did was a combat challenge, and an enemy fell outside of the world, but it had an AOE attack. Cue dying to invisible screams and uninstalling as I write this review. Avoid, please.\n\n* Maybe this one was just me! But oh my word the "bomb them when they're down" lizards refused to respond to damage 99% of the time for me, even if I teabagged them with a friggin' explosive. They'd take 4-5 to kill, and keep in mind this still involved knocking them down first...\n\nedit made because for some reason a completely nonsensical part of this triggered Steam's wordfilter.

I had a quick look at this one before buying it. I knew that it was for up to 4 players coop (I only play in local coop with 2 players). The game will adapt the levels to how many players play the game at the moment....so the tombs will be as challenging with one, 2 or 4 players independently.\n\nI had also noticed that the gameplay was much faster than the predecessor: many enemies on screen, 4 people shooting...well it can get chaotic.\n\nI played through the whole game now, played everything in local 2 player coop....it's great. It is different compared to the predecessor, maybe a bit worse, but not a lot. If you enjoyed 2 player coop in Guardian of light, you will enjoy this one as well. Some puzzles are even harder.

The gameplay is simple and easy to pick and play with multiple people. The graphics are atmospheric and lighting especially creates a warm, immersive environment. The soundtrack is fantastic and is true to the adventerous spirit.\n\nThe game itself is a platforming, puzzle, action, party game that's fun with friends or solo. It has native controller support and the controls are intuitive. The puzzles are fun without being overly intense and the pacing of the game keeps you in the action until the very end. There are plenty of things to collect but the game doesn't smother you with collectables. The combat is fun and the boss encounters are unique. The platforming elements are fun and reminiscent of the classic Tomb Raiders.\n\nThe only qualm I have is that the game seems to crash a lot. In the 8 hours of the main story the game crashed around 20 times. Thankfully, the autosaving and checkpoint system is very generous. Some areas, like the challenge tombs, seemed to elicit crashes more than others.\n\nVery enjoyable game. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed every minute.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomnaut/recommended/289690/","nomnaut","Nomnaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomnaut/","256 products in account",""I don't write reviews on Steam often, but when I do I mean them."\n\nFirst, I was a huge fan of the first. I unlocked everything and 100% the game on the xbox 360. I dabbled lightly in multiplayer, and while fun, it wasn't a major part of the experience for me.\n\nI was ecstatic when I saw that Square (along with Crystal Dynamics) was releasing a second, but all the mixed reviews concerned me.  Here are my impressions of the game (9 hours into the game, approaching the final levels, preliminary run, not going for 100% yet):\n\n- I love it. I loved the first and I love this one. Everything feels polished and well-made. I haven't experienced any serious bugs yet, I'm assuming because I started playing it many months after release, and it's paid off.\n\n- There are some great enemy designs in this. And while not as robust as the first (dinosaurs and jeeps?), they make sense and play well within the atmosphere.\n\n- Some of the level designs are pretty inspired. There are some decent puzzles, though nothing (yet) as incredible and complex as the multiple ball pedestals sequence at the end of the first. Again, I haven't finished this one yet.\n\n- Weapons and sound effects are spot on, essentially carried over from the first, but more fleshed out. There is a nice added twist with maxing out powers and adding elements to your attacks. (was that in the first? because I don't recall).\n\n- Plenty to collect, and it's still fun to mix and match gear to get your desired loadout.\n\n- I love the isometric perspective, camera work, and art. It's great. Granted, I'm biased as a fan of the first, but even objectively, I found some of the views captivating.\n\nI got the game on sale, but as a huge fan of the first, the game would've been worth $20 to me. I still haven't finished the game are gotten 100% yet, but I can see myself finishing everything around the 20-25 hour mark. Then again, I judge games based on quality, not quantity. This feels like a quality game.\n\nNow for some provisos:\n\n- I have yet to touch the multiplayer. Coop or otherwise. It's there, but I don't need it. If I want to play a couch coop game, I feel that Rocket League or Portal 2 would be a better option anyway. Plus, I've always felt this game shines as a single player experience.\n\n- This doesn't "feel" as much like a thinking game as the first. In the first, trying to complete all of the objectives took careful planning and special techniques to earn some of the more difficult rewards. Here, all the objectives I miss on my first playthrough (which there are many), don't seem that difficult (killing enemies with spikes, don't touch hot water) and should be fairly straight forward to earn on subsequent plays of each level. *I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THIS* But it is my initial impression.\n\n- The game is littered with these treasure chests of varying rarity that are opened with the gems you pick up. The chests aren't one time use either, you can just keep opening the same chests, I'm guessing they are necessary considering all the loot in the game, but it's kind of overwhelming. Every corner of the world map will have a chest. The end of a stage will have a dozen chests. I guess if your'e playing with 4 people it makes more sense (and can be more fun as you race people to the chests), but single player, they are not necessary.\n\n- The enemies in the game, I love, but there doesn't seem to be much variety. Skeleton fighters and archers (on fire or not). Alligator warriors, bombers and casters (on fire or not). Scarabs big and small. Two bosses so far. Maybe it's content planned for the DLC, but I would've liked to see more variety built into the base game.\n\n- There are some minor clipping issues in sections, like your ball will bounce oddly or shoot away from your. Certain objects can be jumped through (which shouldn't have been able to). But these are minor issues and don't detract from my experience.\n\nAll in all, I've had a fantastic experience (as a lover of the first) and I'm planning on buying all the DLC when they inevitably do a DLC sale. Oh, and the game runs perfectly smooth on my system, though I'm guessing my specs are overkill.","October 11, 2015","true","11.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

However, this time around the adventure feels less polished, the puzzles far more straight forward, and the co-op interaction stunted.\n\nI played through the game entirely in two player co-op, which was one of the highlights of the first game for me. There are few games that fulfill both action and puzzle-solving in a co-op environment. I was disappointed to find that the puzzle design here is much more simplistic than the intriguing puzzles that made the original such a gem. Even by the end of game we barely broke our stride. Puzzles were mostly straight-forward, often requiring very little actual timing or cooperation.\n\nThere are boss fights with interesting and unique tactics this time around, which felt genuinely fun to experience. It's just a shame this inventiveness never fully carries over into the rest of the puzzles and level design. Diablo-esque random loot systems have been introduced to spice up the game, but instead feels like a hollow grinding chore rather than an exciting "what will I get this time..." thrill. Changing a character's equipment will affect their playstyle (much like the first game), but this time feels more prone to chance with the random loot system than an honest progression.\n\nThe design choice of Egypt is pretty much a go-to when you consider forgotten tombs, gods and lost treasures, and whilst this may be lazy, it is well represented in the game. The story is terrible pulp schlock, whilst the first game was guilty of this too, at least it made it seem fun and like a guilty pleasure, here it feels lazy and tired.\n\nIf you're absolutely desperate for more isometric tomb raiding, this will certainly hit the spot, but it won't satisfy for long. It's a shame this game feels like a miss-step from Guardian of the Light, rather than the sequel it deserved.","August 13, 2015","false","5.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The game seems quite taxing on the system - my videocard heats up to 70C even though it rarely goes up above 40C in other games, there are some slowdowns between cut-scenes and lags that make the game unplayable in multiplayer when there's a lot of things on the screen at the same time like enemies and projectiles.\n\nThe story is plain and dull - you get thrown into underworld and have to reassemble Osiris. Basically its Age of Mythology all over again.\n\nSame as in Guardian of Light each level offers number of challenges and rewards for completing them - there's an overall score challenge (based damage you receive, amount of gems you collect and enemies killed) and some sub-challenges like collecting items or killing foes in specific ways. There is some replay value in levels but not much of it.\n\nThe game gives you dozens of random items outright and even more later on. 99% of them will be completely useless and it would've been better if you could combine, discard or craft them into something more useful. People keep comparing this system to Diablo but in this game items actually hardly matter at all.\n\nThere a several issues i see at the moment - companions are missing from all in game cutscenes if you are playing alone but you can still hear their voices which results in weird and awkward feeling. Camera in multiplayer is extremely jittery. Basically it tries to follow every single person which makes it almost unplayable and very confusing. They should've allowed to focus camera on your character only. Also characters appear very small in multiplayer, not as small as in Gauntlet but small enough to get confusing, especially with that jittery camera issue.\n\nUnfortunately "drop-in-drop-out" system isn't that good either - people can't just come and go and level has to be started from the last checkpoint while you are forced to wait on the loading screen. Waiting for 3 players straight might actually get frustrating and boring.\n\nThe game got decent controller support. It keeps rumbling every second, like when you shoot or when bosses walk, when you take damage, when you use light staff or detonate bombs. Overall using controller seems quite pleasurable. It is kinda hard to roll and place bombs at the same time though.\n\nI can recommend this as a decent single player puzzle game i suppose but if you want to play with your friends - you should probably wait for a couple of patches.\n\nUpd:\n\nIt took me less than 14 hours to complete single player and every single challenge in every tomb. I've got all of the achievements except couple in multiplayer. So the single player is kinda short.\n\nI've tried playing multiplayer some more but its really... really bugged. Players frequently crash, items keep getting messed up (sometimes staff gets replaced by guns you can't get it back until you restart). Its also hard to distinguish between players and it takes too long to wait for everyone to load/drop out/start etc. etc.\n\nIm sure that there are some more hours left in a replay value, since puzzles change when you play with more people but its just not worth it. You really need dedicated people with decent PC's to do that.\n\nUpd x2:\n\nBeen some time. The game hasn't been updated, multiplayer is still unplayable, no new content, no rewards for "seasons pass". Nothing.

I despised the new 2013 TR game and the whiny Lara. I loved Anniversary and regularly clear it 100% over again. Though I was sad we don't really see Egypt much more, this one game raised my expectations. Improved gameplay over Guardian Of Light? Anniversary Lara? Return to Egypt? Pseudo retelling of Tomb Raider IV's story? Count me in!\n\nI got this game for my birthday, and, sadly, the horrible reality that Square Enix made for us is that this game on PC is most definitely the Xbox One port, formatted into an .EXE. The game is locked to work on my laptop's integrated graphics chipset, meaning, I never go past 25 FPS at best ( I hover around 17 ). And, no, the game ignores and overrides whatever parameters you set in your Nvidia/local control panel.\n\nThere is an uselessly high ammount of social networking inside, some game settings are strange ( window mode is locked on 1600x900 or something ), but, the game being dead unplayable due to rendering lag AND input lag ( a considerable ammount of it which apparently evaporates away if you use an Xbox 360 controller ), the ingame buttons being referenced to as Xbox controls, the horrendous PC performance, encrypted settings/config file, and Square's recent trend to go and do surprise parties with Microsoft leaves me to believe that this is an outrageous sabotaged release meant to act as a giant, stinking advertising : "Go  buy an Xbox One!".\n\nI could not play the game. I wish I could. Money was put into this thing. I paid for it, and I cannot enjoy it the slightest.\nThe only redeeming quality I can give so far is the OST. I wish I could give a proper review. I really wish. This game has so much potential, yet it's completely wasted by corporate greed and collaborative attempt to give more crowd to the Xbox. A desperate, crony, offending attempt. Such moves should be forbidden.\n\nI do not recommend buying this game until at least a patch is done so the game no longer intentionally selects your lowest GPU to run on, and that the input refresh rate for the keyboard is restored to normal PC standards.\n\nIn the meantime, there are plenty of TRLE/NGLE third party adventures to find and play through. They will keep me busy until then.","December 10, 2014","false","0.4"," 30 of 60 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","30","60","0","2"

I played 3h and made some good progress.  Usually I'm not the puzzle game player but in my opinion this game is a good mix between puzzles (not really hard ones tbh) and some action.\n\nThe reason for the negative review is simple. After 3h of playing I closed the game. When I started it again, my save game was not there. 3h of progress lost.\n\nAfter researching on how to fix the problem, I found an entry in the steam forum from 9 Dec, 2014.

The vast majority of your experience will be dedicated to solving (relatively basic) puzzles which scale with the number of players (in this case up to 4), allowing for slightly dynamic re-takes on the same puzzles and situations you faced in multiplayer.  These, like in other coop puzzle games, require coordination and patience.\n\nFrom a player point of view I would highly recommend this.  Yes, it's a console port (and the direction keys needing to be pressed in combinations of W/W+D/D/D+S/S/A+S/A/W+A will betray this frequently, but it isn't that bad, and if you own a controller you can completely mitigate that issue easily enough.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, liked the original, enjoyed FORCED, or even enjoyed games like Trine and want something a bit more to play with the brain switched on, buy this.","December 10, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's a lot like Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.  So if you liked Guardian of Light you love this one.  In this game Lara isn't alone.  She has companions with her.  If you're playing single-player you'll be playing Lara going solo.  If you play multi-player then other players can control the other characters.  At the time of this writing I haven't played multiplayer so I can't say much about it.  But the storyline, graphics, gameplay and feel of adventure is all very good.  It's hard to stop playing once you really get into it.

Just like GOL, Temple of Osiris is a fun action packed arcade shooter with flourishes of puzzles and challenges. However, there are a few noticeable improvements from the first. First being Temple of Osiris is more open and works in hubs (rather than chapters) just like the Tomb Raider reboot which allows the game to implement the main pillar of exploration from the main series. Secondly, the game improves on its loots system giving more meaning to the gems scattered throughout the world as you can use them to open chests to gain access to new powerups and legendary weapons. On top of that you have the ability to change the time of day and the weather which also works alongside the loot system as certain weapons/powerups only work in certain conditions such as night-time.  The game also has a lot more post game content as these different weather/day-night cycles change the world around Lara and the other characters meaning in different conditions different challenges and puzzles will appear giving more for the player to do rather than just going through the tombs completing challenges just like the first game. The only real negative of Temple of Osiris is that the puzzles aren’t always as inventive or as challenge as the original. However, the game is still fun the nonetheless and I highly recommend it.","February 9, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I wanted to like it as I liked LC:GoL, but it's too messed up and buggy, at least the PC version is.\nThe graphics are seemingly "better" but the perspective is worse and it's actually even harder to control Lara. Sometimes she wouldn't move at all and seem like she was stuck at a corner because the game expects her to move away from it in another direction first before she can move around the corner, sometimes she would actually BE stuck after she'd just climbed up a ledge or jumped onto some object (and the only way to continue was to commit suicide), sometimes she would run crazy fast and right down into the next chasm or whatever.\nAlso, controls are generally chunky and not immersive at all, and her movements are odd. Contrary to the controls in GoL, there's a constant impression that she glides and slips more than she actually moves, and it's hard to get her to move from the spot she stands in and exactly in one specific direction (of the 8 she can move in), so she sometimes moves too far away into the wrong direction first, or she jumps into the wrong direction.\nThe game also crashes every few minutes, though luckily it autosaves pretty often, so I didn't lose a lot of progress but I lost much of my interest in playing it.\nThe "puzzles" aren't hard to understand at all, but the exploding balls in particular and in combination with those weird controls, pretty much made it impossible to finish some of them. I simply grew tired of repeating the same 2 minutes over and over and dying to some weird unforseeable or buggy crap. At one point, I died about 50 times, often just short of the fraction of a second (and yes, I did it the way it was supposed to be done), then I gave up. I couldn't solve it and I couldn't go back or leave the tomb or anything, so I simply quit.\n\nGuardian of Light was way easier and way more fun to play, and its "puzzles" were a lot less aggravating.\nTemple of Osiris music was good (as was GoL's) and graphics seemed moderately appealing too, though its engine obviously wasn't made for the PC keyboard+mouse controls. GoL's controls were off-key too, but at least not nearly as much as ToO's.","February 13","false","76.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

In 3 player local mode, the boys were using Logitech gamepads while I used the good ol' keyboard/mouse.   I found character movement with keyboard a bit difficult especially when needing to tightrope or hanging from cliffs and ledges.  However character movements with the gamepads were a breeze.\n\nI've noticed that other reviewers experienced bugs and game freezing.  My experience has been rather different.  In 13 hours of gameplay we have had no problems whatsoever.  All boss encounters, trash mobs, and puzzle solutions seemed to work as the developers intended.\nI will note that I'm running Windows 10 along with AMD cpu and gpu.\n\nThe actual gameplay was quite fluid and well paced.  There could have been more interesting loot to be had, however the weapon upgrades were great.  I found the flamethrower endlessly satisfying :)\n\nWeakness:  Don't expect to be hugely challenged.   An 8 and 9 year old were fully engaged, however an adult probably won't break a sweat at any point.\n\nNever got the "Find Match" feature to actually find someone.  I suspect that's due to a rather small community.\n\nThis is my biggest complaint about the game - you can only maintain 1 saved game at a time.  I thought when the kids went to bed I'd start my own 1 player game on the side, but no.  I couldn't do that without blowing away the 3 player game we had going.\n\nIn the end would I recommend this games?  For sure.  It's a pretty good time and for 5 bucks you really can't go wrong...at least while the sale lasts.\n","February 11","true","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Now we're exploring some tombs in Egypt, and the graphics are ASTOUNDING for a top-down shooter. Last time around the graphics were a little on the "cartoony" side, but this time there is a lot of detail and the close-ups of the models are great as well.\n\nGameplay is pretty much the same (I don't know if there's anything new in co-op) with the exception of Lara now having a torch and the staff of Osiris, which help you get more gems and allow you to complete puzzles, respectively.\n\nAnd this time there's a hub! It seemed very out of place at first, but they made it work really well. You just walk straight into levels from the hub (with a hidden loading screen in between, of course) and there's actually a LOT to do in it. You can actually use your gems now to open up chests that will give you some random equipment (with the more gems you spend getting you more rare items), you can collect the optional red skulls in the hub, and at times when you progress to the next levels there are little action segments that take place in the hub, making it feel more connected.\n\nOverall this is a big step forward from Guardian of Light and solidifies itself as a must-buy rather than the impulse-buy Guardian of Light was. $20 is a bargain for this.","December 9, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Resulting in opening only a few of the many, many, many chests you run across.  Something's out of balance.\n\nThe CONs:- The game felt "dragged on" / tedious.\n- I didn't like the map/layout of how you progressed through the game.  ie: the main world you run around to get to the various tombs.\n- You're location is not on the map.  The map doesn't show where you are on it so when leaving a tomb, I accidentally re-entered the tomb I just left.  I tried Exiting, and Continuing, but that took me back into the tomb!  Thankfully the tomb wasn't that big, but I still had to do that one twice!\n\nOverall:  I recommend it for just those who like the Tomb Raider environment and characters, but beyond that, this is at-best just a forgettable "ok" game.  6.5 out of 10.","February 18","true","7.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'm still unsure if it's an improvement over Temple of Light; however, Temple of Osiris is a different beast in many other ways. The combat is still solid, and Crystal Dynamics introduced a mini loot system that continually refreshes the combat. That said, the game seems a bit easy (and gets easier as your arsenal increases). I really wish there was a hardcore mode or something to up the challenge or garner interest in a second playthrough. This is Tomb Raider, after all, so there are a fair amount of semi-challenging puzzles. The gunplay seems to outshine the puzzle solving, but that's ok given this title is not trying to be overly ambituous.\n\nThe game also times you on your completion of each tomb. Your time is uploaded to a master server where you can compare your completion times against your friends or the community's. Sadly, it seem there is cheating/hacking out there, so the system is effectively broken. I suppose its original intention was to get you to retry the same area over and over, but dangling that carrot from the stick fails here. Nice try though....\n\nThe single player story is paper thin, but there is a multiplayer co-op component to make up for it. The artwork is pretty damned good. Overall, I think Crystal Dynamics delivered and then some on the aesthetics. They always seem to do a good job keeping this franchise fresh an interesting. Value-wise? Totally worth the $15 or so spent.","February 28, 2015","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It requires effectivelly a more powerfull/expensive based PC with a Direct X 11 capable Graphic card only to run :-().

Overall I've only just started but I can tell they did a very, very good job on this.  I fully recommend the game along with the season pass.  If your iffy about it just grab the last one it has similar elements.. but takes place in Mayan type jungles.

Unlike the first game, where gems simply "fall in place" when you destroy a container, the gems in this game will "fly" off in various directions. Considering you need to get a certain score to unlock the various challenges & weapon rewards, this means your "points" have a high chance of flying off ledges, becoming unobtainable. This is pretty infuriating, as you ability to complete the score challenges becomes a coin toss. Can you get enough gems? Who friggin' knows.\n\n+ In the first game, the controls were extremely smooth, fluid, and responsive. In this game, they are far worse - much less responsive, and more "heavy" or "sticky." Combined with the above issues, any gems that are sitting on precarious ledges or a fraction of an inch from a trap are much more difficult to grab, as the amount of "weight" you have to put into a movement key can fling you off a ledge, or into a trap.\n\nAfter roughly 3 hours - and having come nowhere close to completing the game, all the challenges, and gathering all the rewards (something I did in entirety in the first game, and was glad to do so) - I had to call it quits.","October 29, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me it's quite enjoyable. I haven't experienced any major bugs or performance issues. Puzzles are nice, though they are not very sophisticated. With the help of friends you can beat them easily, but on solo you need to work a bit more.\n\nCombats are engaging but bosses are mostly easy. The game gives a casual feel and has no difficulty setting (unless you want to complete the challenges, in that case it can be nearly impossible especially the no-damage challenges.) There are vastly different types of arsenals and items you can collect and buy with your gems, making replaying the game not entirely pointless.\n\nGraphically it looks nice and uses the same engine as Tomb Raider 2013. Story and casting are mediocre, but for a casual game you might as well forget about them. However the game satisfies me greatly that it uses 'matured' Lara instead of young Lara like in modern TR games. It reminds me how awesome she is as a tomb raider.\n\nMy verdict: 7/10. Get in on sale if you still have doubt. But as a TR fan, you shouldn't miss it.","January 9","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike the first game, where gems simply "fall in place" when you destroy a container, the gems in this game will "fly" off in various directions. Considering you need to get a certain score to unlock the various challenges & weapon rewards, this means your "points" have a high chance of flying off ledges, becoming unobtainable. This is pretty infuriating, as you ability to complete the score challenges becomes a coin toss. Can you get enough gems? Who friggin' knows.\n\n+ In the first game, the controls were extremely smooth, fluid, and responsive. In this game, they are far worse - much less responsive, and more "heavy" or "sticky." Combined with the above issues, any gems that are sitting on precarious ledges or a fraction of an inch from a trap are much more difficult to grab, as the amount of "weight" you have to put into a movement key can fling you off a ledge, or into a trap.\n\nAfter roughly 3 hours - and having come nowhere close to completing the game, all the challenges, and gathering all the rewards (something I did in entirety in the first game, and was glad to do so) - I had to call it quits.","October 29, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is pretty much the weaker, worse version than its prequel. The graphics seemed downgraded. The controls are the same as the previous game, but there are certain levels that have you running at angles that are awkward and uncomfortable to play on a keyboard – that didn’t happen in Guardian of Light. There are lots of bugs that left my game crashing. The plotline, while Egyptian based now instead of Greek as in the prequel, felt essentially the same.\n\nOverall, it was fun and entertaining, but it left quite a bit desired.

For me it's quite enjoyable. I haven't experienced any major bugs or performance issues. Puzzles are nice, though they are not very sophisticated. With the help of friends you can beat them easily, but on solo you need to work a bit more.\n\nCombats are engaging but bosses are mostly easy. The game gives a casual feel and has no difficulty setting (unless you want to complete the challenges, in that case it can be nearly impossible especially the no-damage challenges.) There are vastly different types of arsenals and items you can collect and buy with your gems, making replaying the game not entirely pointless.\n\nGraphically it looks nice and uses the same engine as Tomb Raider 2013. Story and casting are mediocre, but for a casual game you might as well forget about them. However the game satisfies me greatly that it uses 'matured' Lara instead of young Lara like in modern TR games. It reminds me how awesome she is as a tomb raider.\n\nMy verdict: 7/10. Get in on sale if you still have doubt. But as a TR fan, you shouldn't miss it.","January 9","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
