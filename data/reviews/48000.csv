Its very simple mechanics make it quite an interesting game. You start off with no idea of what's happening, no back story, no one popping up telling you "USE TEH ARROW KEYZ TO MOVE." It just throws you in the game, basically telling you, "you figure it out. You're smart, right?" Each time you fail a puzzle at first, you learn from your mistake how to go at it in a different approach. It's a fun little game that's a good game for reminiscing about simpler game times.","November 29, 2013","true","4.3"," 244 of 285 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","244","285","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/recommended/48000/","Luna_Nyx","♥ Gia ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/","398 products in account","LIMBO is one of those 2-D platformer games with puzzle elements. You know, those games where you keep having to solve puzzles here and there moving objects, like crates, rocks, even dead bodies and deadly traps. I got this a long time ago, and this is the first time I actually tried playing this after casually "finding" it again in my library.\n\nPros:\n\n+ The controls are nice (I used a controller myself.), it feels intuitive and doesn't really ♥♥♥♥ you over with high gravity or slippery floors. It's kinda fast paced and doesn't force you to do ridiculous jumps all the time like SMB or Electronic Super Joy.\n\n+ The soundtrack consists mostly of ambient noise and fragments of something that sounds like a song here and there. I enjoy it myself, being in this shadowy world that's completely in silence really helps to build up the atmosphere. Sometimes the music gets louder, sometimes it's in complete silence (Usually before something bad happens.)\n\n+ Perhaps the thing I love the most about this game. The visuals; The whole world is black and white, with some kind of mist in the background. The characters are nothing but mere shadows, even the protagonist is a kid shrouded in shadows with just his eyes glowing. The world is gorgeous in a depressing way, after all, you're in Limbo. Forests, industrial areas, caves, lakes, even something that looks like a city. Rain pours down on you at some point, and it's nice and soothing. I really like the art style of this game. It's kinda gory too, your character can die in a wide array of painful deaths. Some are quite gory. Still, it's all in black and white, you'll see the shadows of your intestines.\n\n+ The world itself. This might count towards the visuals, though. This game is quite somber, and really atmospheric. You're adventuring into the unknown, and you'll find all kinds of weird stuff along the way. You'll find corpses all around, some of them suicide victims. Even the living beings in Limbo are hostile towards you. It truly is a cold and unforgiving world.\n\nNeutral:\n\n+/- This game gets quite challenging later on. This might be a con for some, a pro for others. Personally, I enjoy it myself. You simply CAN'T finish this game without dying quite a few times on the first run, because they game changes its rules at times, teases you, punishes you for taking the "easy" route. Sometimes, deaths are swift and gory, with less than a second to react. This game is a lot of trial and error, just like you'd expect from a game like this.\n\n-/+ Another pro for some, con for others. This game is quite short. Puzzles are time consuming, and I dare to say, frustrating often, specially near the end of the game. Unless you use a guide, you might get stuck in there for a while. But if you know what to do and you don't die that often, you can easily finish this game in a couple of hours.\n\nCons:\n\n-  The trial and error IS unforgiving near the end. I personally enjoy this, again, but there are some parts where the game goes too far. I specially hate puzzles where your timing and positioning's gotta be spot on, or else you won't make it. This is INCREDIBLY frustrating if you're trying to get one of the game achievements, where you gotta die less than 5 times and finish the game in a single sitting. Sometimes, you know what to do, you know what to expect, but you were a few pixels away from the ideal position, and less than a second off. There, you're dead. I enjoy games that kick your ♥♥♥ with cheap deaths here and there, but I know lots of people would feel discouraged by this.\n\n- I won't tell you exactly what happens near the end, but you might not like it if you were expecting something amazing to happen. The journey was worth it for me. But the ending felt kinda weak.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend picking this game up in a sale. If you are into puzzle/platformer games (I am not, sadly. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed), this is quite an interersting title. The visuals and ambience alone are worth it for me, and the game's short enough for me to avoid giving up in frustration before completing it.","February 20","true","10.2"," 78 of 83 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","78","83","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/48000/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","LIMBO is a puzzle platformer indie title released in mid 2010. It was originally released as an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive, before eventually moving to the PlayStation and PC in 2011, it latter got  another port to PlayStation Vita and iOS, and yet another one onto the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, this goes to show just how popular this game is and how well received of a title it was.\n\nThis is a 2D side scroller platformer which uses the Box2D physics engine, which you may of heard of because it is also used in Angry Birds, and plenty of online Flash Games.  You play as a young boy, and travel through the world filled with dangers and traps as you search for your lost sister.  The puzzles in this game have a very trial and error theme to them. You probably will die a few times on the puzzles before you figure out the correct way of doing it. Each death comes with a horrific image of the poor boys rag dolled body plummet, get chopped up, speared, drowned, pretty much any sort of tragic death, this poor lad will go through it all.\n\nThe graphics are very simple, but very elegantly produced. Its a 2D side scroller so don't expect to see mind blowing realistic graphics; what LIMBO offers is beautifully crafted black and white tones. it is amazing how much atmosphere is generated just from the colour tones alone. The use of light and grain effects really create a spooky atmoshphere which alot of games try to produce but fail to capture as well as LIMBO.  This game is often used as an example that videos games should be classed as a form of art.\n\nLIMBO has a very open ended story; the main plot is you are trying to find your lost little sister; and that's about as much information as you get. I don't want to spoil the ending too much, but I was a LITTLE bit disappointed with it and I really hope that there might be a sequel eventually to this game to find out more.\n\nThere is next to no audio in the game, and no music. All of the sound effects are very minimalist, this fits in well with the spooky atmosphere which is being created, and probably makes it feel all that more eerie\n\nA couple of puzzles in LIMBO had me scratching my head quite a bit before I was finally able to figure out what to do. I would warn you - there is a lot of jumping style puzzles and platforming events to get through. In my opinion, jumping puzzles are the worst, but they obviously have to be in platforming games so I just had to battle on through. The game does offer a very good respawn/checkpoint system though. If you die, you won't end up miles and miles behind where you just were, you'll normally spawn right before you messed up to let you try again - this made the trial and error mechanic work so much better as you don't have to replay content you have just got past.\n\nThis game's world is so well made, yet it doesn't have anything to interact with other than the puzzles, the minimalist theme keeps you on track the whole time, and you have little chance to explore off the track, simply because there is nothing to explore, it's a one track minded game, essentially you need to get from A to B, and you cannot come off the track. That's not necessarily a bad thing; games these days are often too "open world" style, and often overwhelm the player with too much to see. I liked how LIMBO kept me focused on the task at hand, which was the puzzles and progressing through the dark world I was in.\n\nTo play LIMBO from start to finish, it took me just under eight hours. That felt like the perfect length for the game, I would of liked to see a little more of the plot unfold, but it does leave it open ended for a possible sequel in the future. I see little reason to play it through more than once. It's 100% linear, and you will always end up with the same outcome and even the puzzles don't have more than one way to complete them, so unless you want to go achievement hunting, there is no reason to replay LIMBO.\n\nLIMBO is certainly a highly popular game, and is so for good reason. The game does very little wrong in any of the criteria, and it showcases just how an indie game should be developed and published. The game has gone from strength to strength since being released on Xbox Live, and it still alive and kicking on the current gen consoles. For the price of £6,99, you are getting a simply amazing game.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

What I cannot really stand is its illogical way to present the puzzles, as to the player is rarely given the opportunity to recognize a danger and work out for a solution. The whole game is just a repetitive exercise of attempt->death->retry->death->solution found->new death. The death in LIMBO is not a punishment for the player's mistake, but the only possibility to find the solution to a puzzle. Frustration above satisfaction, you'll never solve a puzzle because you're good, but because you died enough to understand the only way to pass a section of the level. Praises go to the art style and to the atmosphere, and to the decision to have merciful checkpoints.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jay720/recommended/48000/","Jay720","720","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jay720/","199 products in account","LIMBO is a superlative illustration of a dystopian world. Nightmares turn into reality for a small boy who wakes up in this pitch-black cataclysm. With nothing to tell him where to go or what to do, he wanders forth into the unknown.\n\nFrom the short introduction into the boy's predicament, the shadows and darkness encroach him in a perfect noir setting. The graphics are simple, but compliment the setting impeccably. The game runs perfectly on any machine, and never leaves a steady frame rate, running at 60 frames per second on higher-performance machines.\n\nSound effects in LIMBO are stunning. An eerie atmospheric stereo soundtrack sounds so realistic with headphones, it's almost like you are in the game. Water, footsteps and enemies sound mysterious and create a mood that both intrigues and repels, which is a rarity in video game soundtracks.\n\nLIMBO's story is one of mystery. The solemn-looking boy has no words, but at the same time he can convey a meaningful message of despair and sorrow. His agility is quite good, even if his jump is somewhat feeble. The platforming elements of LIMBO are simple, but work wonderfully. Ladders, boats and vines are utilised in obvious but unique ways, and makes gameplay different after every stage. Enemies are not the only threat in LIMBO. Yes, there is a giant spider, but you can die just as much by this than a gap in the floor or vicious spikes protruding out of the ground in hap-hazard directions. Death is everywhere in LIMBO, and the scene painted by Playdead is definitely bone-chilling.\n\nIn my opinion, LIMBO is a wonderfully dark portrait of a universe that both frightens and invites. LIMBO is definitely melancholy, but its wonderful mechanics, story, sounds and controls combine to create a game that should be a must-have for anyone who enjoys an unknown adventure. LIMBO's world left me speechless, but at the same time I wouldn't hesitate to dive into its hellish depths again.","October 16, 2014","true","6.1"," 65 of 81 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","65","81","2","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/48000/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","We, as gamers have grown, but you know what, so have games! And they seem to be evolving on many fronts and in many different directions. Playdead the studio behind the Xbox 360 title LIMBO, has given us an example of how far games can go as an art form. No, this is not "just another platformer". Anyone who dives into LIMBO's arty, black-and-white world, will surely find a good reason to stay. The gameplay itself might be a tad reminiscent of other puzzle-flavored platform classics such as Another World, and even recent titles such as Super Meat Boy and Trine. Heart of Darkness also comes to mind. Even so, LIMBO has a feel of its own.\n\nThe central character, a small pale-eyed kid, awakens alone in a murky forest, surrounded by massive trees and a few wondering animals (maggots, tiny butterflies and so on).This is what marks the player's first step into the sinister world of LIMBO. No fancy story, no complex sci-fi universe, no pompous character outlines, no feeble voice-overs... just the tranquil sounds of the deep, black forest. However, as soon as our tiny hero sets out, those tranquil sounds soon transform into a range of rather unsettling noises. Stepping into LIMBO is rather like entering a bleak world of shadows, with but a few flickering light sources that barely manage to outline the silhouettes of nearby objects and creatures.\n\nThe creepy forest is no place for a little boy, so it's best to help him get out of danger as soon as possible. LIMBO's perilous dim environment will have you facing dangers around every corner and almost every step could lead our petite hero into a perfectly laid trap. If he isn't cut by exceedingly sharp bear traps or sliced to bits by spinning razor blades, he'll mostly likely run into a blood-thirsty creature. The game throws the player into a series of tough situations where the main character has to fight for his life against overwhelming odds. The game often requires you to get out of these situations by thinking and reacting swiftly, otherwise the cute little boy may get chopped to bits or eaten by something unpleasant.\n\nWhat's unique about this game is the way it progressively throws different problems your way, without warning and yet somehow always leaves enough time and space for you to solve things on your own. Each step forward tosses you into bigger dangers and tougher physics-based puzzles, in turn may lead to even greater challenges. That's right, physics play an important role as you attempt get out of a range of difficult situations. The puzzles rarely feel repetitive, which was a Godsend. There was an obvious effort by the developers to constantly present something new and unexpected for the player. As a result, the game becomes a joy to play.\n\nIt's even more fun to watch and listen, because of its stylish graphics and equally effective audio backdrop. Again, this game doesn't feature fancy graphics, epic soundtracks or a massive cast of top-rated voice actors. Every time a melody starts swelling in the background, that usually means you're in trouble. The ambient music is a perfect match for the game's distinctive art style.\n\nThis independently developed title deserves a spot among its many triple-A counterparts, largely because it succeeds in grabbing the attention of both hardcore gamers, as much as those who prefer casual gaming. This highly appealing indie game craves more content though. Well, just more levels, really. Nothing more. It ends to damn quickly. And that's about the only thing I could find wrong with it.\n\nLIMBO may seem like a small ripple in a giant ocean of games, but from where I'm standing, this tiny ripple could easily steer us towards new heights, as games continue to evolve as an art form. It immerses players almost effortlessly thanks to its sleek design and delightfully subtle lighting effects and creepy-looking shadows. LIMBO represents a skillful blend of puzzle-based gameplay mechanics and unique visuals. There isn't an aspect of this game that feels redundant or flimsy. Even though the game left me hungry for more challenges and an altogether lengthier experience, I still see this one as a classic that shouldn't be missed out on.","October 19, 2015","true","28.4"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","47","53","11","0"

LIMBO is a game which keeps you guessing with interesting puzzles, complex scenarios, and an intriguing story. The games artistic styling’s does not seem cheap, but rather creates an ambience that makes LIMBO seem rather elegant.\n\nSummary:\nLIMBO is a side scroller where you play a young boy who is on an adventure to seek his missing sister. The game is a platform game with integrated puzzles to solve in order to progress through to the next part of the game. The grey-tone of the game creates a rather fearful and discerning environment where a gruesome fate looks poetic. The game gets progressively harder and the puzzles become more challenging as you progress, although once you get a hang of the game you'll figure out it’s not too difficult. You meet many challenges along the way from rising water levels, monsters that force you in a direction, rope swinging, traps, and more that keep you on your toes. LIMBO is a great game which offers fantastic yet horrific scenery, music, and ambience. The game keeps you on your toes and the clever grayscale art style allows a rather terrifying world to be poetic.\n\nControls:\nMy major gripe about this game was the control system. Although, I write a lot about this, it is actually a rather minuscule problem and doesn't at all ruin the games experience. You cannot edit the controls from inside the game, because the developers decided not to allow key-mapping within the games interface you must exit the game and edit the settings file within the LIMBO steamapps folder. The controls are worse because the jump command which is listed in the settings file is not an actual command in the game; there are only five commands: Left, Right, Up, Down, and Use. There are no resolution settings, so if you are using an odd resolution you may have problems playing this game. The one complaint I have towards this game is that character doesn't always respond well to the controls, which causes a lot of deaths that could easily be avoided if the character control system was better.\n\nGameplay Hints:\n>When you get a brain slug running under the light allows you to turn the other direction.\n>The "up" key (mine was W) is not a jump key, it moves you up and coincidently this means you jump with it. When gravity field reverses you must use the "down" key (S) rather than "up" key (W) to jump as you are moving down.\n>Do not hold the "up" key while on a rope as if you do clicking the "left" or "right" key will jump you off the rope. If you are not holding the "up" key then you will just swing left and right gaining momentum.\n\nResults:\nOverall this game is a fun, the puzzles are challenging, difficulty curve is smooth, scenery is fabulous, ambience is frighteningly amazing, gameplay is elegant, and the symbolism makes the story phenomenal. I would completely recommend this game. I purchased it at a discount, but if I knew it was this fun I would have paid full price.\n\nPros:\n+Amazing environment\n+Great level design\n+Challenging puzzles\n+Mysterious and freaky ambience\n+Fun achievements\n+Great checkpoint system\n+Beautiful story\n+Not too long, but not too short\n+Very fun secret achievement\n\nCons:\n-No key mapping within the actual game\n-No resolution settings\n-Poor character control (it is not too bad once you get used to it, but at first its hard to get used to)","March 24, 2014","true","6.0"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","0"

The game in motion is a sight to behold and if you enjoy any kind of black and white art this game will most likely satisfy your chiaroscuro fancies a plenty.\n\nThe puzzle platforming itself is nice and varied and entertaining throughout and though a game such as this doesn't lend itself to much replayability the initial 5 hours or so it takes to finish the game are well worth the modest price of the game if you enjoy the genre and the beautiful if macabre setting and art direction.

The games I enjoy are called Indie Games. Some notable examples of popular Indie Games are Minecraft and Garry’s Mod. Indie developers have deadlines but also much more freedom with their projects. This is the reason why I love Indie Games, because of their innovation and artistic influence without consequence. LIMBO is a great example of what indie games can be.\n\nYou probably can already tell from my screenshots of LIMBO that it is really great to look at. This well-regarded Indie Game, developed by Playdead, has an incredible art style that makes the world you play in feel dark and mysterious. LIMBO is very atmospheric. It has subtle yet realistic sound design with an ambient soundtrack to compliment the feeling of loneliness throughout the game.\n\nFrom the start, you already notice that the world of LIMBO is a place that doesn’t want you to be there. Everything around you can, or wants, to burn, stab, smash or simply kill you in this disturbing land.  You will die a lot when playing LIMBO. The game is almost centered around that fact that you die so much. You only see how traps work when you get stuck in them the first time. Trial by death is a good way to describe this form of gameplay. This world might even test your bravery when solving morbid puzzles. Sometimes you might have to drag a dead body of a child who drowned in a lake to set off a trap so you can continue your adventure, or sometimes you might have to rip off an almost-dead giant spider’s remaining limb so it won’t attack you when you roll it into a pit of spikes.\n\nIn my opinion, the best thing about LIMBO is it’s unique storytelling. There are no cutscenes or loading screens to disrupt your experience while playing the game. There is no dialogue or text for you to read, so everything is up to how you perceive the game. You only really meet a few people in this world, but they don’t last in LIMBO for more than a chapter. LIMBO never really tells you anything about what is going on, only that you have to find your sister. In my opinion, this is an ingenious way to tell a story. Everything that takes place in the game is up to you to think about what it means. Because of this, you become more immersed in the world.\n\n\nLike all good things, LIMBO has to eventually come to an end, but oh boy, does this game have a great finale. Probably the best thing about this game is its ending. Now, I really don’t want to spoil it, but all I will say is that I am still pondering what it means. You might just have to play the ending over and over to get some small clues about it, but LIMBO and its developers never tell you directly what it means. That is why it is so intriguing, and one of the main reasons why I keep revisiting this game.\nLIMBO is the perfect game to play if you want to get into the Indie Game community. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story, art and atmosphere. There are many disturbing scenes, but all of it is silhouetted, so you don’t see too much detail. Surprisingly, the puzzles that appear in LIMBO aren’t too frustrating since the gameplay is based around failure. LIMBO is only $5.00 on the App Store or on Steam, but you can get the special edition if you want to support the developers. I assure you that playing LIMBO is an experience you will not forget.\n\n\n\n\nYou can read my full review that contains an interview with the main animator of Playdead's upcoming game INSIDE if you really want to I dont even\n","November 7, 2014","true","9.2"," 46 of 67 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","46","67","0","0"

The game is actually about as bare bones as it gets when it comes to both game mechanics and visuals yet it’s the simplicity that makes the game a truly amazing gaming experience. Limbo is a 2D puzzle platformer game that puts you in control of a silent young boy who finds himself in a dark, mysterious, incredibly dangerous, forest where everyone and everything is out to get him.\n\nThe game boasts a gorgeous black and white atmospheric art style that perfectly portrays the emotion filled nightmare of a world that you have been placed in. The eerie sounds pair perfectly with the creepy visuals to completely immerse in in the beautifully designed levels. The game makes sure not to distract you from the gorgeous simplicity, as there are no interrupting cut scenes, dialogue, HUD, or tutorial, from start to finish the game is one seamless experience.\n\nAs you control the young boy you are limited to simply ‘jump’ and pushing or pulling of various objects, so to say you’re defenseless against the creepy crawlers that lurk in the dark would be an understatement. You must use your wits and react quickly to out maneuver and outsmart the faster, stronger enemies who wait around every corner. The controls are tight and precise and the physics are realistic, there won’t come a time when you die from missing a jump and feel like you were robbed.\n\nThe puzzles get progressively harder and harder throughout the game, however there was only one time that I became too frustrated with the game and had to take a short break. The game isn’t difficult per se, however you will die a lot, the game will kill you with what are seemingly cheap deaths just for the sake of killing you, but each death is meant as a learning experience, and you won’t be too badly punished as the game re-spawns you within feet from where you died. This type of “trial by error” gameplay teaches you how the environment around you responds to your actions without having to include an obnoxious, intrusive tutorial to hold your hand through the game.\n\nOverall the game is relatively short and shouldn’t take any longer than 3-4 hours to complete from start to finish. But don’t let the short play time discourage you from picking up this absolute gem of a game or you could easily miss out on one of the finest platforming experiences available on PC.\n\nThe beauty and simplicity of the game is what makes Limbo feel so refreshing, the beautiful art style and magnificently eerie environment will completely immerse you in this demented, mysterious, world. The controls are spot on and the puzzles are challenging enough that you will feel accomplished when you complete one. Limbo is a seamless masterpiece from start to finish with the only downside being that you’ll keep craving more.\n\n","February 5, 2015","true","4.6"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

Limbo has a unique, eerie atmosphere that usually characterises the horror genre. The atmosphere is the result of the dark (black and white) presentation and the lack of music throughout the adventure.\n\nIt is one of those trial-and-error games where in order to successfully solve a puzzle in many cases you either need to react quickly or you have only one chance for a perfect execution. If you fail you can start all over from the previous checkpoint and you should also watch how the boy dies (often in quite a gruesome way). To be honest, I can easily imagine that this unique presentation deters some gamers from even trying out the game. Its trailer, in fact, presents the game's one-of-a-kind aesthetics very well.\n\nThere is a nice learning curve here and the game has some easter eggs for you to collect - mainly for the purpose of extra achievements, of course. If you love hardcore gaming you can complete Limbo in one sitting with fewer than 5 deaths to earn the hardest achievement of the game.\n\nLimbo has a unique atmosphere. While it is not a long platformer it certainly is a great game. Unfortunately, due to its length and genre I consider 10 EUR a bit too expensive - still, we all know there are regular discounts so until it happens it deserves a place in everybody's wishlist.","July 27, 2014","true","5.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","2"

Also yes I finished it in 3 hours with 75% of the game I did it myself and the other 25% is when I could not solve it and had to use a walkthrough.. Enjoy!\n\nLIMBO	By: Playdead Studios\nReleased: 2010\nGenre: Puzzle/Platformer\nOfficial Website: http://playdead.com/	What is LIMBO?	A logic solving platformer game where the live of the in game protagonist is upon depended on how fast you can solve the current area puzzle otherwise he will be crushed, bludgeon, shot and electrified to death within LIMBO's uniquely realized black and white world where danger is out to get you at every step of the way.\n\nBasically its a very hard platformer with minimalist story and a unique artstyle. 	Option Menu	Verdict: Below Bare Minimal\n\nVery Very Bare. All you get is one option for sound, the other two is just control but you can't rebind it and credit which is rather pointless in the option menu.	Controls	Verdict: Good\n\nFor Keyboard User its Directional Pad for movement and CTRL to use stuff. And its non rebindable.\n\nFor Controller user its whatever is it that is on display on the option menu since my controller hasn't arrived yet so I can't vouch for it but otherwise:\n\nThe KB control is alright with no input lag and other such manner of defects and pretty much any mistakes can't be attributed to the control since one of the good things about this game is that the controls are polished. 	Graphics	Verdict: Great\n\nGraphics are presented in a surreal black and white world but you can still see the background of the world most of the time. Neons glow brightly amidst the all consuming darkness. The game give me the horror game vibe with its industrial design and monotone colour scheme. Even the blood are black. Also despite being minimalist the death scene are still rather grisly to go through.\n\nAlso the character eyes glow.	Sound	Verdict: -\n\nI will have to pass the sound without a score this time since it is purely ambient music made to carry the atmosphere as oppose to situational thing. The SFX when the chains rattle and platform grinding on gears is good though.	Gameplay	Eh not much to say here, it is a platformer game with a puzzle based elements. If you like those kind of games then get it since it has the added bonus of watching your character die horribly if you screw up. But oh well lemme just expand a bit.\n\nYou go to an area and are presented with a puzzle that usually follows the theme of the background e.g.: The first puzzle is a bear trap since the theme is a forest. Upon completion you move on to the next area/theme/puzzle/deathtrap and repeat till you reach the ambigious ending which I shall attempt to provide an explanation below.\n\nGame is a bit short though.	Conclusion	And here we are again towards the end of another review this time for LIMBO. Would I recommend this platformer game with a surrealistic bi-tone world? Sure,sure I would. But I'won't recommend it if you are looking for story closure and long gameplay but for what its worth the length is perfect enough to not feel stale. Overall get this game if you like the looks of it. Or just wait for sale if you dislike the price.\n\nScoring Methology:\n-S-Rank: excellent\n-A-Rank: very good\n-B-Rank: solid\n-C-Rank: satisfactory\n-D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: A-Rank.\n\nCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!

Solid objects are always pure black and the eerie backgrounds are beautiful tones of grey. You'll start in a deadly forest and work your way through even deadlier factories and sewers. Everything in the game is deadly, falling too far, crushed into a pile of goo, impaled on spikes, bear traps, mutilated by saw blades, giant spiders, horrifying insects and even shallow water. You will feel every death, the game will show the boy's body being torn apart and the white eyes turn to black. Then you'll restart from the last checkpoint. The restarting from the checkpoint feels like it takes a second too long for a game with so many deaths.\n\nThe controls are simple, left and right to move, a jump button and an interact button. Sadly the up doubles as a jump button, which can sometimes result in deaths when using an analog stick. The other button is a use button that is good for pushing and pulling objects, which plays a big part in traversal (puzzle solving). The game makes use of physics and momentum, objects can fall, wheels will roll, crush and in later levels there is reverse gravity. Objects have buoyancy and will float, except for your character, making for water puzzles (traversal). One of the most unique elements to the game are the brain slugs that will force you to move forward with no stopping until they hit a light where you then turn around. That shows some out of the box creativity.\n\nYou'll make it through the quick game if you just keep playing. There's nothing really that requires skill since this is puzzle solving. Its more like stand here, jump there, pull this, jump on that. Everything has been done before, but this just makes it look really good. For the explorers out there, you can find 10 or so eggs in the game that unlock a challenging secret level.\n\nOverall, its a good game that hangs its hat on its art style. I'm not sure if its worth $10 anymore, you can find it on sale.","September 11, 2014","true","6.5"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","0"

Without an ounce of exposition, no more of a story than the simple premise of a boy in search of his sister, and a completely monochromatic art design, Limbo creates a twisted and disturbing world through its thick atmosphere and exceptional sound design, drawing you inward even as every fiber of your being compels you to leave. At the same time, it sacrifices gameplay in favor of linear, understandable progression that only asks as much of you as to ensure you feel wholly responsible for what befalls your character.\n\nIn this way Limbo is intentionally manipulative. Every shadow that crosses your path, every tree that seems to move when you aren't watching, and the pieces of the decrepit environment crumbling around you all serve to heighten your senses; to engross you in the experience and pull you deeper down the morbid rabbit hole, all the while keeping danger far enough out of your mind that you inevitably slip up. It's in these moments that Limbo is most effective, as it shocks you to attention as your character is decapitated, mutilated, drowned, and otherwise made to cease his existence, all the while never panning away from the horrors on screen. The brutality of these acts are sold home by how young your character is, his innocence seemingly being ripped out of him little by little as you continue to plunge into the madness that surrounds you, all in the hope you might one day find what you are looking for and see the light of day again.\n\nLimbo's discrepancies then arise in the way it goes about achieving the feeling vulnerability as you venture into the unknown, relying almost entirely on trial and error in its puzzle designs, largely removing logic from the equation. It works in keeping a brisk pace and not letting the player be bogged down by mechanics, but it makes the portions where you are actually required to solve a basic puzzle seem out of place; juxtaposed in and placed like odd road blocks, never quite holding up the player but still feeling like they don't quite belong.\n\nThough an imperfect experience, whatever qualms I had with Limbo were quickly swallowed up by its austere, macabre world that so deftly engulfed me with its incredible atmospheric design, leaving me chilled and in awe. Though Limbo itself might eventually fade from the limelight, its impact on indie development cannot go understated, forever having carved out its place in history at a time when a game such as it was all but destined to fail. I don't consider Limbo the masterpiece some do, but its a journey that I feel is all but a necessity to take; if not for the exceptionally imaginative experience itself, than for its significance in gaming as a whole.","July 25, 2014","true","2.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","6"

'YOUR GOING TO DIE!!!'\n\nAlso let me next begin to decalre to all those that have played this game and have an opinion as to it's meaning, you are all WRONG!\n\nSorry it had to be said, i'm merely trumping the hundreds of opinions circulating around as to the games true meaning with each one of them contradicting the opionions of the one before. So I thought i might as well get in on the act. It's understandable really why there are so many idea's floating around, as the game was purposefully designed to be vague. Other than the word 'Hotel', no other written or spoken word is mentioned in the entire game. The game and it's contributing story is entirely acted out in visuals and it's many, many, many death scenes.\n\nThis has even led many gamers to dismiss that there is any hidden meaning at all behind this game and that it is just a game, but for those that have done a bit of research on the matter and watched some interviews, will no doubt soon discover that the Lead Developer behind this game Jensen openly admits that there was a clear indistinct meaning behind all the inspirations discovered in the game and was kind of personally shocked how close the fans had got to that original concept. He has never admitted openly that anyone has it correct and now with all the millions of guess framework layed out, it is very unlikely that he will ever do so, as that is a further added attraction to the game.\n\nSo let me personally dispell a few of the erroneous down right wrong idea's floating around and give you some more things to think about. Personally I don't think this information will ruin anything, but rather enhance the beauty of this game for you.\n\nThe biggest clue to the game is it's title 'LIMBO'. Limbo is a doctrinal place made up by the Catholic Church. There is no mention of it in the Bible, yet there are many rules about it as set out by the Churches traditional theology. Basically in a nutshell it is a waiting place which some people go to before they are called into Heaven or Hell.\n\nThe other things that you need to keep in mind is that there are several different Limbo's. There is the Limbo of the patriarchs (Abraham, Moses etc) and Limbo of Infants. This game's main character is a young un-named boy who for the purpose of this review we will call him 'Mr Bright Eyes' and his sister. There are several other children in this Limbo too. So evidently common sense dictates that we are in the Limbo for infants.\n\nDo all children go to Limbo? No... Only those that are not baptised. Evidently Mr Bright Eyes and his sister, neither of them are baptised. You also have to be dead to enter into Limbo, comatose states do not count as Limbo.\n\nThe next big clue about this game is when it was released which was in 2010. For several years just prior to this there was quite a lot of hot debate as to the teaching of this doctrine and the need of some clarification on it. One of the biggest questions raised which caused a great ruckus was if it was possible to be 'tested' while in Limbo?\n\nEventually after many arguements back and forth it was determined that it was possible to be tested within Limbo and from there your fate could be further decided. Let me give you a hypothetical situation where testing in Limbo might be required....\n\nThere is a young boy who for one reason or another gets angry and pushes his sister out of a tree house the fall which basically nearly kills her/ or does in fact kill her. He then feels remorse for what he has done and goes off to find help. On his way he is bitten by a poisonous spider. As the kid continues in his frantic search for help, the poison rushes through his system and kills him before he is able to get any help. In this following hypothetical situation the boy would be tested in Limbo as to his sincerity.\n\nSounds an awful lot like the game doesn't it...\n\nOne more thing you need to keep in mind about Limbo is that two people can have a completely different experience in exactly the same place, at exactly the same time. For instance a Cruel boy in Limbo will not have the same experience as a sweet girl does have in Limbo. The Catholic church has never really defined how this is possible other than stating that there must be some type of 'barriers' in Limbo.\n\nSo while Mr Bright Eyes gets to play with saw blades and brain bugs, his sister gets to play with butterflies and all things sweet. Therefore any crashing at the end of the game could be attributed to breaking through that barrier which seperates a good kid from a bad kid. Since both brother and sister are in Limbo they are both dead, but which one died first? It seems little sis did. He is aware of her and where she is and is looking for her evidently he already knows she is dead, while on the contrary little sis has no idea that her brother is in limbo too and is startled when she eventually finds this out.\n\nIt is a bittersweet game from start to finish and though it only takes 55 minutes in a perfect run or thereabouts, with the constant deaths and respawn system you will be at it for days. As you journey through it, concentrated on the backgrounds and the places that you are and think about the hidden meaning. It is quite fun to do so. Did Mr Bright Eyes get out of limbo and enter heaven. Well it all depends on how much money his parents gave to the church though. Maybe we will find out in Limbo 2...\n\n","February 27, 2015","true","17.0"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","17","27","4","0"

Because there is little to find wrong with it. Seriously. Sure, it might be on the short side, clocking in at just a couple 2 or 3 hours. But that is about it. For what it is, it is wonderful. In Limbo, you play the role of a boy, who is for the purpose of this game, nameless. You will pretty much go from left to right the entire game, with very little need to backtrack, and when you do, not very far. You will run through a macabre-like setting, that changes atmosphere as you progress the various settings. You will see a few people, but not many. You will see very few enemies period. The game just seems like you are in some hopeless kind of setting. and that is the whole point of Limbo.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix of platforming, and environmental puzzles, seamlessly mixed together, without need for an inclined difficulty as you progress. Instead, it chooses to go for a more relaxed increase, and keep you focused instead on the atmosphere, rather than difficult situations. However, when die, is it ever satisfying! As grim as that sounds, it is indeed. Limbo has some wonderfully sadistic and amusing deaths for our young nameless protagonist. The animations for each are wonderfully extecuted, as the young boy is well...executed, so to speak.\n\nVisuals are entirely black and white, on purpose. But you do get wonderful shades of everything with the lack of color, and a nice film grain to really set the tone for the eerie environments you will find yourself pushing through.

Shadowy and spooky, but not frightening or stressful. And the gameplay is extremely clever.  However, I have to say there is also a good deal of hidden bits that will end up killing you repeatedly.  Towards the end especially, I got quite stuck until I realized some parts I thought were scenery were really part of the game.  Puzzles vary from hard to solve, hard to platform, hard to time well, and hard to sequence.  It never coddled me or left me too far in the dark, though.  It was tough when it needed to be and a definte challenge to see through to the end. You will die a hundred deaths and swear, but once you solve a level it is a very satisfying feeling.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/48000/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","Limbo, the game, is special in that while it does not wholly depict that mysterious dimension as my mind did, it captures its essence. You are a boy who wakes up in a lonely world made up only of black, white, and shades of gray. Video game logic demands you walk from left to right, jumping over obstacles as they appear, a simple task that needs little attention in the initial moments. This is your chance to absorb your surroundings. The background provides an illusion of depth, but its branches and bridges are out of focus, as if you are dreaming them into existence. The pint-sized hero, his bright blinking eyes shining from his blackened silhouette, trots ahead with the charming gangliness of a six-year-old.\n\nYou can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\n\nThen comes death. Limbo is a hostile place, home to giant spiders that would feast upon you, and traps apparently scattered by the world's other denizens. You step onto a claw trap, and it closes on your neck. Your head falls to the ground and wobbles just for a moment before lying still. No tears are shed, no music plays--the game provides no grand gesture to honor your demise. It simply happens, and you revive at the most recent checkpoint to try the puzzle again. Some of these deaths aren't outright fair; stepping on a pressure plate could mean certain death, but so could jumping over it. Such inconsistencies aren't common, but your first time in Limbo requires some trial-and-error experimentation. Loading times are short, and checkpoints are frequent, however, so death is rarely a frustration, though often a horror.\n\nWhat does it all mean? People pondered that question when Limbo was first released on the Xbox 360 in 2010, and the PC version adds nothing new that would illuminate the mystery of this world, so there's little reason to splurge on another version if you've already played. Nevertheless, the ending offers important clues to the greater plot, if not to the details of the game's events and objects--the imposing neon hotel sign that you must cross, for instance, or the murderous children, seemingly escaped from Lord of the Flies, that aim their blowguns at you. Limbo means for its atmosphere to consume you in the moment, and in that sense, it succeeds. You drag a dead child's corpse to solve a puzzle, and perhaps wonder if anyone grieves this lost soul given the apathy of the realm. You glimpse a figure and regard her with tenderness, but the brief glimmer of hope is snuffed out in an instant.\n\nAfter life, before death.\n\nIt isn't until the final third of its two- to three-hour runtime that Limbo's puzzles become challenging. The first half of the game is more concerned with building dread and ambiguity. Even after being vanquished, a colossal spider's remaining leg thrusts at you from its thorax, one final act of defiance that could leave two corpses for the crows to pick. When you pull the leg from the spider, the audible cracks and visible white splatters emphasize just how recently its life force was crushed. Elsewhere, you push boxes and pull levers, rushing to finish the puzzle before the rising water fills the room. Failure means watching the dear boy go as limp as a ragdoll as liquid fills his lungs.\n\nThe second half leaves behind the horrors in favor of puzzles involving gravity and complex machinery. As memorable as it is to navigate tilting rooms with only a few hanging lamps to light the way, it is that spider that most embodies Limbo's somber spirit. The later puzzles are complex and clever, but they don't haunt the heart. The finale feels abrupt because it returns to the first hour's imagery, having abandoned it for long enough to have altered your personal connection with the game from an emotional one to an intellectual one. And yet the end offers insight into a backstory left otherwise untouched--enough of it to inspire another playthrough, this time ever so much wiser than you were before.\n\nTHE GOOD\nStriking atmosphere that chills the heart\nExcellent, poignant moments that stay with you\nCold, gruesome deaths are presented with memorable and horrific apathy\nIntroduces more involved puzzles at a satisfying pace\n\nTHE BAD\nThe most haunting imagery is limited to the first half\nEnding doesn't emerge organically from the hour leading to it\n8/10\nGREAT","April 25","true","3.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Usage: "The dancers performed with skill."\n\nRecollection (noun) ~ the act or power of recollecting, or recalling to mind; remembrance. Usage: "Bob had perfect recollection of everything he did wrong when crossing the street."\n\nIt's too bad that the developers of this game confused these two. There is apparently some underlying artistic expression happening in Limbo related to depression and suicide. So they sat down one day and figured the best way to express that was to just kill the player over and over again by making it impossible to progress without actually having fore-knowledge of what will happen next. Then they remembered that they were actually supposed to be making a game and threw in some puzzles, some of which were very clever but ultimately the result is that Limbo feels like it wants to be doing two very different things and can't make up its mind.\n\nSchizophrenic design and a focus on the theme of depression... somehow they didn't think it was a bad idea on paper. I'll say this though, they certainly captured the essense of suicide. Because they completely killed any hope of this game being entertaining.\n\nAs a final note, the game is sickeningly violent. That may seem like an odd thing to say because the game is all greyscale but the fact is that the developers have intentionally gone to great lengths to make the main character's deaths as vivid as possible. The game repeatedly has the main character dismembered, bisected, beheaded, crushed and impaled all with gruesome detail both visually and aurally. You can hear the bones crunch and flesh tear as well as see and hear blood splatter. It isn't pleasent and it may be the singular reason for the high reviews as many see this kind of morbid stuff as highly entertaining. Furthermore if you are a parent looking to buy this for a child, thinking that it is harmless, you need to look elsewhere.","September 4, 2015","false","3.0"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","18","32","4","2"

On the other hand, it doesn't try to stretch the playtime by repeating the same puzzles over and over again.\n\nLIMBO certainly isn't a bad game, but if you are expecting a brilliant platformer with loads of playtime and replayability, then you might want to look somewhere else as this game most likely isn't for you.\n\nI'm not sure I would recommed it at its full price, but at 75% off during the major sales, it's certainly worth it.","September 1, 2012","true","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game has simple controls, but the puzzles do require some forethought. The game is priced normally at $9.99, I would personally recommend waiting until there was a sale on the game.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You play the story as a silhouette character that is always seemingly running to the right in an attempt to get someplace.\n\nGame Play: Great puzzles, sometimes tricky timed jumps, sometimes morbid, the best word to describe this game is “fascinating”.\n\nAchievements: Many of the achievements are easy to get, most of them require stepping on little white orbs found throughout the game, but there are a few very tough achievements such as “No point in dying”. (…Which I am still working on, as of 02/12/14)\n\nPrice: I’ve put 6 hours into the game, in my opinion that isn’t enough time to be worth $9.99 the game was on a humble bundle sale when I purchased it, so I’ve been very satisfied with the quality of the game.\n\nConclusion: If you’re in the market for a short little platformer adventure and have a few hours to burn, this is a great game for you to play, however the price is too high to purchase normally","February 12, 2014","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Dark and gloomy. Vague and gorey. Clever and enraging.\n\nThis is an artistic platform game that forces you to think outside the box--quite often, but every successful attempt is rewarding and leaves you feeling accomplished.\n\nThis game touched me more than you might expect on an emotional level, too. I affectionately refer to the player as "Billy" because he doesn't really have a name. And he doesn't really talk. Or... anything, really. But that's part of the charm!\n\nIt's a platform game with a delightful twist. It's kinda creepy and fun. Expect to die a lot but once you get that "Aha!" moment, it makes it all worth it.\n\nThe checkpoints are also really handy and the game is merciless but not punishing, if that makes sense.\n\nA fun little adventure. 5/5 might seem like much but I'm rating it not based on what it is, but what it's trying to be.

Besides, the physical effect is another thing i think it great that  no doubt has reached the level in most of 3D games. The design of every stage is fastinating, actually every stage is quite different from the other cuz  you'll never repeat the same thing you have done in last stage. Although the entire story of LIMBO is quite hard to understand but as long as you seize every detail of the process while you're playing this game,you'll find out its heart-touching meaning: a weak but brave and tough little boy, he set out his journey throughout the inferno world for the purpose of seeking his sister. the boy struggling in LIMBO maybe represents he's struggling under death line, but he finally meets his sister which means he comes back to life.The story is somehow meaningful and worth studying.","June 26, 2014","true","2.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Limbo is one of those games that can answer such questions. It combines gloomy black and white visuals, low volume ambient soundtrack and chilling sound effects to produce an unforgettable experience that stays with you, much longer than it lasts. You are a young boy who wakes up in a forest, without knowing anything about your identity, where you are, where you come from or where you are going. You walk alone in the shadows, facing creatures and meeting other children along the way. The road ahead is tough and you must solve many puzzles, with the use of your brain and reflexes to keep going. There are no dialogs or cut scenes in this game, yet the storytelling is much greater than many other games. But there is death.  So much death. You will die many times in order to figure how to solve some puzzles or just to see the animation in every case. The puzzles start simple and they get more complex as you approach the ending. Oh, the ending! What an unusual way to end a game and spur so much debate over the meaning!

Limbo takes platforming into a dark, depressing and desperate world and does not lighten up one bit.\n\nThe "story" was very emotional for me.  Enough questions are left unanswered to allow the player to come to his/her own conclusion, which can be tough to do but pays off well here.\n\nThe controls are simple and balanced.  The game doesn't find its natch by sending volleys of flashy attacks and hordes of repetitive enemies at you like some plat-formers.  Instead, each encounter feels like a dream.  You do what you can to survive, but you are clearly not in control of your surroundings, and you feel as though your character truly doesn't belong in this place.\n\nThe game also does not use an "awesome sound track!" to sell itself.

With a mixture of adventure and puzzle, the game will catch you within a minute. There are no different difficulty settings, but the difficulty rises with higher levels. You will be dragged directly into the story without any information and no more informations are given while playing the game aswell, like a short-novel, but you will instantly try to figure out how to escape the mysterious and even more dangerous environment. You will be happy, if you solve a puzzle within the level and survive, but you can be afraid easily too while playing it. I was a bit surprised of the brutality in the game. Even in black and white you can easily feel the pain when you fail miserably and die one of several deaths. Be aware of the secrets and dangers, that are hidden in the dark. All in all one of the best Indie-games I played so far, but like the most titles kind of short.","February 22, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For this reason, I suggest waiting for it to be on sale or finding a coupon for it.  I understand that Limbo isn't meant to be some time consuming RPG, but it could have used a little more length.

One of those games you can pick up on a lazy, boring Sunday afternoon and get lost in. It has a lightweight story to go with the puzzles, but don't let that put you off if you're not looking to commit to a story in the next game you play. Not paying attention to it won't take anything away from the game, mostly because you'll be wondering how the ♥♥♥♥ to kill that spider.\n£6.99 may seem a little pricey for a game which can be completed in a short amount of time if you put your mind to it, but then again it's also a timeless classic of game that you can return to many times and still be surprised by. I don't know if it's the dark, misty landscape of the world, or the inevitable and somewhat distracting gory deaths (don't take the term gory death lightly), but every time I've revisited this game, I always find I've forgotten how to solve the more complex of the puzzles, a valuable characteristic for a game, as it lures you add yet more chunks of your day to the total game play time.\nThe game's controls are very simple, arrow keys to move around; with the up key allowing you to jump and grab on to chains, or climb up the sides of crates. Crates play quite a vital part in solving puzzles and can be dragged around by holding control when next to them, but be warned, they are just as susceptible to large, spinning blades as your characters limbs are.\nOverall a brilliant game. I'm sure if you dug around for long enough you could find a problem with it, or an aspect which you don't like, but they most certainly aren't obvious which is enough reason for me not to go looking for things which would ruin an otherwise fantastic game. If £6.99 sounds like too much for you, give the steam demo a shot and see if you change your mind, and, well, if that doesn't help, maybe pick it up in the steam sales.\n","July 18, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game itself is very mature, featuring lots of gruesomely graphic and violent death scenes and chilling moments (Spider!!!).\nFurthermore, the total lack of any story cutscenes as well as dialogue leave a lot of room for interpretation of what is actually going on.

There are no voice overs or any backstory - you just wake up in a field and try  to navigate a small lost boy out of the dark and macabre world he finds himself in. It has a great sense of loneliness and isolation. The lack of music adds to this feeling.\n\nI liked that you are thrown to the wolves in the begining of the game and left to figure what to do on your own.

And this one is good. Indie games basicly live from an idea, from originality. Limbo is a game that proves it. Black & white graphics, horror themed forest, little guy in the middle of nowhere and going through lots of puzzles. That's original, I bet you can't name a game like that that's already on the market.\n\nGraphics are again black & white, that's cool, along with the "vintage horror movie grain" it really adds an awesome atmosphere. Details are presented also really well, grass, sparks, dust, everything like that. You can't really find something bad about it.\n\nGameplay is simple, 5 keys only. No skill needed there. But it's a puzzle game, it makes you think. So in lots of cases, you need to worry about the timing and figuring out how are you gonna get past each section.\n\nIn my opinion, a big factor in any kind of game is replay-ability. This game doesn't really offer you that. Although there's an achievement where you have to complete the game without dying more than 5 times. But it's fun to not play it for a couple of weeks, forget about all the solutions and playing it again.\n\nOverall, it's one of the best indie games I've ever seen, it's beautiful to look at even after figuring out all the puzzles.

Dark and Moody Atmosphere in a Brutal World.Genre: 2D Puzzle Platformer.\nDeveloped & Published by: Playdead\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Consoles.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the original review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nYou play as an unnamed, and apparently mute, boy searching through dark woods and city landscapes for something. According to the game description, you're looking for his sister. Oddly enough, there is no mention of this in the game though it's implied. There isn't much of a story in this game. You simply wake up in a forest, with no idea who you are or what's going on. In the background, you see trees and as you go along you start seeing buildings, plants and factories. It is almost as if your in a side world to the "real world" but the game never really explains this. The game has a distinct ending, but its a bit abrupt and isn't that satisfying to me. There isn't much to spoil about the ending of the game, but I won't spoil it so you'll have to play it to find out what happens.\n\nThis story's character is no saint, to say the least. While one could make the claim that it was kill or be killed, he does some things that make me wonder. There are certain parts where the kid will kill the other kids via traps. There is also one point of the game where you have to pull a leg out of a spider that's been trying to kill you in order to progress further. Usually, you feel justified to an enemy, but ugh, doing that really made me queasy.\n\nPuzzles\nSo what about the puzzles themselves? Well, they weren't too bad. They tended to range from jumping around, moving objects to the right place, using the physics engine and jumping at the right time, otherwise you were dead. It also includes some gravity puzzles as well as a part where an insect limits your movement. The overall difficulty curve is gentle and gradual for most of the time. None of the puzzles got to the point that required a ridiculous amount of precision in order to progress though. However, I did find some of the puzzles can be frustratingly opaque. I ran into a couple that required some help from guides. One other thing I should point out is that while the game auto-saves as you progress, there are a few puzzles that if you screw up, it sets you back a little bit more than I would like, which can lead to some frustration as you redo the steps over and over again until you get it right.\n\nPC Settings & Audio/Video\nPC settings are fairly limited though you don't need many for 2D Games. You can change are controls and brightness levels. No V-Sync, AA, AF, resolution options or anything else. It's limited but to the game's credit, seems to scale well from my experience. I never had any lag or crashing or other issues crop up during gameplay. The game is very light on graphic settings, though your not going to really need to change them as long as you have a decent computer. It is controller compatible if you prefer controllers. The keybindings aren't changeable, but I found the default ones are smartly placed.\n\nThe game's OST is very atmospheric. At first the music stays in the background, but as you progress along and get into the city-section, the music starts getting in your face, almost overwhelming you as you try and solve the puzzles all the way to the end of the game. The sounds itself sound very realistic, though sometimes muted. There is a flying insect in the game that slightly creeped me out thanks to the sound design.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIn the end, I had more fun that I thought I would with this game. The unique visuals sets this game apart and makes it memorable, helped in no small part by how brutally dark this game is. It only clocks in at about three to fours hours for a run through it. But I was satisfied with the length of the game given how cheap it is and how well designed it is. There's a reason that a lot of games are based on the Limbo formula and why so many people played this title. It's worth giving a look for the moody atmosphere, the dark music and tight platforming.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","June 3, 2012","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can barely think of a single criticism for it because it is, for all intents and purposes, perfect. It's short (it took me around 5-6 hours to complete it, and I will not even pretend to be remotely good at puzzle games) and simple, sure, but if it was any more complicated it would be less enjoyable. It has an amazing balance of disturbing, gory, and at times terrifying moments with a beautiful soundtrack, visuals, world design, and story. And all of this without having a single word of dialogue. This game changed the way I look at video games so that they are no longer something designed solely to be entertaining, but rather something that can be admired as a work of art.

The puzzles increase in difficulty as the game progresses but never become frustrating or stop being fun and the platforming is seemless. I don't like how the game can be trial and error at times, some traps require clairvoyance to be predicted the first time through and it makes some of your deaths seem really cheap, also the game could use more puzzle variety.

Gameplay is fun while the puzzles aren't the hardest and a bit of a die as you go the first time through, but that's ok the deaths in this game are surprising blunt.

Behind a rather linear 1,5 hour-long 2D puzzle platformer lies a masterpiece with a story of highly emotional background and astonishing aesthetics. I won't go into detail regarding the story, but the things that make this piece of art a game are solid. Gameplay mechanics are intuitive and sometimes provide a challenge (at least the first few playthroughs), the controls are fluid and responsive (I'd recommend a controller but keyboard will do just fine as well), visually the game looks very atmospheric and grim and the sound design lacks music, which is a good thing, since you're immersed by the cold-sounding ambience of the world of LIMBO. The game had many discounts already and you're likely to get this game for a single dollar. Get it.

Play it. Chuckle at its simplicity. Continue playing. Watch horrified as your little illuminated eyes close at unexpected dismemberment. Curse it for its merciless deviousness. Play some more. Die some more. Marvel in disbelief at the previously missed subtle hints that made the seemingly impossible obstacle suddenly inexplicably logical and simple to surpass. How did I miss that?! Hear the eerie echo of your glee maniacal laughter die off against the walls as you watch yourself being squished like a bug after skipping ahead from the last obstacle. Scream. Play some more. Wait, why is it getting light already? Spend your work day mulling over the last fateful steps in your journey. Surprise your boss by finishing that project early just to get back to try your theory on how to beat that last obstacle. Die some more. Overcome some more. Oh my.... I.. I think I.. really... I won?!\n\nPositives\nPrice point: worth the current €10. If you pay this money for a full-feature movie where you complain about how the main character is disposed of, you should get at least the same playtime out of this, probably more, with no one to blame but yourself for the multitude of ways your character bites the bullet.\nInterface: proof positive that a great game does not need a complicated interface, or really, much of an interface at all. All works exactly as expected or as discovered after a bit of trying. Nothing superfluous. Checkpoints are saved automatically after each main obstacle, which is all that's needed. The Thomas Edison Path-to-Success exemplified: succeed by finding 1001 ways to fail. Every gruesome death will teach you something (if only that you just repeated the same stupid mistake). Learn and overcome.\nReplayability: if you are the type that doesn't look back once the end is reached, admittedly not much. For completionists/perfectionists: you *will* sink a multiple of the original playthrough time to go back from the top and try and get all achievements, especially to try finish it in under 5 deaths. Guaranteed.\nNegative:\nGame length: This may arguably be the weakest point of LIMBO. Even after all the achievements are done, you may find yourself wishing there was a next catacomb to explore, another monster to outrun, another trap to outwit. Who are these other kids so hell-bent on separating me from my limbs? Where did/do they go when they are not ending up in their own traps? What places did my sister visit, and devious traps survived, that I haven't seen yet? In other words: where's LIMBO 2?

Very nice animation and an art style that separates it from most other games.\n+Fun puzzles. Some are hard at first, but they make you feel smart when you solve them.\n+Very good controls. I never felt like a death in the game was due to bad controls, only my own mistakes.\n+You don't have to replay long segments if you die.\n\nCons:-Some sections are quite hard! Some are hard to figure out, others are hard to time right. Or both.\n-The game is perhaps a bit short - experienced platformer players will probably get through it in about 3 hours. The lenght of the game was fine with me but might be a dealbreaker for some.\n\nMain review:Now don't get me wrong by thinking a 7/10 score is something bad. Quite the opposite, I would rate it on par with many games with a much bigger budget behind them. If I were to compare LIMBO to other similar games (indie platformers), it's the very best one I've ever played, and would then be a 10/10, but the score is set in comparison to all games I've played.\n\nThe game doesn't have much of a narrative, but that's just a part of the game style. You start off in a dark and eerie world without any real clue about what's going on or what you're supposed to do. You pick up the controls and start walking around to discover the first obstacles.\n\nThe game is all about platforming and solving different puzzles/obstacles. Some puzzles require timed jumps, other are more of physics puzzles. All puzzles challenges you to figure out a solution, and to make it, which can sometimes be hard. The game isn't so punishing if you happen to die though. Upon death, you don't have to replay the last 5-10 minute sequence as some games do, often you will reappear just in front of what killed you. In some cases there might be maybe 10-60 seconds of repeating, but never more than that. That's an extra plus for me - for some reason I suck at platform games, and seldom make the jumps requiring precision, so some parts had me doing maybe 20 tries to get through that certain jump, but being able to start over close to where you died didn't make me quit on the game.\n\nThe controls are excellent. I played through the whole game with the Xbox 360 controller, and it worked really well, I would highly recommend it. The character you control isn't your double jumping super agile platforming hero, but a slower character that doesn't jump very far or high. This doesn't mean that the controls aren't responsive though, they do just what they are supposed to, when you press the buttons. The game also has very good animation that pair up well with the nice controls.\n\nI must admit that I was uncertain about the game before I started to play it. I'm no big fan of platformers, and while looking at some screenshots and gameplay videos, it just seemed too dark and boring, but I gave it a chance and I was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nSo, even if you're not a fan of platformers, I would recommend this game (at a sale).","June 11, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No other information given. The story is vague, even after you finished it. And still,... got huge of recommendations with overwhelming positive reviews. How could that be possible?\nAnd here's what I though:\n\nDetailed Score: AspectScoreExplanationGameplay9.0Like other platformer games, in this game you have to finish the puzzles in order to advance to the next chapter. Actually, there is no clear distinction between each chapter in-game. You can see it, though at Load Chapter on main menu. The puzzle is quite easy at the beginning, but is getting more difficult in the mean of time. You'll have to die a lot just to discover the hint of the puzzle.\nFor first walkthrough, it needs so much time (and a lot of headache) to finish this game. (I remember my first walkthrough and it needed days for me to complete it.)\nOne little flaw (probably) of this game is the length of game. Especially for second walkthrough and more, the game can be finished for a couple of hours. It is more likely because much of chapter is quite short and the key to finish the puzzle is easily remembered once you have finished it before.World Design9.5"Hey, why would we have to discuss the world design here?"\n"Well, as a platformer game, it does a matter, right?"\nOkay, no matter how good the gameplay is, it's going to a waste when the world is poorly designed. Gladly, LIMBO is smart enough to avoid that problem. The world is mainly divided into three regions: forests, sub-urban cities, and mechanical factory. Each place has their own unique design, given the player to do the different approach to finish the puzzle in each regions.\nNot much more to say? Okay, to the next criteria.Story9This is where one of most unique aspects of LIMBO lies. You have no clue about what's really happened from the start (to the ending). All we know is our character, a boy, anonymous, wake up in the middle of forest, go through puzzles and puzzles, and finally meet your little sister.\nFor some people, the story is very annoying given the lack of information about it. But, I love it. It give us the feel that the game "don't guide us". You are the player, you define the story, you define what's really happened. It's pretty unique way about how developer put their story.Graphic and Sound10The most remarkable aspect of LIMBO. Instead give us he player a full-detailed graphic, the developer gives us a grey-ish, silhouette world. You have to imagine about the world itself, what our character looks like, what those giant spiders look like, what those big chainsaw looks like, etc etc etc.\nThose big aspect of graphic become more immersive with the sound effect. I love how developer use minimalistic sound effect in their game. Sometimes they makes use calm. Sometimes, they gives us some kind of nightmare, take example of sound effect when you died because of chainsaw. (ugh...)\nThose two aspect are combined pretty well, and we have an immersive, dark, terrifying, and yet beautiful world.\nTL;DR LIMBO is a great example of what a game should be. Every aspect of this game is amazing, if you don’t want to call it perfect. A must-have for every platformer fans and common gamers alike.\nSome people say the price is a little bit high for a 3-5 hours of gameplay. For me, it’s worth every cent of your money.\n\nScore: 9.5/10\n\nNB: I only spend less than 10 hours for this game when I reviewed this game. I’ll tell you, I have finished this game long time ago.  Well, at piracy. Forgive me!!!  But then, I still buy this game on Steam because I love this game so much. I want to give my support for the developer and I can’t wait for their upcoming projects in the future.","October 27, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

The controls are fluid enough, and that's about it.\n\nLimbo features simple, single-solution, direct puzzles.  One or two require lateral thinking:  video games have rules, and we forget to abuse physics behavior because we expect a simplistic physics subset.  Many are a matter of precision timing, rather than puzzle solving.  There is occasionally rapid death, giving you one-second experiments alternating with five-second load times to try again and see if you can't get the timing right without dying.\n\nAllegedly, the game has a story; what it really has is an ambient motif of black-and-white, and a completely unexplained environment.  People, machines, and giant monsters?  Buildings, machinery, and wilderness?  Who built this, why are you here, how did you get here, who are these people, why are they doing what they're doing?  There is no explanation.  Even the ending is a cop-out:  it suggests a silent, visual, unexplained story resolution is about to happen, and then cuts to credits without actually playing through any sort of final cut scene.  You then wind up back at the title screen.\n\nLimbo is more of a technology demo than a game.  With some dialogue, cutscenes, and more content, it would be an actual game.  As it stands, it's a set of procedural instructions which must be followed precisely, but they didn't give you the instruction sheet.","June 20, 2015","false","2.6"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","1"

However, about halfway through, the game stopped presenting any sort of context or narrative to justify the character's progression and just became a puzzle platformer with average controls.\n\nThe last few levels felt very frustrating to me, as visual cues for new twists on mechanics suddenly seemed to become a lot less clear. The end also felt very unsatisfying, with absolutely no closure on the narrative. Since getting to the end was basically my only motivator for the entire second half of the game, it left me pretty bitter.","April 4, 2015","false","3.8"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","17","32","0","0"

Throughout gameplay of Limbo, you follow along the experiences of a little boy in which you play as. You are presented with some challenging obstacles in which you learn many things from along with the character through your mistakes and the use of the method of trial and error. The game and levels are cleverly designed and though the obstacles are challenging to an extent, I have never found them to be overwhelmingly frustrating but in fact, I have found them to be rather enjoyable.\n\nThe mood through the use of simple music and an unique artistic style involving dark monotonal colours is great at immersing the player into the scene. You begin to develop an attachment with character throughout the game.The physics/movement is applaudable, the character control is smooth and the controls are simple and easy to use.\n\nThis game is an amazing piece of work. It is definitely worth the price. I have no regrets buying this game and I highly recommend this game to those considering to purchase and all of those who have not purchased this game.

Personally, I loved it. I can't, however, see any reason whatsoever to spend $10 on this game. It's dark and tricky but the length of gameplay kills the price tag. Steam has me registered with 111 minutes on Limbo. I'd say a good 30 minutes of that, if not more, was registered while I was paused, doing things around the house. When I got to the end, I figured I had just completed the first chapter. Nope, no more story. If you've played the demo and like it then wait for it to go on sale. I'd say $3 is reasonable but I can't in good conscience recommend you spend any more than that on it.","May 30, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

That is not, however, why i personally love this game, it has a wonderful ambience, and does a good job of making the player feel truely alone and hopeless.  the anamation style used is incredable for this purpose, and just to increase the intensity, no music plays during gameplay. very little sound at all realy.  the whole experience is truely one of a kind, and nigh unmatched.","October 9, 2011","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetravellervslife/recommended/48000/","thetravellervslife","Domingocs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetravellervslife/","379 products in account","Limbo is an Inde Puzzle Platformer that is mostly standard in the sense of its mechanics (aside from a couple of shiny moments in the "late game"), but that has a strong point in its artistic choice and the way that the whole aesthetic of it is. It is a very interesting idea that I haven't seen in a lot of other games of this class (if at all really, I can't remember any other game that has done that before).\n\nThe mechanics of it, as I said, are very standard in comparison to any other puzzle platformer: you jump, you move stuff around, you try to find a way to keep moving forward and not to fall to your dead. The interesting thing about the game comes to play when you are confronted with some of the "enemies" of the game, but then again it is more of a time pressure in the puzzling than an actual fight against the AI of the game. Other special things that might happen in the game that changes the mechanics a little bit are some of the puzzles (I cannot explain them without spoiling a bit of the game though).\nThe game can be completed very fast. I finished it in about 3 and a half hours. I did not finish it to a 100% because that includes looking for little "light bubbles" around the world that are meant to be collectables or achievements, but these do not affect the game in any way. And again, I cannot imagine that finding all of them might extend the game all that much. The game itself in a mechanic point of view is okay. Maybe a little bit about average, but not much more than that. Challenging at moments and has some interesting ideas. You can be sure that you won't get trough a whole are without dying a couple of times, but it has nothing to do with skills, it has to with the game being a ♥♥♥♥ and setting you up to some traps you CANNOT see coming at all. I guess dying is just a part of the game, which actually makes sense considering the artistic view of it.\n\nThe artistic view and aesthetic of the game are the most attractive elements of this game. The way I would describe it is a black and white world (light and shadow kind of thing) that looks beautiful, but has a creepy and impressionistic element to it. It made me feel a little bit uncomfortable at some points because of the impressionistic nature of the art style. It is not "gore" in any way, but it is something that get's close to it in a 2D shadow-like graphics. Nothing to worry about, though; just a dark game. The world is very well made and it pays attention to little details, which is weird considering that you are basically seeing shadows of the world in a 2D view. A very good thing that I have to point out is that the game makes a very good work of letting you know what is actually a platform you can jump on and what is just a part of the background/fordground.\n\nThere is a story element to the game that, as far as I am concerned, is left to free interpretation throughout the whole game and up to the very end as well, not giving you any answers to any of your questions. Where are you? What/who are you looking for? Why is there other people here? The game has no dialogue at all, but it manages to get across just as much story as it wants to, leaving you with just enough questions for you to keep pushing forward and looking up theories in some forums after you have finished the game.\n\nWarts and all, this game is good. It is an experience that I enjoyed. Short and simple, but worth some of your time. Get it if you care more about story than about mechanics.\n\n7.5/10","December 15, 2013","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun to solve the puzzles, and feels great when you have that "a-ha!" moment. It's fun to dodge all the environmental hazards flying around, especially in later levels. It also has a unique and beautiful art style (well, unique for it's time anyway; so many games now try to duplicate it's style).\n\nI'd recommend if you not only like "art" games, but also like games that are generally fun to play.

It was only thanks to the generosity of a friend on Steam that I gained a copy to try and complete. But I haven’t been a fan of platformer games for some time, so would I enjoy Limbo?\n\nIn a mysterious, monochrome world, a boy awakens in a dark forest. He sets out in search of his sister. But in his way are the various denizens of this world, from giant spiders to parasitic worms, and even other kids…\n\nThere are four words that sum up Limbo: dark, artistic, minimalistic, and frustrating. Easily, the best part of the game is the presentation. It’s dark and moody, the graphics are just right for the macabre style, and the whole atmosphere is enhanced by a dark and appropriate soundtrack. Music and sound effects contribute to an eerie and intimidating atmosphere. It’s like Silent Hill, but, if anything, even darker. While at first glance it appears to be a kid’s game, it is anything but. I dunno what the rating is, but parents, THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS. This is a violent and dark game. Bleakly beautiful and beautifully bleak, but definitely not for kids.\n\nThe gameplay is another matter entirely. It is hard, even by the gold standard of Nintendo platformers. The gameplay consists of avoiding death and figuring out how to progress by trial and error, or as the publishers once called it, ‘trial and death’. And you will die. A lot. In manifold gruesome fashions. But figuring out how to get by the latest obstacles or adversaries will give you a feeling of accomplishment. Unfortunately, I tended to get more frustrated than feeling like I accomplished anything meaningful.\n\nThe game comes across as the illegitimate offspring of Silent Hill and Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysey (which, incidentally, was recently re-released on Steam). While the difficulty feels right for such a game, I just wish it wasn’t quite so hard. And the payoff in the minimalist story doesn’t quite work.\n\nThat being said, Limbo is pretty good. I like it mainly for the presentation more than the gameplay, but the gameplay itself has its own charms. It’s just a touch too hard for my liking…\n\nRATING: ***½","April 3, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All animations are very detailed and smooth, in fact you can only see silhouettes. Depth is created with blur.\nLevel transitions are fluent, no loading screens, which creates a nostalgic feeling. You think you can always go back from where you came from. In Fact you can't, as some geographical obstacles block the way back.\nEven though the main purpose of this game is to solve puzzles, which are using physics and differ in grade of difficulty, LIMBO also has a profound background story or at least events.\nFirst you have to defend yourself against a spider, and cut of three of its legs. Then it's fleeing, but catches you later on a webbed floor. As you escape the spider is following you again, and you head it to a small village. The people are not delighted of course, as the spider is killing them. So they also try to kill you, in return you have to kill them. Afterwards you also manage to escape from the spider, which is so hurt, that only one leg is left. To get further, you have to tear out also the last leg, and use the spider's body.\nLater you see that the people of the village are sometimes controlled by a worm, which causes them to walk into water and to drown. Again you have to use a dead body to complete your journey.\nSeveral times you try to reach a girl, but you are led away by a worm or cannot reach her.\nAll these incidents are disturbing in some kind and thought-provoking.\n\nIt's a lot of fun to get all hidden eggs, and find the hidden level.\nI completed the game on Linux, it was running perfect, even the XBox 360 controller rumbled.","July 9, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Creepy settings in multiple enviroments. It has all the requirements to be a fantastic horror-game, yet there is more to it than that. This gruesome game is a must play for those who likes emergins themselves into another world.\n\nLIMBO is one of those indie games which, to some, are a piece of art. I most certainly agree. I morbidly enojyed every minute of it.\n\nPros and Cons++ Pros:\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Clever, Tricy, yet simple puzzles\n+ Learning curve\n+ Hidden Treasures and Replay value\n+ Full controller support\n\n- - Cons:\n- Short\n\nDetailsThe atmosphere of this game is amazing! ... You do indeed feel that something is lurking in the dark. LIMBO only uses two colours (and shades between them) and yet it creates an even more creepier feel to it than the common indie "horror"-games do. You don't know where you are, you don't know who you are. You only know you must find a way to continue.\n\nTo add to the beautifully executed creepiness of the visuals, a rather amazing sound-score is also a part of the game. It helps you emerge into the LIMBO. I can't really tell why, but the sounds are you so morbidly appealing. the spook-factor definetely goes up do to the sounds.\n\nThe puzzles and the platforming of the game may be simple once you figure out what to do. However figuring out exactly what to do, and what to move, and what to begin with is the tricky part. Simple in design, yet an interactive experience. You need to be observant to complete some parts, and others you need to watch out!  Buh!\n\nAs you progress through the chapters, you will die... And as you die, you'll begin to learn what to look out for, and the learning curve behind this is actually pretty well composed. The atmosphere of the game and the puzzles blend in so cleverly well, that you sometimes stop to just look at it. If you are looking for a challange, you can collect all the the hidden goodies in the game, to make secret level appear somewhere in the chapters. There you can really test your abilities to survive and think creatively. Be aware, you wil die... repeatedly... you need use the thinker as well as the fingers.\n\nThe replay value of the game is pretty nice for multiple reasons. For once there are the steam acheivements which you can collect by exploring secret locations. Some are very tricky, so check every possible hidden route. Especially the "DING!" and the "No Point in Dying" achievements can be devilish to acquire, so good luck. Secondly the game in itself is worth replaying purely because it's simply that good.\n\nAn top of all this the full controller support is of cause a benefit to the game. Don't be scared users who prefer keyboard; the controls are fine with either choice.\n\nThe only "flaw" to this game, is it's length. The length of the game is about two hours. I wouldn't even call this a mistake per se. The games length is actually what gives it such a high level of replay value. Either way, this game shouldn't be rushed, as is far to great an experience for that kind of play.\n\nFinal verdictNo colours, no words, no prolog, no epilog. And still... filled with atmosphere.\nA well deserved 9/10.","November 5, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It Dark, disturbing at points, atmospheric, beautiful and enchanting.  It is easy to play but engaging at all times, presents puzzles to you but not obviously as a puzzle.  The main character is childlike but the world is harsh.  The story is subtle but evolves perfectly as the play and leaves you with questions.\nThis game should not be remade, changed or even have a sequel. It stands on its own in many respects and just is.\nIf it was £30 it should still be bought and played, just so that you can say you were there when it happened. I have been playing games since pong and there are many games that I am proud to be able to say I was part of at the time of their breakthrough.  Limbo is one such game.

From the very beginning you will feel immersed in the strange dark world of Limbo.  The story is not very long, and there is not much replayability unless you want to go for all of the achievements.

Its minimalistic approach works to its advantage, bringing out a silent, gloomy atmosphere that adds a tone of mystery. The controls are pretty basic, the physics is magnificent and the difficulty curve is just right. The best thing about the game would probably be that the puzzles you encounter dont require raw skill like in most platformers, but most of the times, if something you do doesn't work, you need to take a different approach. You will, nevertheless, die a lot, but the save points are so frequent that you will not be frustrated at all. Perhaps LIMBO's greatest shortcoming is its short duration, but its quality definitely makes up for it.","November 26, 2013","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What story it has is largely implicit—the game contains no dialogue. You simply wake in a dark wood, apparently a child, and set off to explore the dingy place in which you find yourself. But the genre of the game is certainly horror, though without most of the usual tropes. You are fragile—easily hurt, unable to swim, essentially defenseless—in a hostile and trap-ridden place. You will die many times. And the game does not divert your gaze from your death but rather renders each different mode of your demise in somewhat disturbing detail.\n\nThe artistic style of the game simultaneously keeps this from being too macabre and contributes greatly to the eerie atmosphere. The game's graphics are entirely silhouettes in shades of grey. Yet the landscapes and objects feel very detailed. Beautifully done lighting effects give the impression of a layered world mostly in shadow. All this makes for a beautiful noir environment well worth admiration in its own right. This game is more immersive with black and white outlines than much I’ve played that had expensive 3D-graphics.\n\nA subtler strength of the game is the way its physics feel naturalistic—you are acutely aware of the weight of objects and the force of gravity.  I doubt that the game’s engine is particularly remarkable in this regard, it’s an aesthetic effect. Great attention has been paid to the visual details of motion. But I think it also comes from player movement: in many games you play as a character with outsized physical capabilities. Even in shooters and platformers where such isn’t part of the story your movements are subtly superhuman (think of the lateral jumping featured in most platformers). Not here. Here you have a painfully tiny lateral jump and a rather slow top speed. Here objects don’t just slide easily into place but are dragged only with great effort.\n\nThe largest complaint I had with LIMBO was that it was too short. Though the puzzles were good, and admirably varied, not too many were very difficult. If one is adept at this sort of thing one could easily complete the game in just a few hours. They are an excellent few hours though. The puzzles are crisp, things to be grasped, not just fiddled with. For a little while LIMBO takes you to an unsettling, engrossing otherworld. And I’d very much like to visit again.","August 10, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drydwen/recommended/48000/","drydwen","Drydwen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drydwen/","475 products in account","LIMBO is an indie/adventure puzzle-platform video game, the first released title brought to us by the Danish developers Playdead. While the game itself was first released in July 2010 as an exclusive title on the Xbox Live Arcade, Playdead decided to re-release the game on other platforms after the Xbox exclusivity had ended. This meant that PS3 and PC players could get their hands on this amazing title after all. The developers never stopped there as they continued to release the game on other platforms such as OS X and Linux in 2012 and eventually even for the PS Vita and iOS in 2013. By continuously expanding the platforms this game can run on, the developers show us that they are proud of their first title and rightfully so.\n\nSettings\n\nYou wake up as a nameless boy, who I named George, in the middle of a dark and eerily forest. There is no explanation to how this boy got here, nor what his tasks are, so the start of the journey leaves you with an infinite amount of questions. If you don’t feel sorry for this young boy at first, you will certainly feel more pity towards this adolescent adventurer as the story advances when he comes across human characters who would rather have him dead then be helpful or died of unexplainable reasons. Other creatures are also lurking in the forest, such as giant spiders who enjoy spiking this poor boy with their legs. The end has us bringing the boy to a girl, presumably his missing sister when the game abruptly ends leaving us with yet more questions.\n\nGameplay\n\nSince LIMBO is a 2D platform video game, you can only steer the boy left or right, jump up, climb on ledges and up or down ladders and ropes. There is also an action-button where you can push or pull objects which are mostly part of a puzzle. Those who find more joy by playing with controllers are in luck since the Xbox Controller works perfectly. The graphics are dark and grayscale to provide more depth in the scenery. The sounds are kept at minimal, which leaves you with a setting that is both stunning and alarming. If your spider-senses aren’t tingling with this game, you sure are one hell of a cold-blooded player. At some point you may find yourself laughing hysterically, if you are evil-kindred that is, when you hear the splash-sounds the game creates when you’ve killed a creature or unkind humans. Since you will not always understand what you need to do to solve a puzzle, numerous amounts of deaths is inevitable. These horrifying deaths are accompanied with gruesome sounds and images of the boy being dismembered or beheaded. As if the creepiness of the settings wasn’t enough to cause panic in my mind.\n\nFinal conclusion\n\nOverall this game has left me amazed with the fact that such a simple design and story can leave me with such an eerie feeling. It may be an older game but I would certainly recommend it for any player who enjoys puzzles and platform games.\n\nThis review can also be found on nearlyenoughdice.com","February 17, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was only thanks to the generosity of a friend on Steam that I gained a copy to try and complete. But I haven’t been a fan of platformer games for some time, so would I enjoy Limbo?\n\nIn a mysterious, monochrome world, a boy awakens in a dark forest. He sets out in search of his sister. But in his way are the various denizens of this world, from giant spiders to parasitic worms, and even other kids…\n\nThere are four words that sum up Limbo: dark, artistic, minimalistic, and frustrating. Easily, the best part of the game is the presentation. It’s dark and moody, the graphics are just right for the macabre style, and the whole atmosphere is enhanced by a dark and appropriate soundtrack. Music and sound effects contribute to an eerie and intimidating atmosphere. It’s like Silent Hill, but, if anything, even darker. While at first glance it appears to be a kid’s game, it is anything but. I dunno what the rating is, but parents, THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS. This is a violent and dark game. Bleakly beautiful and beautifully bleak, but definitely not for kids.\n\nThe gameplay is another matter entirely. It is hard, even by the gold standard of Nintendo platformers. The gameplay consists of avoiding death and figuring out how to progress by trial and error, or as the publishers once called it, ‘trial and death’. And you will die. A lot. In manifold gruesome fashions. But figuring out how to get by the latest obstacles or adversaries will give you a feeling of accomplishment. Unfortunately, I tended to get more frustrated than feeling like I accomplished anything meaningful.\n\nThe game comes across as the illegitimate offspring of Silent Hill and Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysey (which, incidentally, was recently re-released on Steam). While the difficulty feels right for such a game, I just wish it wasn’t quite so hard. And the payoff in the minimalist story doesn’t quite work.\n\nThat being said, Limbo is pretty good. I like it mainly for the presentation more than the gameplay, but the gameplay itself has its own charms. It’s just a touch too hard for my liking…\n\nRATING: ***½","April 3, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game itself is gorgeous. The puzzles are just challenging enough that you get frustrated but feel accomplished when you figure it out. I killed myself in ways I didn't even know were possible.\n\nMy only gripe is the ending, but I think everyone interpretates it differently.

Its minimalistic approach works to its advantage, bringing out a silent, gloomy atmosphere that adds a tone of mystery. The controls are pretty basic, the physics is magnificent and the difficulty curve is just right. The best thing about the game would probably be that the puzzles you encounter dont require raw skill like in most platformers, but most of the times, if something you do doesn't work, you need to take a different approach. You will, nevertheless, die a lot, but the save points are so frequent that you will not be frustrated at all. Perhaps LIMBO's greatest shortcoming is its short duration, but its quality definitely makes up for it.","November 26, 2013","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once again though, this is all done in silhouettes but the deaths that happen if you fail or make a wrong step are graphic. (...and yet that makes me want to face the challenges again because they add to the "Oh crap! Now what?")\n\nGood luck if you are brave enough to go through the challenges to rescue this boy's sister. It won't be easy, and you have a long journey ahead of you, but it's worth the journey through LIMBO.\n\nYou have GOT to get this game if you like puzzle games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drydwen/recommended/48000/","drydwen","Drydwen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drydwen/","475 products in account","LIMBO is an indie/adventure puzzle-platform video game, the first released title brought to us by the Danish developers Playdead. While the game itself was first released in July 2010 as an exclusive title on the Xbox Live Arcade, Playdead decided to re-release the game on other platforms after the Xbox exclusivity had ended. This meant that PS3 and PC players could get their hands on this amazing title after all. The developers never stopped there as they continued to release the game on other platforms such as OS X and Linux in 2012 and eventually even for the PS Vita and iOS in 2013. By continuously expanding the platforms this game can run on, the developers show us that they are proud of their first title and rightfully so.\n\nSettings\n\nYou wake up as a nameless boy, who I named George, in the middle of a dark and eerily forest. There is no explanation to how this boy got here, nor what his tasks are, so the start of the journey leaves you with an infinite amount of questions. If you don’t feel sorry for this young boy at first, you will certainly feel more pity towards this adolescent adventurer as the story advances when he comes across human characters who would rather have him dead then be helpful or died of unexplainable reasons. Other creatures are also lurking in the forest, such as giant spiders who enjoy spiking this poor boy with their legs. The end has us bringing the boy to a girl, presumably his missing sister when the game abruptly ends leaving us with yet more questions.\n\nGameplay\n\nSince LIMBO is a 2D platform video game, you can only steer the boy left or right, jump up, climb on ledges and up or down ladders and ropes. There is also an action-button where you can push or pull objects which are mostly part of a puzzle. Those who find more joy by playing with controllers are in luck since the Xbox Controller works perfectly. The graphics are dark and grayscale to provide more depth in the scenery. The sounds are kept at minimal, which leaves you with a setting that is both stunning and alarming. If your spider-senses aren’t tingling with this game, you sure are one hell of a cold-blooded player. At some point you may find yourself laughing hysterically, if you are evil-kindred that is, when you hear the splash-sounds the game creates when you’ve killed a creature or unkind humans. Since you will not always understand what you need to do to solve a puzzle, numerous amounts of deaths is inevitable. These horrifying deaths are accompanied with gruesome sounds and images of the boy being dismembered or beheaded. As if the creepiness of the settings wasn’t enough to cause panic in my mind.\n\nFinal conclusion\n\nOverall this game has left me amazed with the fact that such a simple design and story can leave me with such an eerie feeling. It may be an older game but I would certainly recommend it for any player who enjoys puzzles and platform games.\n\nThis review can also be found on nearlyenoughdice.com","February 17, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything else is open to interpretation.\nIf you like games, which are not just mindless fun blasting enemies away but also let you think about what you are doing and why, this may be the perfect choice for you, mixed with a great art style!\nFor me, LIMBO represents one of the few titles, I'd give a 10/10 score!","December 27, 2011","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All animations are very detailed and smooth, in fact you can only see silhouettes. Depth is created with blur.\nLevel transitions are fluent, no loading screens, which creates a nostalgic feeling. You think you can always go back from where you came from. In Fact you can't, as some geographical obstacles block the way back.\nEven though the main purpose of this game is to solve puzzles, which are using physics and differ in grade of difficulty, LIMBO also has a profound background story or at least events.\nFirst you have to defend yourself against a spider, and cut of three of its legs. Then it's fleeing, but catches you later on a webbed floor. As you escape the spider is following you again, and you head it to a small village. The people are not delighted of course, as the spider is killing them. So they also try to kill you, in return you have to kill them. Afterwards you also manage to escape from the spider, which is so hurt, that only one leg is left. To get further, you have to tear out also the last leg, and use the spider's body.\nLater you see that the people of the village are sometimes controlled by a worm, which causes them to walk into water and to drown. Again you have to use a dead body to complete your journey.\nSeveral times you try to reach a girl, but you are led away by a worm or cannot reach her.\nAll these incidents are disturbing in some kind and thought-provoking.\n\nIt's a lot of fun to get all hidden eggs, and find the hidden level.\nI completed the game on Linux, it was running perfect, even the XBox 360 controller rumbled.","July 9, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetravellervslife/recommended/48000/","thetravellervslife","Domingocs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetravellervslife/","379 products in account","Limbo is an Inde Puzzle Platformer that is mostly standard in the sense of its mechanics (aside from a couple of shiny moments in the "late game"), but that has a strong point in its artistic choice and the way that the whole aesthetic of it is. It is a very interesting idea that I haven't seen in a lot of other games of this class (if at all really, I can't remember any other game that has done that before).\n\nThe mechanics of it, as I said, are very standard in comparison to any other puzzle platformer: you jump, you move stuff around, you try to find a way to keep moving forward and not to fall to your dead. The interesting thing about the game comes to play when you are confronted with some of the "enemies" of the game, but then again it is more of a time pressure in the puzzling than an actual fight against the AI of the game. Other special things that might happen in the game that changes the mechanics a little bit are some of the puzzles (I cannot explain them without spoiling a bit of the game though).\nThe game can be completed very fast. I finished it in about 3 and a half hours. I did not finish it to a 100% because that includes looking for little "light bubbles" around the world that are meant to be collectables or achievements, but these do not affect the game in any way. And again, I cannot imagine that finding all of them might extend the game all that much. The game itself in a mechanic point of view is okay. Maybe a little bit about average, but not much more than that. Challenging at moments and has some interesting ideas. You can be sure that you won't get trough a whole are without dying a couple of times, but it has nothing to do with skills, it has to with the game being a ♥♥♥♥ and setting you up to some traps you CANNOT see coming at all. I guess dying is just a part of the game, which actually makes sense considering the artistic view of it.\n\nThe artistic view and aesthetic of the game are the most attractive elements of this game. The way I would describe it is a black and white world (light and shadow kind of thing) that looks beautiful, but has a creepy and impressionistic element to it. It made me feel a little bit uncomfortable at some points because of the impressionistic nature of the art style. It is not "gore" in any way, but it is something that get's close to it in a 2D shadow-like graphics. Nothing to worry about, though; just a dark game. The world is very well made and it pays attention to little details, which is weird considering that you are basically seeing shadows of the world in a 2D view. A very good thing that I have to point out is that the game makes a very good work of letting you know what is actually a platform you can jump on and what is just a part of the background/fordground.\n\nThere is a story element to the game that, as far as I am concerned, is left to free interpretation throughout the whole game and up to the very end as well, not giving you any answers to any of your questions. Where are you? What/who are you looking for? Why is there other people here? The game has no dialogue at all, but it manages to get across just as much story as it wants to, leaving you with just enough questions for you to keep pushing forward and looking up theories in some forums after you have finished the game.\n\nWarts and all, this game is good. It is an experience that I enjoyed. Short and simple, but worth some of your time. Get it if you care more about story than about mechanics.\n\n7.5/10","December 15, 2013","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The very ambiance and atmosphere of this game is very unique, and has a kind of dark mordbidity that creepy, yet enthralling. You start off the game with no tutorials, not "how-to" walkthrough of any kind, and plunges you right in the game, leaving you to more-or-less figure it out yourself. This makes it seem more rewarding when you solve a puzzle without any help or tutorials at all, really without any idea what you're doing, intially. Its easy to see all the effort put into this game, from the physics and creative puzzles, to the mysterious art style, it is truly awesome.\n\nWould definitley recommend to anyone who enjoys a good puzzle game. 10/10","December 19, 2013","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drydwen/recommended/48000/","drydwen","Drydwen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drydwen/","475 products in account","LIMBO is an indie/adventure puzzle-platform video game, the first released title brought to us by the Danish developers Playdead. While the game itself was first released in July 2010 as an exclusive title on the Xbox Live Arcade, Playdead decided to re-release the game on other platforms after the Xbox exclusivity had ended. This meant that PS3 and PC players could get their hands on this amazing title after all. The developers never stopped there as they continued to release the game on other platforms such as OS X and Linux in 2012 and eventually even for the PS Vita and iOS in 2013. By continuously expanding the platforms this game can run on, the developers show us that they are proud of their first title and rightfully so.\n\nSettings\n\nYou wake up as a nameless boy, who I named George, in the middle of a dark and eerily forest. There is no explanation to how this boy got here, nor what his tasks are, so the start of the journey leaves you with an infinite amount of questions. If you don’t feel sorry for this young boy at first, you will certainly feel more pity towards this adolescent adventurer as the story advances when he comes across human characters who would rather have him dead then be helpful or died of unexplainable reasons. Other creatures are also lurking in the forest, such as giant spiders who enjoy spiking this poor boy with their legs. The end has us bringing the boy to a girl, presumably his missing sister when the game abruptly ends leaving us with yet more questions.\n\nGameplay\n\nSince LIMBO is a 2D platform video game, you can only steer the boy left or right, jump up, climb on ledges and up or down ladders and ropes. There is also an action-button where you can push or pull objects which are mostly part of a puzzle. Those who find more joy by playing with controllers are in luck since the Xbox Controller works perfectly. The graphics are dark and grayscale to provide more depth in the scenery. The sounds are kept at minimal, which leaves you with a setting that is both stunning and alarming. If your spider-senses aren’t tingling with this game, you sure are one hell of a cold-blooded player. At some point you may find yourself laughing hysterically, if you are evil-kindred that is, when you hear the splash-sounds the game creates when you’ve killed a creature or unkind humans. Since you will not always understand what you need to do to solve a puzzle, numerous amounts of deaths is inevitable. These horrifying deaths are accompanied with gruesome sounds and images of the boy being dismembered or beheaded. As if the creepiness of the settings wasn’t enough to cause panic in my mind.\n\nFinal conclusion\n\nOverall this game has left me amazed with the fact that such a simple design and story can leave me with such an eerie feeling. It may be an older game but I would certainly recommend it for any player who enjoys puzzles and platform games.\n\nThis review can also be found on nearlyenoughdice.com","February 17, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although it only uses a simple dark style, this creates a very special and unique atmosphere that is hardly ever seen in video games. Simply put, the artwork of the game is just awesome and I’m surprised at how much can be achieved just by using silhouettes. Playing through Limbo felt like discovering a work of art. Its puzzles are sometimes challenging, specially towards the end, but they don’t really become annoying at any point. The music is fitting, but what I liked the most is how well silence is used throughout the game. It really makes you feel lonely and lost. The biggest highlight of the game is, however, the appearance of the spider. Just seeing the way it moves sends shivers down my spine. It’s the kind of stuff that would have given me nightmares back in the day. Definitely one of the scariest and creepiest enemies in video games ever. Seriously, kill that thing with fire and bury it as deep as you can.\n\n\nAnd last we've got the "story". Yeah… well, I’m not sure I really understand what the game is about, but that doesn’t mean I did not enjoy playing it any less. it's true that I felt kind of puzzled at the end of the game when I realized I didn’t know what was going on though. As it happens to be fairly short, I’ll gladly return to it at some point in the future and maybe then I’ll be able to propose a theory or two about the true meaning of the game... until then… well, just stay away from that six legged terrifying creature and enjoy the game.\n","August 3, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Creepy settings in multiple enviroments. It has all the requirements to be a fantastic horror-game, yet there is more to it than that. This gruesome game is a must play for those who likes emergins themselves into another world.\n\nLIMBO is one of those indie games which, to some, are a piece of art. I most certainly agree. I morbidly enojyed every minute of it.\n\nPros and Cons++ Pros:\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Clever, Tricy, yet simple puzzles\n+ Learning curve\n+ Hidden Treasures and Replay value\n+ Full controller support\n\n- - Cons:\n- Short\n\nDetailsThe atmosphere of this game is amazing! ... You do indeed feel that something is lurking in the dark. LIMBO only uses two colours (and shades between them) and yet it creates an even more creepier feel to it than the common indie "horror"-games do. You don't know where you are, you don't know who you are. You only know you must find a way to continue.\n\nTo add to the beautifully executed creepiness of the visuals, a rather amazing sound-score is also a part of the game. It helps you emerge into the LIMBO. I can't really tell why, but the sounds are you so morbidly appealing. the spook-factor definetely goes up do to the sounds.\n\nThe puzzles and the platforming of the game may be simple once you figure out what to do. However figuring out exactly what to do, and what to move, and what to begin with is the tricky part. Simple in design, yet an interactive experience. You need to be observant to complete some parts, and others you need to watch out!  Buh!\n\nAs you progress through the chapters, you will die... And as you die, you'll begin to learn what to look out for, and the learning curve behind this is actually pretty well composed. The atmosphere of the game and the puzzles blend in so cleverly well, that you sometimes stop to just look at it. If you are looking for a challange, you can collect all the the hidden goodies in the game, to make secret level appear somewhere in the chapters. There you can really test your abilities to survive and think creatively. Be aware, you wil die... repeatedly... you need use the thinker as well as the fingers.\n\nThe replay value of the game is pretty nice for multiple reasons. For once there are the steam acheivements which you can collect by exploring secret locations. Some are very tricky, so check every possible hidden route. Especially the "DING!" and the "No Point in Dying" achievements can be devilish to acquire, so good luck. Secondly the game in itself is worth replaying purely because it's simply that good.\n\nAn top of all this the full controller support is of cause a benefit to the game. Don't be scared users who prefer keyboard; the controls are fine with either choice.\n\nThe only "flaw" to this game, is it's length. The length of the game is about two hours. I wouldn't even call this a mistake per se. The games length is actually what gives it such a high level of replay value. Either way, this game shouldn't be rushed, as is far to great an experience for that kind of play.\n\nFinal verdictNo colours, no words, no prolog, no epilog. And still... filled with atmosphere.\nA well deserved 9/10.","November 5, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What story it has is largely implicit—the game contains no dialogue. You simply wake in a dark wood, apparently a child, and set off to explore the dingy place in which you find yourself. But the genre of the game is certainly horror, though without most of the usual tropes. You are fragile—easily hurt, unable to swim, essentially defenseless—in a hostile and trap-ridden place. You will die many times. And the game does not divert your gaze from your death but rather renders each different mode of your demise in somewhat disturbing detail.\n\nThe artistic style of the game simultaneously keeps this from being too macabre and contributes greatly to the eerie atmosphere. The game's graphics are entirely silhouettes in shades of grey. Yet the landscapes and objects feel very detailed. Beautifully done lighting effects give the impression of a layered world mostly in shadow. All this makes for a beautiful noir environment well worth admiration in its own right. This game is more immersive with black and white outlines than much I’ve played that had expensive 3D-graphics.\n\nA subtler strength of the game is the way its physics feel naturalistic—you are acutely aware of the weight of objects and the force of gravity.  I doubt that the game’s engine is particularly remarkable in this regard, it’s an aesthetic effect. Great attention has been paid to the visual details of motion. But I think it also comes from player movement: in many games you play as a character with outsized physical capabilities. Even in shooters and platformers where such isn’t part of the story your movements are subtly superhuman (think of the lateral jumping featured in most platformers). Not here. Here you have a painfully tiny lateral jump and a rather slow top speed. Here objects don’t just slide easily into place but are dragged only with great effort.\n\nThe largest complaint I had with LIMBO was that it was too short. Though the puzzles were good, and admirably varied, not too many were very difficult. If one is adept at this sort of thing one could easily complete the game in just a few hours. They are an excellent few hours though. The puzzles are crisp, things to be grasped, not just fiddled with. For a little while LIMBO takes you to an unsettling, engrossing otherworld. And I’d very much like to visit again.","August 10, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's not that hard to beat like other platform games for example Braid.\n\nLIMBO has an awesome and anti frustration auto save game mechanism, where you will never rage quit and still enjoy the game as if you haven't died.\n\nYou will not get all achievements in your first run, but you have the option to load each chapter again to get 12 / 14 achievements very fast and easy. The achievement 'DING!' is much fun and challenging. The hardest achievement is 'No Point in Dying', but not impossible.\n\nIf you like Indie games especially puzzle games without have a big story in the background, then this is a game for your library.\n\nRecommend!; when it's on sale!, because the main gameplay time is around 3 hours.","June 27, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is pretty darn classic if you ask me. You can interact with some items like boxes, ropes, etc. in order to solve puzzles. What makes LIMBO such a great game is its graphical style and most importantly its atmosphere. Even though it is a 'die-and-retry', LIMBO will definitely make your heart go insane at times.\n\nFirst you have the musics, which aren't much diferent from one another, but they do so much on your immersion. Secondly, the game not giving you any kind of defense or way out sometimes, your conscience keeps the idea that you are very vulnerable.\n\nAnother topic I want to aboard would be the story, which by any means is NOT inexistent. You can Google that and get some speculations and hypotheses on that. The players actually make their own interpretation of this game's story, and that's what makes this game so mysterious and questionable.\n\nLIMBO is one good enigma you HAVE to get your hands on.","January 8, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But at the same time, it is so much more. It is a statement. Thing is, it's up to you to decide what it is saying.\nWhen I first launched the game, I was struck by how it looked. The aesthetic instantly reminded me of old black and white movies. I was blown away by the strange beauty of the place I woke up in. After learning relatively quickly that the game would give me no directions, I learned the controls, which are conveniently all next to each other. You can literally play Limbo with your left arm tied behind your back.\nI played forward, breezing through different puzzles, until the spider appeared. Do not play this game if you have extreme arachnophobia. This thing manages to make the spiders in Harry Potter or Eight Legged Freaks look like puppies. Eventually, you will overcome this foe, which will leave you feeling... Strangely sad for it. The people appear only shortly after the spider does, and there's even a little interaction between the two in the form of a human figure impaled on one of the spider's legs.\nThese people will kill you. Who are they? Why do they want you dead? When you get to the city, why is it so run down? It's post apocalyptic, it seems. Who was doing all the tests towards the end of the game? Why are the arthropods so gigantic?\nLimbo does not set out to answer these questions. In fact, it leaves you with more questions than answers. In a way, this is good. You can create a story not just for the little boy you play as, but also for the world he faces, and what he finds at the end. Some might not find this lack of information satisfactory.\nThere is just as little information in the descriptions for the achievements. Expect to hunt. Do not expect to easily find.\nAll in all, I like it. No, scratch that, I love it. Through the grim darkness, there seems to be a strange and ironic appreciation of life displayed here. I would definitely reccomend this game to others, and it will sit proudly on my desktop to be replayed many times.","September 26, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pixels_/recommended/48000/","Pixels_","Pixels The Brave","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pixels_/","183 products in account","“Indie Puzzle-Platformer” isn’t the most enticing of terms for a PC gamer. It seems like such an accessible kind of game that every bedroom dev and their mother has made one, but that’s only because of games like Limbo. Probably preaching to the choir here but on the assumption that you’ve never heard of this game, I’ll tell you why it’s great.\n\nThe mechanics are the standard 2-D side scrolling fare, except your movement speed and jump height feel a little less than other games of the genre. But that really plays into the main selling point of the game, which is the atmosphere. The entire game is in a bleak, high-contrast, black and white and beside some beautiful ambient sounds one might almost call music, the main sounds you’ll here are the ones made by interacting with the environment: Creaking wood or trudging footsteps – sounds normally minimised – are amplified to contribute an atmosphere of I guess “loneliness”. I’m unashamedly in love with this game’s sound design.\n\nLimbo’s release rightly sparked up the “games as art” debate when it was released, and if you experience it for a moment you’ll see why. All the above and more contribute to make you feel things: more than a usual sense of accomplishment or kick of adrenalin (although it has those too). It draws you in and makes you feel lost and powerless, but with a sense of hope spurred on by every small victory over the environment.\n\nLimbo is after all a game about a journey. Where from or to is not readily explained and it doesn’t really matter because the getting there is the experience. Every obstacle you overcome is simple but satisfying because it brings you closer to your goal, even though you have no idea when or where that is. And the journey never gets boring. The moment you get bored of the trudging moving of boxes on foot, the game shakes things up by rotating the screen or giving you a brain slug (no, really).\n\nIf you have no patience for trial-and-error gameplay then maybe the puzzles might irritate you a bit. The game will unfairly kill you sometimes, but pick you up right before your death with the knowledge of the oncoming buzzsaw. Also, if you’re expecting an especially long game you’ll be pretty disappointed (unless you SUCK at puzzles). Oh and if you don’t have a wired 360 controller you might fall afoul of imprecise digital keyboard controls.\n\nNegatives done? OK, roundup: Limbo is beautiful, atmospheric and (for me) the right level of challenging. I’d hesitate to call it perfect except that I can’t think of anything I’d change, but then I’m not a developer.\n","March 17","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"Limbo's" puzzles are perfectly fine. If you liked "Another World" or "Flashback" back in the day you'll probably enjoy Limbo's approach to puzzles (others who hate trial and error in gaming might pull their hair out though). But the puzzles, adequate as they are, are really just a pretext to look at the game, which I think, is one of the better looking I've ever played. With its stark black/white artwork, layers of film grain, and analog hiss the effect is a bit like the video game equivalent of a Guy Maddin movie (Don't know him? Take 5 minutes and see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4JmeXXRmZg).\n\nOf course it is a bit strange that a game would take the silent era of film as its "retro" model rather than, say, the 8 bit era of video gaming (there's something odd about using digital technology to so lovingly recreate the analog imperfections of another medium), but it's just so gosh darn pretty you don't have much time to think about how it doesn't make much aesthetic sense.","June 2, 2012","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dark, desolated, alone. You walked on, without the faintest idea of where you are heading. The forest is empty apart from the vague shadows of the leaves falling. A soft, obscured sound taps you on your shoulder.  You turned around, in hope of finding someone, something, that you can share your woes with. But no, that did not happen. All that stood in front of you are pillars and pillars of trees, looming, casting their ominous shadows onto you. You yelled, you screamed, and you cried, praying that a being, any being, will answer to your call. This is all to no avail. You have no choice but to venture on. However, deep down inside you, you know very well that someone is here, someone is listening to your calls, and that someone does not want you to be where you are. Welcome to Limbo.\n\nLimbo is nothing more than the silhouette of a world where the protagonist venture on in desolating loneliness. Using simple controls, you will have to interact with the surroundings as the story unfolds while making sure that the protagonist lives.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/recommended/48000/","outlaw953","Metal Bison [33rd]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/","263 products in account","Brought to you by the minds at Playdead, LIMBO is a bleak puzzle-platforming title that follows the bizarre trials of an unnamed adolescent as he journeys through perilous territories. Though the boy is simplistically presented, portraying no characteristics of audio cues, and the puzzles require much experimentation to achieve completion, the story it has to tell is engaging, as the protagonist perils through increasingly difficult struggles that occur subsequent to each other in a search for his lost sister.\nHere are a few items that I enjoyed about LIMBO:\n\nGameplay - LIMBO holds a striking comparison to other Indie titles when it comes to the control layout: it is entirely straightforward. As you may or may not have experienced in prior games, this title utilizes the directional keys for basic movement-with down allowing your character to drop down and grab onto a ledge-, the Space Bar to jump, and the Control key to interact with objects and the environment itself; others have stated that this is much more fluid while playing with a plug-in controller. This painless layout aides the player in not forcing them to have to remember too many needless actions; if the controls could be remapped, a player could even be able to play it with one hand. In summary, the controls are of simple design for a simple game. As described previously-without revealing too much in terms of story progression-the player directs the young boy through treacherous territories, which prompts the solving of intricate puzzles. These stages-numbering twenty-four in total-generally require the player to test the mechanics in a ‘truth and error’ approach, unless applied thought is given to the situation for a considerable amount of time prior to action. A decent reaction time is necessary for certain portions since platforming is included into the general mechanics, which can be somewhat frustrating and rewarding due to the intense precision specific stages necessitate.\n\nAtmosphere - LIMBO is very black and white in terms of its color palette in that it is literally variants of black and white (if you have read my previous reviews, you know that I am not permitted to make jokes due to the overall lack of comedy involved, hence this current display.) This helps to depict the grim depth of this title’s occurrences, as well as developing tone that is not distracting from the gameplay. Even the game’s playstyle is murky since the protagonist’s death is intended to remind the player what they had done wrong in a specific segment and as an indication of how the level’s mechanics are set. The game shifts seamlessly between transition periods with minimal loading and intractable events. Hence the end of the game, which directly transfers into the beginning and causes the player to feel as though the protagonist’s ordeals are hopeless. Throughout, however, you may just become attached to said protagonist as though his struggles become your very own. The protagonist portrays no vocal characteristics, though the background effects add enough ambience to compensate for this.\n\nTL:DR - For those with keen senses in regards to game mechanics, you will find LIMBO to be trivial yet enjoyable. This title is a deep, brooding tale with no words and only atmosphere to speak its demented thoughts. It is a relatively short title that can be frustrating at times but is worth its cost as an experience. Though the protagonist does not and cannot outwardly portray his ideals, you will surely fight for him to learn of his sister’s fate. You will learn much as a player and an adventurer, but do not lose hope in LIMBO. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

And perceptive you will indeed have to be: the game does not provide any hints for you whatsoever. You're on your own from the start, which is quite refreshing + making each step of progress satisfying.\n\nSome of the puzzles might need to get solved for the first time by trial and error (where error = death), but the game loads right before the puzzle "room" after that, so there's no frustrating punishing you for something you couldn't predict. But, you don't have to worry about a lack of challenge either - puzzles can take some thinking to crack + there's always that "play through the game from start to finish when dying 5 times or less" achievement to aim for.\n\nAesthetics are minimalistic, but despite that (or perhaps thanks to that) pleasing. I personally recommend playing the game at night with the lights off, so the world around becomes fittingly black'n'white just as well.","October 14, 2015","true","11.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its approachable and easy enough but every once in a while hit me with something that kept me guessing. The gameplay progresses with varying hazards and abilities such as gravity and lasers. Its art style and lack of sound (music not effects) really gave it an atmosphere that i enjoyed.  The length of the game was a pleasant suprise too, something quality that is less than 10hours can be a struggle to find sometimes. A nice story told even with a lack of dialog and a really creepy spider interaction makes this a little gem of a game.","October 17, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You will face the trials of gaint spiders, ancient tribe warriors, gigantic saws and much more. All this takes place in a fluid black and white atmosphere with a soothing set of ambience in the background. However it is not without its flaws. I have two major complaints against this game, the first being that there is zero help whatsover on how to play this game. To learn the controls, I had to find which key opened the  main menu to open to the control manager. (For future players, this menu can be opened with the "escape" key and the controls on a standard keyboard are the arrow keys and the control key for interacting with an article. Also, when you are upside down, the jump key is the "down" button.) The second major issue with this game was the story. Except for the game's description, there is no way for the player to understand the story. Also, the end of the game was... open ended to say the least. I feel the developers could have done a better job explaing to the player what had happened to cause this "limbo." All in all, the game is great, but for ten dollars, I expect at the very least, a help section in the game's menu.\n\nGENRE TYPE: Puzzle/Action-Adeventure\nMUSIC: 2/5 - There wasn't much music involved with the game. A bit too quiet for my tastes.\nSOUND: 4/5 - Excellent job with the background noise. You hear everything from birds to the boy's breathing.\nSTORY: 1/5 - This is the main issue here. The developers neglected to inform the players of the objective and the end result.\nPUZZLES: 4/5 - You should be able to figure them out yourself, but an optional hint system would have been appreciated.\nGRAPHICS: 5/5 - While monochrome, the game's fluid-like phsyics and detail makes the world pleasing to the eye.\nDIFFICULTY: 4/5 - Simple enough at first, but it gradually increases to a fairly moderate challenge in the end.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 3.8/5 - Great job on physics and puzzles, but poor execution of main storyline.","December 30, 2013","true","6.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/recommended/48000/","Futurato","Futura&!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/","610 products in account","There has been much written about heaven and hell. The absolute paradise of the former and the absolute pain of the latter are some of only a small handful of human ideas that are immune to hyperbole; our mortal descriptions of such places will never be too much and of that we can be sure.\n\nBut what about what lies between? The concept of purgatory is a much harder one to pin down. Thoughts on the concept, both lay and philosophical, have defined it as anything from a second mortal existence to an afterlife of absolute nothingness. If the title is to be believed, LIMBO ostensibly takes place in this in-between afterlife. It may not be hell, but it is a far cry from heaven.\n\n"Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters LIMBO." This lone sentence is the closest thing to a synopsis that the creators have given us. How the boy got to limbo is unclear. Why you must press forward is unclear. But to stand still is to both promise and condemn yourself to nothing.\n\nBut after all, LIMBO is a puzzle platformer and the instinct to move forward is natural. The puzzles are elegantly designed and make the most of your limited capability for interaction: running, jumping, and moving objects. Everything feels right and the game plays as a good platformer should.\n\nLIMBO is not content to only be another decent indie platformer, though, as the puzzles very quickly become trials of dread and fear. Death has always been part of platformers, but LIMBO is almost eager to remind you of the pain. In your desire to move forward, you only introduce to your character more ways to die. If you miss that jump, you will fall down a pit and be impaled on the spikes below. You will have your body torn to pieces by the crushing force of a giant bear trap. You will fall into a ragdoll's seizure as electricity fries you. Even the more quiet deaths feel horrible; drowning in water is a whole process of struggling and sinking before becoming still. The screen will linger and you will sit with it until you are ready to press a button to respawn. Do you want to try again?\n\nThe hazards of LIMBO seem too much to all be manmade, but they all seem purposeful. It is hard to ignore the sense of malice that pervades this world. The colorless settings and the silhouetted character designs do some amount in making the deaths less gruesome, but only so much. You might find yourself standing still when you get that second chance. To stand still is to do nothing, but to move forward is to create your own hell.\n\nBut maybe you do keep pushing forward and maybe you do succeed more often than you fail. The purpose of this boy's search for his sister is unclear: it could be a journey of redemption, or love, or curiosity. Either way, that there is even a chance at success and a chance at relief at the other end of each dangerous trial is, in a way, a promise of heaven. There will be hard times ahead, but the pain is not infinite. To be given the chance to find an answer and reach an end is a small but merciful thing. But before that, the hard times will only get harder.\n\nThere will always be ideas about what lies between heaven and hell, life and death. LIMBO has earned its spot among the best artistic representations of such a place – not only through its undeniable dark beauty, but also the fear that a similar world might await us.","March 6, 2014","true","4.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sadly those are the only real selling points of this otherwise quite generic puzzle platformer.\n\nLong version:Limbo is all about style: a noir-like, minimalist, but nonetheless unique art style. If you wouldn’t mind staring at what you see in the preview screenshots for 2-4 hours, then Limbo will definitely be your game. And it knows how important first expressions are, because the initial atmosphere is superb, the eerie forest sets a very memorable tone.\n\nStill, it is mostly just a façade. A façade that hides a fairly generic puzzle platformer set in the most overused and tired settings for such games, a boring factory. A façade that tries to hide the fact that the game has no story: all you do is walk right and try to get past various obstacles that prevent you from walking right.\n\nAs for puzzle mechanics, there are a few clever ones, like a parasite that makes you unable to stop moving in one direction (usually towards a pit), or some gravity manipulation. They are too rare though in the endless sea of uninspired box and switch puzzles. And they aren’t even difficult puzzles; the difficulty comes from trying to implement the easy solutions with incredibly tight timing and jumps. You’re gonna die. A lot. (©LordKat)\n\nIf puzzle platformers are your thing, by all means, get it. Despite my musings, it is one of the better ones to come out in these years. Just don’t have too high expectations for it.","August 22, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It never traipses about claiming to be anything more than it is.

You are tossed into a bleak, unforgiving, and cruelly beautiful world to... move to the right (and die quite a few times on your way). Might not seem like much, but it's stunning and worth every minute.\n\nObligatory mention that Martin Stig Andersen's work on this only reinforces my mild to manic obsession with well done soundtracks. Phenomenally moody, reminiscent of quite a bit of John Luther Adams' work. I can't imagine anything more fitting.\n\nA small part that I particularly enjoyed are that the achievements... are actually achievements.

Lately, indie titles like Braid, Trine, Limbo and others have been some of my favorite games overall. Not only does Limbo have amazing puzzle solving gameplay but it also has a... I feel weird saying this... a very touching storyline. Also, for a game with no writen or spoken words, Limbo has possibly the greatest atmosphere of any game (only competition would be S.T.A.L.K.E.R.) and it never gets old. I hope to God there is a sequel to this game, either way, I cannot wait to play the next game from developer Playdead, and please do yourself a favor and experience this game.\n\n5/5","August 10, 2011","true","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is hilariously sick, creating an atmosphere easily meant for older crowds, despite the childish appearance of the game. The graphics and rendering are amazing and beautifully crafted. The puzzles start easy and increase in difficulty at an even pace, building up in darkness as well as becoming more challenging. The game forces the player to pay close attention and really think of what they have to do. The only downside to the game is how relatively short the gameplay is. After only a few extremely short hours, one reaches the end of the game. While the game itself is interesting and fun, the shortness creates an overall sense of one being unfufilled. Unless, the player is someone who enjoys a quick and challenging game.

In spite of that I would highly recommend LIMBO if you like games that involve thought-provoking puzzles, simply because the experience is that AWESOME while it lasts. The lack of options is a minor issue & doesn't really impact the enjoyment of the game itself.\n\n-- read the FULL REVIEW at http://www.metacritic.com/user/Shad0WeN --","December 28, 2011","true","16.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I actually looked it up and maybe the one guy I found who figured it out pulled it out of some nether region I'll never fully know, but it somewhat makes sense.  Point being, there is no narrative, the story speaks through what environments and little cutscenes you see but otherwise you are left to your own conclusion as to what is going on.\n\nGraphicsNot that story matters when the game looks this pretty, or morbid depending on how you look at it.  It uses a Noir inspired aesthetic with fluid sprites and movement.  Grass sways, boxes make crack a bit under the weight of your character, lighting also plays a big role in the game setting tone.  Your character also has a tendency to look around and move his hands (more as a hint when a puzzle clue is near) and it's so fluid and lovely to behold.\n\nGameplay/ControlsI put both categories in here since I felt given the nature of how this game actually is, felt are one in the same.  You solve puzzles, you use fancy buttons to solve puzzles.  The problem is the puzzles cause you to die repeatedly, and there is absolutely no way you can prevent your death in some cases on your first (or third try) due to the fact that simply jumping over say what looks to be a dangerous hazard actually wasn't dangerous, the thing you landed on upon jumping over it was the real hazard.  Assuming your guy even jumps or decides to jump to early.  For some reason they decided to map the jump button to the up arrow key, and there is no way to remap it, no controller support, nothing.  So you will accidentally jump off of a box trying to climb on top of it due to overly twitchy controls.  Add in trollish puzzles that just outright kill you for no apparent reason other then the fact you are a noob and don't have the thing perfectly memorized is rather unforgivable for a puzzle game.  There are hard puzzles, there are puzzles that punish mistakes but never should a puzzle kill you for just trying to be cautious for kicks.\n\nSoundAs far as the music goes, it relies on ambience instead of outright "scary" music.  Most of the time you are hearing whatever level's background noise would be prevelent (wind brushing through the trees for example) minus a few areas where the ambience does kick up and leave you unnerved.\n\nConclusionWhile the game is pretty, and sounds fabulous, I don't recommend it unless you are a glutton for punishment.  The Demo of this game is actually what the rest of the game should've been, however once you buy the game and are past that it all goes downhill very fast and you don't give a crap about anything then just wanting to finish it and never have to play it again.","February 26, 2014","false","5.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I mean it. No, you don't ride a horse around and stab through giants. But this comparison to Limbo is justified in another way. This is a staple for Indie games. This is video game art. Like Shadow of the Colossus on the Playstation 2, Limbo tells gamers that a game can be beautiful, mysterious, and a subtle, yet deep tale about what one would do to bring back the one they hold dear.\n\nIt took me about three hours to beat this game. The average gamer could probably beat it in 3-4 hours. But that's really not a big deal, because the "puzzles" are so intuitive and the overall game is so beautiful in its simplicity that it demands another playthrough.

When the spider catches you and spins you into its web, you will shudder with revulsion. When you finally (and brutally) tear the final leg from the spider's  body, you will marvel at how satisfying such a gruesome act could be.\n\nAnd all this is after just 48 minutes of playing the game!

Bonus points for acheiving this feat in such a minimalist environment with no vocals/text or any other in-game guidance (other than said environment itself).\n\nFinal thought: I don't enjoy horror games. While this game has caused me to feel terror, I don't clasify it as 'horror'.

He doesn't even know if she's alive. As you go through LIMBO you go through hard puzzles and through dark eery places. The boy you play as, goes through of what I think is his life. Forest being his child-hood, Hotel is his teenage age and Industrial as his adult hood. Overall this game has a great story. Ending may be confusing for some people, but if you take the time to think what is happening and what you're doing throughout the story, you will get this game.\nMY RATING ----> 4.5/5 ~Great story, Great gameplay, Would highly replay.","December 1, 2013","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a game in black and white and you could quite possibly be able to consider this game a "rage game" depending on if the small puzzles are hared for you to time perfectly or just confusing. I enjoyed this game and I honestly did rage a little bit playing this game. If you find all the hidden eggs there is a hidden level that gets unlocked. Good luck not dying and have fun.","November 18, 2013","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
