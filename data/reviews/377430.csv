Who is Mike? features an interesting little story of two people named Mike Jansen who look the same, and think the same, trying to figure out who is real, and who is not, with the help of their girlfriend. It shines in the music department, great pieces really setting the scene for each outcome, the writing ranges from humourous to dramatic and makes you think real deep about what to say next. Long story short, it's a great tale and I really recommend it to anyone who wants a good mystery.

Getting to them is a pain on its own: Which ending you get depends on how you answer a short series of questions. This would usually be alright, if the paths to each ending weren't so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ random. Choosing between liking dogs or hyenas can completely change the entire plot of the game, and since there's no ramifications between questions, you don't get any indication of which ending you're headed towards, until it's already too late to turn back. If you refuse to use a walkthrough, be prepared for a ton of save-scumming, and just randomly checking every single possible combination of answers until you find the 6-7 endings missing from your list.\nI don't really like the way that every single route completely contradicts eachother either, but that's really more of a matter of personal taste.\n\nAll that said, the game is alright. The art, despite having a few slips here and there, is pretty good, and the narrative can create some pretty good tension in important scenes. The music, as simple as it is, is pretty eerie, and really helps the atmosphere. And the story really compels you to keep reading, since there's no way of knowing what you're about to find. Definitely pretty good for a free to play game.\n\nAs frustrating as getting every single ending can be sometimes, I had fun with this one. Definitely recommended if you have an hour or two to kill.","November 18, 2015","true","1.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It can get repetitive when the protagonist is angsting, but in a believable way.\n- Unusual plot that keeps you guessing until the last minute.\n- Free.\n\nCons:\n\n- Short. Which is fine, especially for a free game, but if you like your VNs long with many branches, this is not one of them.\n- Lack of variety in player choices. For most of the game, you'll be faced with the same decision again and again in slightly different contexts.\n- Non-intuitive branches. Maybe it's just me, but it took a lot of trial and error, followed by reluctant use of a guide, to figure out how to get all the endings that branch off from the main section of the game.\n- Inconsistent storyline. This is the one truly bad thing about this game - instead of the endings gradually giving you more and more bits of the puzzle, like in a good mystery VN, different endings reveal that you were playing different scenarios all along. It's a bit like a murder mystery where the the murderer turns out to be a different person depending on the choices you make during your investigation, even though the clues are all the same each time.\n\nIn the end, I definitely recommend it. It is a distinct and memorable experience that costs no money and not too much of your time.","October 1, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The only other person in the room with you is none other than yourself. The question is are you the real Mike?\n\nFirst of all, the story line is intriguing: the tension between both Mikes and Sarah (depending on one of the choices you make) works really well. One of the reasons why it succeeds in this is the music. It's disonant yet simplistic sound creates great tension in it's darkened setting. The characters are interesting and their dialogue is enough to gauge their personalities. The artwork is absolutely beautiful and matches the grittiness to this tale.\n\nHowever, the story itself is very short (but it can be shorter depending on your choices) and for a visual novel, you don't get to interact that much in terms of choosing how to answer or make your decision. Speaking of decisions, it lets itself down a little when you make some important choices.  The fake in the story is some kind of life draining demon, who can shape-shift into their victims and pretty much steal their identity. Depending on how you play the game, you could either die by leaving the house and inadvertedly let the demon drain your soul/life force, get shot by Sarah (Mike's girlfriend) when attacking the 'Fake Mike' or get stabbed by the demon when they transform into Sarah (only if you decide not shoot her). Focusing on the first two deaths, you as the player would either be the real Mike or the fake Mike, but it depends on how you respond to the questions Sarah asks both Mikes. You wonder who's persective you were playing from in the first place once you obtain the endings, where both Mikes end up in a fist fight. I was certinly confused when I played through again.\n\nSaying that, if you're looking for a visual novel with a good storyline where you can discuss your theories, and what's going on and you want to feel a lot of tension between characters, this game will satisfy those needs. Just over look what I said in the spoiler part and you should be fine.\n\nI give this game 7/10 .","October 17, 2015","true","1.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/razinghel/recommended/377430/","razinghel","Dekay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/razinghel/","734 products in account","A very compelling who-done-it with a supernatural twist. When it comes to visual novels, the dialog between characters can make or break the game. If the dialog is too forced or cheesy it'll completely break the immersion, however, 'who is mike' strikes the right cadence between lightheartedness and dead seriousness all the time without breaking that very important immersion.\n\nThe subject is relate-able and a bit creepy to me because on a personal level I've had a family member taken away by mental illness, it's scary, they end up a shell of themselves that you don't know anymore but 'who is mike' is a bit different. You gain consciousness only to find yourself standing face to face with you. Both of you insist to be the real thing but one is pretending, and for sinister reasons. Great original story.\n\nLet's talk about the sound, the cues are spot on and really help drive the emotion of the game. While the loops could be managed better (a bit jarring when a track restarts) the pieces chosen are perfect to cultivate the fear, foreboding, or relief the developer wants the player to feel.\n\nThere aren't many different backdrops or character models but given the length of the game it suffices. If there is one thing I'd like to change about the game is to have the character text actually originate in speech bubbles from the characters speaking. Having to read the text at the bottom all the time really does detract from the overall 'visual novel' element of such games. The dialog would more powerful if you can see the face of the person as they speak it.\n\nIs this free game worth 2 hours of your time? Yes! I wholeheartedly recommend playing it, but keep in mind it's not really for unsupervised children (strong language).\n\nIf you want to hear me narrate 15 minutes of the game feel free to watch my first time playing it below (minor spoilers):\nhttps://youtu.be/0PAZw8sAYT8","November 7, 2015","true","2.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Now, obviously, this is more than acceptable for a free game, so unlike many an arsewipe out there in Steamland, I'm not going to use this game's brevity as cause to condemn it.  Nor am I going to argue that it's not by-and-largely well-written, and reasonably entertaining for what it is.  Hell, it's even a mite bit intriguing, especially near the beginning.  But the content of the story is highly unlikely to blow your socks off unless you were either cloned last week, and/or have never read a sci-fi short story or watched an episode of The Twilight Zone (any series or era) in your life.  It's cool.  It's nice.  It's probably even worth fifteen minutes to a couple of hours of your time, if you're the type who's determined to see each and every ending.\n\nMe...I'm good for now, though there's every chance I may give it another burl sometime between now and death.  Recommended, if only by virtue of its free-ness and undeniably solid quality.  Unless you don't like reading.  Though having said that, enough of you seem to enjoy those mindless "clicker" games, so who knows, it may even have some appeal to that most perplexing of target audiences, since you really will get to click your left mouse button an awful lot between the start and end of the game.\n\nVerdict: 6.5/10.","September 30, 2015","true","0.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

You really can figure it out with a few tries, and it only takes about five minutes to get to the main ending, and around a minute for the shortest. Not a challenge for any seasoned visual novelist, I can assure you, but it can be fairly confusing at times.\n\nArt was so-so as far as I can see. Slightly better than what you might see in any other plain game, but nothing special. Pretty pixelated for a game of this type, too, but I'm sure that was on purpose. Story was original by my standards, which, though my standards are not very high, I can at least pick it out among the other stories that attempted to center around clones.\nSoundtrack was better than expected, building the atmosphere in a way that wouldn't be possible had there been none at all. However, I don't feel it stood out in any other ways, and thus faded into the background at most points. Still, it deserves a mention.\n\nIt really didn't take me too long to get through this. That's probably a good thing, as I tend not to stick with anything that doesn't offer achievements. That's kind of my selling point, I guess. But achievements or no, I'd give this a whirl.

I love the design of both characters and they are well-drawn. They also have several poses and some scene-specific drawings.\n\nSecond, the dialogue is fantastic.

Which can be viewed as good or bad i guess :/  It could have had more backgrounds, the living room can only be stared at for so long.The art style is great and im really thankful that it wasn't in the giant eyes cutesy anime style(most visual novels' art tends to lean that way and its honestly cringy in such a serious atmosphere or mood).The story is really good though, it really made me think about the whole clone scenario thing, and it honestly wouldn't be as funny as it is in the cartoons ono  . Its put together very well and its crazy how quickly the atmosphere changed! One second cracking jokes about your brother and gossiping about a model and the next commiting cold blooded murder!!! tldr;big on art,atmosphere, and endings , short on time and some dialogue. Must play if you enjoy danganronpa and crime interogation shows.","February 27","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played a visual novel before so I didn't know what exactly to expect.\nThe gameplay is simple, throughout the game you will have to make choices at certain points. You can only choose from two different options. In the end, this effects your outcome and you can get up to over 9 different endings (I think.) Based on your choices a lot of interesting twists could happen and some I was a little bit suprised.\nA bonus of this game is whenever you want to try to get a different ending there is a 'Skip' button that would allow you to fly through the story without having to read the plot again. Another thing that I liked is that there is some humor here and there that was great.\nWith the game being a bit short I still enjoyed the game a lot. If you like a bit of mystery and choice making then this would be a great game to try out.","March 12","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Way too short however! Even though I proceeded slowly & cautiously, I managed to complete the game the first time within 50 minutes of playtime.\n\nIt started out really well and then poof. Before I knew it, it was over. Too bad!\n\nDoesn't take long to install though, so it's suitable for anyone who's new to VNs and would like to get a taste of the genre, without needing to spend a penny or deal with downloadable content to enjoy the story.\n\nThe art, sound effects and music are of the exact same quality as applied in "CUPID" (another project from the developers).\n\nJust as effective though!\n\nIf you like the look, feel and delivery style of "Who Is Mike?" then, there's a big probability you would like "CUPID" as well.\n\nBoth contained great music!\n\nGo ahead and see for yourself! :)","March 6","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
