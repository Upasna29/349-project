Easy to play, fun.\n\nPros\n-If you have people for LAN\n-Like Controller Games\n-Like Top-down Games/Arenas\n-Does have online function, though you might be waiting for new players new release.\nCons\n-Brand new, no sale yet, so be a while before other players.\n-Bots get boring even in hardest setting. Although they are a great way to practice.\n-Possibly no newer content, abilities using buttons with be nice.\n-Can get boring from repetitive in general. But I can see myself logging in a few times a day to play.\n\nOverall, great game. Just needs new features and if you are hesistant to pay, wait for a sale.","March 15","true","1.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

Incomplete, yes, but I'm sure that, if given enough time, Mech Anarchy will become a great game.","March 15","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The enemies range from incredibly stupid to incredibly smart depending on the setting chosen for their AI.\n\nThe online multiplayer portion of this game is where the action is at. The netcode seems flawless, with no noticeable lag on the client. The game currently supports games of 8 players on-line, hopefully more in the future.\n\nI had an incredibly fun time playing this game through different iterations as new builds were released, and I can honestly recommend it to anyone who wants to have some fun with friends online.","May 7","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
