"Not another 'zombicide game' trying to say it's a 'survival game'." But he got it for me, and it woud be rude to not atleast give it another shot. I'm rather glad I did.\n\nI started play in a -private game- with my friend, set to the medium difficulty. Day one was a mess, I figured I was playing another left4dead 'survival' game which was all about killing as many zombies as one humanly can before wandering to the next area. Well, after breaking a few weapons on zombies and getting no reward outside of what lint was in the zombie's pockets, I knew I was wrong, and night had begun to set in. My friend luckily -had- played before and warned me that things got a lot different at night, so we managed to make it through with no deaths, but many close calls.\n\n50 days in, I'm more than hooked. Survival is the key- Food, water, scavving, repairs and building at day. Shelter, security and stealth at night. Crafting damn near anything in a Alpha game, from multiple layers of cobblestone walls outside of what used to be a log cabin. Each peice taken the long crafting process of finding rocks, chopping them down into stone and then turning into cobblestone. More? We built a second story for storing items. More? Two layers of spiked pits surrounding our 'cabin' with only a ♥♥♥♥♥ for us living people to cross. More? Another story, turned into a rooftop farm of corn, blueberries and potatos.\n\nNights can get rough at the "Spillway Estate" as we have now dubbed our fortress, we try to keep quiet throughout the nights, limiting player activity to things that dont make sound, or carry foods on our person that generate smell. ( Yes, that's a thing!) A chest near the front door full of easy repaired and built weapons. Pistols, a shotgun and some ammo for it, fresh from the forge! when things get really bad- The newly crafted fallback point, a basement/bunker. Metal walls , floor, and roof, only one entry which is blocked in times of emergencies. Beds, emergency food and water (or tea!) supplies stored next to some of our most powerful weapons. ( Chainsaws, landmines, a rocket launcher, and a whole lot of shotgun ammo! )\n\nTo sum it all up, it has a few minor bugs, but it's in alpha, and they generally get fixed up rather swiftly! Worth the money, great with friends- Especially when you notch up the difficulty and find yourself hiding for your life in a closet with nothing but a stick to protect yourself!\n\nLots of potentiel, and fun as is.\n\n9/10\n\n\n(Aug 19, 2014 Update: 1)\nBeen awhile since I posted this, but it has been brought to my attention that a good amount of people have read this. So I thought I owe it an update due to the many, many changes to the game:\n\nCrafting: Crafting is mostly the same beast as it was when I started, though so, so much more crisp now than it was before. A lot of the bugs have been worked out (Some still linger). You now can upgrate tiles after you lay them into more fortified version of their previous selves. (A wooden frame - Wooden block. - Reinforced wooden block - Metal reinforced wooden block.) As well as many other types of similar things, it's rather neat I think.\n\nRandom world generation?! I admit the same ol' world was getting a bit old and such. So when I heard they had a random world with some neat UI upgrades I was excited. And it is nice, though has its bugs and the occasional cluster of buildings you recognise from the old world, but still adds a great stuff. Maps now have a "fog of war" making it harder, and more exciting to go scavanging!\n\n\nTo come? I heard character creation comes at the next big patch. Could be wrong though.\n\nMy rating remains the same.","April 18, 2014","true","310.9"," 1,179 of 1,264 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","179","1","0","14"

Then I went Rambo. Fought my way out and ran to a house. Hid in the attic until the sun came up.\n\nDay 2 - Found a few weapons and some rudimentary armor in the house next door. And the upper half of the owner. Gotta stay mobile until I find a place to settle in and make it defensible.\n\nDay 5 - Snuck around and scavenged houses for food and potable water. No sign of...people. Am I the last one alive?\n\nDay 10 - Found an abandoned military outpost. Made a door and barricaded myself inside of the largest tent for now. Will scavenge the surrounding area during daylight only.\n\nNight of the 10th day - They're everywhere. Oh God. They walk right by my tent. I'm cowering in a corner behind a desk with a pistol and a wooden club that I wrapped in some scrap iron. Only 15 rounds of 9mm for the pistol. I hope that they don't decide to tear the tent down around me.\n\nDay 11 - Began collecting resources. I think that I'll try sleeping tonight.\n\nDay 12 - They woke me up 2 times, but never took notice of me. I'm glad that I don't snore.\n\nDay 25 - Have been fortifying my position, dug a trench to trap the undead. Only the "Spider Zombies" can get out. I need to contain them somehow.\n\nDay 50 - Currently I have a fortress surrounded by metal tipped log spike traps 3 deep so they can't escape. Then I just stand on my roof and snipe the spider zombies. Collect loot and smile. I think that I'll be ok.\n\nDay 79 - Been farming. Food is plentiful now. Weapons and ammo are easy to make. I built my fortress on top of a deposit of iron, lead and potassium nitrate, with coal deposits poking out of the ground all around me! What luck!\n\nDay 1?? - There's no end to them. I heard a scream the other night. Not one of them. It sounded...human. Female. Close. By the time I made it outside at first light, all I found was a pool of blood and entrails a half mile from my fortress. Next to the carnage I found a purse with some pictures of a pretty young blonde lady with a cheerleading outfit on in one picture, in another she was in an expensive looking dress cuddled up to who was probably the star quarterback at her high school. The last picture was her with what must have been her family on vacation at an expensive looking beach house. They looked so happy. Her driver's license said that her name was Cindy Batross and she was 17 years old. There was a notepad with illegible scribbles and crude drawings of people eating each other. I cried as I realized that she saw my lights and was desperately trying to make it to the safety of my home. What may have been my only hope for companionship was now in the rotting stomach of the undead.\n\nStardate 4/20 Delta V - Venison stew is good. It's lonely here. I found pictures in houses and I talk to the nice people in them. You want to be my friend, Jimmy? Ok. I promise that I won't chew on your bones.\n\nDay whatever - What was that noise? They scratch inside my skull sometimes. I saw the cheerleader. She doesn't have a stomach anymore, but she walks around with a little smile on her face and coos sometimes. Then she screams when I try to talk to her from my roof. Maybe I should let her in. Maybe she just wants to be friends.\n\nNight time now. She didn't want to be friends. Only my iron helmet kept her from chewing my face off. I cut her head off with my hunting knife. She didn't have any manners at all.\n\nHump Day - I sewed her head back on and sat her in a chair. We talked for hours while I cooked some vension stew for us. She's nice, but a little cold. I hope that she's on the pill.\n\nYear of the Rat - I caught that ♥♥♥♥♥ Cindy looking at one of the other guys in the photos today. She denied it, but I know there's something going on while I'm out risking my life for us. Ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nJudgement Day - Cindy had to go. I had no choice. I had told her too much about Mrs. Doubtfire and she was plotting a coup to reap the benefits of our trade agreement with the rabbits. I loved her, but now her bones are scattered in the ashes.\n\nThe Day I Die - Spent the last 30 winters here. I lost my mind a long time ago, though I regained some of my faculties after much reflection. I can no longer keep up with my home. It's only a matter of time before they break through. I never did find anyone else. No one came. The supply drops stopped long ago. I can only assume that the rest of the world succumbed to this hellish plague. The undead continue to march in all directions.\nI have stockpiled a large amount of explosive devices, guns and ammo. Tonight I will open the bridge to my door for them and when they are clamoring to peel my flesh from my bones, I'll let them in.\nThe world will see the last survivor, not dying peacefully in my sleep, but raging against the darkness in one last epic battle. But I won't let them kill me. When it's finally hopeless, I'm going out on my own terms. Let them eat what is left of this shell after my spirit departs. Those damned fools won't make me one of them. My life is over.\nI can hear them now. There must be close to a hundred. It's time to face my fate.\nHere I come, Cindy. I'm sorry for everything.\n\nNOTE: This is a dramatization of in game events and doesn't represent actual game play. Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing and I can't wait to see where they take it for the end game. BUT, this little story was entirely made up in my head based on my experiences in the game and a fateful first encounter with a cheerleader zombie that seriously freaked me out. And based on the positive comments so far, I may turn this into a short story.\n\nUpdate 7/21/15: I've managed a plot that I can mold as more content is released and have been working on a solid beginning to explain just "appearing" as if from nowhere in Navezgane amidst the carnage. It should please quite a few fans of the survival horror genre. I'm not looking to invest a lot of time into a project that won't yield any revenue, so a very short story will set the bar and sway my decision to pursue a published work (with TFP's blessing, of course) in the future. I'll see how well it is received here and on some FanFic sites first. But rest assured, it's in the works as you read this text.\nStay safe, survivors.

Very few may say that "Oh, it's just another zombie survival game" or "Oh, it's just a DayZ knockoff". Well, I'm here to tell you that this is not the case at all. I own H1Z1, DayZ, and 7dtd. I have to say that this is the best one. Why?\n\n1. The developers are actually going in the right path.\n\n2. Loot system is pretty awesome.\n\n3. Crafting system is also pretty awesome, may take a bit to get used to. But, still awesome.\n\n4. Instead of just piling blocks and making a box-house, there are actually physics to the building system. Like, in some cases, you actually have to put support. Otherwise that sniper tower or that neat house will collapse on you. Which has happened to my friends. It's kind of satisfying to watch, but damn you're mad if it's your structure.\n\n5. The different variety in enemies is cool! Right now, you have: bees, dogs, and zombies; and other different kind of zombies to add to that.\n\n6. Speaking of zombies. This game's zombies have something that DayZ doesn't have. You know... They actually pose a threat and can move in numbers. There are moments when you see that police station surrounded by a horde of zombies and you think to yourself "No, I'm good", because they actually threaten you. The fact that they sprint at night by default (settings can be changed) also adds a thrill to the game. To a point in which you don't even want to leave your shelter at night because you can hear a spider zombie calling a nearby horde. Hordes also happen randomly at anytime and anywhere. This is also unheard of in DayZ. You never see a horde in that game. Also, as the days go on, the zombies start to get a little tougher. You start to feel that the apocalypse is worsening. Zombies are also smart.\n\n7. There's nothing more satisfying than fortifying your base to prepare for the undead. This game does a very good job at that. You can do almost whatever your mind imagines.. Wanna put a trench that surrounds your base and put spikes at the bottom of it? Do it. Want to salvage land mines from an overrun military base and use them as your own? Do it. Want to build a huge wall around your base? Do it. However, don't think that just putting a wall around your base will help. Zombies will rip through it and actually dig under the wall. We've seen this done in our server before, and it's frustrating, but it's so awesome having to constantly keep maintanence on your base and look for new ways to prevent them and to see your weak spots.\n\n\nThese are just some of my points, and you wanna know the awesome thing? This right here, is just an alpha.. A ♥♥♥♥ing.. Alpha, and the developers have already come this far. As I type this, the alpha11 update is imminent and should be released any day now. This is said to be the biggest update this game has seen. This game is going nowhere but up.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't tell you about the PvP, because my friends and I just normally play on a private PvE server and survive together. I have no idea how well PvP works. If I ever play PvP, I'll tell you how it goes.\n\nGet. This. Game..\n\nIt's a solid 15/10.","March 24, 2015","true","134.0"," 550 of 576 people (95%) found this review helpful 143 people found this review funny","95","550","576","143","17"

Incorporate rope, and simple machines including but not limited: pulleys for drawbridge function, trip wire, netting, and levers.\n3. Equipable ruck sack for additional storage, but decreased speed.\n4. Weather? rain would dampen smell and sound sensed by zombies, slow player... etcetera.\n5. A zoomable minimap\n6. Ladder lock, jump to eject, I have died way too many times falling off of a ladder.\n7. Easier book reading for recipes.\n8. Laser sight, red dot sight, and mechanical sight. Add a sword and a spear.\n9. Alliances, groups, clans?\n10. Big military base instead of those small camps. a lot of loot a lot of risk.\n11. First aid kit to restore either half or full health.\n12. Restaurant food prep/ovens and MREs\n13. Fall breaking: IE pressing space bar breaks fall.\n14.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealgoresome/recommended/251570/","therealgoresome","Goresome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealgoresome/","91 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMy first time playing this game was one of the most enjoyable noobie experiences I've ever had, digging a hole in the side of a hill before nightfall and hiding inside, starving and hoping nothing would find me, seeing sunrise has never been such a relief. After some exploration and scavenging for food and water, I found a town, thinking this would be a good place to lay my bed and fortify a building to try and hold off anything that came for me at night.\n\nWhat a mistake that was, a horde came for me and trashed my defenses, the few crossbow bolts I had managed to craft were consumed in no time, and I found myself in a backroom hacking through the roof trying to find an escape route, my friend below me yelling at me to hurry up as he desperately tried to repair the door that was being pounded on by zombies. "I see daylight, I've found a way out!" Our glimmer of hope ruined when I looked down to see my friend, looking up at me, with the floor beneath him almost completely destroyed and a horde of zombies under him, barely a block left to stand on. I told him not to look down, but naturally he did, what ensued was a genuinely fearful collaboration of curse words, desperation wouldn't be a fitting enough word to describe it.\n\nGenuine adrenaline rushes and forever fearing for your life, this game has brung about a whole new meaning to the survival genre, being in a fortified position and crafting yourself a lot of ammunition simply won't cut it, you can play rambo for a short time but your resources will eventually diminish if you use them too recklessly and you will find yourself back to being starving and hiding away once again, you really need to think about how and when you're going to engage the zombies by choice, because when a feral horde comes for you, you won't have a choice, and you better be ready for when that happens.\n\nNot only is this game a great thrill-ride and at times a genuine tester for your grey-matter, it is also a brilliant game to play with your friends and rewards co-operative gameplay. Sustaining yourself, by yourself, is indeed possible, but with friends you can assign eachother certain tasks, for example me and a buddy built a fortified bunker with a deep mineshaft underneath, he spent most of his days underground mining, creating ammunition and such, providing me with raw materials, while I worked on our surface defences and food supplies. Do-able alone but so much more efficient if planned with a friend, or a few friends is even better, unless you are the hardcore lone-wolf type.\n\nI have yet to play on a "no rules/ PVP" server, I can imagine that adds whole new elements of fear-factor into the game, knowing that other survivors may just snipe you from a distance and steal your stuff, at their own discretion, or maybe they will help you, it's up to them, I may build the courage to try this someday, at the moment I'm happy enough just trying to survive waves of zombie hordes on a PVE server.\n\nOverall this game is already almost a finished product in terms of crafting and survival aspects, there is the occasional annoying glitch/bug here and there as to be expected in a game at Alpha stage but I have found nothing game-breaking as of yet. To think that there is so much more to be added in terms of character customisation, experience points, more weaponry etc. is a very exciting thought indeed. I can see this game making a huge impact on release, it is genuinely brilliant fun.\n\nHighly recommended, especially playing with friends!","October 25, 2014","true","351.2"," 264 of 285 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","264","285","0","6"

But I rather tell you a story.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a hell hole, far, far away there was a nameless man who could punch insanely quickly and break bushes with his fists.\n\nHe plopped into existence on a remote server. With nothing more than his starting items and a zombie mauling his face due to server latency.\n\nHis journey started light heartedly. He came across a body of a dismembered fellow citizen, he politely inquired if the citizen would be requiring that wrench on his persons any longer. The man took the gentleman’s silence as a “yes, please good sir! I cannot bear to have it in my locale any longer!”\nThe man then starting using the head of the wrench to mate with the faces of walking dead - It was the start of a beautiful relationship and symbiosis between two sentient objects. Man and wrench.\n\nAfter some through mating with skulls; the wrench began to tire, the man acknowledged his silent partner’s weary state and left her (My lawyers say the wrench must be a she due to gender neutrality) in his inventory to rest.\nThe man travelled onwards, admiring the fly tippers that had plagued the lander with their rubbish tipping on public highways. “Are there no gentlemen left anymore?” the man asked himself. His companion would retort, is she were not so tired.\n\nThe man after many minutes of walking the man was ambushed by 4 gentlemen, all armed with firearms pointed at him.\n\nThe gentlemen asked in the most gentlemanly fashion:- “Want 2 help us come build a town :D ?”\n\nThat man pondered for a while, this could be a trap. What he was more worried about is that following 4 burley white men into the bushes late at night could ruin his reputation as a stand up and decent gentlemen.\nWeighing the risks he agreed politely.\nThe 5 gentlemen travelled down the road, for what seemed like many hours (20 minutes) until they came across a small town, partially build in the middle of a plains area.\n\nFor the next few days the man and his fellow gentlemen laughed, sang, and drank the polluted water from the river merrily. And as a result were plagued by the ungentlemanly affliction of diarrhoea.\nMany days passed of incontinence and building.\nThen, a large pack of ruffians assaulted the town’s walls.\nThe more nimble ruffians simply vaulted over the walls IN A MOST UNGENTLEMANLY FASHION while the slower Ruffians pounded on the walls and demanded an audience with us.\n\nI stood upon our half built watch tower. Gazing at the ruffians…\nThe ungentlemanly behaviour…\nThe pounding on the walls…\nThe way they attacked us like feral beasts…\nThe way they were dressed and many of them unclothed…\n\nBeing a gentleman I knew this could only mean one thing. The French had found us.\nThe walls fell, many died from being driven indoors and (presumably) forced to sample their heathen food.\n\nI did what I could, but there were too many Frenchmen to repel. I came down from my tower, firing my rifle as fast as I could at the hordes of unwashed Frenchmen. I could have sworn one was wielding a baguette.\nI was forced inside, I fired my rifle with the most British and gentlemanly fury I could muster.\nThe Frenchmen piled up by the door. But there was too many.\n\nI then barricaded myself inside – buying myself only time.\nIn my last efforts, I took out my tired companion. I bashed and bashed and bashed the wall in front of me, breaking through enough to escape.\n\nOn the final swing my friend broke into pieces.\n\nI heard her speak to me, broken on the floor…\n“Be free”\n\nI ran outside, jumped over the fence and off to freedom.\nThen I disconnected.\n\n===THE SERIOUS REVIEW===In a nutshell 7D2D is what early access games should be. It has a good range of features to keep you entertained while updates come out. The devs were friendly and helped me with a FoV problem I had with the game (I suffer from acute simulation sickness).\n\nWhat put me off is seeing people and curators endorse the game as “like minecraft”\n\nCan we please get out of this trench of comparing everything to Minecraft?\nThe genre is Voxel world not “Minecraft”, it’s like calling all FPS games “Like CoD”.\n\nThere is much I still have to explore and it honestly is one of the best survival games I have ever played. Compared to a game such as DayZ everyone seems rather friendly. Which is much better than other zombie world based games like Dayz (not making many comparisons, for obvious reasons) because not many people seem to shoot me on sight. Which was refreshing.\n\nOnce you get access to guns everyone loves you (totally unrelated I’m sure).\nDefinitely worth a pickup. I can’t find much wrong with it. The only problems are purely cosmetic and don't break the game. Which is nice because every build seems to be very stable, aside from the few bugs that do get fixed rapidly.\n\nThe only major complaint I have is that the range of melee weapons and a zombie’s reach feels misleading, if a reticule turned green when in range and red when out of melee range I would be happy with this. But it's hard to judge range and distance, espically when you are like me and you modded the FoV files because you suffer from motion sickness.\n\nAside from that, completely worth the money - nice to see someone finally did the genre justice.\nThe only warning I will give however is that this game is pretty damn taxing, not on your hardware, but on you;-\n\n1) The ambiance will quickly start messing with your mind (really good, props to the sound artists) and it's easy to give up because of it being "too hard"\n2) Thankfully 7D2D isn't hard just because it has to be or it feels it must be. It's hard because it is. And thats what counts.","November 15, 2014","true","55.5"," 449 of 515 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","449","515","7","30"

Zombies, and tons of them, especially at night when they turn into 28 days later crack zombies.\n\nBuilding, you can build underground, above ground, build castles, huts, shelters, expansions on already existing buildings. The things I've seen in this game amaze me. The creativity of some people is astounding. I've literally seen kilometer long tunnels leading from a base, to a nearby town. I've also seen castles surrounded with spikes, and hidden doors / passages.\n\nThe looting system is also great. Items generally spawn every 7 in-game days which is a very reasonable amount of time. The randomly generated maps are amazing, and literally endless so you have to potential to find hundreds of towns, etc. So much freedom you can even deconstruct buildings in towns, use dynamite to blow things up, chainsaws, augers.\n\nThe leveling system is very well done too, and very unique as it hasn't been done in other popular survival games. As you level up, you become more efficient at crafting - being able to create higher tier items. At first, you'll be able to create Faulty items, which are the lowest quality, as you level you'll be able to create from Faulty - Poor - Good - Fine - Great - Flawless. It takes forever to gain a high enough level to make flawless items so you can spend lots of time leveling up which adds highly to the game playability.\n\nThere's also PVE servers for people who don't want to deal with PVP. Every server I've joined, the admins are great and active. If anything happens, they're generally happy to help regardless of the situation.\n\nHighly recommend this game over every other survival game available. Don't read anymore reviews. This game is in Alpha, and is very playable and has lots to offer in content, features, and enjoyment.","May 16, 2015","true","142.9"," 262 of 288 people (91%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","91","262","288","18","3"

I missed the Kickstarter, and have only started playing with the 7.9 Alpha patch. I have been watching the game on Steam since it made Early Access in December. I bought it when I caught it on sale for $20.\n\nFirst let me say what it is that I do NOT like about the game, so that any notion of fanboy-ism can be dismissed:\n\n1) Getting others into you game can be tricky. Hosting a game isn't an issue, rather, the problems arise when friends try to even FIND my game on the server. Regardless of physical distance or ping, even friends that have my game favorited cannot always find my game and connect. While in game, some friends do not receive invites to Steam Chat, but can when they exit. I don't know if the issues are related, but they happen at the same time.\n\n2) Sometimes, when the server load is high (and at random), my computer will freeze while hosting, usually just after friends join. I have to do a hard reboot, and when I load my game, any alterations to the environment and containers are saved, but my inventory is reverted to the state it was in at the end of my previous session. Moving precious tungsten from chest to my inventory and having it lost to a freeze is very annoying.\n\n3) Zombies are a little too aware at times. If I can't see what is atop my tower, how can they? As for being sensed, I don't carry food with a smell radius, and the sound radius created by various actions isn't large enough to carry through my walls AND over the trench, but zombies hear/smell me. AI pathing needs work. Nightly hordes will run through my base and stand on the corner of my wall and do nothing. A freshly spawned zombie can sense me, causing it to arbitrarily attack the hardest section (and most costly to replace), instead of running into the opening a few blocks away and into my sledgehammer.  Spawning is poor. When just loading into the game, zombies tend to spawn way too close, which means they are in my base. This isn't an issue when first starting the game (as you are in the open, unprotected), but hunting the crawler zombie that keeps clipping into my walls for the first 15 minutes of a session gets old. Zombies sometimes spawn stuck in blocks. I then have to dig them out to kill them so that they don't alert and attract other zombies.\n\n4) Lighting doesn't always have the intended effect. I can see better when I am near, but torches do not always stay lit when far from players. I can still see them, as they are rendered (my base isn't THAT large), but without the light being "on", zombies have no problems spawning at night right in my base. I have had issues where zombies IN the light when it IS on will still behave like they are in the dark. This means that the one or two zombies that managed to get in my base (or more likely spawned there) will still be a large threat inside, even when the sun has come up.\n\n5) Gathering materials can be a pain. Killing zombies and having them fall into grass often means you have to destroy the grass, or walk around it, to loot the zombie - same goes for picking up items near grass. Corpses de-spawn too quick. I appreciate the game cleaning itself up, but I don't like missing the opportunity to loot every corpse (part of the game IS scavenging). A horde of ten zombies often results in half the bodies de-spawning before I can kill them all. Sometimes, the body will even disappear while I have the loot screen up. When mining or digging, if you are not quick to grab all the voxels, they can be gone before you realize it. To add to that frustration, anything on the ground (not placed) have collision. This means that when you hold the key to pick up all the dirt or wood you just worked for, it has to travel to the player with each unit bumping into itself and the environment. When breaking down anything, you have to work from the top down, or risk everything crumbling under gravity from removing the support (think sand in Minecraft). Though this may mean getting materials quicker (chopping a tree down at the base), the falling blocks can destroy themselves and de-spawn, often hurting the player in the process. I don't mind getting hurt, but I shouldn't lose all my materials because of one misstep. Some blocks, crafted or found, drop nothing upon being broken. This is really frustrating for items made out of metal. A tungsten door or iron bars broken by zombies (or needing to be moved by a player) will leave not even a piece of scrap, much less the some of its whole. It is too easy to accidentally throw something out of the inventory. Placing something on the grid instead of in a slot means the item is now on the ground, and might de-spawn before you realize it.\n\n6) Crafting can be ambiguous and cause a lot of wasted effort. Example, a crossbow: you need sticks and plant fiber. With these materials in the required amount, the recipe shows up in the list in white. When clicked, the 5x5 grid will highlight the squares that you are supposed to place these materials in. But the game does not say how MANY of each item is needed, nor WHERE they go in the grid. Once you make the crossbow, the recipe then turns green in the list, and when you click on it, it automatically places the items in the grid. You can even queue up multiple to made (you don't have to leave the crafting menu open for it to finish). This does make it easier than the initial attempt, but what if you completely forget what a crossbow is made of, or are one stick short? Then the recipe will not be in the list at all. You cannot preview item stats before creation: how am I supposed to know that a rusty iron door is better than a scrap metal door?\n\nNow, let me say what it is that I LIKE so much about this game that I have convinced several friends to buy it:\n\n1) The construction is amazing. There are several materials, each with varying degrees of durability, structural integrity, and acquisition difficulty. Anything that can be placed can be rotated. Turn a ramp piece upside down for the lip of a wall (to stop those pesky spider zombies). Turn wooden planks vertical into a fence. Lay a ladder horizontally to make a walkway. The construction lends to creativity. How a block looks and where it will line up can be seen in a transparent overlay before you place it.\n\n2) The game looks good for its current development. I don't need 4K textures, but for a voxel game in Alpha, I am impressed. Some textures repeat more than others, but in most cases you would have to make a 2x2 section of blocks before the texture completely repeats.\n\n3) Zombies are a THREAT. Even in the day when they are slow, letting one get close can result in not only health loss, but infection and bleed-out. At night they have increased spawns, run, and do more damage. Zombies vary visually and have different behaviors, loot, stats, and sounds.\n\n4) There are a LOT of settings to choose from each time a game is created or continued. There is a cheat option for the lazy or new player, but it can be used to test weapons and materials, or to gain back anything lost in error or glitch. Multiplayer supports up to 16 players. The standard game is survival, but players can choose horde or deathmatch for shorter sessions.\n\n5) Heatlh, fullness, hydration, and stamina all make sense. Decreased stamina means decreased effectiveness in work and combat. Lower fullness/hydration means less stamina.\n\n6) Weapons/tools degrade and do less damage to entities and blocks. They can be repaired, or more can be crafted (ammo too) or found. Blocks can be repaired and reinforced with siding.\n\n7) Farming, hunting, and scavenging are all viable, and sustainable, gameplay options. Players can settle or be nomadic.\n\n8) The updates are regular.\n\nTL;DR This is the zombie game I have always wanted: buy it.","April 14, 2014","true","193.0"," 432 of 520 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","432","520","0","6"

I played it a bunch, even when it was still VERY rough-cut. And rough-cut it was. But I still had plenty of fun with it, and was especially impressed with the building physics and support mechanics that force you to build something structurally sound. The drawback, however, is that it used to be a bit of a grind and the grind overwhelmed me a bit, so I took a very long break from playing (more than a year) to wait for some updates. I just came back last week and was not disappointed.\n\nThey overhauled the crafting system, added a leveling system complete with tiered perks and skills that train as you use them. Combat is a LOT more fun now that they added a ton of animations to the zombies' movements and attacks. They changed the way materials gather from sources so that the game is MUCH LESS of a grind. Survival, especially in the beginning of the game, is still pretty brutal and unforgiving unless you have good luck. The challenge is definitely still there.\n\nIf you like zombie survival games, give this one a chance, and ***♥♥♥♥ING BE PATIENT***. It beats the hell out of all the others.\n\nI was worried for a while, because updates have been a bit slow to come out, but I'm just glad to see that these guys aren't RUSHING production like so many others. And when they drop an update it's a fatty. I still have hope! This is the best zombie survival game on the market already, ifinitely better than DayZ, infinitely better than H1Z1...and it's only in alpha.

Admittedly yes, there are some bugs in this game, but fortunately most people seem to accept that the reason for these is the fact the game is still in Alpha. However most of the complaints on this game I have personally found to be inaccurate, and therefore should not be considered fact by those wishing to purchase the game. The price is a bit steep, but if you enjoy this type of game then I'm sure you will have as much fun as I am.\n\nPeople say coop isn't working and that they're paying close to $60 to play this game with friends, only to be left alone in a server with error mesages. At first I was also unable to play with friends without going to a public server, but a quick 2-minute YouTube video showed me a very simple way to connect.\n\nThey also say the game is laggy, to the point it's unplayable. To be fair, yes I have experienced lag at times that was frustrating. But 100% of the time? Not even close. I'm playing on what isn't even a gaming laptop that's a few years old, hosting a server, and things are fine.\n\nSome say that the gameplay is uneven, which I also believed during my first few playthroughs. But that's because I didn't understand exactly how to play this game, and approached it like other survivals: with the mind frame that I am invincible. That isn't the case at all in this game. You are incredibly vulnerable and will need to put a lot of work into ensuring you can simply survive, let alone more sophistcated things. If you prefer a game where you run around at night killing hundreds of zombies, I don't recommend this game. But if you like knowing that your choices truly have consequences, I completely recommend it. The gameplay isn't uneven at all if you treat the game the way it's meant to be treated (or at least how I believe it should).\n\nOverused textures? Perhaps, but they don't bug me. If I'm stranded in the middle of the desert, I want to feel like it, which is something the developers nailed. But I've found other environments such as the forests to be quite interesting. The fact that there is currently one map that is not randomly generated understandably bothers people, so all I can say is the fact that this remains in Alpha needs to be remembered here. Though this review is for the current game it targets those looking to purchase this game, who need to remember that it will be updated to contain more/improved features.\n\nOverall, I loved this game, but it does have flaws. Most of the flaws are fixable even on your own to create an intricate and enjoyable experience, but others remain to be fixed by the developers. I eagerly look forward to further updates and content for this game and would recommend it to those with interest and experience in games focussing on survival, not superiority.","February 1, 2014","true","39.6"," 1,059 of 1,335 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","059","1","0","22"

We both spawned in the wasteland and spent panicked hours trying to avoid the undead while scavenging what we could. So great was our noobishness that we'd actually chow down on raw eggs and old sham sandwiches in a pinch just to regain our hunger, ignorant to the fact that we were slowly poisoning and killing ourselves as we struggled to stay ahead of the dead and cowered on rooftops at night, listening to the rushed footsteps of sprinting zombies as they tried to sniff us out, emboldened and strengthened by the lack of sunlight.\n\nI was a fool to think we were safe.\n\nAfter repeated breaking of legs and the development of bloody diarrhea, dysentery and an infecton, I actually ended up killing myself to purge myself of my ailments and settled with my friend near the banks of a river, ignorant to what would happen to us on the 7th night or the fact that I was sacrificing my wellness, growing frail and weak as my max health and stamina was reduced to a whopping 60. Day 7 rolled by with no incidents, giving us more time to stockpile on resources and think we were safe in our hastily designed log cabin towers, guarded by nothing but stick-based spikes and amateur trenches dug into the soft sands of southwestern Navezgane.\n\nThen Day 14 happened.\n\nMy friend was outside when a massive day horde approached our homes, watching helplessly as I ended up getting trapped, and surrounded in our besieged base. The buzzing of hornets and the groans and vomiting zombified police officers turning an otherwise beautiful day into a horror show. She managed to sneak back in, but spent the entire time having a panic attack as the undead began to eat at the foundations of our towers like termites, destroying everything we had worked for. Glancing out of the windows on the top floor, our attempts to snipe at the numerous walkers proved futile as we resigned ourselves to a slow death and complete loss of everything we had worked for in our first fourteen days of play...\n\nThen we broke out the chainsaws.\n\nIn a surge of blood and gore, we -barely- managed to carve our way out through the undead and ran out into the surrounding desert with no supplies but the clothes on our backs and few jars of water and canned food we always kept on our persons. We contemplated quitting and starting over, but decided to push on and rebuild. After many running battles, we managed to reclaim our ruined towers before the evening rolled by, and spent a few nights huddled in the relative safety of one of the interior rooms, and scavenge what little supplies that had survived the onslaught while filling the holes with what little materials we could cobble together.\n\nThen we found it...\n\nA small campsite, isolated and on the other side of a hill where our original ruined towers stood. For some reason, we decided to settle there, digging deep underground and building a series of bunker networks that we connected into one super-compound. With our supplies safe, we built connecting tunnels to a nearby town and heavily fortified one of the buildings there with every material we could find back then, sandstone, sand, stone, wood, scrap metal, you name it. We made a point to make our stand there every 7 days, retreating into our tunnels when the going got tough, which was pretty much every single day until day 35.\n\nAfter a long and terrible night...\n\nWe managed to keep the Horde out, and surged out of our bunker during the day to meet them head on. After mopping up the remnants, we squared off against multiple waves before the undead fell silent, we had avenged our horrible defeat at day 14. To commemorate our victory, we built a giant tower with a sniper perch and elegant roof over our bunker, complete with beer coolers and chairs. We named it Isengard, surrounding our perimeter with layers and layers of (then-invulnerable) log cabin spikes and smashed the undead repeatedly from that day 35 onward. Gone were the days of our frailty as our wellness surged to 200, replacing old sham sandwiches with meat stew, blueberry pie and goldenrod tea. We even went back to our old base and refurbished it, combining our two towers into one giant platform where we housed giant, closed farm, connected to our main base through a series of tunnels. This lasted until a patch-induced server wipe ended our adventure, but we had learned valuable lessons. We were hardened.\n\n\n\nIn short,\n\n10/10, would get bloody diarrhea and build Isengard again.","April 12","true","905.8"," 187 of 207 people (90%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","90","187","207","81","6"

A horde is scary enough during the day, 20 zombies or so shambling along...maybe trying to catch up to you. But...at night a horde is terrifying. A screeching, sprinting mob racing through the dark. The dead don't get tired...but you do.\nFinding lots of supplies in the cupboards and what not. We didn't realize that all the noise we were making...as night fell...was disturbing the tenants of the building. Of course the entire building was inhabited by zombies...all locked in their apts ever since it all started. They must have been dormant until we disturbed them. The screams and bangs and crashes from all around us got louder as the darkness became absolute. You could hear walls, and doors and even the ceiling starting to give way. We had a long wait for dawn. We couldn't stand the pitch darkness anymore, it made the cacophony that much worse. In the server I set up...The darkness of night lasts a full half hour or so and that's how long we sat there in the near pitch blackness listening to the zombies tear the building apart around us. We couldn't make a run for it because all the noise that our neighbors were making was attracting other nearby hordes on the outside of the building.\n\nAs dawn broke...so was the rear wall of our unit....they were getting in...\n\n\nfun game!\n\n(I didn't even mention the zombie dobermans.)","December 21, 2014","true","864.6"," 160 of 181 people (88%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","88","160","181","35","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mawlocgunner/recommended/251570/","mawlocgunner","SherlockHole","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mawlocgunner/","18 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEDITED for A14.5\n\nEasily the best zombie survival game on steam, and probably the most promising alpha I've ever seen. I often watch youtube videos before purchasing a game, and this review has been written with past experience of all the games I've mentioned, with DayZ, Rust and H1Z1 being played on friends' accounts. It's a blast with friends, but the main reason I recommend this game is because it has some things which are almost unheard of in the zombie survival genre:\n\n1) Zombies. No, not the glitchy, ethereal zombies in DayZ, or the ones they just simply couldn't be bothered with in Rust, because Zombies in 7 days obey the laws of physics, and are everywhere, and the regular hordes (completely unheard of in almost every other survival game), as well as variation in zombies keeps combat fresh. We already have vomiting police officer zombies, "feral" boss zombies take horrendous punishment, undead dogs (which are extremely dangerous if not properly handled), bears (and undead versions) and mutant hornets.  The zombies in 7 days are threats, and, for a long while at least, not a manageable one. By default, they run at night, gaining speed and finesse, turning an already- formidable foe into a nightmare. I won't say much more, but it is called "7 Days to Die" for a reason...\n\n2) It's actually a challenge to survive. This isn't like in H1Z1 where you can live forever off of blueberries until a bear mauls you to death, or in Rust, where starvation feels practically nonexistant. The scavenging itself is rewarding, but food is low in quantity and far- spread. However, once you survive long enough to have a fortress going, you have time and opportuinty to hunt or farm, where the goals in the game radically shift from getting by on cans to actively improving your wellness, which takes me to the next point:\n\n3) Unique mechanics- Be it the wellness system (eating good food and staying healthy increases physical fitness), weapon quality, the fact that you can get infected and become desperate for a cure, building a base or even simply that zombies run at night, 7 Days has many things that similar games in the genre have merely scraped the surface of, if they've even bothered at all. It's a true game hidden amongst several cash grabs. Something I will note though- the devs are currently experimenting with temperature based survival and hordes, and both are fairly broken atm. Still, they're making progress, have no intention of giving up and listen to the community. Besides, that's what early access is for, right?\n\n4) Singleplayer- This one is probably coming off as a surprise to you right as I read it, but I think it's worth a mention. Singleplayer is a feature that most similar games lack, and that's a really crucial feature for those who want a decent survival game without the constant PvP like in DayZ or H1Z1. It's obviously not initially intended for single player, considering that there's still chat, but it still works, and works wonders.\n\n5) Base building- This isn't like in Unturned or H1Z1 where it is seemingly bolted on as an afterthought. Base building in 7 Days is important (not essential- you can still get by by moving from place to place) for survival in the new world. There are many items easily lootable that serve no practical purpose, but are instead simply decorations to further the impression that base building is a core feature of this game.\n\n6) The devs and community- The Fun Pimps listen to the community, and the community itself is very helpful and supportive. The (incredibly) steep learning curve is quickly offset by the community, who tirelessly answer all questions the noobs may have.\n\n7) ANYONE can mod it- The Fun Pimps have deliberately designed the XML files for the game to be easily moddable. I'd check out Valmod once you consider yourself truly hardcore- it makes the game way harder. Alternatively, you could do what I did, and mod more recipes and guns into a private game with friends to get a more walking- dead style vibe. If you get confused, again, the forum section on modding is amazing at helping you with whatever problems you might have.\n\nThe game itself has regularly been referred to as a mashup of Minecraft and DayZ, but I disagree. From the perspective of a buyer, this may look the case, but it isn't. It's a completely different animal, far greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nI will not lie to you, there are more than a few balance issues, bugs galore after every major patch and big patches take a while, but I believe that it's all worth it in the end, because there's no other survival game to my knowledge that doesn't act like that Goat Sim parody DLC, while also having hardworking devs who are willing to put more than ten minutes into the game.\n\nRecommended as a 7.5/10- the learning curve is steep, and there are balance issues- and the devs are hardly experts at meeting their deadlines, but that's what Alpha was meant to be about. If you're the type of gamer who wants survival, building, a true zombies game or an amalgamation of the three, then this is the game for you, and you won't regret buying it.","April 21, 2015","true","160.3"," 130 of 141 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","130","141","10","3"

I've watched as the land has smoothed out, a skill tree has been added, trees and zombies have been beautified,  and additional zombies have been added, among other things.\n\nIf you are listening to a review from someone who has recently downvoted because of an upgrade, keep in mind that The Fun Pimps are constantly monitoring player feedback and responding to it. Ultimately, this is an alpha and there will be times when things happen that take away an aspect of the game that you are used to or that is part of your usual play style, but you can try a new play style for a while then return to it when it's reintroduced after The Fun Pimps are able to respond to the complaints.\n\nNow, how about some pros and cons from someone who has some real gameplay in?\n\nPros:\nContinual work from The Fun Pimps.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodlyrics/recommended/251570/","bloodlyrics","Blood Flowers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodlyrics/","37 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(Updated for A13.6)\n\n7 Days To Die (7DTD) is not a truly "unique" game, but that is, in fact, one of the greatest things about the game. It blends the best parts of many games (the building from Minecraft, the open-world aspect of Skyrim, the terrifying zombies of... etc) and makes them its own. For instance, while Minecraft building uses grids and is unrealistic, 7 Days To Die takes that, adds gravity and dynamic changes while retaining all the fun.\n\nOne of the first things you will notice about 7DTD is that the graphics are surprisingly high definition. Granted it takes a pretty intense system to utilize higher graphical settings, for a ~$20 game that often goes on sale, the graphics are superb. Even on the lowest settings the game looks incredibly realistic.\n\nThen come the zombies. Depending on your settings, these guys go from terrifying to downright unstoppable. You think you're safe behind your walls? Not when they rapidly bash their way through. You think they won't come for you as long as you stay quiet? Not when the feral horde comes seeking your blood. The zombies are made to punish the unprepared survivor and they do it extremely well. Of course, there is not just a single static zombie type. You have police officer zombies that launch projectile attacks, zombie dogs that will viciously run you down, zombie hornets that are just plain annoying, and zombie bears - yes, you did read that correctly, zombie bears.\n\n7DTD is challenging for the new survivor, it is made to punish the player during the early game. You are affected by the temperature (you can actually freeze to death), you require sating of both hunger and thirst, and there are more things that can kill you that you can possibly count (including falling trees). Yet, as you get further into the game and explore further into the world, there is a sense of reward and accomplishment that accompanies the hard earned experience. You begin to harvest raw materials faster, craft stronger tools and weapons, build more fortified bases, etc. Eventually, it is no longer you who needs to run from the zombies, but the zombies who need to run from you.\n\nMy two favorite aspects of 7DTD blend nicely together: crafting and building. I have not seen a (similar) game that has as extensive a selection of craftable items as this one. There are tons of items to craft and then use to build into castles, homes, crazy-spiky fortresses, or whatever you wish really. In a game where everything is destructible, you are also capable of building anything your heart desires. What you make depends on what strikes your fancy. If you want to create something grand, build an epic castle. If you want to create something that will withstand a sea of zombies, then layer spikes and walls and, of course, ever more spikes.\n\nWhile all of these features are great in singleplayer (honestly, you can play hundreds of hours in singleplayer without getting bored), the ultimate fun in this game comes from playing with others. Get a group of friends and play on insanely hard settings while trying to survive from heat-seeking, running zombies. If you don't have any friends (amumu...), you can still go multiplayer servers to join up with or against other players!\n\nIn conclusion, 7DTD is simply a lot of fun. You get out of it whatever you want. You can be a survivor, you can be an architect,and heck - you can even try and be a pacifist (VERY hard). Whether you choose to play alone, play with strangers, or play with friends, you'll find yourself losing countless hours in senseless fun. I highly recommend buying 7 Days To Die - it's worth every cent.","October 28, 2014","true","775.8"," 149 of 171 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","149","171","2","5"

(Yet?)\n\nThis might be less of a review and more of a message to the Fun Pimps. Can't put it on the forums because it will get deleted.\n\nI rarely have such conflicting emotions about a game, especially since Alpha 13. I didn't follow the whole kickstarter thing but bought the game a year ago on a boring night without any prior research and quickly dismissed it for its mediocre performance despite the very crusty graphics.\n\nAfter several attempts of playing it, the vast options of a sandbox finally hooked me and allowed me to half-heartedly overlook the - at times - very annoying bugs. I usually play alone or semi-alone with an emphasis on exploration/large scale underground building and don't really bother with coop play or PvP.\n\nWhile I was racking up hours and hours of gameplay, my occupation as a software engineer got in the way of my passion for gaming the first time in my life. I really wanted to like the game and grinded through it 8 hours at a time just out of spite, but jesus tap dancing christ, this thing is riddled with bugs and game breaking inconsistencies.\n\nI could make a huge list of all the bugs and weird things happening, but it pretty much all boils down to two things: A severe lack of experience and no mentionable quality control. Now, don't give me that "But it's an alpha!" crap. If you build something, anything, you start with a good foundation and then gradually add stuff. With 7DTD it seems like there's a very messy but somehow working foundation that noone really wants to (or has the ability to) fix, and instead of hiring someone to do it, every patch appears to be a string of quick wins and cosmetic changes that are hit or miss at best and completely pointless at worst. At times, it seems like the Fun Pimps are done doing actual progress and alternate between doing "most flashy thing for the least amount of work" (pre-patch) and "holy ♥♥♥♥ we need to put out fires left and right" (post-patch). I mean, just look at some of the "improvements" of A13:\n\n* UI was completely broken and a massive exploit-fest. Now it's completely broken and a massive exploit-fest with a new flat look.\n* The game couldn't handle decent amount of zombies; the animations, spawning mechanisms and attack patterns were totally off. Nothing changed about that, but now we have new motion captured zombies that have weirdly skewed models depending on the viewing angles, have non-existing keyframes and move like an epileptic Michael Jackson dance movie in anything above 60 FPS. Oh, and zombie dogs are broken. Again.\n* A lot of the harvestable resources are suddenly gone. No more sticks, branches, different meats, all the stuff that brought some variety was taken out. Why? Just so you can inflate the patch notes?\n* The grunting, screaming and huffing and puffing of the alter ego is now voiced by professional voice actors. I can now hear myself moaning of hunger in crystal clear quality while trying to use the broken camp fire that mysteriously eats fuel and never finishes crafting my damn meat. That's right, meat. A bear now has the exact same kind of meat as a rabbit.\n* Performance is _abysmal_. "But it's an un-optimized alpha!" You know the first rule of optimization? - Don't. You can't build a complete dog turd and then flip a switch on release date and suddenly it runs like hell. It's not gonna happen. Start with a good foundation and then add stuff. Yes, i'm repeating myself.\n\nMultiplayer is another huge disappointment. Don't even get me started with multiplayer. It's an integral part of the game (despite the Pimps backing off again cause they are not able to fix the related code), yet it's the most broken one. The netcode is horrible and the dedicated server is a hot mess that WILL bring your hardware to its knees. Memory leaks gallore, 32/64 bit Linux versions randomly (don't) work depending on the patch level and administration is XML with a bunch of strings and a ♥♥♥♥ing TELNET interface.\nI mean, props for providing a Linux server (and client!), but if it's going to randomly break because noone is testing it, why even ship it?\n\nOh, if you want to have a laugh, check out the website. "a small dedicated group of highly experienced Game and Software developers" and "The average 7 Days to Die Team member has over 14 years of experience in Game and Software Development working with or for many top companies." Yeah, right. I bet that's the reason why you're using ♥♥♥♥ing Unity and can't update a label without a bunch of null pointer exceptions and out of range indices.\nThe communication is very professional, too. If you have to introduce forum policies that explicitely forbid talking about release dates or criticizing anything about the game it's HIGH ♥♥♥♥ING TIME to think about how you're communicating with customers. If you can't be arsed to do it yourself (and i can highly sympathize with that!), hire someone to do it. And I'm not talking about giving some fanboy moderator rights on the forums and letting him wreak havoc.\n\nGod damn.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. Despite the massive bashing, I kinda sorta like this game. I'd never pile up >300 hours of gameplay and write a long review about a game that i hate. Sometimes the only thing that'll help is some good old tough love. I fear that if nothing changes, the game has already reached its zenith and will crash and burn. So please, use the money we gave you. Hire some real software developers. Make the software as good and enjoyable as the gameplay you have created. I'd revise my review in a heartbeat if there was any positive change.\n\nPlease make it happen.","December 30, 2015","false","330.5"," 394 of 509 people (77%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","77","394","509","39","48"

Even though I play this on a Mac for the most part where it's no secret that bugs, crashes and a plethora of frustrating issues arise from time to time, overall I think this game has huge potential for just an alpha. Something that very few games manage to do even 40 hours into gameplay is keeping me on my toes and worried all throughout. The "difficulty" progression of the waves seems to match pace with the progress made very nicely, imo. While I tend to play settler style for the most part, at any point of the game I would never be completely relaxed about the nights. Yes, generally the nights pass by in silence as the zombies simply walk over my base, but occasionally when they sense or even outright detect me underground and start mindlessly digging towards me, it's always a nerve racking experience. (My bases are generally shallow, eg only 10 or so blocks down. Something I should probably fix)\n\nOverall, the game is wonderful because it allows so many different styles of play, but still forces players to do one common and core function. Exploring. Now I talk about this from a vanilla server or SP perspective where you have no recipes unlocked. As you progress in the game, it becomes apparently harder and harder to survive with just a crossbow and some cloth armor. You start requiring later and later game items which require more unique resources. Eventually, you'll be forced to go out into the wild to gather and find these resources that will be paramount to your success in the game.\n\nWant a shotgun? Better know how to make one. What's that? No ammo? Gotta figure out how to make that too. Don't know how to make it? Well sucks to suck. Go out and find the recipe book. Keep getting rekt by the zombies pumelling you? Well get that janky cloth armor off you and get some iron armor on. Don't know how to make one? Find the recipe book. What's that? Need leather? Better figure out how to make that too. The point is, you can't progress in the equipment line without these recipe books that you won't be finding unless you actually go out and explore.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy the idea of packing up a lunch, grabbing a stack of water, putting on some armor, taking my shotgun and seeing what I can find out there. I've been playing on Navesgane for a little bit now and I have a pretty good idea of where all the major things are without needing to reference an online map or anything. Even then, I keep stumbling upon encampments, houses and other POI that I forget exist. It's an exciting experience when you legitimately don't know what you might run across on one day of exploring.\n\nI would go into more commentaries on the mechanics and nitty gritty of the game, but there are already tons of reviews that do that much better than I ever could. This review is just an honest opinion of my experiences with the game thus far. Hopefully others will find that the game might be worth their time and money to do a bit of exploring with :)","December 26, 2014","true","254.0"," 109 of 121 people (90%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","90","109","121","81","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/recommended/251570/","DeliveryGodNoah","DeliveryGodNoah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/","363 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHonestly, the best Alpha/Early Access game you can buy.\nIt has the most content.\nIt is (one of) the most playable.\nIt has one of the most dedicated developers.\nIt has a pretty sizeable and dedicated playerbase.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's minecraft meets DayZ. That's probably the way you're sick of hearing it described as, but it's appropriate.\nIt's a first person zombie survival game that you can play with/against other players online, with a fully fleshed out crafting system that allows you to make weapons and craft incredible buildings. Though this game has a more "realistic" way of building houses than Minecraft does. Houses actually look like houses, and they even have structual integrity, so if you build a house without much support, it will collapse.\nWalk on an old, decaying bridge? It will probably collapse.\nTry to build a single line of wood as a temporary bridge? It will fall down after about 3 or 4 blocks.\n\nMining looks great. It looks like you are actually creating a cave, with smooth walls and dizzying geometry. However mining has had some issues over the course of development. It's been "nerfed", made too abundant, nerfed again, and sometimes even being made impossible. Be warned that mining in this game is a bit glitchy, however this shouldn't come as a surprise in an Early Access title.\n\nThe game used to have a blocky asthetic, but the game has since had an update that makes the terrain smooth with rolling hills. It looks great, and it's not even done yet as the developers are working on random generation and on smoothing out the terrain even more.\n\n(SEE UPDATE AT BOTTOM ABOUT RANDOM GEN) Oh, I also need to mention, at the moment, there is only one map. It's a pretty decent size, but you'll see most of it within a couple playthroughs. Building your own structures, especially when playing in an online server, does change it up however.\n\nThis game can be played in single player as well, or with a private server. That's another thing great about this game: Options.\nThere's literally an option for just about anything.\nHow durable blocks are and how long it takes to mine them.\nHow many zombies spawn.\nHow much damage the zombies do to you.\nHow much damage you do to the zombies.\nHow much loot spawns.\nHow many players can join your server.\nPVP on or off.\nAnd many other options.\nThis game can be just about any way you want it.\nSome people will point out that options have been both added, and removed, and sometimes options don't have much of an effect at all. Again, be warned, things are constantly being changed, including the amount of options and their effectiveness. There's a chance an option you really like having may be taken away, or accidentally broken. It's all a part of the process of making the game balanced and challenging, while also allowing you to create a personal experience.\n\nThere are a few mods, and a few custom builds, but those are pretty few at least until the game becomes more complete. I'm sure once the development moves futher along, you'll see a lot more custom levels and mods being made and updated.\n\nCombat is bit floaty though. As it stands now, melee combat doesn't have that much impact, and guns need better sound. However, usually combat works. Guns shoot bullets into things, melee weapons bash things, but this can be temporarily broken during any update.\n\nCrafting is a major component of the game. You find resources, either through loot in the environment and buildings, or by getting your own from mining from rocks and trees. Crafting is done in a grid fashion, which will look a bit familiar, in that you can place certain components in a certain way to create something. However, it's not all guess work. It's usually outlined what you need and where, you just need to place it. It's a bit simplistic and easy this way, but it works.\n\nFor now, 7 Days to Die is a fantastic experience. It still has bugs and optimization issues, such as mechanical bugs, sound issues, and sometimes even having parts of the game you really like being taken out or being made useless. It's part of the process, but overall it's the most complete of the Early Access titles that you can find on Steam, and continues to be updated pretty regularly.\n\nUpdate: Random Generation. This game NEEDED this. Like most things, it's not perfect, but it's a welcome edition. A random seed is generated depending on the name you give the world, and the results are impressive. You get rolling hills, random buildings and points of interest, large cliff sides, both deep and shallow areas of water (which also added the ability to finally "swim" underwater with neat effect), and a large central city to explore.\n\nThe ability to randomly generate worlds now alone has potentially increased the replayablility of 7DaystoDie by countless hours. My first couple hours with random generation I just spent exploring around to find all the nice looking terrain.","July 16, 2014","true","144.3"," 225 of 284 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","225","284","0","19"

Here is a list of common user complaints from the steam forums.\n\n-Hostile community moderation, posts containing negative opinions and bug reports on the game are being deleted by PR on both steam and the games official forums and users being unjustly banned.\n-Mouse moves to the top left hand corner of the screen on its own.\n-Characters are black and textureless until a worn item is equipped.\n-Overpopulation of powerful bear and dog enemies with no rhyme or reason to their locations.\n-Bows now doing nearly no damage.\n-Weather effects and environment textures change depending on which type of biome voxel you're standing on. Two people standing right next to eachother will see completely different worlds, one snowy and one desert depending on which they are standing on.\n-No randomly generated lakes or rivers, only small prefabricated ponds.\n-Even the prefab water ponds are too rare.\n-No more natural caves.\n-Getting hit by an enemy reduces your wellness (maximum health).\n-Removed item category colors from item icons in inventory.\n-Loot rarity is now limited by the xp level of the looter.\n-Physics are nice but perhaps introduced more lag for servers with many players.\n-Buildings spawn with voxels benethe the terrain, which cause these voxels to free-fall under physics and contribute to poor server-client performance.\n-Certain areas looked "Stamped" into the heightmap of the terrain with little or no blending showing a distinct circular feature on the map.\n-Many objects and environment textures have animated rain reflections playing constantly which make the whole game look "slimey".\n\nI made a post on the 7 Days to Die Steam Community Discussions boards with a simple list to outline some of the issues that were causing people to dislike this version (A12) of the game. The post was called "Whats wrong with A12?". Many users found the post helpful and we were creating some valid feedback for the developers. Shortly after making the post I was confronted by "Red Eagle LXIX", STEAM_0:1:5711787, a forum moderator who was getting very defensive and attacking users personally, calling me a "Troll" and a "Whiner". I tried to have a civil conversation with him and he banned me from the 7 days to die steam forum with no warning. The thread has also been deleted (for his own protection) as many other members of the community recognized that he was being abusive to the contributors of the thread and commented on it. Today I am banned until Jul 11th @ 1:20 pm, here is the last PERSONAL message that he sent to me;\n\n//"Your very first post broke the Steam discussion rules with insulting the game and the developers (on an issue they listed in the notes, and was listed as temporary in nature)\n"Standing on an environment voxel causes that players textures to adapt to the biome type of the voxel you are standing on. Standing on a single voxel of snow in the middle of the desert makes the whole desert appear to be a snow-covered tundra. Take one step and it all turns back to desert. This was probably a "feature" however it was poorly thought out and implemented."\n\nFurther you broke rules arguing with a moderator.\n\nAs for your "rights" you should re-read your Steam Subscriber Agreement, Terms Of Use, Code Of Conduct, Discussion Rules, etc again as you have no "right" to free speech on a privately owned forum."//\n\nAs you can see, saying that a feature may have been "poorly thought out", was in this moderator's opinion grounds to ban me from the steam forums and call me a "whiner". According to Red Eagle LXIX you are not allowed to have a different opinion than his own or you will be banned. If that isn't abusing his powers then I don't know what is. I believe this moderator should lose his privileges.\n\nI've requested that steam support restore the thread to examine it's nature and that moderator "Red Eagle LXIX", STEAM_0:1:5711787 have his privileges revoked.\n\nThe point of the post was to give people who previously enjoyed this game a place to discuss what they don't like about the current build so we can offer feedback to the developers in a place that was easy for steam users to find.\n\nUnfortunately this isn't the exact same list as the original post since it was deleted by the maverick moderator. I don't know how many other participants of the thread were also banned. The original thread was a simple checklist very similar to the one above.\n\nI have opened a ticket with steam support on this matter and have also left a copy of this on the fun pimps 7 days to die official website forum.\n\nWhen a number of other users and I brought this up on the official 7 days to die forum, my thread was deleted yet again and I was issued private warnings from another administrator named "Fox", STEAM_0:0:22519404.\n\nAs to this day The Fun Pimps have been unapologetic about their moderators behaviour, although their efforts to silence complaints about their game are being overwhelmed by a largely dissatisfied player base.\n\nI do not recommend 7 Days to Die at this time.","July 4, 2015","false","134.4"," 1,292 of 1,789 people (72%) found this review helpful 80 people found this review funny","72","292","1","80","142"

There's hunger, stamina, thirst, and health. You can sprint, you  can cook food on fires if you have cooking pots or a grill. There's a fair amount of fire arms, and you can even craft the bullets for them. You can construct quite a fottress, barricade existing structures, repair damage on structures, upgrade parts of your structures to withstand more damage, grow food, hunt, and the longer you stay in one area, the stronger your scent gets in that area, increasing the chance of an invasion occuring, there's many types of zombies, most look standard, but there's a few special ones, and more are going to be added, not only can you eventually craft standard digging tools and cutting tools, you can find an Auger to dig faster, and a chainsaw to cut tree's down swiftly, multiplayer works fine too, the player sync seems to be perfect even if ping is around 100-150 levels. There are many clothing pieces you can find as you scavenge, head, chest, hands, legs, feet, and they have armor value against attacks, you can even use hides from animals you've hunted to make leather, and then leather armor with the proper knowledge. They recently added the random world generation, which i've been testing, it is done quite well, biomes seperated by rivers, if you look enough you'll find roads, and there's even generated structures to be found, you can also mine a tunnel down anywhere to find yourself some metal ores to make whatever tools, bullet casings, or bullet tips you need and coal, as well as nitrate, to make gunpowder. You can make torches, there's a few ways, and you can find flashlights, there isn't anything that can't be destroyed by you, or the zombies, everything has a different durability depending on what it is made of. The options for playing either on single player or multiplayer are fairy customizable, you can increase drop rates of all items, durability of all blocks, amount of zombies that spawn, how long days last, and how large of percentage of each day is night time, you can also decrease all of these options as well. I'd strongly recommend getting this game if you like a good survival, or action game with an extensive crafting system.","December 20, 2014","true","224.2"," 123 of 144 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","123","144","0","0"

Graphics seem to get better each alpha release / A13 all zombies will be HD even the new ones\n2. Gameplay is awesome I would know I have 400+ hours ingame.\n3.Joining servers is seamless.\n4.Ability to host your very own server if your into that.\n5.Performance is really good for me i play at 1080p sometimes 2k DSR [upscaled] and still get great FPS.\n6.Zombie AI can be changed if you want them to be harder if you like----> (Game devs say Motion Capture will be added into Alpha 13 when its released meaning zombies are going to be more lifelike and will be acting more like a zombie would act with real input and they said will be a whole new game experience and feel like you just received a BRAND NEW game all over again)\n7. I forgot this for A12 BUT there is a minibike to drive at night and zombies can't catch you if on one.\n8.Bears in game now and they aren't friendly. Lol\n\nHere's what NEEDS to be improved:\n\n1. Faster updating---> Alpha 12 is out now so it's a bit faster updating cycle / A13 isn't out yet but may be out 1st week of November.\n\n2.From what it sounds like the protection bypass hack is most likey will be fixed after game is out of the alpha stages / Isn't that much of an issue I don't think anymore though.\n\nI will add to this or remove from this review as 7 Days To Die gets updated.\n\nHopefully reading my review helps you decide on buying or not buying this game.","June 7, 2015","true","439.0"," 100 of 112 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","100","112","7","3"

By alot I mean at least 50+ games in early access state.\n\nOne of the common tennants that I have noticed in these games from small developers is that they bite off way more than they can chew and fail to deliver communication on how thier studio is effectively tackling the challenges presented by thier intial overly ambitious goals. This studio is not one of those studios, this game is not one of those games. I have supported this game since it's kickstarter campaign and I have to say its one of the top investments I have made into the early Access game sales model.\n\nReasons why I recommend this game:\nUpdates: Are frequent.\nBugs: When found are fixed promptly.\nCrafting: Many recipies in the initial bucket with tons more custom recipies if you decide to play multiplayer\nScalable difficulty: The amount of options that you are able to adjust for singleplayer make your experience playing the game as challenging or as easy as you would prefer.\nMultiplayer: There are some amazing PVP and PVE servers out there\nPersonal Experience: I play alot of games when I have the oppurtunity to do so. You can tell by the amount of hours I have into this game that it is definitely worth the price tag.\n\nReasons why I would not recommend this game:\nNone.\n\nIf you are on the fence, and considering buying this game, buy it. If you love the genre of either sandbox games, zombie games, or survival games, buy it.","January 22, 2015","true","488.9"," 106 of 121 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","106","121","9","0"

I've tried most of the genre out there but nothing else has a hold on me quite like this one.\n\nI like to play aesthetically pleasing games, and while I have no unrealistic expectations when it comes to how a game looks or feels, this game delivers for me on all fronts.\n\nSo what's different about this game? Well it's covering a lot of ground, from finding food, to staying safe, building, farming and a whole host of other stuff to learn and explore. They've now included recipies so you have to work hard for those much cherished items, and there are quality levels in all that you make/find. Your character also has a long steady climb of experience before you're able to make nice looking items, so scavanging is always rewarding. The game offers both melee and range fighting which really appeals to me.. theres a time for stabbing zombies in the head, and a time to just blow them away!\n\nThey have also included a whole heap of options for any single/multiplayer setup, like the length of each day, the amount of zombies that spawn and how hard they hit etc. The list is pleasantly structured increasing the chance to find a playstyle setting that works for you. You can even increase/decrease loot settings making things much harder to find and some things are really hard to find... useful tools and weapons that once found you guard\n\nThe games mood shifts at night on default settings and the zombies pick up pace, running rather than walking, but if this is too much for you, you can disable this too.. in fact, you can turn them off altogether, and this ends up being an enjoyable construction game with a few wild animals to keep you on your toes.\n\nI could go on and on to list everything I like about this game, and while it's still in alpha I'm loving every minute of it. Sure there are some bugs and glitches and it's been in alpha longer than I care to remember, but overall this is definitely an alpha I'm enjoying and I cannot recommend it enough to any survival fans out there.\n\nSo in summary, If you like survival zombie games with a focus on building resources, weapons and bases, then I really would recommend you give this one a try. The updates are regular enough for me and give a strong sense of acheivement in each one as they bring more rewards into the game. I will definitely be sinking many more hours into this game, and it has now become my most played game of all time - fast approaching 1000 hours!\n\nGreat work deserves great support and I thank the people at Fun Pimps for sinking much of their time into this great adventure.. I highly recommend you buy this today!\n\n###### END OF UPDATED REVIEW - THANKS FOR READING ########\n\n\n\nI thought I'd take a bit of time to review this game since it's occupied nearly 300 hours of my life!\n\nI'm a huge survival fan... horror is a bonus, but the idea of being alone (with or without friends) on a barren wasteland looking for food and supplies to survive really appeals to me. I've tried a few of the genre out there but nothing else has a hold on me quite like this one.\n\nI like to play aesthetically pleasing games, and while I have no unrealistic expectations when it comes to how a game looks or feels, this game delivers for me on all fronts. I've never played minecraft for example for the simplistic look it holds... missing out? expect so.. but nevertheless, its part of what I need to feel immersed.\n\nSo what's different about this game? Well it's covering a lot of ground, from finding food, to staying safe, building, farming and a whole host of other stuff to learn and explore. It has melee and projectile weapons which really appeals to me.. theres a time for stabbing zombies in the head, and a time to just blow them away!\n\nI like the fact some things are really hard to find... useful tools and weapons that once found you guard and protect and that the mood of the game shifts significantly during the night phase.\n\nI could go on and on to list everything I like about this game, and while it's still in alpha I'm loving every minute of it.

It's still in Alpha as of this date.\n\nOriginal Pre-Alpha7 Review - http://screencloud.net/v/D4NS\nOriginal developer comment, finally changed on the 29th January  - http://screencloud.net/v/pVOJ\nOriginal response to Developers - http://screencloud.net/v/vOcN\nAlso had my review marked as abusive for no reason by the developers - http://screencloud.net/v/kkMI\n\nAdded 02/01/2015 - The game was meant to be fully released and completed by May 2014 according to the developers. It's still in Alpha as of this date.\n\nAlpha 7 Review - March 2014\n\nI decided to update my review as it was old and new builds have been released.\nWould I recommend the game now? No. For a multitude of reasons.\n\nGameplay - The game still lags (on the one computer i've tried it on 16gb Ram, Nvidia GeForce 770M, i7 Processor, though I will try it on others also), though not as bad as before which is a plus, the game is now playable if you push the settings right down and it appears the developers have updated the recommended specifications to better match what the game requires.\n\nThe updates to the Alpha 7 Build include the ever-so-needed stealth system, a rework of a lot of the in game textures, a looting-timer system (with noise penalties) cooking and a plethora of other things and since the Alpha 7 update random map generation has also been added.\n\nFor me the balance between survival realism and zombie-shoot-em-up is wrong and the game feels boring like most of the other Early Access survival games\n\nSome gameplay feautures I do like though is the new loot-timing system. Instead of being able to see what is in a lootable container right away there is a short timer which in real life would replicate the opening of the container. There is also a noise penalty if you decided to 'take all' rather than each item individually which does add a nice realism touch to it.\nBut that is my problem. The game doesn't feel like a sandbox survival game, it feels like a sandbox trying-to-be-everything game. I don't feel compelled to stay alive like I do in Rust, or build an awesome base like I do in Minecraft. I don't feel compelled to do anything in 7 Days to Die at all. I just don't find the game enjoyable.\n\nI've left the various 'bugs' out of the review, because it is an Alpha, and like all other Alpha's it has a ton of bugs, included some that are gamebreaking so beware of those.\n\nIn all, the game is a lot better than it was before, but it's still not worth the price and I can't recommend a game where the developers believe that anyone who critisizes thier product is trolling and marks all and any critisism as 'abusive' and requests that Steam comes up with a way to 'anonomusly silence and report' all negative reviews or remarks. I have no desire to continue playing this game, mainly for that reason, though the game not being enjoyable FOR ME is also one. I do think for the price, and genre, there are many games that do the job of 7 Days To Die and are a lot better with better communities. The May deadline the developers set themselves has long passed and the game is still in Alpha stage. I recommend saving your money.","December 13, 2013","false","11.1"," 10,177 of 14,563 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","177","14","8","1,697"

I expected it to be just like every other zombie survival out there. In fact, while it incorporates many of the features we've come to expect in zombie and survival games, it also introduces us to new features, The smell of food attracting zombies, zombies using their senses to find you, being actively hunted, not to mention an array of different zombies, bloaters, bloated zombies who spit poison, ember zombies that catch you on fire if they hit you, runners, tree climbers, etc. The playing map is similar to minecraft, in that it goes on forever and there are different biomes. Everything is breakable in game, zombies can actually collapse houses by causing enough structural damage, which they will do if they sense you but can't find you.

Early game was spent by a riverside shack I created right next to a river in the forest biome.  I surrounded it with corn, cotton, maple tree, blueberry and potato farms.   Absolutely zero protection, but I was relatively safe during the night in sneak mode at the top of my 4 block high 7x7 abode wielding my handmade crossbow.  Had a hell of a time trying to find all the books I'd need for crafting, particularly the one that would allow me to build a forge.  Luckily, I found a cooking pot pretty easily (I know from previous playthroughs how screwed you are when you can't boil your own water).  Lived off boiled meat very early, but before long I was making a living baking potatos.\n\nMid-game, I set up mining operations near my shack mining for stone,lead, iron, coal and potassium nitrate at night, while the hordes passed overhead (mostly) unawares.  During the day, I hunted, hit supply drops and did some supply runs on hardware stores and the homes nearby.  Stocked up a lot of rebar frames and wood frames plus came across a lot of tools from the hardware store runs.  I saved the rebar frames for later, and used the wood frames as fuel for my cooking and forge fires so I could stockpile wood from my maple tree farm.   Ended up with a metric ton of animal fat between hunting and those slow bloater zeds, the little I needed to make candles barely made a dent in my stock.  Used the corn to make cornmeal, then that to make clay.  With the clay and my supply runs, I was able to make molds of all parts of every firearm in the game.\n\nLate-game: prepared to make the defensible, self-sustainable lair of my dreams.  40 x 40, four block high walls topped with barbed wire that are three blocks thick using stone from mining to make concrete (outer layer is reinforced concrete, using the rebar frames from runs; inner two were simple concrete).  Surrounded by a 3 block deep moat with sharpened tree trunk traps at the bottom.  Entrances on the north, south, east and west sides secured with two metal doors each.  Inside, I had enough room to rebuild all my farms, all my forges and cooking fires, a mine, and built a two story house in the center.  Have a small lake for water.  Now, pretty much the only reason I would HAVE to venture out is to hunt to maintain my stores of animal fat and venison (fat for biofuel and candles, venison for venison stew, which is awesome) and ironically, sand.  I use the sand to make glass jars because the game, inexplicably, does not allow you to keep jars after you use water for anything other than drinking (like making venison stew or grain alcohol, which I use with biofuel to make my own gas cans for power tools).  Between the iron I've mined and continute to, and the molds I have, I'm able to build any number of guns.  Between lead, coal, potassium nitrate and a stockpile of brass (you should really be able to mine this too) I can make any bullet.  Have plenty of books for shotgun shell wadding.\n\nThat was just one way to go about it.  You can be a nomad packing it up during the day and raiding any town or muni building you see.  Or you can fortify an existing structure and save on building resource cost.  What's most surprising to me is how a game that is in early access, which has made no attempt at a storyline (so far) can really make you ask yourself how you would survive an apocalyptic scenario.  Highly recommended, especially if they come through with the dirtbike they said they'd include in the game.  Would make late-game looting really fun for the stay-at-home types.","April 25, 2015","true","246.3"," 74 of 79 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","74","79","8","2"

Be careful if you choose to buy/play this game. It is riddled with bugs/glitches/cheats/hacks.\nComplaining or asking for help on official forums in relation to multiplayer games, will be met with: "This is alpha", "Go play single-player", "This is alpha!", "Join a server with your friend", "THIS IS ALPHA!"\nUnfriendly interface for joining multiplayer games. I still have no idea what some of those 'filter' options mean/do and there is nothing in-game that explains them; not even on the wiki or offical website.\nAnti-cheat system doesn't work\nFrustratingly annoying to connect directly to a friend's game. Port-forwarding, etc\nNo option to "type only to friends" or "private whisper" in-game. All typing is global.\nRelatively slow updates from the devs\nRocket launchers, advanced military sniper rifles and fully-automatic machine guns *sigh* (A personal "con" for me, as it destroys the immersion of a zombie apocalypse)\nSingle player soon becomes extremely tedious/pointless.\nKnown Cheats/Exploits\nNo-clip. Players can shoot through walls, floors, etc.\nDuplicate items. Players can stack/duplicate items.\nTrack bedroll. Players can track another player's base after he/she places a bedroll.\nInvisible killing. Players can attack another player from anywhere on the map.\nFlying.\nItem spawning.\nDespite there being more CONS, the PROS significantly outweigh them.\n\nHope this helps.

I bought it a little over a year ago and really only started playing it a few days back. I'll probably keep playing it, too. This is why it saddens me to have to do this, but I cannot recommend this game.\n\nThe game itself is pretty straightforward: you're cast as a scantily clad man or woman in a deserted wasteland after some grand catastrophe, possibly (heavily hinted at) involving nuclear warfare. From the instant you enter the world (which can be randomly generated as per the world seed or a prefab world) your survival is in your hands. There are hundreds of items to craft, a handful of different biomes with unique enemies and challenges, and an endless number of forts/bases/shacks that the player can build in order to survive. Basically, the game is great, the store page is a fairly accurate rundown of what you get for dropping your dime.\n\nNow I will elaborate as to why I cannot in good faith encourage folks to buy in right now.\n\nThe Steam game forums, as you well know, are for the discussion of their respective game or discussion of certain subtopics that relate to said game. Early Access games in particular usually encourage user feedback through their forums. 7DTD is, and should be, no different. Earlier today, however, I had a particularly bad experience with a forum "Officer," in which the officer involved (Red Eagle) not only showed a blatant disrespect for me and other members of the userbase, but also for the rules and guidelines of Steam as a whole.\n\nAnother user started a thread entitled "A compilation of problems with A12" or something like that, in which he detailed what he believed to be issues with the game's latest build. The user was in no way hostile, nor was he even making the slightest attempt to badmouth the game, the dev team, or anything even remotely involved with the project. He was simply providing feedback as per the store page suggestion: "Report bugs and leave feedback for this game on the discussion boards." <--This is literally a copy/paste, word for word text box on the store page with a hyperlink leading to the discussions right next to it. All was well, folks were discussing the topic, and everything was very civil, that is until the aforementioned forum Officer showed up.\n\nAs if completely ignoring the thread's title and the original post's content (containing a list of issues with the latest build), he rudely replies to the OP these exact words: "Release notes: read them." The OP replies, stating that he had indeed read the release notes and asking the officer what his point was in making the comment. The officer then replies (rudely, again) stating that if the OP had read the release notes, he would see that all of the issues in the list were "intended features" and that he had clearly failed to comprehend basic English. At this point, having been keeping tabs on the thread I chime in, reminding the officer of his status and the conduct expected of him, and pointing out that the first thing in the OP's list was related to a mouse jittering issue. That, along with several other items in the list, could in no way be "intended features."\n\nAt this point, Red flies off the handle, saying that "If [we] had read the patch notes, I wouldn't be getting my panties in a knot" and "...end up looking like a fool." I report his post for rudeness, then reply thusly: "Again chill, please. This is a forum, you're an officer. Please act like an adult. If you're trying to spread information, there are several better ways than spouting out thinly veiled insults like a child. I.E. Instead of "Release notes: read them," try "Have you read the release notes? I tried to cover all of your issues there." Red ignores my post and then attacks the OP again, claiming that his thread is a troll thread (seriously, he honestly said this) and that it serves no purpose if he isn't trying to "make issues known." The OP replies calmly, again, and states the purpose of the forums and their public status. He also goes on to state (correctly) that his thread was, indeed, feedback and that the officer was the only one trying to start a fight or troll or what have you.\n\nI chime in again, reciprocating OP's reasoning and telling the officer that the thread is attempting to make issues known, as per his own rules. The officer replies to me, stating that the OP now suddenly needs to give specific reasons for his issues or it's just a troll thread. In yet another display of extreme patience, the OP calmly restates his thread's purpose and reasserts its status as falling within the forum guidelines. I began typing my own response, but when I try to post it, I discover that the thread has been erased and the OP has been banned. Now, I'm not sure if OP said anything during the brief interval when I was typing my response that broke the rules, but I know for a fact that Red Eagle had no call to act as rudely and childishly as he has. As such, I am actively going to attempt to disuade any and all interested parties that I know of from purchasing this game until such a time that the mods take some action against Red and/or he is made to apologize publicly or resign from his officer status.\n\nIt is absolutely disgusting that this kind of behaviour is tolerated by this team, and I cannot, nor will I ever support people who care this little about public interaction.\n\nTL;DR\nVerdict-- Avoid it like the fictional plague it so gleefully employs in its world. Forum mod abuse to an extreme and hostile extent. If any forum officers are reading this, take a look at the deleted thread yourself and see what I'm talking about. And to Red, you should be ashamed of yourself. Your behaviour was and is pathetic and I honestly hope you strongly reconsider your approach to public relations. Grow up.\n\n[EDIT:] Grammar and such.","July 4, 2015","false","15.6"," 680 of 958 people (71%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","71","680","958","49","98"

You can pretty much do anything. You must use strategy and, if possible, teamwork.\n\nThis game is super fun and addicting. The way it's designed makes sure you never feel safe or secure. There's always something that needs to be built or crafted to survive and you have to explore often to find supplies.

I've put in 100 hours into this game and this is EXACTLY how I imagine a real zombie apocalypse would be. I think the creaters of this game have hit the nail on the head and even though the alpha is just a taste of what's to come, the balance they have struck between desperate survival vs environment, rush of looting items and mining resources during day so that you can survive during the night is absolutely perfect. And the fact that they put in "structural integrity" REALLY adds to the realism of the game.\n\nSure the fighting system could be a bit better, and yes it's alpha so there are some minor glitches. But all in all, it feels like it's already a full game and once they release new custom maps and other features, this game is going to be HUGE!

I write this review as of alpha11 and while the new patch is only a few days and a tad buggy, the devs have already hotfixed some of the bugs and i have every faith the others will be fixed in the next few days.  Even this the bugs Alpha 11 is very playable.\n\nI have 835 hours invested in this game as of writing this review. Yes I LOVE IT!!! ... honestly the price is well worth it.\n\nPeople come into a game like this for different reasons, my husband loves fps and loves the zombie hunting elements of this game.

I focus on crafting the things we need to survive and building a safe place to lay our head at night and trust me there is enough to do in that respect alone to keep me busy without me needing to run around with a gun.\n\nYou can easily play this game as a pure survival, sneaking and hiding avoiding zombies as much as possible while you scavenge enough food/drink and build yourself and impenitrable bunker to ward off even the most mighty of enivitable hordes which will eventually come looking for you. (and trust me they can be terrifying.... i have literally logged off too scared to play untill my husband joined me)\n\nOr you can play it almost like a fps ... living moment to moment scavenging for supplies while blasting the hell outta zombies with the multitude of weapons the game has.

You get developpers that released a patch on December the 24th around 8pm EST, that's what! These guys are INSANELY dedicated to their game, it's unbelievable. You get a game that has more average players online now than at about any other moment since its alpha release, meaning that the health of the player population is very good and growing. And you get to pat yourself on the back because you've just bought yourself the quintessential zombie survival game available on Steam (and lost a fair chunk of this coming year to potential sleepless nights in the process). You've been warned.\n\n***End of Edit***\n\nWhat do you get when you buy this game? Well, if you already know that its a sandbox voxel-based tower-defense inspired rpg survival first person shooter.... damn that's a mouthful right there. So, what do you get? The bestest game ever made (that is still currently in Alpha), that's what!\n\nI never liked Minecraft. I started hating it after some years. I did like DayZ, played a bit but got bored because the maps were too big/empty. I guess I didn't play on the right servers. Then a friend of mine gave me 7 Days. I would have never bought it. No way. That was back during Alpha 9. I had nothing planned that Saturday so I fired up the game. Started digging down with a friend to make an underground base. He was teaching me stuff about the recipes and what not as I was digging. Then he left and I kept on digging a little bit more. And a little more. Then I figured I should go put the trash out since it was already 4am Monday morning... The trash never made it to the street that week. But my base got big, real big! I had like 20 rooms in it, 19 of which were decoys, and I had.... lots of sadness when the server got reset. Little did I know, a game in Alpha stage is often reset...\n\nWow, ok. Now I know what an alpha is. That **** isn't for me. No way. Or so I thought. Then I told myself that if I had been raided by other players and lost everything it wouldn't have been any different. I love PvP so I can respect that. Then I fired up the game. I didn't have much planned that week. I started digging down with a friend and... another friend bought the game out of nowhere and joined the server we were on. So we dug more. But this time it made no sense to build a palace underground, all I wanted was some PvP resources to make ammos and go shoot people. Then one day I heard the sound of thunder! I mean auger! the sweet, sweet sound of fast-paced destruction! I needed to get me one of these!!!! Then the server got reset.\n\nWow, ok. Now I really know what an alpha is. **** that!!!! Then I read the patch notes. I must have shouted out loud when I read them. It was filled with godly bits of pure joy. I could feel the love the devs had for the game. And the lack of sleep too. This game was gonna be the bestest ever made. So I fired up the game. That was back when Alpha 10 came out. So I fired up the game. This time I knew the resets would be plentiful but I didn't care, I just wanted to kill as many people as I could before the reset. So I started looking for a server with the exact set of rules I wanted and from those few that had them, some had bad admins, some had too low pop (that would include the one that a friend of mine started and that we tried to get more people into) and others had rules close to what I wanted but not exactly it. So I settled for one of them because having good admins that create a good atmosphere with little to no hackers is essential. And then I had a boatload of fun. Until one thing came out in one of the hotfix: a container that could be locked and couldn't get unlocked by the enemy players, forcing them to destroy or avoid it. No more raiding after that point since everyone would hide their stuff in those and we were not allowed to destroy stuff senselessly.\n\nWow, ok, no more raiding, I guess Christmas is coming in 2-3 weeks anyway, I've played too many hours already, I got others games that are being neglected. I shall take a break. Then the devs asked for people to register if they were interested in being VIP testers. Hmmm... Maybe I could shorten the duration of my break and lend them a hand, this game has brought out the tester in me I think. Why not? So I became a VIP tester. For a while, **** ***** ** ******** ** ***** *******. And then ****** ** ****** * **** *** ******. The last month before the patch we ****** ****** ** ******* ** ********. It was ridiculous. Becoming a VIP tester was one of the best idea I've had in a while.\n\nWhile I was a tester I got to see from (just a tiny bit) closer how the devs work, well at least the QA manager. These guys must all have 2 hearts each cause they pour at least one of them daily into this game. This game must be sucking the living life out of them cause they barely sleep. And I'm sure they are enjoying every second of it. By enjoying I mean the sort of joy one gets while eating ramen noodles at 4am because they really really wanna pump out the next patch before going to sleep and they didn't go to the grocery store (who am I kiding, they didn't get them to deliver) in the past week (or was it 2 weeks?).\n\nDuring the 3 months we tested, I believe more than 700 bugs were (introduced and) fixed, while also switching to Unity 5. Using the word workhorses would just be an insult at this point. These guys are pure dedication and passion.\n\nTL/DR: This is not finished. Its not even close to getting in beta. Its the best alpha game ever made (hum, what about Star Citizen you ask?.... well....) that isn't kickstarted with 40M+ $$. If you like any of these words: sandbox voxel-based tower-defense inspired rpg survival first shooter.... or most importantly the word ZOMBIE, then by all mean, get this game!\n\nP.S.: No, H1Z1 is not as good. Neither is Rust.

With that said let's begin\n\n\nI. What is 7 Days to Die?\n\n7 Days to die is a open world zombie survival shooter game. Deep crafting systems, multiple types of zombies, destructible environments, air drops, hunger system, medical system, and thirst system are just some of the main features avaliable in this game.\n\n\nII. Minecraft?\n\nNO! NO! NO! This game is not minecraft! This game is a zombie survival sim with many survival features, minecraft is a sandbox platform game. Please do not ask this ever again.\n\n\nIII. What is singleplayer like?\n\nSingleplayer is in my opinion boring as of 9.1, reason being is the game has no NPCs or quest systems so it feels like a survive or die alone game with nothing behind it (though fans of this system will find it gratifying especially if they set the zombie spawn higher and loot chance lower to increase difficulty)\n\n\nIV. List the zombies please.\n\ninfected survivor (basic)\ninfected cheerleader (basic)\ninfected woman (basic)\nnude walker (basic)\ncrawler (hard to hit knee biter)\nlumberjack (double health normal zombie)\nbloated lumberjack (massive amounts of health don't even bother they are too slow)\nspider zombie (climbs walls and screams ALOT)\nbloater (triple health big slow zombie)\ndog (super fast enemy that will destroy everything you own)\nspewer (cop that spits vomit that melts blocks, blows up when close both do massive amounts of damage health is equal to bloater)\nhornet (zombie air force slightly slower than dog drops honey yum)\n\n\nV. How is multiplayer?\n\nMultiplayer is stable though there are the occasional stutter (that is not related to my connection or specs) but this is barely noticable. Multiplayer has a balance system to it in that the more people you have, the more mouths to feed and the more medical supplies you will run through. I personally have had quite a few wonderful moments such as a group of four surviving together and wondering if I should kill a friend because he's infected (perma death is on) I had a healing anti biotic but it was my only one, so I shot him to save my own skin later (they found out and executed me lol) the multiplayer has a lot of similar things that happen. Help a friend defend his house and waist your bullets that you just crafted or let him fight them alone and hope he doesn't die? Do you share your extra gun and hope that the others don't shoot you in a bad situation or just smelt it down and say you don't have one? These are literally endless and are controlled by you so it adds a sense of joy and excitement to the game that most zombie games lack in MP.\n\n\nVI, List the pros of this game please. (As of 9.1)\n\nGreat multiplayer\nGood hunger system that feels balanced (not too hungry or too full all the time)\nstamina system is linked to your water intake\nYour character can run a long way to show that in a death situation your guy would give his all\nCrafting system is very deep and makes sense\nblock upgrade system uses resources and actually makes a difference\nFully destructable enviorment\nFarming system is farely easy to do and can mean a lot\nzombie hordes are usually sizeable\nmultiple zombie types keep it interesting\nDisease and Health system with medical system\nCreative Mode is a lot of fun the ability to spawn a zombie behind your friend never gets old\nProcedural generation makes new maps each time, with a few biomes and quite a few building templates this makes the world really fun to traverse\n\n\nVII. List the cons please.\n\nzombies will spawn inside your fortress and house\nzombie spawn settings only seem to effect hordes and not the annoying single zombies\nspewer zombies seem to track you anywhere\nthe falling system is a bit unreliable\nzombies will get stuck and glitch making them unable to die but still able to hit you\nno NPCs\nno singleplayer quests\nsingleplayer is less enjoyable than multiplayer but can still be fun depending on you.\n\n\nVIII. Conclusion\n\n7 Days is a zombie game unlike anyother I have found, the survival system is super fun and the multiplayer in my opinion is the best done. Early access makes this game buggy but, the devs update fairly often and listen to fans to make sure the game is aweomse. All in all this is a zombie game up there with The Dead Linger and Project Zomboid, this game IS NOT minecraft or DayZ this game is what you make it more than anything, the question is what will your zombie story be?\n\n\nIX.

Positive review from me here.\n\nThis is my first review on steam for a game and is because I am very angry at the whole way they are dealing with the cheating issues with the basic attitude of the developers who basically are saying theres no way to stop it so stop asking us to fix it.\n\nIF you play on any server your base will get hacked, basical the server is open to client map files allowing modification and checking map to see where player bases are, where players are (while not on your friends list.) They can change the damage given, the damage they recieve, where they spawn (without a bed). Even tunnel through bedrock to escape easily after they have filled in your base.\n\nBasically raids on bases are legal in PVP where your base is protected by landclaim blocks.\nIn a hack - land claim blocks do nothing to stop hackers because they change their damage to a rediculous amounts.\n\nMy friends and I on our third server we have lost everything decided to make a base hidden in a mountain, no forges would ever be running and all our stuff was at bedrock with a small tunnel as only means of entering. And about 10 minutes run from the main starting area.\n\nTook the guy 5 minutes to completely fill in our base and tunnel out the bedrock leaving a hole into nothing where you fall, then log out and come back in to be on the surface. We have taken screen shots of this.\nUsually you can spot a hacker when their ping is over 250 and they have the ability to set all pings to 0 there by disquising themselves. The steam ban does nothing for hacks as players can simply use family library sharing to get back on the servers they are banned from and keep playing the game.\n\nIf you want this game to play with a friend and PVE its a really good game.\nIf you want to play with other people, dont bother. Save your money cause all the work you do will be lost within minutes by hackers.\nIf you buy the game to play with others on an open server enjoy - 7 ways to be Hacked!","December 17, 2014","false","477.1"," 846 of 1,228 people (69%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","69","846","1","23","78"

The best one out there I'd say. The amount of content the dev's continuously bring to this game is amesome and I am grateful for that.. This game is addicting and surpasses what I ever expected of it to grow into. So why am I giving it a negative review?\n\nLets just say this games anticheat software is rather worthless and the developers don't seem to care or be focusing on that issue. I have more than once, ended up on a server with ONE single person modding/hacking/cheating that destroys it for everybody on the server, literally. It drives me crazy. The game is difficult as is and I'd like people to comment to see if their experiences is rather the same. I want to know if hackers and cheaters are as bad in this game as I think they are. Here is my experience lately.\n\nMost recently I had a server that I put 2 days straight worth of work into to have it gone in a second due to one single person. That one single person somehow was able to hone missles from out of nowhere and kill everybody on the map as well as destroy all their supply crates, beds and you name it.. gone. I was also deep underground. To the bedrock. Yet a missle came from nowhere and killed me. Destroyed my bed, crates and everything, continuously no matter where I spawned. Me and the 2 other players I was playing with were furious.. As well as the rest on the server. What a waste of time.\n\nThis is the problem I run into with every multiplayer server based game out there is hackers and cheaters that just ruin it for everybody. I really have no interest to return to the game. What is the point in putting in all that hard work. Hours, Days or weeks worth of work just to have it gone in an instant.  My recommendation is if your going to play, play on a server that is watched and you know is safe and possibly password protected and private. Otherwise, prepare for the worst on open servers.\n\nSo please, if you will. I want to know everybodies experience with this issue.","December 16, 2014","false","180.7"," 487 of 698 people (70%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","70","487","698","17","50"

Do not let the trailer on the steam store page turn you off, it is extremely outdated, atleast more than two years ago. The game has changed drastically. This game started out as a voxel based, blocky, survival hode crafting game. It has turned into a voxel based, randomly generated, smooth terrained, amazing visuals, and overall VERY fun and hardcore game. (You can choose between Random Gen Map & Premade Navezgane)\n\nUI: 7/10 (Relatively easy to understand)\nGraphics: 7/10\nAnimations: 3/10 (First person is fine, third person needs work)\nCrafting: 6/10 (The old crafting was slightly harder to grasp, but was more unique)\nSingleplayer: 9/10 (The sort of ideal way to play the game)\nMultiplayer: 8/10 (The game is just as fun with friends, and is more of a co-op experience rather than PvP)\nContent Amount: 8/10\nHardcore Features: 10/10\n\nOverall Rating: 8.3/10\n\nThe reason I give it an 8.3 is because not that many of the flaws in the game are because of the fact it is in Early Access. Sure, the animations and things like that will be improved, but I feel like the way the game is going now is not the way it was originally going, and this may be for the worse. I'm not saying to not buy this game, because it is truly a magnificent game. Definately worth a buy.\n\nHow many hours will you get out of this game no matter who you are?

And, as such, it still has some bugs, though not that many in my limited experience. And the rumors are true: it's an ugly game, mostly. I'm not here to give an in-depth review, however, I'm here to tell you why I like this game and why you should give it a chance.\n\nTo give you just a taste, imagine if you combined Minecraft with DayZ and got rid of the terrible community of snarks, hackers, and griefers (DayZ players, you know what I mean), all while fixing the zombies so that they not only work, but work smart instead of hard. Yes, at times I can't help feeling that the same people who did the art for Killing Floor had something to do with this gem, but think of 7DtD as the one who can't coast on looks alone who instead tries hard to bring something to the table besides inane meteorological commentary. If 7DtD has anything, it's brainzzz... No, I'm serious, it's a smart game with smartly done zombies.\n\nImagine playing minecraft in a world without the blocky style (or the odd beauty that accompanies it at times), where instead of laughing at vanilla zombies you run and sneak and generally fear for your life because they are "coming to get you, Barbara..." (sorry, I had to... the flying turtles made me). Imagine a world where you choose between Romero or 28 style zed, where said zed can smell if you're carrying  some rabbit or deer meat on your person, where zombo can hear you searching that house because you broke a window to get in and then had to break into a fortified area to get at the safe you spied between the boards over the doorway, where the walking dead might be easy one on one, but damning and deadly should you not stay on top of your game and get cornered by a horde, where you never know what the game is going to throw at you next because although some things remain predictable, those things seem refreshingly logical and limited.\n\nYou take down an infected nurse and find some medical supplies. You search a car and find some auto parts. Medicines are where you'd expect them. Guns are where you'd expect them. Food and supplies are pretty much where you'd expect them. You're not going to find a wolf carrying a sack of gold or a rat carrying bits of materials for you to use in crafting. Sometimes, a town will have a pharmacy and be full of rare medical supplies. Sometimes, a town will have a weapons supplier that has nothing left on its shelves. Sometimes you'll stumble into a snowy region or a fallout zone and find some unusual things. Sometimes you'll feel the game is unfair, but it's up to you to set your boundaries because, like Minecraft, you can set the game to creative and enable cheats if that's the way you want to play it. Run from those zombies, or fly, the choice is up to you. Either way, I've solidly enjoyed my brief time in this game and I urge you to consider not skipping it even though you may feel that you've killed all the zombies you could want to kill in one lifetime.\n\nMy one qualifier on my recommendation is that you should factor into your decision whether you will be able to play this game with friends because, like Minecraft, it's perhaps most fun when it's done with people you care about and enjoy spending time with.\n\nThanks for reading. Hope to see you in game soon.","May 11, 2015","true","48.1"," 96 of 120 people (80%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","80","96","120","18","7"

They have sprinkled in mocap, new HUD, new zombie skins, some graphics upgrades, and a whole load of xml tweaks.  There is an absolute obsession by the developers to take a mechanic that is working just fine (forge, resource harvesting, and crafting) and change it.  There is also a focus on making the beginning of the game more difficult and much more tedious, but they have not added anything for once you get past the early stages of the game.\n\nAfter over two years: just one rudimentary vehicle, no npcs, no quests, no electricity (and the plethora of items that could be added with electricity), no gates/large doors, no animal domestication, no fishing, and no rivers in random world generation.  These are just a few things that could be added for content, not a dispositive list.\n\nIt seems like the devs are just constantly shuffling around small features and fixing other features that are not broken.\n\nIt's a shame because this was one of my favorite games.  Hopefully they are able get it back on track.\n\nEdit:  Another aspect of the game that is not the fault of the developers, but needs to be addressed regardless is the cesspool the Steam forum for this game has become.  It is basically open hostility towards people who put forth their own negative opinions on an alpha game.  The tone of the forum has drastically changed over the past few months into  an echo chamber in which it is required for everyone to either like every change the developers make to the game or to make excuses for the game's shortcomings.  This is not how you make a game better, diversity of opinion should be encouraged, not chased off and silenced by the angry mob.\n\nEdit: An example of forum decorum: http://steamcommunity.com/app/251570/discussions/0/412449508276608974/","January 8","false","223.7"," 180 of 248 people (73%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","73","180","248","12","17"

Rivers existed and wound their way through landscapes randomly. It felt real.\nHordes worked, coming and going as they pleased. They consisted of a good mix of zeds and followed sort-of predictable patterns.\nEnd-game content was (and still is) pretty limited, but there was always stuff to do.\nIt didn't take weeks in-game to be able to look after yourself and there was no absurdly long list of recipe gates preventing you from doing fairly simple and intuitive things. For the most part, if you had the resources you could do it.\nTo survive, all you really needed was a good, defensible location and a determination to make it yours.\nEverything else you could find underground or a short walk from the front door, past your huge walls and defensive spikes.\nSome people didn't like this mixture of easy to learn but harder to master. I loved it and I sank hundreds of hours into A9.\n\nA10 came along and 7DTD changed a little. We got a heatmap. Spider zeds became scouts that came when you did too much cooking or forging and they brought hordes with them if you didn't cap them ASAP. That was the biggest change. It didn't ruin the game at all, it just meant your defences had to be even better. You could still take care of yourself and play the same way (mostly).\nEverything else was still pretty good, I even got my feet wet in online MP and discovered things like vanishing trees and new defence ideas. I sank hundreds of hours into A10 too.\n\nThen... the rollercoaster passed its apex and started heading down when A11 was launched.\nThe world switched to Unity 5 and, I think, became much uglier. Terrain became difficult to navigate and felt much more rigid. It didn't "flow". Rivers were dead straight, cliff-sided and always divided biomes. I could be wrong, but I think this is when devs also added biome blending. This on its own wasn't bad except they also added fog and biome effects. The fog was everywhere, in my house, outside my house, underground, just everywhere. It was ugly and unnecessary. It was like they turned the atmosphere dial past 10 and broke it ... and left it broken. Some biomes became nearly impassable at all times of day with dust and fog in the air all the time.\nThe devs also introduced dog hordes on day 6 in the 7 day cycle. Why? I don't know. I just knew that without warning on day 6 you would find yourself assaulted by (sometimes) 20+ dogs, usually being mauled to death if ill-equipped.\nSpeaking of ill-equipped, the devs also introduced item quality into this build... and the much-maligned forge-gate, Forge Ahead.\nGreat concepts, but hamfisted implementations.\nThe game became tedious in the first week or so. Your choice of play style was taken from you. You now HAD to survive by looting, because unless you found Forge Ahead, you couldn't do anything. You couldn't even replace your supercrap stone tools with supercrap metal tools that broke almost as quickly.\nYou HAD to go into caves to find randomly allocated ores.\nYou HAD to do all of this with utterly crap tools and equipment before ridiculously oversized dog hordes found you. The game became 6 days to die and the rollercoaster sank lower with every hour I played. I devoted significantly fewer hours to A11, but I did get back into MP just before A12 came out.\n\nSpeaking of A12...\nThe devs introduced a great sounding RGEN3. A poorly working RGEN3. Biomes became dictated by height and rivers vanished. Most of the world is desert (which is now THE place to be) and everywhere else is full of bears. In my first few spawns on literally THE easiest, most bludgy settings that still involved zombies I died in under 2 minutes. Most times involved getting eaten by a bear that I spawned next to, the other one that sticks out to me was spawning in the middle of a city and getting eaten by dogs as soon as I had left my "safe" bubble.\nI then turned off zombies and found the game to be marvellously enjoyable. I still had bears everywhere to worry about, but the sheer number of game-limiting recipe gates didn't bother me. The fact that I now had to grind for 2 in-game weeks to even find Forge Ahead or another recipe for anything/everything remotely useful wasn't such a bad thing.\nThe paucity of biomes other than desert is thoroughly disappointing though. The rapidity with which heighmaps change can render entire biomes (like plains) mere metres thick before the next biome up (forest) appears and then disappears into pine forest and snowy pine forest. The game world is a mere shadow of its former A9/10 self.\nI am pleased to say, however, that the devs have tweaked the item quality system and you're now endowed with less-crap crap tools at the start. I hear you can still get eaten by dogs on day 6 though. Unfortunately, in truth, I've become so disillusioned with this game that I'm yet to make it to day 6 in A12. It just isn't fun to play now.\nAlso, my minibike keeps vanishing when I open/close the chassis for the 2nd time. That really annoys me, given the amount of resources one must expend in order to craft it in a vast, sparse and depressingly depressing desert.\nYes, the rollercoaster is going down and picking up speed.\n\nThe devs have also heralded further un-fun-en-ing (unfunnening?) with the announcement of their intent to remove the game's core crafting grid mechanic and replace it with a list based crafting menu thingy that sounds like shattered dreams and sweaty, sleepless nights (not the good kind).\n\nAnd so I must say with much regret and a stabbing feeling where my heart was... I do not currently recommend this game.\n\nA13 Update\n\nMany things have been fixed, and many things have changed.\nThe most noticeable is that the world has multiple biomes again and they're expansive. As for gameplay?\nYou're extra slow, the hunger and drink bars are gone and have been replaced with a VERY brief popup of percentage remaining and you get chills and cold and the like.\nEverything must now be harvested.\nZombies don't die like they used to, they stumble around and soak up excess ammo because it's hard to know if they're dead or not. They suffer some stagger and knockback but generally only with the 2nd or 3rd hit, so you usually get hurt in melee.\n\nThe devs were correct in saying this plays like a completely different game - a worse game.\nI have to stand by my red review. This game is still a shadow of its former self, A9/10.\nSpeaking of which, if A9/10 was released as a standalone I'd buy it and I'd tell everyone else to buy it too. A13? Not worth it guys.  I'm deleting it and if I could I'd ask for a refund.","July 23, 2015","false","053.6"," 448 of 655 people (68%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","68","448","655","44","39"

If crafting is your thing, then this has it all. Take over a building and make it your own, or build your own stronghold. The hordes can be nasty, but that's what it's all about surviving. With the newly implemented skill system you can cater to all your needs. There simply isn't anything you can't do really. Can even find a poop in toilets. Now THAT is in depth.

The light of the full moon poured through the gaps in the boarded windows, setting a sense of calm about the place. The shack that Dave and I had spent a few days building and fortifying stood strong and sturdy. We hadn't had much trouble from zombies during construction and fetching supplies, just a few stragglers here and there. The only thing is however, I didn't know whether that was a good thing or a bad thing. A very bad thing.\n\nA stag roamed past our shelter this morning, so quick to spring into action I aimed my crossbow at its rear, and pulled the trigger. It tried to run off a few paces before collapsing to the ground. I approached the stag cautiously making sure no zombies in the nearby area had heard its screams of pain and come to catch an early lunch. I pressed my knife into its throat and yanked hard down to its abdomen. The warmth of the beast reminded me of home. Home, before everything was so ♥♥♥♥ed up. Snuggled on the couch with a blanket watching the Walking Dead wondering what life would actually be like if a zombie apocolypse were ever to occur. I guess i found the answer to that one!\n\nWrapping the Venison steaks in leaves and putting them in my backpack i headed back. On arriving Dave was boiling water over the campfire in a cooking pot. Placing the steaks down by his side i noticed him wipe away a tear and swallow his sorrow. Normally i would have asked him what was wrong however i knew the answer. Yesterday we lost Frank. It was only meant to be a quick in-and-out supply run to the local village for antibiotics but, while searching a medicine cabinet Frank did not see or hear a zombie dog behind him. Poor guy never stood a chance.\n\nA few hours later Dave and myself were just finishing a nice bowl of venison stew. A single candle burned between as to not give off to much light or heat to draw attention to ourselves. The windows were boarded up good but you can never be too safe. Taking both our bowls over to the rusty old sink I peer out of the window. And there, reflecting off the light of the moon, pressed to the glass, i see the harrowing face of a spider zombie...\n\nI get a shock and drop the bowls. They shatter into tiny pieces off the decayed brick flooring. The noise alone is enough to set the spider zombie into a raging frenzy. Its long black fingers crept through inbetween the wooden planks used to board the windows, solidifying its grip it pulls with all of its strength however it does not budge. Aggrevated, starved and looking for another way in it climbed onto the roof. Pounding with its almighty strength onto the wooden plank roof reinforced with scrap iron it knew that that wasn't going to work either. By this time Dave had ran upstairs and fetched two shotguns from the gun cabinet, a long barrel and a sawn-off. i took the sawn-off, loaded it, and held it tightly to my chest; and then came the sound we know the horror of all to well.\n\nThe spider zombie on the roof let out an almighty screech which echoed off into the distance. An eerie silence hung around the shelter so thick you could bite it. And then, from over the nearby hill, a screech was returned...\n\nThe silence came and went however this time was broken by the sound of footsteps. Not walking footsteps, but running footsteps. And they were getting louder, and louder, and louder. Then like an army of charging horses all at once the horde smacked against the side of the house, with a thud so loud it was like a gunshot going off inside your head. Faster than we could think of a survival plan the wall crumbled and the zombies came hurtling in. They were hungry. Very hungry. Dave was first to shoot, the buckshot spread enough to cover 2 maybe 3 zombies at once. Quick to follow i too took aim. Our gunshots rattled the woodwork in the shelter and i began to think we were overwhelmed. There were spider zombies all over the house. Bloaters spitting acid and disintegrating the foundations. Dogs growling and snarling from every direction. Saying a quick prayer I signal to Dave that we should make a run for it. Even if we could fight off this horde the repairs alone would be pointless and starting fresh elsewhere would probably be quicker. Opening the back door and making a dash for it we clear a smaller crowd. Running low on ammo confirmed to me it had to be this way. We were low on ammo, low on stamina and low on HP. Running up the nearby hill we had lost sight of the horde, pausing for breath we stood for a while. Looking at the remains of our home crumble and fall. And it was at that exact moment, a couple of crawler zombies come out of no where and killed us both, GG.\n\n11/10 would die again!","March 15, 2015","true","228.4"," 81 of 102 people (79%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","79","81","102","58","1"

It truly is a diamond in the rough. Normally upon purchasing an early access game I give up on it after 10 hours of gameplay because there simply isn't anything left to do but in this game the possibilities are endless. That being said, this game is quite challenging and I've heard of many people ragequitting before giving it a real chance. The learning curve in this game is pretty difficult to overcome but once you do everything comes together and it becomes SO much fun. You can build a base, secure it against zombies and other players. You can go exploring and find countless cities and structures to loot and you'll always find new stuff. The most fun to be had in my opinion though is raiding other player bases. It truly is a challenge finding people's land claim blocks and destroying them so that you can access their loot chests, it adds an element of thought that no game like this has done.\n\nThe zombies in this game are unique as well, in my opinion. They are extremely committed to finding you, knocking down your defences and munching on your brains. At one point a horde actually smashed through an entire mountain to get at me, these zombies offer a true sense of fear and intensity that others simply do not. That being said, it is truly rewarding to build up a base and fortify it to the point that every night when the hordes come a knocking you can stand your ground and wipe them out.\n\nIf you are  looking for a zombie survival game this is definitely the one to go with, it offers countless hours of gameplay, its crafting system is very in depth and seemingly endless and new items/features are constantly being added. This is the only early access game that I truly have faith in right now, and the way it's going right now it seems it will just get better and better. Great job by the devs, keep up the good work guys!\n\nCurrent rating: 9/10","January 28, 2015","true","301.8"," 65 of 79 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","65","79","4","0"

I expected another half-hearted pseudo-sandbox with pushover survival mechanics. My expectations were way off mark.\n\n1) 7DtD has one of the most comprehensive crafting sysmtes I seen, even in building within the world, with many tools that provide a variety of benefits and a plethora of resources differing by biome that alter the way you manage your survival. The world is fully detructible, being able to dig and mine (with some decent physics) as well as destroying parts of the landscape (or cityscape), thrown in with many gatherable items for survival purposes.\n\n2) Survival itself is key and is directly tied into game play. Managing your hunger and thirst will determine not only how long you will live, but more nuanced features, like stamina and wellness. There are many resources available to satisfy both survival mechanics, but you have to manage them well to maximize their effectiveness, and you have to gather them without dying.\n\n3) Zombies are no joke. Even during the day time, if you're hammering on zombies with your crossbow, all it takes is for one not-so-noticeable zombie to flank you, and you're dead. Taking hits from zombies can detriment you in several ways, including bleeding, infection, and being temporarily stunned.\n\nAt its stage in development, this game is already basically a fully-fledged game, and it only continues to get better with bugfixes and additional content. 10/10","December 24, 2014","true","54.3"," 55 of 64 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","55","64","2","0"

Zombies in Hawaii-themed shirts are after your delicious brain and the dogs are not your friends. I repeat, the dogs are not your friends (I made the mistake of thinking they were).\n\nLike many other survival games before it, your job is to build a suitable enough environment in which you can live out the rest of your post-apocalyptic life in (I'm guessing that is the purpose, I've never really survived that long...) Anyways, there are many items at your disposal and the possibilities are endless. Based off of the discussions in the forums, there will be more options in the future which only enhances the quality and price of the game. The developers are, from the looks of it, more than willing to listen to their player base which is definitely a huge plus.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPros+ I can pretend I'm in The Walking Dead\n+ Amazing replayability value here, all for a decent 24,99$ pricetag\n+ Offers a "cheat mode" which, of course, makes things much easier. Still provides hours of entertainment\n+ Very fungame to play with friends - I've already lost so many hours playing this, it's ridiculous (but clearly not as many hours as many others! That just proves how great this game is)\n+ Fun Pimps, the developer's, are amazingly responsive to their fan base. They roll out updates in a timely manner and are always working to better their product. You can't beat that kind of dedication\n+ This game is truly terrifying at times. It doesn't have a "horror tag", but I think it really deserves one. Then again, my threshold for scares is dangerously low... this game has been known to terrifying my most manliest of man friends though!\n+ Graphics are great - they have improved vastly since it was first released. If you can, play it on high graphics (you will have to restart the game if you change during the middle of your gameplay. Otherwise you will see chrome, neon, and black figures instead of a human being, etc.)\n\nCons- Would like to see some improvements to defensive measures: items, like the spikes, prove to be too ineffective at times (zombies can glide over sometimes)\n- So many optimistaion issues; so, so many... the game has been plagued with lag since the beginning, and I hoped that it would've improved by now,  but alas, it hasn't\n- Can there be some achievements and trading cards? I know this is "not the mark of a true gamer", but I truly enjoy this game and would like to have a flashy badge to prove it\n- Can there be some "bandits" and "rivals"? Likewise, it would be nice to have other "survivors" that you can pick up along the way. They can either be persuaded to join your group or become enemies... Am I fangirling over The Walking Dead too much?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nI've been playing this game since it was first released: from the basic blocks, lagfests, and terrible graphics, to its now far more superior quality and number of improvements. While I don't have the hours to prove it (since a lot of time was spent offline), this is a game that I absolutely adore.\n\nIn the end, 7 Days to Die has a lot to offer and at a more than decent price, lives up to expectations. With more updates coming along the way, and a sufficient player count, you honestly can't go wrong with this title.\n\nOverall8/10\n\nBeware every 7th day... you have been warned.","May 29, 2015","true","72.4"," 140 of 197 people (71%) found this review helpful 198 people found this review funny","71","140","197","198","3"

So understandably, there's still a lot more content that the developers are planning that have not yet been implemented (such as Mods, NPCs, story/plot, more types of animals, character builds/personalization, many HD models, and much more). That also means that if there are bugs, glitches or pereformance issues that you have complaints about, depending on how critical it is the developers will get to it eventually and release sub version patches (alpha 13.1, alpha 13.2, so on and so on).\n\nNow that that's out of the way let's move on.\n\nAs of V12.5 (literally days if not hours before the release of Alpha 13) after you "create" you're character/profile you start out in your underwear in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a bottle of water, a can of food, a torch, and ..... I forget what else, but it's not much.\nYou have a certain amount of time in this starting safe zone (like 5 minutes or something) to procure the materials that you need in order to create your starting survival gear/tools before the zombies start to spawn around you. Collect grass to make grass pants, collect cotton to make cloth armor, some grass, some sticks, and some rocks let you make your first stone axe, some grass and sticks make a bow, and with some feathers, sticks, and rocks/metal scraps you can make some arrows. It's not much, but it will at least allow you to defend yourself.\nYou can see a list of what you are able to craft as well as what materials are needed in your menu, and you can learn recipes for other more advanced items by finding recipe books.\nCurrently your crafting qualityand skill is determined by your level, but I think when Alpha 13 is released it's being changed to a "use it to improve it" system. For example, the more you use/craft bows the more proficient you become with them and you can create better quality.\nYou can customize a lot of your settings/gameplay options when starting a game, but in a standard game the zombies walk slowly during the day and run during the night, so you'll probably want to take the oppotunity of your first day to make your basics and then find some kind of shelter to hide in for when night comes (a cabin, a cave, or even dig a hole in the groud and cover it back up from the inside). You also want to be careful about creating noise and heat (chopping down a tree, firing a gun, cooking food in a campfire) that will attract the attention of zombies.\nThe random generated maps are currently infinite in size and come with many different areas to explore called biomes (dessert biome, forest biome, snow, swamp, plains, etc.) and are blended together very well now, so there's not any noticable borders between them anymore.\n\nI could go on but this getting a bit long winded alredy, so I'll just let you figure the rest out for yourselves. I highly recommend this game, and it has been a blast seeing all the changes and new content as it has developed.","November 28, 2015","true","506.0"," 100 of 135 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","100","135","3","0"

I was pleased by the gameplay I'd seen on YouTube but given my limited understanding and (most importantly) my one dimensional thinking, and my first 45 minutes in game were not pleasant. My buddy and I got together with someone who'd been playing a touch longer and she showed us a few things we weren't thinking to do.\n\nMy buddy and I come from playing all manner of games but when it comes to survival games, DayZ is where we started REALLY getting into those hardcore kind of unforgiving games. But it is limited in what it all can do. We moved on to DayZ Epoch and even still, given everything it's capable of, we just weren't prepared for this level of construction and destruction. The sheer amount of freedom you have at building and destroying things, is mind boggling. I can safely say, my initial impressions of this game were WRONG. I love this game and I've already begun building my secret underground base. It's insane what I can do.\n\nIt won't be for everyone, I know that but really, if you're into minecraft and/or DayZ, give this game a go. It really is something fresh and the devs did a great job here. The only major issues I can level at it, for the moment, is perhaps graphics but I'll take a hit in that department for wonderful gameplay and that's where this delivers. There may be other cons but this game isn't a full release yet so listing them would perhaps be negligent on my part, as given that it's an Alpha, problems are to be expected.","October 31, 2014","true","16.7"," 70 of 89 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","70","89","0","0"

Only downside to this game it is a little hard to play alone. I dont play alone now but when i first started an trying to learn the game I felt like i wasnt able to learn bc i was dying ever five mins from other players. so if you get this game start on a easy server with little to no ppl.\nNow also prepare to spend alot of time on this game, it takes a long time to get everything going for you. I know once you learn the game, it wont take as long to do things because you'll know what to do an where to find stuff.\nHIDE YOUR STUFF WELL! I cant say that enough, now while i have robbed ppls bases when they were no longer online i do know the feeling when you log on an all your stuff is missing. It sucks. So hide it. Behind a wall or floor or be sure to landclaim the crap out of your place. bc trust me they will get in. landclaim or not. <-- hide those as well!\n\nWaiting on alpha 11 atm, so by the time you read this my thoughts on some of the game have been fixed or are no longer a problem. Please please please keep in mind this is an alpha game. that means its not finished so you will find things the glitch out. thats norm for a Alpha Game!\nIts an open world, so pvp is going to happen. doesnt mean every person will kill you but most will. I just killed my first person the other day. not much for pvp. an the pve servers still have ppl who pvp. its just a game.. get over it.\nSo as nice as someone sound keep in mind they might kill you an take your stuff. Not all but most.\n\nI recommend you an a friend to play an start this game together, its more fun this way. also maybe watch some starting out video on youtube. they can help. Wiki helps too. Not every server is right for you, so you could start on one server an have a nice set up, but then you find one thats evern better. look at the bright side of starting over. you can fix what you messed up on your last house to look even cooler.\n\nSorry kinda ranting. But this game is really fun. just have to give it time to learn how to play an then your set.\n","March 6, 2015","true","897.1"," 73 of 94 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","73","94","5","4"

EVERYTHING IS DESTROYABLE! And i mean it. All of the buildings, roads, mountains and trees.\n2. Physics. This ain't nothing like Minecraft where you can build a house ontop of a 10 meters 1x1 block tall stack of blocks. You need to add support pillars in order for the building to stay up. If you don't you're dead if the structure collapses on you.\n3. Crafting. You can make a lot of different weapons, tools, traps, mines and other items.\n4. Map is endless. + You can find a lot of different and cool cities, towns, lone houses and camps on the way that hold supplies.\n5. Zombies! Many kind of zombies; from fat slow ones to hot nurses.\n6. Wildlife. Deers, rabbits, pigs, bears, dogs and giant hornets!\n7. Sound quality is quite good to be honest, i like it.\n8. Survival all in all. It is quite hard to survive if you are playing on one of the hard difficulties. (There are 6 difficulty levels). You need to gather food and water to survive. And let us not forget medicine.\n9. Combat is not really that great but you can manage it.\n10. PvE and PvP!\n11. At Every 7th night a lot of zombies will come in large numbers and try to kill you. And i mean it..In large numbers so be prepared.\n\n--CONS--  1. Bad framerate on low/medium pc's. Could use some optimisation as soon as possible.\n2. Graphics are decent enough, can be done better.\n3. Some lag might appear after some time of playing.\n4. Some parts of the generated world is weird. Specially around towns.\n\n\n\nAll in all. Great game and worth buying. Hours of fun specially in co-op.\n9/10\n\n\n\nTL:DR ->\n\n█▀▀ㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ▀▀█▀▀ㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ █▀▀▄\n▀▀█ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ █ㅤㅤㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ ㅤ █\n▀▀▀ㅤ▀ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤㅤ ▀ㅤㅤ ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤ █▀▀\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ▄▀▀▄ㅤ█▀▀▄ㅤ █▀▀▄\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█▄▄▀\n\n─────███────██\n──────████───███\n────────████──███\n─────────████─█████\n████████──█████████\n████████████████████\n████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n██─────██████████████\n███────────█████████\n█──█───────────████\n█──────────────██\n██──────────────█────────▄███████▄\n██───███▄▄──▄▄███──────▄██$█████$██▄\n██──█▀───▀███────█───▄██$█████████$██▄\n██──█───█──██───█─█──█$█████████████$█\n██──█──────██─────█──█████████████████\n██──██────██▀█───█─────██████████████\n─█───██████──▀████───────███████████\n──────────────────█───────█████████\n─────────────▀▀████──────███████████\n────────────────█▀──────██───████▀─▀█\n────────────────▀█──────█─────▀█▀───█\n──▄▄▄▄▄▄▄────────██────█───████▀───██\n─█████████████────▀█──█───███▀──▄▄██\n─█▀██▀██▀████▀█████▀──█───██████▀─▀█\n─█────────█▄─────────██───████▀───██\n─██▄████▄──██────────██───██──▄▄▄██\n──██▄▄▄▄▄██▀─────────██──█████▀───█\n─────────███────────███████▄────███\n────────███████─────█████████████\n───────▄██████████████████████\n████████─██████████████████\n─────────██████████████\n────────███████████\n───────█████\n──────████\n─────████\n\nㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀▀█▀▀ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ█ㅤ▄█ㅤ█▀▀\nㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ█ ㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█▀▀▄ ㅤ█▀▀\nㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀ㅤ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀ㅤ▀ㅤㅤ▀ㅤ▀▀▀\n\n█▀▄▀█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ█▀▄▀█ ▄▀▀▄ █▀▀▄ █▀▀ █ ㅤ █ㅤ█\n█─▀─█ㅤ█▄▄█ㅤㅤ █─▀─█ █ ㅤ █ █ ㅤ █ █▀▀ █▄▄█ㅤ█\n█ㅤㅤ █ㅤ▄▄▄█ㅤ ㅤ█ㅤㅤ█ ─▀▀ ─ ▀ ㅤ ▀ ▀▀▀ ▄▄▄█ㅤ▄","November 8, 2015","true","64.0"," 67 of 85 people (79%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","79","67","85","24","2"

I'm not very picky when it comes to talk about graphics so I'll subjectively say that, even tho it'll never overshadow engines like the CryEngine for instance, 7D2D is not an ugly game at all, I even happen to find the game really beautiful sometimes, mostly when I'm going through woods or clearings.\nThere are of course some flaws and bugs, most of them appearing after every major update, but the devs often fix them very quickly. Talking about the devs, they are very attentive to feedbacks and keep the communication with the community really open, which obviously leads to faster bug fixes and advancement through the updates.\n\nMy friend and I are coming back on the game every major update to try all the new features, items and other stuff, that makes it never getting boring. For instance, the major addition of alpha 12 is a craftable minibike, it makes the game so different once you managed to get one. We got one each and are having a hell load of fun with it. Being so mobile is truly enjoyable and driving over zombzombs (or innocent piggies and bunnies >.>) is even more.\n\nIf you like zombie survival and crafting games then I highly recommand you to give it a shot, 7D2D is definitely worth its price, even as a pre-release game.","July 30, 2015","true","515.9"," 68 of 88 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","68","88","2","3"

I have played every release since the very first one before this game ever hit steam so I've really had a chance to see this game grow. And it sure as hell IS growing!\nLet's keep this short and sweet.\n\nPROS:\n-A very solid voxel game (IMO)\n-Great Graphics (for a voxel game)\n-Good sound\n-Good controls\n-Good gameplay, crafting, looting, building, mining. It's all very nice.\n-Beautiful randomly generated worlds complete with ruined towns and even cities!\n-Wonderful smooth voxel terrain! As functional as that of Minecraft but much prettier!\n-Pretty damn polished for an Alpha!! Like really!\n-Great development team! These guys are serious, skilled and well funded!\n\nCONS:\n-It's an alpha so there's still some small glitches but honestly I haven't experienced any glitches in a long time.\n-Not enough different kinds of zombies!!! (I'm sure they're gonna add more though)\n-Doesn't work well on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computers. (Oh well, not a problem for me :P)\n-Building with certain materials has become a bit cumbersome and overdone. It's still ok though.\n-It's built on Unity.

Gettin tired of seeing that same fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his ugly-♥♥♥ hawaian shirt!\n-FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! I WOULD PAY $20+ FOR THIS FEATURE ALONE!!\n-VEHICLES!!!!!!!!

Think about fallout 3 with zombies, hunting, and building/renovating a place of your own. Set in a post-apocalyptic landscape, the constructions players can set up are equally representative of a post-apocalyptic environment.\n\nIf you heard of project zomboid, well if you ask me this is exactly that but better; the annoying needs are removed, the game plays fluently, the environment is already less buggy, and your freedom is more obvious. The crafting system is worked out very well as well: the game lists everything you can make with your inventory. When you choose something, it shows the shape but not the materials.

So much so that I will write my one and only steam review.\n\nI will only speak of general gameplay and not really of game features.  You can find those elsewhere.\n\nI only play SP and without the harder settings (e.g. zombies always run) enabled so there is even more gameplay to be had. I also only play on randomly generated maps which are infinite. You define a seed value to generate these maps. There is a standard map to play that I've never seen. =P\n\nThere are minor bugs in this Alpha build but no real gamebreaking bugs. The Fun Pimps are on the ball and do what they can to fix those even though the focus is on content (Alpha = content, Beta = bugfixes). I don't think I've ever had a CTD with this software.\n\n-Crafting is good and fairly complex. Quality in crafting is linked to your level. Loot is available at any quality level.\n\n-Structural integrity is a thing and does make you think about your basebuilding which can be massive both below ground and above. You are limited to about sixty meters below grade before hitting bedrock and much more above grade (if it doesn't collapse!).\n\n-Combat is varied with the different zombie types and rely on appropriate tactics. Firearms are great to use but turns you into a heatscore. Sometimes it is better to run away.\n\n-They have what they call heatmaps. Crafting, cooking, building and killing creates heat which attracts zombies. Heatmaps do cool down after awhile though so you do not have to be a nomad and continually wander the map.\n\nIt can be a little frustrating at the beginning, starting off with nothing until you level up a little (stamina mainly) and start collecting gear. Pretty well everything is gated behind finding books to learn from. Those are randomly generated so unless you find a bookstore, you could be a while on your own without decent tools to work with. This varies gameplay a great deal.\n\nAt this point, XML files are open so you can customize a fairly decent amount of the game and create content. Mods are being made already(!) considering the game is still in an Alpha stage. You are also allowed a wide range of options to click on when starting a new game so there is varied gameplay without editing XML files. This ranges from easy street to impossible.\n\nThe ONLY thing that I dislike about the game is you are allowed a maximum of four hour days (one day compressed into a four hour period) and the standard gameplay is a forty minute day. Gameplay is not linear between the different time periods. Everything is centered around the forty minute day so you will have to eat and drink a lot more with an extended day period. With a four hour day, gameplay is easier because of more time to loot and build between the incoming zombie hordes. Even this is not really gamebreaking but it is a little weird.\n\nI do recommend this game. Even if they stopped development now, I've gotten my money's worth. Alpha 12 looks to be awesome with even more content planned down the road.","June 26, 2015","true","678.4"," 57 of 74 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","57","74","4","3"

The Game is in Early Access, the Developers are churning out Awesome content, and there are xml files that you can use to tweak the game in just about any way you want. Servers can change the files or you can just change them on your computer for single player or games that you host.\n\n+ Can change biome file, so you can re-add ore everywhere in the random gen maps.\n+ Can modify Zombie Spawning, Recipes, Biomes (How much ore, what kinds of ore, what kind of blocks, water, etc.), pretty much anything someone is complaining about can be tweaked.\n+ Zombies, lots of Zombies, They can walk all the time, Run only at Night, or Run all the time.\n\nI actually tweaked the spawner, so that it just spawned animals and I had a fun and rather peaceful time of looting, building and just dinking around. I added a bunch of Hornet Spawns and those things are blighted evil. They bide their time in the sky and swoop down at you when you least expect them to. I did that, before they added the bears. Could have a lot more fun adding them and making your Zombie Survival Game into a "Non-Zombie" Survival Game.\n\n+ Can hunt Rabbits, Pigs, Deer (Stags only), Giant Hornets, and Bears. Yes, Bears. (Dogs are actually "Zombie Dogs".) The Hornets Drop Honey which is odd, but then again they are Giant Hornets. Who knows how they actually became gigantic, mabye they are mutated / crossbred  with bees.\n\n+ Need to eat and Drink to Survive. *Plans to add hot / cold survival features.* Desert/Snow Biomes should become a lot more interesting to deal with.\n+ Various food items, can cook, can grow crops. Just missing an option to capture and breed animals, that would make the farming experience complete, but still great without it. Can gather crops, make seed of some of your crops, replant your entire field, and have crops left over to use.\n\nThe game is an Alpha release. So far the Developers have been doing an awesome job and usually release a hotfix fairly quickly after a major release to take care of the worst bugs.\n\nI got this game during a sale. I would have got this game a lot sooner, if I knew how awesome it was.\n\nI would whole heartedly recommend this game. Assuming, you don't mind re-building bases, starting over after each major update, and a few minor annoyances caused by this game being an Early Access Alpha Release. Personally, I like starting over every now and again just to see a new map or to try once again to see how long I can go, before my first death.","July 9, 2015","true","645.5"," 114 of 167 people (68%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","68","114","167","15","4"

Fallout will sell more than all these new ♥♥♥♥ty survival games combined and we'll be right next to them with a fabulous single player campaign. Are we abandoning multi player? Hell no.

It is very action packed, the choices for difficulty are nice and the crafting system is excellent.  When you start a new game or join someone else’s, you will randomly start somewhere out in the middle of nowhere and then it’s up to you to find shelter, water and supplies.\n\nGrab a stick off a bush, some rocks and grass to craft a basic axe.  Then use that axe to chop down some trees.  Use the wood from the tress to make yourself a basic wooden bow and then craft you some arrows from feathers, sticks and more rocks.  From there the possibilities are endless.\nHunt down some deer for the meat and leather.  Make some basic armor to protect yourself.  But watch out, those zombies are hungry and they will smell the bloody meat on you and hone in on your location.\n\nIs night coming?

I've put in a lot of hours of play, and over the last two releases (A12 and A13) it has gone from bad to worse.  On the surface, there are signs everywhere of lack of quality control.  The GUI is sluggish at times, where a click to activate or select an item fails without precise targeting, or due to a lag stutter.  The new A13 GUI is terrible, and requires a criss cross of clicking and selecting to craft or operate forges or campfires.\n\nI find it amusing that so many things that worked fine in A12 suddenly didn't work in A13, as if they rewrote all the code as best as they could but missed a bunch of stuff.\n-Suddenly you couldnt use E to exit a forge or campfire.  People complained on the forums, and they fixed it.  Only now if you type in the name of an item in a menue to find it's recipe, and that name happens to include the letter E, you exit the forge when you type it.  Who writes this code?  Who tests it?\n-An old and ongoing issue has been the fuel timer and the cooking progress timer in campfires clock at different rates.  So if you add enough fuel to match the burn time to the cook time, your fuel will run out before cooking is done.  This hasn't been fixed, and it confounds me as to how it was coded wrong in the first place.  How do two items get a different clock rate?\n\nThere are many more examples I can cite that reek of lack of attention to detail.  There seems to be poor quality control, and it is evident in many of the smaller details of the game.  Why is this important?  Well, if they can't code the timer on a firepit cooker properly, how competent are they on the really important tasks?\n\nSome more ongoing issues:\n-Zombies spawning in close prximity to the player and making no sound before attacking from behind.\n-Game breaking duplication bugs that are going unaddress and ruining server play experience.\n-wellness system that pealizes 10 points per death.  You start at 100, and after 4 deaths you hit the lower limit of 60.  Wellness must be earned by eating certain foods and doing certain activities, and takes many hours to recover.  Given the difficulty of starting the game, it is more than likely that you will spend the first 20 hours of play as a very weak and vulnerable player.  Low stamina makes this game a walking simulator, with POI's spread out far enough that it makes exploration very impractical.  A death while on such exploration can turn a 15 minute expidition into a 2 hour struggle to recover your stranded items.\n\nDon't bother complaining on the forums.  99% of the active posters are fanboys who lick the brown off of TFP starfish.  One TFP developer is especially rude, callous and dismissive to criticism.   And an army of fanboys will rally to his side and claim that the game is in alpha, so quit ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning about it.  It seems that nobody is willing to address any of the real problems, and developers will just say they are working on it.  But patch after patch and things are not fixed.\n\nI'm just about ready to throw in the towel.

Survival is about a constant struggle to stay alive in a dangerous and uncertain environment, where the odds are most certainly stacked against you. And it is this essence which 7 Days to Die captures adequately and beautifully in the beginning, but which eventually diminishes and peters out due to the game’s lack of late-game content.\n\nStarting out in 7 Days to Die is hard, very hard. The game is similar to Minecraft, it has no storyline or  tutorial to guide you on what to do next. Instead, you are simply thrown in the middle of the world in your underpants, no tools, only a can of chili, a bottle of water, a bandage, and a torch to your name, and tasked to survive.\n\nJuggling your character's various needs, and managing your daylight time properly are both essential components of a viable survival strategy. And it's what makes 7 Days to Die so compelling and stimulating to play. Because frankly speaking, you never quite have enough at the start. And depending on your luck, that undesirable state may persist for a few more in-game days. The Fun Pimps have rightly, in my opinion, made some of tools that are important, but not strictly necessary to survival in the beginning, difficult to obtain.\n\nAnd herein lies 7 Days to Die’s biggest problem. Because so much of its appeal is derived from putting its players in the seat of a survivor who never quite has enough to eat, drink, and is constantly struggling to stay alive against the odds which the game stacks heavily against them from the getgo, the lack of a forceful impetus to survive in the middle or later portion of a game, as one’s character gains in strength and survivability, ultimately and ironically detracts from that appeal.\n\nThis weakness speaks more to 7 Days to Die’s apparent lack of late-game content than its heavy reliance on a relatively unsustainable premise such as survivability. At the moment, the game fully expects and encourages you to become stronger, but imposes no additional challenges to test your new-found strength. Zombies stay the same, develop no new capabilities, and although the game attempts to shake things up by throwing massive hordes of zombies at you every 7 in-game days or so, they are easily countered if you properly fortify your stronghold.\n\nI fully expect, and have faith, that The Fun Pimps will properly flesh out 7 Days to Die's content. At the moment, 7 Days to Die is still capable of offering its players many hours of deep and complex gameplay. I have only spent 50 hours playing it so far, and I believe I will continue to spend more time exploring, surviving and building in in 7 Days to Die.\n\nAs an early access game, 7 Days to Die is definitely worth your money.","January 30, 2015","true","160.1"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","38","47","4","1"

This makes it so the game doesn't get boring too quickly.\n\nNavezgane is bigger now!\n\nOptimization has improved the speed the game runs (for me) lately.\n\nAnimations and new HD zombies make combat more interesting. Ability to stun and decapitate zombies is a great mechanic, glad it was added in.\n\nBeautiful world, and challenging survival elements keep me engaged for long periods of time while playing.\n\nRecent cons:\n\nWhile it is easier to level up skills than before, some are still way easier to level up than others (Example: Upgraded two existing structures with wood, and got construciton tools up to level 52 of 100 whilst having killed around 50 zombies with a bow and numerous animals, archery is STILL only level 2.. Weak).\n\nI am still experiencing weather bugs from a long time ago. Using "debugweather" in the console commands shows the outside temperature is registering as 137 degrees fahrenheit in the desert. I know deserts get hot, but I don't think there's a desert on the planet that gets THAT hot. That temperature carries on into the burned forest biome as well.\n\n^Strangely enough, this only occurs twice a day. Once at dawn, and once at dusk. In the middle of the day, when it should be the hottest, I get normal temperatures of between 90-100.\n\nA tutorial on harvesting and skills/perks would be helpful.\n\nStill a little grindy..\n\n\n-Would still recommend this game to anyone. I have enjoyed it immensely, and with the most recent update, I'll be playing it much more.","April 4, 2015","true","290.5"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","35","42","0","5"

It's Hardcore Casual, this game can't decide what it wants to be anymore.\n\nTREE AND DOOR BREAKING SIMULATOR 2015 - It takes WAY, WAY TOO long to fell trees and break through doors and walls now. If I wanted to take so long chopping down trees I'd go outside and do it, There needs to be a better balance between Game and Realism - The HP Bars on everything have led to you realizing how very generic and even emphasizes MORE SO how much of a GRINDFEST a few basic activities are.\n\n7 days to Dress Up, if you could carry a backpack you would need it now to constantly store your clothes in because for some ungodly reason you have to run around in your undies because if ambient temperature is above 90 degrees outside you're going to die of heat stroke. My main armor combination should not be Boots, Gloves, and a Hat; How was the gross obviousness of how annoying it is to not be able to use your armor overlooked?\n\nCrafting, forging, inventory control and streamlining.. I don't like it. MEAT, why hunt anything difficult, kill easy things and get their "Meat". Wood and the removal of sticks as well as many other streamlining aspects makes me wonder why at the same time this game keeps throwing more casual aspects in, it also gets balls harder - What Audiance are you going for? Rocks from punching rocks and Wood from punching trees, Come on. If the rest of the game is extremely hard, why do we need to streamline crafting and make it more Casual? I liked the fact you had to break things down to certain states to make other things, now I'm just throwing wood and metal together to build and mixing meat to eat. If the rest of the game is extremely hard, why do we need to streamline things and make them more Casual? I liked the fact you had to break things down to certain states to make other things, now I'm just throwing wood and metal together to build and mixing meat to eat,  the entire generic 'streamlining' of the entire 'creation' aspect is dumbfounding.\n\n"Skill progression" means you get to play the game for 20 hours to build a base or kill more than 1 or 2 zombie at a time, I defiantly enjoyed this game more when it was rougher around the edges. As an adult with a job I want to get in to the "Fun" part of a game much sooner than being gated behind 200 books and grinding for 7 hours to be able to not have to use 10 metal and tons of wood to do achieve simple base building and block upgrading, because I'm not "leveled up enough in that crafting stat". Guess I'm too Casual for it now, You may use all your gitgud white knighting arguments to disparage my personal views if you wish, But this is how I now feel about this game.\n\nThe mocap in general is also.. Tacky, I appreciate the fact that mocap is going in to the game but the entire thing is just over the top, Just because it's mocap does not mean you need to oversell EVERY SINGLE ASPECT. The walking undead should not grab limbs I hit/shoot and act like they are trying to win a tony award, there is more to subtle movements than to these EXTENDED overly long LOOK AT ME USING MOCAP type animations that seem to have been shoehorned into EVERY single thing the zombies do - There was something rather errie about a large hoard coming at you and firing at them and them basically shrugging it off and barely flinching while still advancing, Now it's like some poorly choreographed keystone cops re-enactment.The ability to behead and hack and slash limbs play counter intuitive to how you would think, honestly Melee feels like I'm playing Teken or something, you need to "Ground and Pound" to do it effectively, but the fact that zombies just spring back into a standing position basically warping into damage makes getting near them to take advantage of the 3x damage while stunned a lesson in futility. Oh that zombie was on the ground, you're going to finish him off? NOPE - Zombie hitboxes are poor, the 'dancing' aspect of dodging back and fourth while using melee is gone because you'll just get hit when the animation on the zombie skips frames and you get stunned and bled.\n\nWill I uninstall the game and never play again? No, I'll still try to salvage how much I previously enjoyed this title, but..\n\nTL;DR - It's really too much of a chore to play this game anymore, it feels like it's nearly turned into an MMO with the amount of grinding you need to do for the simplest things. There's a fine line in games between extending game play and sucking the fun out, For me personally this game has surely tipped into the later.\n\nAnother Nail in the Coffin For this game in it's Current State:\nThe Obsessively Hostile Fanboy Legion\n\nJoin the Steam  discussions to get told: "getgud", "get a new computer your potato sucks", "it's an alpha so everything should be broken" (even after 6+ months of work on a build), and everybody's favorite: "I don't know what you're smoking / I'm not having those problems they don't exist"","December 18, 2015","false","304.2"," 366 of 595 people (62%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","62","366","595","42","96"

Remember this is still in alpha stages so dont kick their ♥♥♥ so hard if you dont like it!\n\nAnyway, from my experience, this game is amazing at keeping you busy, on the harder difficulties you're constantly looking around for the zeds and constantly trying to figure out your next move, theres little time for luxury because surviving is not as easy as it sounds! BUT. When you've set yourself up, and you're confident you can defend yourself... thats when you can truely give no F**ks.\n\nBuilding the most inpenatrable base possible is easilly the most time consuming thing ever, but by far the most fun!\n\nWatching a wave of zombies die in your traps and minefields is amazing... Panic inducing if a feral zombie somehow manages to break his way inside... I'll leave that to you...\n\nPlay on multiplayer servers?... You have your own version of "The Walking Dead" ... Playing solo or just with friends... Well, i have 560 hours playing and with people i've never even met!\n\nYou either love it or hate it... But before you dismiss this game try and survive a week without being eaten alive... It really grows on you!!\n\n-Considering i sound very biased ill list some of MY pet peevs on this game\n\n1) They tried out a new minimalist User Interface which im not 100% sure i like yet... again looks like they're testing stuffs\n2) It can be VERY difficult to survive on a bad spawn and especially when you're new to the game!\n3) Zombies sometimes make no sound.. and you can be hit and killed without even realising they're there!\n4) Performance can be a peice of S*** if you have a lower end PC if you tend to "max it and forget it" make sure u have at least a GTX970 and some sort of hyperthreaded i5 or 8 core AMD, an SSD would help too! (high ram would be good as there are some memory leaks!)\n5) Crafting has a ton of bugs sometimes and hotfixes sometimes introduce new bugs, (not 100% sure on A14 yet)\n6) Unbalanced crafting in somecased, you'l understand in game after a few hours..\n7) Dogs.\n\nReally do reccomend this game to any survivalist... It kicks the s**t out of Rust, DayZ, H1Z1 and those other games (so far)\n\n\n","March 27","true","586.3"," 46 of 61 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","46","61","3","2"

There are bugs and some issues, but even so, my 5 friends and I are really liking the direction. Let me explain:\n\nWe host our own private server so my review doesn't take into account anything about that.\n\n1. It's a good looking game and runs very well on my i7 + 8bg ram + Nvidia gtx660 OC\n2. There ARE some graphica glitches, but not game breaking. Sometimes my prone, dead body will be what everyone sees even though I've respawed and am running around. Meh .. once I jump or climb it fixes itself.\nIt get progressively harder as we've been alive and progressing. The 25+ zombie hordes that come at us on a blood moon can be dealt with, but they're still dangerous.\n3. DEVS !!!!!!!   I REALLY like how the clothing works in regards to body temp. GREAT concept but needs to be tweeked. Clothing needs to have  hot/cold properties. For example... The bandana should NOT make me colder while in cold climates. It's covering my skin and helping to keep body heat in. If you want to make it -2 in hot climes because it keeps the beating sun off, then that makes sense, but then it needs to be +5 for cold areas. I think ALL clothing should have dual temperature properties.\n4. Zombie animations are excellent! We can tell...for the most part... the type of zombie by it's movement/silhouette and sounds. Love the localized damage. Headshots ROCK!\n5. DEVS!!!! Can you make the TRACKING for friends permanent. I have to click the box every time someone logs in and out. That checkbox should be persistent.\n6. DEVS!!!! Schematics/RECIPES ... please show a tooltip/hover over tip for recipes that tells whether or not I've read it. Inventory space is limited and we need to quickly see if we've read that book or schematic so we can drop it to pick up something else.\n7. DOGS SUCK ... just saying. And I mean that in "AHHH, 3 dogs have spawned and I'm screwed! They're fast and dangerous!!" ... keep up the good work.\n8. BEARS!!! .... freaking awesome to tap a bear and watch them come running and then slaughter the zombies for us! LOL SWEET!\n9. Would love more Forged Steel tools. Pickaxe is the only one, but a shovel and better axes should be the progression of tools.\n\nThis is a deep game, creative crafting and building/upgrading. Decent combat vs zombies as a pure survival game. Just kill them quick..nothing too outlandish. You're trying to survive and this is basic survival.\nYes it can get glitchy / buggy, but it's a blast with friends.\n\nKeep up the hard work!","February 7","true","182.9"," 51 of 70 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","51","70","4","1"

If you are warming up to type TL/DR after seeing the length of my reivew, just scroll on down and I'll have a short list of the plusses and minuses from what I saw.\n\nAfter a few messages popped up informing me that my review was getting pretty dated, I decided once again to step back into the zombie infested world of 7 Days To Die. Right off the bat I noticed a cleaner, more polished world, with flattened terrain and buildings looked more like blocky buildings, and not freaking funhouses. I then looked down to see if I still had akward stilt legs that had equal animations to a wind up toy you would find in a dollar store. But what's this!? I am missing my legs. So either the devs pulled the legs, knowing they were a visual abomination. Or they thought the game worked better without them. I myself prefer seeing my character's legs to increase imersion, but that is just my opinion. After coping with the fact I was nothing more than a floating torso, I headed to the nearest car. As I looted the trunk, I noticed there is now a small searching timer. I assume the timer is to make things a feel a little more authentic. Instead of being able to do a lightning fast snatch-n-grab on anything you see, you actually have to choose whether or not it's worth checking that box or car depending on your current situation and how many brain thirsty zombies are after you.\n\n\nAfter digging a pathetic excuse for a cave (more like a trench that just got deeper) I had a good 15 minute wander until I walked into what I would assume was a radiation zone of sorts. My character quickly lost health until I went into a comical death animation resembling a lawn flamingo falling over stiff as a board. I laughed, respawned, and made my way to a familiar little town and was quickly greeted by a few zombies and..... zombie dogs. Now, I understand having a variety of enemeis in games, but I find the zombie dogs and giant bees to be rather annoying. I would rather shut a door or window to stop those little F*%$ers from bothering me further. What I did like were the spider zombies. Lanky freaks with long arms kind of creep me out, so I'll bite on that one. Upon meeting my undead K9 freinds, I ran to a nearby house, closed the door, and started taking anything I could and headed to the attic.\n\nAfter hearing the repetitive "crunch, snarl, squish, slam" of the beasts outside for a few minutes, I skulked downstairs to see how things were going outside. I first was greeted by a running zombie (because the house was dark) and quickly dispatched him with what few shotgun rounds I had. I then turned the corner and ran into a fat zombie and a rather voluptuous female zombie (don't judge me!). I pulled out my  handgun and fired a few rounds into the fattie, but saw that they were just jumping in place instead of trying to eat me. After a few rounds I noticed Mr. fatty fat really only liked jumping when I shot him. I then decided put a round in head of his female parter and saw the ragdoll had been cleaned up a bit as she tumbled to the ground, which I appreciated since I am a ragdoll ♥♥♥♥♥. I finished off count blobberton and headed out the back of the house.\n\nThe rest of my play time involved me walking from house to house, collecting whatever I saw without caring what it was. My level of entertainment wasn't very high from the beginning, but what was left of it was draining fast. I eventually found myself doing what I did last time, standing on a rooftop, watching 20+ zombies gnaw at the same spot over and over. I decided to end it all with one last 'flamingo flop' death and called it a night.\n\nThere were good things and bad things I saw in this playthough and I will list them to the best of my knowledge since I am a newbie at writing reviews and I didn't take notes.\nPLUSSES!\n1. Ragdoll was cleaned up\n2. Sharper visual quality\n3. Looting timer (it's the little things that add up the the big experience)\n4. No more funhouse style!\n5. Character models and different monster types (spider zombie=cool. Dog zombie=bad)\n6. The price did drop from 35.00 to 25.00\n\nMINUSES\n1. I lost my hideous stilt legs in echange for a floating torso (possible plus?)\n2. Player and monster animations are still clunky and feel far from realistic\n3. AI pathing is pretty painful, it's at it's worst when you are indoors (fattie liked to jump when shot)\n4. Pretty much still the same experience as last time.\n5. Mining and crafting (although varied) aren't doing much to keep me wanting to find that last piece I need to complete my item.\n6. The landscape has been worked on, but nothing in that game makes me want to explore it. The radiation zone killed me, and did not inspire me to dig deeper to see what was in there. I would just turn and walk the other way if I ran into it again.\n7.  Zombies kind of feel more like a nuisance instead of a threat. I won't bother going into a dark house because I know it will just ensue a Benny hill style run around with some zombies.\n8. The price still doesn't feel worth it\n\nThere could be more items but I will stop here since I JUST got a kickstarter update email from the funpimps saying that a new update is right around the corner.\n\nTHE VERDICT!\n\nWith bigger contenders like DayZ standalone, Rust, State of decay, the recently revealed H1Z1 (with crafting, building, and vehicles), 7DTD still does not do it for me for the price. When I walk around the world of DayZ I actually feel like someone trying to survive in that world, and I worry about attracting zombies and player kill happy gamers. In 7DTD I run to everything, ♥♥♥♥ off ALL THE ZOMBIES and watch them chew and slap the side of the house I am squatting in at the moment while growing bored. In State of Decay I LOVE going out at night to scavenge. And holy crap do I get a rush when I accidentally make a noise while looting and see zombies close in around the house I am in. I doesn't get more cinematic than when you fight for your life in a house full of zombies and jump through a window to escape at the last second. In 7DTD it's hardly a thrill when zombies come after you in a house. In the end, I still don't reccomend this game to players at it's current state and price. But to each their own.  I still hope to turn this negative review to a positive one day.  Thanks again for reading.\n\n\n\n--------------------OUT DATED VERSION REVIEW FROM 2013-----------------\nI backed this game on kickstarter in August. I played a good amount of the alpha when I got it and I didn't really like what I saw, but before people get mad I DO know how much more work devs promise to have done. I understand it's still in it's early stages, but over time I have not seen a whole lot of changes so far (My Opinion). In minecraft I actually WANT to mine and search for goods and I take pride in the places I build to survive in, and I fear what stares at me from the windows at night. In other open world zombie games I WANT to gather food and I get tense while fighting humans and NPC zombies. This game does not inspire me to do much of anything. I get guns, I build around houses, I watch the mindless zombies just stand at the wall below me wihtout trying much to make me worry about getting attacked. The night cycle is not even fun to sneak around on. The current character models are either a male or female characters with two color options (all pretty ugly). and the textures are acceptable. Do I reccomend this game currentlyat it's price? Hell no. Do I hope the game gets to the point where I can reccomend it for the price? Yes, yes I freaking do. But at this moment I could think of many other games I would rather have purchased with the 35 I spent backing this game. I also want to add that the hours played are only what I played on the steam version. I put much more on the pre steam release.","December 13, 2013","false","18.3"," 1,862 of 3,128 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","862","3","2","60"

There's a new graphic engine and the UI was changed a bit wich was a nice thing, what kills this game is constant bugs, lack of decent marketing, bad BR (as many before me wrote, you can't post a negative feedback on forums because you'll get swarmed with fanboys telling you're a whiner or insulting you).\n\nThe patches are developed very slowly, the content in this game almost didnt change since over 6 months. Latest patch was supposed to bring something everyone were waiting for : weather engine, driveable minibike, new animal and new random generation engine.\n\nThe weather engine is not like it was announced to be. It's simple texture change. It changed brightness/darkness so much most people are unable to see anything. The minibike that everyone were waiting for is broken and buggy. If it does work it falls under the map... Yeah that's the kind of endgame item you get here. I won't even mention adding 1 animal to the game. The random gen 3.0 is the only thing nice about the newest patch. Rest is just game breaking.\n\nSaying that there's also the coop aspect. High population servers (over 10) are not supported because devs claim that is game is not designed for this, even that there's a need for them. There's only one developer that works his ♥♥♥ off about the needs and makes server optimizations. In 2015 there's a game like this, with endless world designed for 8 players..

And for the direction the game has taken in this iteration, it is getting a thumbs down. I have little hope for this title to change direction in the near future, since it seems to stand to reason that the devs will be looking to "wrap up" after 2 years of Early Access.\n\nWhat I expected of the title when reading the reviews and watching the user generated videos (mostly based on Alpha 12 at the time) was a game focused on survival, base building, making your base self-sufficient in terms of resources, and finding creative ways to hold off the hordes. It's a voxel based game after all so I expected a good amount of creative freedom in base building and trap designs.\n\nI had multiple hours of intense fun figuring out how the crafting, survival and horde mechanics work on randomly generated maps as well as the standard map. Once I got the basic mechanics down, I started a new game on the standard map intent on surviving and outsmarting the hordes for as long as possible.\n\nThus started the disappointment. I could do nothing like the creative base building I've seen other players do on Alpha 12. Turns out Alpha 13 introduces a skill/tool quality system that is preventing players from having fun. You need to invest ~15+ hours of repetitive grinding first, and that's if you know what and how to grind, before your character starts to get abilities that allow you to even start considering building something like a halfway decent moat.\n\nBasic building, resource gathering and looting is all terribly tedious when starting out. You need to do all of it to survive. There is `no time` to dig out a half way decent ditch for your base, let alone a fortified moat.\n\nAfter you survived long enough for the character to acquire all the gear and skill to actually build something interesting, you're way past the point where the game has become boring and has plateaued for its lack of content.\n\nThere's also little incentive to try and build something interesting any more, becase once you've internalized the design principles of this game during your time climbing the learning curve, you'll realize that this is not meant to allow for 'interesting' outside of 'creative mode' a.k.a god mode.\n\nWhich is one of several problems with the design choices in this title:\n\nYour base is supposed to be vulnerable, in the sense that you can't effectively wall off or trap zeds. The walking lumps of flesh will degrade and destroy every conceivable material in good time. Forged iron spikes, steel, concrete. All will disintegrate in time. And way faster than you think it should. Zeds will dig and claw through solid rock. So if you did follow through with your moat idea, you'll realize that once Zeds have fallen into it, they'll start digging tunnels under your fort until it is inadequately supported and collapses. You can place spikes at the bottom, but they won't help as much as they should.\n\nAnd by the time you can conceivably dig a moat deep enough to have Zeds actually die from fall damage onto said spikes: you actually can't, not with all zombie types, not while keeping the ability to effectively maintain your spikes at the bottom, and most importantly not within your first ~20 hours into the game.\n\nMy problem with the above state of affairs is that it prevents experimenting with base and trap designs. There is only 1 or 2 effective base designs in Alpha 13 if you're playing single player. Everything else is either too maintenance heavy, so you can't go scavenging and resource gathering, or simply does not work well, because it is overcome by the zombies too quickly and too easily. You'll likely find out the hard way. There's too little viable choices in effective base design. Not in single-player anyways, where you have to rely on the passive defenses to do the bulk of the work, because you can't be in multple places at once.\n\nAlong the lines of 'your base can't really protect you' design, which is misleading for new players, there is no way to actually be creative beyond static bulding. That's right, there's no moving parts like gears, levers, pressure plates etc. So you can't even build a retractable bridge, because well, that might actually be effective as a means of holding off the horde or building effective traps. And that would be cheap wouldn't it? So we can't allow it.\n\nAnother badly executed aspect of the game is the randomly generated loot, that also depends on 'level' (griding time) of your character. That's right: skyrim-type leveled loot. Also the aspect of 'knowing where to go looting to find the stuff I need' is largely under-emphasized  vs. 'just being lucky getting what I need' or 'having looted 1000s of containers to finally be worthy to find something in good condition'. For example: on my first game, I found a chainsaw in a car around day 5. Needed gas to operate it, but it was awesome for felling trees and getting the Zeds off my back. In another game, I've not seen a chainsaw or any of its parts yet. Found 4 diagrams to build one through. And I'm well past day 100 with the game plateauing after day 49 where you'll see the strongest horde. Some more vital diagrams the RNG has not seen fit to grant me neither. So I was not able to craft leather before day 104, nor was I able to make steel or cement well past day 100. And that's after I started concentrated raiding sessions in all directions to finally get these books because I wanted to see what the game would have been like if there were more deterministic ways to progress in the technology trees, and what the benefits of the advanced materials were.\n\nAnother issue are the item durability and quality systems. If a real world iron shovel disintegrated as fast as it does in this game, you'd need 4 of them to just dig out a latrine. But the fast breakage has a purpose: it allows you to grind your tool smithing skill by making a new one. And just 500 shovels into the grind, you'll be golden, achieving the level of quality on it that you had in pre-alpha 13 from the beginning.\n\nThe 7 day horde spawns near you, and knows where you are at all times. Full on GPS Zeds. This is different from regular wandering hordes that get attracted by activity like burning fires and making noises. Those need to spot you. The GPS Zeds on the other hand have an all-knowing tracker on you. If the pathfinding code finds a way to your character the Zeds will follow it. If it does not, it gets as close as it can, and starts clawing at any blocks roughly in your direction. No way to outsmart, trap or outrun them. You have to kill them all before they wreck your base entirely. Currently there is one way to avoid it: dig very deep down and make sure the tunnel entrance is far away. The GPS Zeds will congregate just above you on the surface, and with the tunnel entrance far enough away, the path finding will not see a way to you. The Zeds cannot dig down vertically, only to the sides. So here you just stay put for the night, and once daybreak comes and Zeds lose their running ability, you go up and wipe them out. That tactic is the only way to be 'smarter' than the horde. And of course is considered an 'exploit'. There used to be more options for horde management in previous alphas. The Zeds' nightly running ability was hampered if they entered brightly lit areas. But the devs removed that.\n\nCharacter limit is kicking in, so wrapping up: much potential, too limited player choices, vital progression behind RNG, no end-game content, last alphas moving into tediousness and grinding instead of content. Not expecting it to recover.","January 6","false","163.7"," 115 of 179 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","115","179","7","14"

Currently gamepay consists of gathering resources with which to craft and build. If you need metals, coal, potassium nitrate, and that sort of thing then you mine it. If you need wood you chop down trees. To get weapons, recipe books, and any of the other items you may need you will typically raid major cities or towns that are zombie packed.\n\nThere isn't much more to it right now aside from gathering the toys you want, things like SMG, Chainsaw, Auger, Sniper Rifle, or Rocket Launcher and then building your base up to survive the massive feral night hordes that want to eat your brains.\n\nHOWEVER, the devs say that their inspiration for this game came from Fallout 3 and Minecraft. They want to merge the two worlds. What's planned is NPC's featuring quests and storylines to follow, vehicles, metallurgy, electricity and generators, and a full blown living world of NPC survivalists to interact with.\n\nThis is one of the best co-op games I've ever played. The zombie shrieks and growls will send chills down your spine as you and your friends feverishly repair your damaged structures as the zombies break through. You will feel an immense sense of accomplishment after you construct a worthy defense structure and successfully fend off a zombie horde.\n\nMy background in games is Eve Online for 10 years, some WoW mixed in, and I love open world games and strategy games. This game does a good job of satisfying my need for killing, surviving, strategizing, and progressing.\n\nThe only downside to this game, IMO, is that this game doesn't have intentions of being a full blown MMO. The game is on player owned servers with a maximum of about 64 players. This game could be the best game ever made for me if it were an MMO. But this is a great game, with one of the best communities i've ever been a part of, and a development team that's dedicated to making their dreams become reality in the form of a fantastic game that you should own!!","December 28, 2014","true","662.6"," 39 of 51 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","39","51","0","1"

You're developing a game with your community, you're not polishing a finished piece, the point of an alpha build is for the players to help create the game, otherwise you would just launch it at beta with whatever features your little hearts desire.\n\nThis game was a major thing back when it came out, in my opinion peaking at greatness in alpha 11. What happened from there, you may ask? Fundamentally, progressive development ceased and became redundant. We're working with developers that are so far up their own asses (pardon the expression) that they don't really care what the players want or how they feel; any sort of criticism, be it positive or not, is treated with censorship back in their forums, I've witnessed countless times whole threads being completely obliterated by overzealous mods, who don't like it when they're told their favourite game is going the wrong way.\n\nAnd yes, this game IS going the wrong way. I remember getting my closest friends to buy the game back in A9, we pulled freaking all nighters playing that game, it was so immersive and an overall amazing experience, everyone had their roles during the day, and rendezvous at night to defend the fort. We really couldnt get enough of it, whole days we'd spend looking for the perfect safe haven. From A11 forward, it just became a redundant game, at its core. Update after update with almost 6 months apart from each other (which is pretty bad, considering its an alpha and frequent updates are essential) the game just got more and more simplified and less immersive.\n\nAs of A13, you can build solid concrete blocks out of decaying wood. Take that for immersion. No more specific meats, everything is just meat, which means alot of recipes and farming went down the gutter so that shaved off alot more hours spent hunting for deer or any other specific animals, and overall we waited 6 months for basically, like I said previously, a simplification of the game's core engine that was perfectly Solid, and a visual rework on zombies that completely shattered the overall game stability. Thats right, a full HD remake, that took 6 months to develop, on an Alpha build. Thats like dressing in your finest suit to go out later before you've taken that shower you've been putting off for a week. Not to mention that they pushed it out so badly optimized that it forced them to work on about 5 patches in 3 weeks in order to fix framerate issues, server lags and other gamebreaking bugs. No other relevant updates.\n\nThe game lacks content, and removing it to reach an end-game state quicker only affects it further. Everyone I played with got bored of the game, and for good reasons. I got bored myself and unfortunately I can no longer support developers that are working apart from their community. It pains me to let the game go like this, but I cant support something that's no longer what I payed for originally.","February 10","false","174.2"," 187 of 304 people (62%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","62","187","304","9","9"

Other survival games have set locations for enemy NPCs to spawn, while this one can spawn entire HORDES of zombies wherever it feels the need to. As they get considerably more powerful at night and increase in difficulty with each passing day, you are forced to spend days building up to continue survival.\n\nThis puts a HUGE emphasis on players helping each other rather than hindering each other, as it would be a waste of their time and resources and leave them vulnerable to quick death should they run around hindering others progress with the scarce resources they have. And mind you, the nights are not to be taken with a grain of salt like other games. Should you hold back waves of the horde, more waves spawn immedietly, meaning this is not a game about simply shooting them to the point of destruction - it's simply about surviving long enough to see the daylight and bring an end to their siege for the night. There are 19 types of enemies too, including powerful bloated walkers whom are only vulnerable to headshots, as well as wall-climbing, window-smashing spider zombies and even infected wildlife.\n\nOn top of it all, there is a noise engine - the more noise you make from firing a gun, setting off grenades, or even constructing and upgrading your house, the more the horde hears you and the worse it will get. This puts emphasis on having multiple fallback points too, as if you manage to attract them to one location too much by noise, you will need to leave and escape detection before coming back at which point you can only hope the horde will have left with minimal damage.\n\nAnd another thing about the night - you CANNOT survive by simply running and gunning with minimal shelter. During the night, zombies become not only more powerful and massively increase in number, but they also run at twice the speed of your standard movement speed. You can only outrun them by sprinting and just barely, which requires limited energy and depletes your hunger and thirst, which admittedly should not be too much of an issue after day 3, but regardless surviving an entire night sprinting is a near impossibility.\n\nCan you pull a minecraft and dig underground and just stick a block on top of you? No. Because zombies can break down ANY blocks in this game including the dirt on the ground, you are not safe anywhere. Once you are sensed, you can only prepare for the inevitable siege to come. What makes it worse is the fact that underground bases are very restricted - you likely have only a small number of escape routes which can easily be blockaded by zombies. This makes even the most secure underground bunkers only a temporary hold back point.\n\nPhysics are in this game too, which means that if the supporting blocks for something are removed, the entire thing comes crumbling down. You have to have secure houses with more holding them up than just the walls therefore, and you need to ensure your platforms will not come crumbling down at first possibility.\n\nAll in all, this is a FANTASTIC survival game where for once, you fight with others against truly difficult NPCs. I would highly recommend this over other games for those of you who are not major PVP fans.","June 12, 2014","true","16.1"," 40 of 54 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","40","54","0","0"

It is the #1 survival game on Steam in my opinion at this time. It combines the building modularity of Minecraft, with the crafting of Day Z or Rust. The survival aspects are well done and you really do have to keep your well being in mind while you play, rather than it being an occasional annoyance like many other survival games. Looting is very fun and there are enough items that you don't feel like you see the same stuff over and over for quite some time.\n\nThere is as good mix of low level crafting (1 item into another) and high level (Multiple items crafted together to make a new one). You can really make a good base and there are many options for entrenching yourself at a location. You can even build a little motorcycle and explore way easier!

The player models, right now, are very ugly but you cover up with armor and that actually looks cool. This game will also get a lot of updates over time, so you may not want to get in on this until more releases come out, or the game releases.\n\nDefinitely recommend, and once they nail down the random world generation and some optimization, this will be an amazing survival game for a group of players!","August 6, 2015","true","43.3"," 47 of 66 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","47","66","4","4"

Note tht the developers have repeatedly stated that thi is the audince they are looking for.\n\nIf you like MP PVE then again all the good things about SP carry through to this experience and depending on how you tweak the difficulty settings you will have some fun with your friends exploring, building and fighting off the occaiional hordes.\n\nMy play experience was about 10 hour SP after which I realised the world was not challenging enough and the lack of people made it too lonely a world and I oved on to maybe 100 hours of MP PVE which was nice in that I got to meet other players and have some interation however the same sense of little challenge remained and I have spent the rest of my time playing MP PVP.\n\nThe devs dont ike MP PVP, they dont code for it they dont make any allowances for it and generally look down their noes upon it like its some dirty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child in the corner that should get no love.  The funny thing i that MP PVP is where this game shines.\n\nWith MP PVP you have the correct level of challenge (again can vary due to the particular servers settings) because now you not only have to survuve the environment (easy) and fight off the zombies (relatively easy) but you have real people adding in that random element.  Alliances are formed, enemies made, grudges held and acted upon.  Bases get raided and sometimes raised to the ground, sometimes they are taken off, sometimes you will rush to defend friends in need or gather your alliance to take down a particularly unpopular team.\n\nThe PVP element adds uncertainty, challenge and real risk v reward elements to the gameplay.\n\nAll of the above was pretty much true until Alpha 12, in Alpha 12 they introduced levelled loot so now we have the mind bogglingly stupid mechanic of your level directy affecting the uality of the items you find.  Want that flawless axe?  get ready to grind through 3-4000 zombies and god knows how many RL hours before the game decided you have levelled far enough to start finding high quality items.  Before this the quality element was truly random so you could get lucky on the first day or you could spend 2 weeks travelling to find all the parts for a high end sniper rifle, exploring was rewarded, effort was rewarded, now?  its just mindless grind and when you have killed all those zombies and reached level 60 almost every container has flawless items which is totally stupid.  This change did not increase the rarity of flawless items it actually did the opposite and made them commonplace IF you were prepared to grind countless hours.\n\nNow this mechanic is complete BS, what is in a ammo crate is there regardless of my experience at killing zombies but despite a lot of feedack on their forums they went ahead and did it anyway and this tells you a lot about them as a dev team.\n\nThe second really bad decision they have made regards the upcoming Alpha13 release where they are doing away with how peple craft items in its entirety in order to dub it down for the console market, this change also extends to how you upgrde structres in place.  Up to this point there were many materials you could build with and the choices you made, the time invested in gathering resources and how you built your base were mssively fun elements in the gameplay that have been lauded by pretty much anyone who has played or reviewed this game.  Thats all going now because again the devs want to dumb the game down in order to port it to console and the deep breadth and complexity that was 7DTD crafting and building is being thrown in the bin.  A sad day truly and they will lose a large amount of players for it.\n\nThe last thing you need to know is that their community site is pretty toxic, if you are not a rabid fanboi then you will be openly insulted, trolled and insulted and this will be ignored by their moderators (some of whom were so dismissive of any negative feedback that even TFP had to fire them eventually).  No feedback will be tolerated if its perceived in any way as negative or not in line with the devs ''vision'', dont take my word for it, go and read their latest A13 dev thread.\n\nI have had some amazing times playing this game, particularly with a wide ranging group of friends and particularly in PVP but the direction the devs are taking it now is thevery opposite of that attracted all the people I know in the first place.\n\nI have to put in a reccomendation as the game is now rather than as it used to be and for tht reason I cannot reccomend although I hope that the devs do see sense and recognise the huge playerbase of PVP'ers and how important they are to the games success and that they stop dumbing the game down for the console kiddies.\n\nUntil that happens I have to say i do not reccomend.\n\n","October 21, 2015","false","138.2"," 298 of 498 people (60%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","60","298","498","31","40"

If I wanted it to be this difficult I'd play on the harder settings, but even the middle of the road and low difficulties are nearly impossible now. bears are still rediculously common, zombies spawn all around you at all times, loot has been reduced to nearly nothing. Sadly, I still can't recomend this game to anyone who isn't a hardcore survavilist. For me this game was a fun slightly more realistic minecraft, it filled a small niche that most survival games go right over. Now its just like every other survival game, you'll spend hours diggging trhough piles of trash and slowly crawling accross the world trying to find a few critical items that spawn so infrequently that I haven't ever seen them in A12.\n\n_orignial review_ (still stands)\n\nFor the time being this game should be avoided, Alpha 12 has sucked all the fun out of the game.

You can already find servers with one click hosting ofthe game (even in alpha).  They still have work to do.  There are some glitches in the voxel building system.  As of 9.3 there are areas and certain heights the physics glitch and blocks for no rhyme or reason fall apart when they should not.  Their one static map Navegane have buildings and bridges that where built before one of their patches but now fall apart when you traverse them since the current physics mechanics no longer hold them up.  Despite all that I can (and have) easily setup an instance of the game that my friends can jump on any time and enjoy a couple of hours crafting and battling hordes of zombies.  I hope these guys keep going with their development road map and more casual players give this title a try.","November 20, 2014","true","956.3"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","34","45","0","0"

Seriously very minimal bugs the DEV's are keeping this nicely polished. The game even though in Alpha stage has alot going for it.\n\nAtmosphere: Great feeling game that really changes moods, not for the faint of heart or easily creeped out. This game has feeling by the bucketload, at times you will be hiding in a corner, sometimes you will be sprinting for your life while your heart tries to beat out of your chest and other times you may completely lose your mind and go on a rampage throwing all caution to the wind as you exact your wrathfull vengence upon the undead for daring touch your beloved minibike!\n\nPlayability: This is a game you can really spend alot of time on without realising that its 2am and you need to start work at 8am. There is countless things to do in 7 Days, by yourself or in a group you will have no trouble finding things to do, explore, build, repair, renovate, create, be mischievous, compete and survive!!\n\nInterface: The feel of this game is great and it has really been done well, the menu's are simple but indepth, you can "couple click start" or you can spend time adjusting how you want the game to be, difficulty levels can be rather casual up to insanely "messed my pants scary!" Hard! Controlling the character is very smooth, easy and just feels so good, the ingame crafting is fantastic, the best I have seen.\n\nGraphics: Very pretty! Graphics are up to scratch and have all the nice bits that one would expect from a modern game with great lighting effects and smoothness of images. The landscapes and buildings look fantastic and make it easy to sink into the feel of the game.\n\nConclusion: There are alot of crafting games that have followed and ridden on the success of Minecraft and now there is literally a vast sea of Minecraft/Zombie survival type games available now, most of them in Alpha/Beta stages, some are ok and some are absolute rubbish. 7 Days clearly stands above the horde with top marks in all the right places, you will not find a better game in this genre.","August 9, 2015","true","243.5"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","3"

As you can see I don't own DayZ, I don't own many of the zombie games out there.  But I do love tower defense games and this adequately sedates my thirst for these types of games.\n\nFunPimps (funny name) did an incredible job on this game already and I would argue that this game is far better than any other alpha I've ever seen.  Sure there are bugs, but the bugs are very minor when comparing it to these other games.\n\nThe developers keep pushing the beta data back in response to the community in that we're constantly demanding new features to the game.  This is a level of customer service you don't see from big game publishers out there like EA.  Their About Us page states it best, "We're experienced enough we can't be called indie, but we're small enough to.." define their own limitations.\n\nIf you are looking for a really nice single-player, co-op, or multi-player tower-defense, crafting, shooter, you're nuts not to give this game a shot.  The price seems to be somewhat reasonable and the developers have shown promising signs of logevity and support.\n\nPROS:\n- Very well-built game for the maturity.\n- Easy to loose most of your day in this game\n- Highly immersive -- realistic engine and needs\n- The developers are responsive and listen to the community's input\n- Gameplay is amazing -- hordes of zombies are very unique to this game and get your adriniline flowing during night times.\n- Legitimate PVP in this game is very fun and immersive allowing players to build forward operating bases, attack a base and pentrate, and raid another players stuff.\n\nCONS:\n- Multiplayer is not a secure platform and is plauged by hackers and cheaters\n- Items and hit-detection is handled by the client, so multi-player is easy to hack/cheat\n- The developers can be a bit vague to when the next patch will be\n- Excpected bugs as in all alphas","October 30, 2014","true","252.5"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","31","41","0","0"

Now, that is simply not enough.\n\nNO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO, NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE AT THE GAME the zombies have developed a hive mind and onmiscient sense of where the player is.

Really?  I'm running it on an 8 gig laptop pentium 2.7..It runs more than fine without lag.    Another griped of the blocky features and repetitive landscape.   Am I the only one that read in APLHA STAGE?     The Graphics needs some heavy updating to eliminate the blocky,  old nintendo game look but I can't imagine that not being on the menu.      Another wrote how the zombies always find you regardless of where you hide.  Really?  Me and my friend built a fortress that was completely unbreakable.  They haven't gotten even close to us yet.     It isn't a mindless shooter.  You need to put effort into the game, scavenging, foraging, forging, crafting, hunting and even cooking.\n\nHonestly the only complaint I see valid is the cost.  It has the potential to be (With massive graphics upgrade) a 50 dollar game.  Right now?  It shouldn't be 20$ I'd price it at 15 for a one pack and 25 for a 2 pack.   I just saw it went on sale which annoys me as I bought it like 5 days ago the 2 pack for 49$.  I'd have saved 16$.  Grrr.  Had I known I'd have waited and bought 3 copies.\n\nBut I recommend the game mostly based on potential and what I see MAY be in the works.  Better Graphics and driveable cars?  2 thumbs up.    I'd like it if one could hide from the zombies to but I don't see that as a huge issue.  There should be roaming NPC groups that either want to join your compound, theives and Merchants, though I saw that was coming.  The scope and potential of the game is huge and limitless.  It really just depends on how serious these guys are about it.   So far I think they are and as such, I give this game a thumbs up and look forward to more game updates soon.","February 9, 2014","true","36.7"," 72 of 113 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","72","113","0","0"

Little did I know this would become one of our guilds main games. Our guild leader is now thouroughly addicted and plays almost nothing else. While I have played some on public servers, our guild has our own server, so this review and my experience will be based mostly on the private server side of the game. I  have found this game to be really addicting in the building aspect you can make almost amything you can think of and that is a major part of how addicting the game can be, you tend to keep saying to yourself "ill just finish this little area up and log next thing you know you have built an underground comples, hollowed out a mountian for your mine and build towers and fortifications everywhere, while forgetting to eat and sleep. Another good aspect "atleast on the private server is we can mod the world and setup game types form group survival to pvp which is very nice. The only issue I have seen so far is the new lighting system in update 10 while it looks very nice it really drops your frame rate (I was running game on max settings and now have turned shadows and anti-aliasing off for better preformance and some of our guildies with older computers and graphics cards are only hitting 3-10 FPS, after the update).

But each new update has just made that beginning longer and more tedious. The latest update has finally convinced me that 7D2D really isn't going anywhere.\n\nWith Alpha 13 it now takes me 50 chops, with a really good Stone Axe, to get through half of a boarded-up door. That's 100 chops to get through one door. And all doors are now boarded-up, even ones inside a house. (Who boards up the door to their own bathroom??) But it doesn't really matter, because there's no good loot behind those doors anyway. No chance of something useful - like maybe an iron axe. More likely some empty tin cans, or more parts for a Hunting Rifle I won't be able to assemble for another 20 hours or so.\n\nI'll be lucky to live that long. There are dogs everywhere, and they're pretty much un-killable. When I do kill an animal (dog, pig or deer), I don't get hides, like I used to. So no chance to build a Bellows, or after that, the all-important Forge. Also, air conditioners don't give up Steel Pipes any more - which means no way to make a Grill, and therefore no way to cook food. So I'm rapidly starving. I'm also overheating all the time, over 100 degrees standing outdoors in a normal woodland biome. So I'm going through 10 water or more in a single day. That means more trips to the river, more boiling to purify the water, more chopping wood for fuel. Also, items wear out really fast now, so you'll be spending most of your time repairing and re-making the same gear over and over and over again.\n\nThis is after almost 8 hours of play on Alpha 13, with most of my stats well up from their starting points. And with difficulty reduced one notch from the default. So when, exactly, does the fun part start?\n\nEach successive 'big, big update' to 7D2D has turned out to be mostly about better visuals, more tweaks to an already perfectly-adequate UI, and, above all, more ways of making the game agonizingly, screen-punchingly slow and difficult. Instead of extending the game with new content, TFP is just stretching what's already there, thinner and thinner. What they've got now, is a game that's both tedious and pointless. Grind your way up the skill tree as far as you like, and you'll find there's still never any actual progression in the gameplay. No advanced tactics. No grand strategy. No storyline. No fascinating new locations to discover. Just more of the same simplistic gameplay: see a zombie, kill a zombie. Build a fort and watch the zombies rip it apart in one night.\n\nThis is a game so linear and mindless that it could be played by an actual zombie.\n\nSo why have I spent so much time playing 7D2D? Two reasons. First, because it actually used to be a lot more fun. Back when it was simpler and not quite so mind-numbingly grind-y. Second, because I was sustained by hope. The hope that by the time I inevitably got bored - yet again - the next patch would give me somewhere to go, something to do that I'd never done before. But after literally years  of waiting, I have now officially lost that hope. I've crafted thousands of blocks, hunted down hundreds of crafting blueprints, fended off endless hordes of zombie dogs. And there's still no point to it all. Only now it's way more difficult and way less fun that it was back in the early days.\n\nTL;DR: I probably would have recommended 72D2 a year ago. Today, in December 2015, I can't. It's been 'improved' and 'upgraded' until it's become hopelessly broken. Don't bother with it until you see some signs of real evolution in the gameplay. And some serious reduction in the grind factor.\n\n\nEDIT: I've been informed that to get hides, you have to chop the animal with a bladed weapon. It works. Changes like this ought to be documented by the developers... nothing like a good 'readme' file.\n\nNOTE: Reading the "How Alpha 13 Works (Basics)" thread, I've learned how to level up my crafting skills in a hurry. Basically, just keep making the same stuff over and over and over. It works, and it makes the difficulty a lot more manageable. But it's also kind of the definition of 'grind.'\n\nThere's a no-man's land in game design, between 'too easy' and 'too difficult.' The way to fill in that gap is with 'interesting.' TFP obviously don't understand this. They won't let players build an impregnable base, because they fear that would end the zombie threat permanently. They don't realize that the solution to the problem isn't simply to make the game tougher, it's to make it more interesting, to allow gameplay to evolve. When you've built the impregnable base, the game doesn't end, or become trivial - it moves to a higher level. Until they realize this, 7D2D will always be an exercise in futility.","December 14, 2015","false","427.1"," 224 of 382 people (59%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","59","224","382","21","76"

Whether you prefer to play solo or with friends(or enemies), this gem of a game will keep you entertained for a long time with its content.\n\nThe best way to describe this game is as a mix of Minecraft crafting and creativity combined with best parts of other zombie survival games. Personally, the best features of the game are the game's atmosphere and zombie herds. Yup, herds, like The Walking Dead comic herds. Not so great in number(20-30 zombies) but every once in a while(with increasing frequency) they'll stumble past your house and either go around it or start tearing it down while you're inside praying they don't get in and gathering your most valuable stuff, ready to try and make a break for it in case they get inside. These herds give you new goals in the game, as unlike in Minecraft, you cannot build a home which will be completely safe with 1 layer of dirt, and will force you to try to constantly improve your home, run for your life and keep you on your toes. If you also set zombies to run at night, this game turns from a survival to a horror game.\n\nMight just be the best survival game I have ever played.","January 2, 2015","true","102.5"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

It's also pretty cool to build up some deffences like sharp sticks and stuff and watch the bastrids kill themselves at night.\n\nThe learning curve is pretty steep though, so you may want to look at some videos or whatever before you start.\n\nStarter tip:  Make a stone ax (stick, from punching a bush; plant fiber, from punching grass and crafting it up; and a sharp stone, made from a small stone you can find on the ground).  It's an ok starting weapon (though you may want to trade it in for an iron/spiked club when you get the chance), and you can use it to chop down trees and dig clay to make molds for ingots.\n\nBonus starter tip:  Get a ranged weapon (a crossbow works) or make a good melee weapon (at least an iron club) before you barge into a house looking for loot.  As a matter of fact, don't barge in.  Wait for the zeds to come out and then snipe 'em.\n\nAnyways, it's damned fun and *mostly* bugless as far as I can see.  Worth the price too, but if you can't afford it then you could probably wait for a sale.  Then you should deffinitely get it.","October 9, 2014","true","501.4"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","26","34","0","6"

(You get a steam key)\n\nhttp://7daystodie.com/\n\nNow that I have played it further, I like to state I love the destruction model this game engine has. Like its immediate close comparison MINECRAFT it has the same cube construction world and therefore has the same sandbox element of creativity and destructibility. This game though unlike MC, has a far more survival aspect with the need to drink, eat and rest. Ammo and guns are ripe yet are very valuable.\n\nThe graphics are a touch basic at this stage and some things are nice to look at and some things are plain ugly (like the hands). But its alpha and looks I been told are superficial over game play (though a nice looking game doesn't hurt either !)\n\nThe map of the game area is not very large at this time but of course there is so much yet planned and I am sure this will be added to.\n\nYou start out in the wilderness, It becomes important to find shelter/supplies and build a safe house QUICKLY. As soon as dark approaches zombies become the things out of 28 days later and run, rip and claw at the very building and you at a horrifying ferocity.\n\nMany a time I thought I was safe in the attic only to be swarmed by zombies that got up !\n\nThe game has also a great user friendly crafting system. No wiki needed to make stuff here as its as friendly to craft as like say in Terraria. There is a wiki though if you so wish to refer to for extra ease.\n\nhttp://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/Crafting\n\n\n\nALPHA 7.6 out and reviewed :\n\nWe come a long way from version 5 when I first sat down to review this game. It has expended its map, more zombie types have been added and a major graphic & lighting overhaul has been implemented.\n\nThe crafting system has been expanded, and you now have a furnace / camp fires / cooking, plus much more. This game is more now so in direct competition with Dayz and like but heads over and beyond that comparison when you have the lovely terrain morphing that lets you build underground bases, raise buildings to the ground and punch holes through anything to escape impending death. I mean what game has the scenario ;\n\n"Your in a tense situation, up stairs in the loft. A wandering horde has *smelt* your immediate proximity and the zombies claw there way in through the windows and breaking the door down. But they can not reach you by the ladder you deliberately broke, so instead they instinctively start to claw and chew at the surrounding beams/walls of the house supports causing a slow but impending situation with structural security! I thought at first I may have to jump down and try and fight my way through (probable death) but I go and place a fuel barrel near the corner of the loft, firing at it causes an explosion that blows a hole through the floor but also the roof. I jump through the hole and make my way up and out to the roof of the building making my hastily escape."\n\nThe game has got great scope and even now is SO MUCH FUN single player or a friend or two in co-op and I know we have a real gem here with yet so much more growth promised and coming.\n\nThe updates as you can see, from Alpha 5 to now Alpha 7.6 are coming regular enough to keep this project healthy and interesting. (Unlike the SLOW ongoing update response from Dayz team - YAWN).\n\n\n\nALPHA 7.9 out and reviewed :\n\nLots again changed to the crafting system, more items added & lots tweaked. Mining is now a little more tricky and involves more time spent finding all that sweet ore.\n\nNew FX added, Bloom and HD hands. Little things that make a lot of difference candy wise.\n\nThis game is shaping up to be a really good survivalist game. But striking that balance of fun/challenge is still of course being tweaked and streamlined.\n\nLately I have built my first base out in the wilderness. Nothing fancy but using materials like concrete and wood planks I have shapped a defensive base, with camp fire for food and a forge for building materials. I have a mine in the centre that spans tunnels and caves deep below, its great what you can do in this game.\n\n\n\nALPHA 8.2 out and reviewed :\n\nJust released and is superb !\n\nNew sun affects, better crafting eliminating Wiki use altogether now.\n\nWith every patch so many changes come out its brilliant and fresh and far to extensive to list here everything that was included in 8.2. Needless to say that they keep adding so many cool things to the game and its looking better after every patch.\n\nWe now have wondering hordes, we now have materials that can be upgraded ie, wood planks to metal reinforced wood planks. So many building options just let your imagination go wild with how to make the ultimate fortress.\n\nSmooth terrain is the big change to, its now fully in and makes the world much more realistic. So no more looking like Minecraft from now on.\n\nI so look forward to whats to come, ...\n\n\n\nALPHA 9 out and reviewed :\n\nWOW - what a major change we have here. RANDOM maps in glorious techno-realism.\n\nThe beautiful new Randomly Generated Worlds A.K.A. Randomz-gane which have full gigantic cities, roads, rivers, lakes, cliffs, mountains, roadside and wilderness locations and feature all biome types.\n\nthey have also reworked the entire in game GUI with new Art, Truetype fonts and many new features including fog of war, waypoints, friend tracking and recipe search.\n\nBuff System enhancements including, Broken Legs, Sprained Legs, Dysentery, Drowning, Concussions and First Aid Kits. New rendering enhancements including soft shadows and underwater effects added. In addition the player can now craft a full cloth armor set and use scrap iron build and upgrade forts. Folks this update is jammed packed with features!\n\n\n\nALPHA 10.4\n\nOh my, this game gets better and better. Every update since I first brought the game brings fourth a multitude of awesome sauce. Finely tuned Random worlds with a load of POI (points of interest) buidings / cities and estates to scrummage through.\n\nCrafting increased, with GUI futher more tuned and twisted into a delight to use. With now a fully customised character system to play around with and mutiple clothing options to obtain.\n\nThis game is on sale as of 20th / 12 / 2014 half price and really suggest you pick this baby up.\n\n\nALPHA 12.1\n\nThings just got better, My god, for what a great looking game with better random gen / scenery.\n\nCrafting be overhauled again, UI improved no end.\n\nFeels so much better as a survival, balancing is getting there to near perfect.","December 13, 2013","true","215.7"," 445 of 773 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","445","773","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/251570/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n7 Days to Die is a post-apocalyptic sandbox game by the aptly-named indie-developer The Fun Pimps. Part role-playing, part crafting, and part base-defense, the overall game takes place in the area surrounding Navazgane County, Arizona, some years after a third World War took place. Whether due to the radiation or some bio weapon, no one knows, but the resulting virus transformed most of the surviving population into the re-animated dead. And, much like the monsters in Stephen King’s Cell, they act as a single-minded being.\n\nYour automatic and understandable thought in looking at this game for the first time is that it looks a great deal like an upgraded Minecraft. In a way, you’re not wrong, and that’s what makes it play so well. The genius of this game is that the creators took what they knew already worked and built on top of it with new features and twists. So, the voxel-based world is built temporarily in a “block” form, though it’s cleverly designed in a way that buildings and roads look much more complex that the “Q-Bert-esque” world you see in most sandbox games.\n\nNaturally, crafting is where you’ll create the tools and weapons you’ll need to survive this post-nuclear world. The crafting is done via a recipe matrix, just as Minecraft is, but it’s been expanded to a 5×5 grid and has been designed so that now you won’t feel a constant need to keep a wiki page open in a side-browser to remember a recipe. Depending on the resources in your inventory, the possible recipes you can build, with what you currently have, will show up on a list next to the crafting grid. It’s still up to you to lay them out in the correct configuration, but once you create the recipe once, you can then simply click on the name of the recipe and it will automatically pull the ingredients out of your inventory. It’s a simple, and yet very welcome feature.\n\nThe scavenging and resource system in the game fits perfectly with its post-apocalyptic theme. You also have a hunger and thirst meter so you’ll need to be mindful of where you can find water or food, and it’s done in a way to be interesting but not annoying. Resources in the world come in the appropriate form of scrap metal, wood planks, pieces of cloth, etc. Some resources can be picked by hand or dug up like certain plants or mineral resources, but the majority of the resources you collect will come from scavenging with tools. With a fire-ax, you can cut down a tree or a telephone pole. A pick-ax can break concrete walls or break up iron plating . Scattered randomly around the world are broken metal panels, steel beams, and piles of old garbage. From these, you’ll find all kinds of things you’ll use to build other items. Some can even be broken down further. At one point, I searched an old rusted car and found some hubcaps which could be broken down into scrap metal pieces, which could then either be used to create reinforced plating for my walls or used to create iron ingots for making tools or to craft the game’s vast assortment of booby-traps and explosives.\n\nExploration has to be approached very carefully, since you are having to watch the safety of your surroundings as well as how many hours you’ll have to explore before the sun goes down and all Hades breaks loose. This goes doubly for when you venture into one of the towns where the urban ruins are surrounded by many more zombies and the dark narrow hallways and stairwells in the multi-story buildings introduce new tactical challenges. But all of these things make for exactly the kind of gameplay you want in a post-apocalyptic title.\n\nA great main feature is the way the game approaches structure integrity and physics. All building materials have different strengths and weaknesses and weight comes into play with that. Just as in the real world, you can’t just keep attaching block after block of wood horizontally in the air and expect it to hold. At some point it’s going to tip over and crash down without support. Wood, however, can be built further out than dirt, and metal much further than either of them — especially if it’s reinforced with truss work. Step too far out on a decaying roof and your body weight will cause you to collapse the chunk your standing on and bring you down with it. I learned this the hard way when I got on a warehouse roof, thinking I had outwitted the zombies below, and smashed right through the ceiling and into the auto repair shop below where they were waiting. Eventually, you’ll catch yourself actually thinking like a true scavenger when you approach a ruined building, quickly assessing how it’s built and if it’s safe. It’s one of those moments that really adds to the immersion. And the physics really shine for those crazy I-wonder-if-this-will-work moments, as it did when I blew up a line of gasoline cans at the base of a broken apartment complex and watched in amusement and shock as the building started to tip and then completely collapsed.\n\nThe game is surprisingly complex and if it does have a weakness at all (assuming you consider it a weakness), it’s a realization that there is a lot under the hood and the game isn’t going to tell you what it is. It’s the same initial learning-curve that Minecraft players experience the first time, and one where you’ll want to at least give a quick-glance to a wiki site at the very beginning and get at least SOME idea of what tools do what. I was dead multiple times before I realized the sleeping bag I had crafted served as a selectable re-spawn point, and that I could actually have more than one if I clicked on the “tent” symbol on my map. I also struggled to find certain resources to build common tools, only to realize that I was simply in an area where the dead trees didn’t have the wood necessary for it. Or the fact that when you die, you lose the items in your hot-bar but keep the items in your backpack so the balance between “what you use” and “what you protect” becomes much more important. And then there’s the zombies.\n\nZombies can hear you, smell you, and see you. They aren’t just lumbering hulks that walk around with no real goal. There are 15 different types: the shrieking spider zombie, the huge acid-vomiting Infected Policeman, the ground-crawling and the vicious and fast-moving Infected Dog just to name a few. Each one with its own attack, movement, and discernible noises. The zombies are affected by light (with the exception of the dogs) and so you find them in the daytime moving slower and much less intelligently. But when the sun goes down… well… that’s when everything changes. When the sun is down and the light is no longer inhibiting them, the zombies go from lumbering undead to ultra-fast monsters to begin hunting you down. Torches and campfires can temporarily slow them, but only as long as they are in the light, and if you haven’t prepared you’ll be dead before you realize you screwed up.\n\n7 Days to Die achieves exactly what it sets out to be. It’s a fun and intense post-apocalyptic sandbox with all the right mix of base-defense, scavenging, and exploration. There are an incredibly large amount of things to do in it, and though it’s still considered an early-release game, it feels surprisingly feature-complete even with what it has in its current state.

I had been struck earlier, and was suffering the early stages of the infection. I hadn't eaten in days, and all I had were some eggs that I had found in a birds nest this morning. Expecting the cold grip of death at any moment, as I hear the deathly screams of the undead outside, and my body beginning to eat itself, I quietly slip a raw egg into my hand from my backpack. I lay hunkered down, crying silently, as I eat the raw egg to stop the hunger pains, knowing full well it was a gamble; that the raw eggs would most likely cause me some sort of illness. Although I knew the risks, I wasn't prepared for the sh*t stormof blood that erupted from my ♥♥♥♥. I began losing consciousness, but remained alive by popping painkillers. Finally, daybreak came about, and as I emerged from my hiding place, I lost the battle with my bloody diarrhea, and slipped into a coma.\n\nThis has been the 8th time that I have come so close to death, only to be rescued by some mysterious stranger.

I hope it stays that way.\n* You can make underground bunkers/bases. or If you prefer to be visible, you can make a giant castle xD\n* Soon, more places to explore will be added and vehicles, which will make this game epic.\n* Most importantly, this game is Fun !! Loads of FUN with your friends!!\n\nAlso, i'd like to add that some of you prefer high quality graphics, but this is one game which is all about the gameplay.

Most of my 200+ hours were spent in the first few months came out. I enjoyed the crafting options for buildings, tools, weapons. The combat was loads of fun, and I had an amazing time using the many different ways to kill zombies with traps, weapons and environmental destruction. I was hooked after a Gas station explosion chained to all the oil drums as a zombie horde attacked.\n\nI know games change in Early Access and I do feel that I got my money's worth for the time I played. Sadly, I currently find the game unplayable. Some of the biggest issues for me are...\n- Zombies can hit you farther out than you can hit them with a melee weapon (Absolutely horrendous in multi player, but still bad in single player). I have a 2-3 foot spiked club and can't hit the zombie punching me from 4-6 blocks away!?!\n- The cross hair targeting for any weapon is randomly inaccurate. (Enjoy wasting all that ammo you spent hours gathering resources for and forced time spent crafting it up?)\n- Crafting has become overly complex, not in options, but with the steps you have to go through to even find what you need to craft in the GUI menu's. (Can't see the recipe for the mini bike frame, unless inside the forge GUI)\n- AI glitching. (Watching zombies circle 4 blocks for a few mins before killing it or having one run away from you in the middle of a fight, is funny to watch but not great game play.)\n- Terrain glitches (Fall through the world to your death anyone?)\n\nI'm not including frame rates, or view distance issues, due to not being able to test properly on different computers.\n\nMany people have found ways to work around the glitch-ridden combat and just accept the obtuse crafting mechanics, but I don't feel that I should have to do that for a game about killing zombies and crafting for base creation. I would rather watch it on YouTube.\n\nBeing able to have a zombie fall and crawl at me, after hitting them in the leg is great, but if I can't attack or kill it due to glitches, sloppy targeting, or a weapon blocking the screen, then I personally can't enjoy it.\n\nAt this point I feel, that having more time and money may have caused a loss of focus on game play. I loved this game before and want to again. Hopefully the Fun Pimps will be able to correct these issues at some point. If that happens, I will happily change this review.","April 22","false","303.5"," 121 of 204 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","121","204","9","11"

You can never get bored, there's always something to do and gives you the "just one more turn"-ish kind of addiction. Although still in Alpha i can 100% say that i've seen games released by major studios in a way worse state than this "alpha".

The game is very punishing to new players (and even veteran players). The game is getting better in some regards, but the cons outweigh the pros on this one.\n\nThe following are things I enjoy about the game. TL;DR at the end.\n\nThey've gone a long way to make the game look better. Nights feel like nights, forests feel like forests. Textures seem sharper, lighting is better. Over all the game just looks good.\n\nI personally like the new mechanic for gathering resources. Now you hit trees / rocks / ore and the items are deposited into your inventory. You get a little bit of wood for hitting a tree (which I attribute to you breaking off branches or something) then a bit payoff at the end. You don't need to mash your E key to pick up wood or stone that sprinkles itself all over the ground.\n\nWith Alpha 13 they've added new animations and textures for all the zombies. For the most part the animations are good (there are a couple that are over-acted and pretty cheesy) and I think the textures look great. Zombies can now be dismembered and knocking the legs off of one turns it into a crawler. Only head or body shots will kill a zombie, and I think this an improvement.\n\nIF you can make it to the point of the game where you can craft guns and ammo, it can be kind of fun rolling through a city gunning down hordes, problem is that's a big IF. Crafting guns and ammo is gated behind skill books and to add another layer, tools for the forge to craft the rounds also require a random drop.\n\n\n\n\nNow on to the negatives:\n\nResources are now streamlined to basically "wood, meat stone". This wouldn't really be a huge issue for me but the game already had a working system in place. Wood turned to planks and then to sticks with crafting recipes to go with it. Deer, pigs, rabbits already had their own meat and recipes for them in the game. The developers gutted perfectly functional systems for no reason other than to change and over simplify the game.\n\nThe sheer amount of tedium in the game is overwhelming. Doors take forever to break down early on, cutting down trees, breaking stone, hell even digging dirt takes forever. The main counter point to this complaint is "well you just need to skill up" and yes that is correct. Eventually you skill up enough to get to the point where it's not nearly as boring but that leads me to the next, the skill system.\n\nOh the skill system. Currently you have a wide range of skills that level from 0-100 with one perk (3 ranks that increase the quality of items you find). Sounds great, skills and niche roles are needed in a game like this and I'm happy to see it come to light. My problem is the grindy nature of these skills, some level well naturally, like blunt weapons and shotguns. The crafting skills are a chore where you'll spend your nights pooping out stone axes and bows just so you can create tools that do enough damage so you don't spend 30 hits to bust a wooden door down. So why not just level crafting naturally? You'll quit the game long before you accomplish that.\n\nOther skills like heavy armor basically become a dump stat for your points when you level up, because it requires you to get hit. However the games encourages you to not get hit so if you had hopes leveling up blunt weapons and heavy armor to tank hordes of zombies keep dreaming. Which reminds me..\n\nCombat needs a lot of love in this game. Zombies do a lot of damage and inflict a few different statuses (bleed, stun, infection). The only one I have a problem with is the stun. It lasts like 5 seconds and pretty much spells your death. Zombie dogs are basically infected heat-seeking missiles that most times kill you before you even realize what hit you. A good percentage of players just mod them out because they're so broken and frustrating to play with. So you'll die a lot and you'll basically get into this viscous cycle of losing wellness until you've bottomed out at 60 max HP / stamina.\n\nEvery 7 days you get hit with a big horde of zombies that immediately rush your position tear down your defenses to get you. Some tweaking is needed here because even actively defending you're doomed to fail unless you either build way up in the air, or build way underground (to basically exploit their pathfinding, lets face it). Personally I think the idea of the 7 day super hordes should go. I'd rather have a more constant but manageable threat, but that's just my opinion, some players prefer the super hordes.\n\nAll in all I feel like I've got my moneys worth out of the game, but I don't like the direction the game is going in. Instead of doing their own thing, the developers are trying to copy bits from other games but it just doesn't fit. The UI looks like a poor quality Ark UI and I've heard resource gathering is copying RUST (Never played it so I can't really verify that).\n\nTL;DR\n+Game environment is prettier\n+Resource gathering mechanic is less tedius (my 'E' key is happy).\n+Zombies look better, react to pain, dismemberment, rag-doll\n+Gun combat can be fun IF you manage to make it that far into the game.\n+Skill system on paper is something this game really needs.\n\n-Streamlined over-simplified resources\n-Overall tedium with construction / deconstruction / gathering\n-Skill system in practice needs a huge amount of re-balancing\n-Melee combat is not fun or rewarding. Early game you die, late game guns are always better.\n-Zombie dogs should probably just not exist.\n\nOther issues not expanded on:\n-Zombie spawning is broken and they materialize out of thin air\n-Weather survival is broken, Core temperature is 90F better cool off, what?","January 4","false","359.8"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","38","57","2","3"

There's crafting and zombies, two of my favorite elements! I have tried other zombie/craft games that were fairly hyped up when they came, but this looked way cooler. I decided to look it up on steam, and to my surprise my brother whom I have always partnered up with in multiplayer games had it. After asking him if he wanted to do some zombiekilling, I suddenly had something in my inbox. My bro gifted it to me and told me to get my ♥♥♥ on his server, where several of his friends were as well.\nWhen I entered the world, I was pretty freaked out. I was in my underwear in a desert. All alone. Even though it was sunny and in the middle of the day, the sounds combined with the scenery made me incredibly uneasy. After checking the map I saw that I really couldn't be further away from their base. I freaked and ran towards them, and died about five times. (never claimed to be good) I finally spawned well within range,  and after a few minutes I found their base. Now, this was some next level fortification. After breaking a few bones trying to get in and not really managing to get anyones attention, a massive zombiehorde came towards me. I finally called my brother on the phone and forced him to show me how to get in. Upon entering they handed me full armor, guns, medkits, a place to put out a bed and showed me around. They really outdid themselves. There were common spaces and everything. After some time we moved up to the roof and started killing some zombones while they bolted past our fort. The next ingame day I was sent out on a scavenging mission (bro takes these kinda games really srsly), and it made me freak out. I had to deal with zombones all by my lonesome and be far away from camp, well until night time. And I still hadn't really learned anything useful about the game, seeing as they had provided me with everything before I could start asking questions. Being by yourself at night in this game without a proper base and proper knowledge is downright terrifying.\n\nNow, this was right before Alpha 11.\nThe next time we ganged up to play our server was outdated and saves had been deleted. We had to do everything from scratch, and I finally really got to learn how to do crafting because I would die pretty fast if I didn't. I did get infected several times, broke several legs, and got dysentery more than I would like to admit. And I was loving every minute, while simultaneously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants. I mean, I love their swagger but zombies are still terrifying.\n\nWe are still trying to rebuild what we once had, but sitting at night and actually being scared because you could die at any moment is actually way more fun (and gruesome) than being safe and sound inside a fortress. This also goes for having to actually go out and gather/make every last little thing you need too.\nI still haven't been able to put in that many hours since I refuse to play it alone, but I love it!\n\nAnd after that long boring story; on to the game itself!\nAs I stated, I have tried other games with the same elements. None of these have lived up to my expectations. I was terrified at the start of every last one of them, but that soon wore off. It just gets worse with 7d2d. The atmosphere created by the amazing sounds, the massive landscape with concealed valleys and mountains blocking your view, and the terrifying night/day shifts is just simply amazing. I wanna ♥♥♥♥ my pants when I play these kinda games. And I keep on doing that. There were some complications after Alpha 11 came out, but it is an early access after all. And from what I gather the pimps are pretty involved with their community and active as well, so in time this will probably be one of the greatest zombie mmos out there.\n\nGreatest game i've played for a long time, by far.","April 6, 2015","true","24.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

BAM! Crafting survival game and it's the best of both worlds.  When you start out you just loot the world, kill your own food, and then you desperately find a place to make a shelter or hold up in the abandoned buildings at night hoping no zombies find you. Then you will die, and die, and die... and then you play with your friends and you both die and die and die until you finally level up enough and start crafting good stuff.\n\nPROS:\n-Nice looking 3D environment with physics! No random fort building in the sky for this game it would fall on your head and kill you. Plus there are many different Biomes to explore from snowy mountains to deserts.\n-Crafting adds so much more value to the game rather than running around just shooting zombies.\n-They throw everything at you when you least expect it. Hostile animals, hordes of zombies & zombie dogs to randomly attack your base even during the day. It makes for great gameplay because you never know what is going to happen and when.\n- Leveling up system that improves your crafting and stats. Plus you get hunger and thirty stats adding to the survival aspect. It's fun to see your character evolve into a wasteland bad mofo especially when you start out naked.\n-You get sick and can break bones adding to the realistic feel of the game. You never think while playing this game "yeah right that would never happen in real life." well... minus the zombie apocalypse that is, that might not ever happen in real life.\n\nCONS:\n-A little too difficult for single player alone, it's really only good with co-op.\n-Hackers. If you forget to set your server to private anyone can join and I've had several hackers who will join my game just to mess things up.\n-Too challenging to upgrade items, weapons, etc. The game didn't start that way but it keeps getting updated and every time it gets harder and more unbalanced. You run around for days with a crappy bow that can barely kill anything, making it almost impossible to loot the houses where zombies spawn in hoards when you play single player.\n-The modeling for characters is really weak/ugly and there are few options for things like hair styles. You basically end up looking like your buddy so it would almost be better to scrap it and just give us 5 or so pre-made characters to choose from.\n-No hints or tutorials. You just get thrown in, figure it out for yourself genuis! A quick “how to craft” tutorial would be really beneficial to the first time player, especially since it’s challenging from the moment you are thrown into the world with almost nothing.\n-very minimal lag but there is some, especially when you get overwhelmed with the undead. But the bugs in this game impressively non-existent.\n\nIn short, there is no causal play for this game. It keeps you on edge the entire time and although it’s very difficult to play alone it’s still well worth it. You can easily drop hours on this game and not even know where the time went. Worth $25 bucks? Totally! It feels like a completed game even in just the late Alpha stage and I’m excited to see where it goes from here.","September 1, 2015","true","46.9"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

Dig underground, repair and reinforce an existing building, or build an all new structure. Upgrade your build from wood to scrap to concrete etc.\n-Challenging zombies.\n-A nice crafting system.\n-A persistent character progression system where you can allocate points into areas you want to specialize in. This adds quite a bit of longevity to the game IMO.\n\nCons:\n-Wot.\n\n7 Days to Die is one of my favorite games. The devs have done a great job. They communicate with the community(even accepting help from the community to fix/shape the game), and almost every new milestone alpha build feels like a brand new game(really, look at the first few releases of the game and compare them to now---quite an amazing difference IMO). I think this game deserves way more publicity and players. Hopefully the console release will fix that. It gets a lot of flack for its graphics but I don't think it looks that bad honestly.","May 24","true","479.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

That’s why I decided to write my first review - I do not think the reviews are representative of the game, they nearly put me off buying a game that I am enjoying a lot.\n\nFirst thing I really like is that you can play this game exactly how you want to.  You want creative mode for building, farming and exploring? It’s there.  You're fed up with the zombies? you can remove them or reduce their numbers, want more of a challenge? Make more zombies and give them the ability to run day and night or increase their health.  You can tailor the game exactly to your favourite gameplay.  As well as the menu options, the spawn settings are stored in XML files which you can edit to customise further still.\n\nThe balance of the whole game IMO is very good.  Everything has been designed in such a way that you have to get out and explore.  To begin you can make a few items/tools/weapons.  To unlock more you have to read schematics or books which you can only find by looting buildings.  The better schematics and weapons are mostly found in the cities which is where you find the most dangerous zombies, forcing you to take risks if you want to progress.\n\nA lot of these survival games are all about grinding materials, with 7DTD I never really feel like it’s a grind, especially once you start getting decent tools.  Breaking safes can take a while but you normally get decent rewards for it.  You can very quickly get enough materials to build a basic house.  You can farm some of the plants and most of your materials will come from looting buildings and rubbish.\n\nThe zombie types have been chosen well to give a good variety.  You are mostly safe to walk around during the day, but there are dogs and bears that still keep you on your toes, at night, everything is dangerous.  Some can climb, some have a ranged attack, some can run faster than others and some crawl around in the grass.\n\nThe entire world is destructible, so you can dig into the ground and mine anywhere in the map, destroy, rebuild or fortify buildings etc.  The immersion -ambient sounds in the game are brilliant.  The wind, the howling of dogs at night and the footsteps of zombies all add up to a really good experience.  Many times I have been caught out by zombies creeping up on me and made me jump.  The graphics IMO are very good considering the size and detail of the maps.\n\nThe only negative I have is the zombies seem to be able to see through walls, but the game is still Alpha so this may improve in future.\n","April 12","true","162.4"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","4"

Although I'm not recommending the game, that may change as development continues. However, the game has been in public alpha for a while now and I've yet to see it progress significantly towards the type of game I thought it could be.\n\nIssue I have:\nPoor quality zombies. The models are shocking, maybe these are just placeholder, but they've been there a while and look terrible.\nUnimaginative zombie spawn and AI. It's like the developers have used a really basic noise algorithm to desperse the zombie spawns, then quadruple it when near points of interest. If a zombie is chasing a player, another player could stand right next to it and it would just continue to chase the first, zZzZzzzz.\nRidiculous zombie health. Getting a head shot on the most basic zombie, with full stamina and a hardly damaged weapon does not equal a kill. This might disapear when skills are introduced and I think it lessens the higher level you get, but really? Zombie appocalyspe rule No 1: Headshot = kill. Maybe there could be some more varied difficulty modes?\nSkill book to unlock the forge. This is just stupid and frustrating, why would anyone find that fun?\nI do like the building mechanics, creating frames that can then be upgraded with materials is one of the few innovative things I've found in this game. Pretty much everything else has been taken from other titles. So for a game that is basically a mash-up of Minecraft and DayZ, you will not have fun mining and base building and you will not get immersed in the world due to the awful graphics and the laughable zombies. I'm not entirely sure what they wre trying for tbh, but maybe they'll get there, some day.\n","July 6, 2015","false","136.1"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","26","37","0","0"

This is an early access alpha game, after over two years of being such. This doesn't count what ever time was before such that may have been used for development.\nThe placing of blocks is rudimentary, you can't rotate them to various degrees and are stuck with building basic square and rectangle and octagonal shapes. Spacing between half and quarter blocks is exagurated to take up a whole section, even if it's only a sign on the wall. The lack of choices in the basic game with out modification is dry and very limited.\n\nWeapon choices are very limited.\nAnimals which may roam the world (if they even spawn) are very limited.\nZombies (if they even spawn now) are very limited and half the time glitch out with randomly missing parts while still trotting after you.\nThere is no story line for the basic game in single player mode.\nOver 75% of what was promised by the go fund me for the game hasn't even been touched upon even after over two years.\nCrafting now takes from minutes in previous versions to hours now. And these are small amounts of things. Material usage is multiplied by ten times what previous versions used to create things.\nDuct tape is used to repair everything, yes, even your guns. I'd like to see some idiot fix a gun with duct tape and fire it.\nEverything degrades expotentially when you repair it, there is no maintaining anything, it will always fall apart even if you fix it.\nOnce you actually build a base after spending hours upon hours doing so a group of five to ten zombies can buldoze through it in less than ten minutes. I wonder what sort of milk zombies drink that they can bash through a solid cement/concrete/ or steel wall with their bare hands and keep all their bones intact.\nThe resources to make ammo, especially brass is so scarce that you may as well give up on making any ammo unless you are on a mp server with some sort of mod with copper and zinc.\nFor servers, once you hit about 20+ players there are now these odd black graphics glitches, lines, black blocks, or jsut a full black screen. If you go near a fridge, forge, capfire when it's running the sound will usually bug out and cause a string of errors that wont stop all the while cutting out all of your sound except for some odd buzzing noise.\nThe dogs have been beefed up so they can one shot you, all the while being invincible to melee atacks.\n\nI should also mention whats advertised on the 7 days to die web page as already being in game but never has.\n\n"Dynamic Story Generation – The story unfolds through our “Dynamic Story Generation System” which guides the player to other survivors, better loot and undiscovered Points of Interests through story note quests."\n\n"Looting, Mining and Crafting – Loot and mine a multitude of items and ingredients to create hundreds of items including melee weapons, guns, traps, generators, motorized tools, motion detectors, landmines, auto-turrets, salves, potions  and more using our 5×5 grid Crafting System."\n\nOf course, I would caution against believing half of what is advertised to be in the game, simply because it's not. It's just false advertising.\n\nAll in all when ever the basic bugs are worked out of this game and everything which was promised to be in it ever arrives it might be really phenominal. As for now the only thing which makes it even slightly playable or enjoyable is finding a good online community to play with on a heavily modded server. Other wise it's jsut another severly limited alpha game which is years old and shows the lack of either creativity or intelligence from it's developers.\n\n","January 7","false","966.5"," 97 of 165 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","97","165","6","3"

For me its more the foraging for materials while happening to keep an eye over your shoulder for an incoming zombie.  Also enjoy heading out with a friend and guarding while they run around grabbing loot.   It is a sandbox and suits many styles of play.   I would definitely recomend it to the player who enjoys a good coop but doesnt need directed quests or set goals.  I am not a PVPer so I cant really speak to that aspect of it but I do know the game is set up to support that type of play as well.\n\nEdit - 1/29/2016\nIts been a while so editing this review.  I have to say the comments above still stand.  I see people claiming to have monster systems and claiming game is laggy for them.  I'm playing on a very old system with half the specs usually mentioned and am playing it fine on some good graphic settings.  Seems strange that they would have the issues they are listing.\n\nI see people attacking their programming skills, yet I have found very little wrong in this game as compared to other, full release games.

I dont do survival games and I do ok with this, but yes, its difficult.  And yes, you can start up a game find yourself in some untenable situations.  Either ride it out or start another game.\n\nThe game has changed a lot while I've played it.  Most of the changes are strong improvements, creating more depth and a more interesting game.  Changes I've wondererd about when they first came out were refined into things I love about the game and this process is still going on.\n\nAt the end of the day this is one of my go to games that I keep coming back to.","June 4, 2015","true","445.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

I read reviews about the game being to predictable and that every 7th day is the most dangerous time to survive but I will tell you that is not true. I purchased 2 copies for my son and I to play and for over 150 hours we survived with no cheats. We have built several different types of structures to hold back the zombies including ones that may just be glitchs or exploits and we have found out some interesting things that may or may not change with later builds. Random gen is the only way we like to play. The unknown is what makes the game fun.\n\nWood shack.. Like everyone else the first home we built was a little 10x10 wood shack. No windows, wedge shingled roof with center support with ladder for roof access. This shack only lasted a few days before we needed to seek something stronger.\n\nUnderground.. We then found a good size neighborhood but was quickly overwhelmed with zombies and knew we wouldnt be able to bed down in the town and it was getting dark so we decided to make a big loop around the town to get the zombies off our trail and we began to dig a hole in the ground.  First night underground was stressful. The zombies become alot more active when the moon comes up and even underground we could be sensed. We didnt move one inch until the sun came up. The next day we decided to dig further underground and make a small cave for storage containers. over the next several days we extended our lair with tunnels under the town. We actually tunneled all the way to a house in the center of town and came up threw the floor only to be welcomed by zombies boarded up in the house. Our underground lair worked well until about day 100 then all hell broke loose. A little after midnight the game ai decided to send a large pack of about 8 dogs our way. We didnt think much of it since weve seen dogs come and go plenty but this time the dogs knew our location and circled around on ground level and starting digging in the dirt. It didnt take to long for them to dig a hole straight down into our cave and with our best efforts we tried to kill them. Didnt work. We had to abandon all our crates only to watch the pack collapse our lair destroying all our loot.\n\nFloating lake house.. Some days later we decided to give the floating house a try. It worked extremely well since the zombies acted odd when in the water and cant swim to the surface to attack our home. We lived in this home long enough to get 2k zombie kills and become bored with our home. The lake house is a great concept but the ai isnt able to do anything to you.. yet. Hopefully this will change since the game is all about keeping you on your toes.\n\nCheats activated.. Bedrock spawned in. We now decided to work in creative mode and see what kind of structures can be built with the game physics as of now. We built a mega fortress out of bedrock with 4 floors, a water elevator, and a pitfall 65 blocks down to kill off the zombie horde. Now this sounds like the way you would want to play this game but we found this is not the best way. Because we used 1,000s of tnt and used power tools etc we heated up the map so bad that we had non stop hordes coming from all directions. This was still no problem for our fortress. The build was fun but after learning all the structure physics and just watching zombies come after us for days and never needing to do any repairs or kill anything we found ourselves bored again.\n\nSo what now? Well the saying keep it simple is the way to go here. We restarted our server and decided to try the wood shack again but with some extra defenses. A 3 block deep trench with log spikes helped but the wood spikes made no difference. Placing the log spikes against the shack also helped alot. One of the biggest things we noticed was that using the crossbow let you be sneaky and kill and hunt without being detected even when close to dogs. For the remainder of our playtime we kept our part of the woods quiet and the only issues we have is the roaming horde every now and then but we just leave them be and stay out of site til morning. You will occasionally get a group of spider zombies scouting the area but we just snipe them off with our crossbows. This may sound boring but with this setup your not cheating the ai simply because you can make a mistake and draw to much attention only to find yourself running for your life in the middle of the night.\n\nBottom line is this. The game is only in alpha so if you like the concept you should give this game a try. Hours of fun and off the edge of your seat madness. You will never feel safe and thats what makes the game fun. Keep it up pimps.","March 15, 2015","true","415.0"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","23","32","0","0"

On the high settings, I reached a maximum of 11 frames per second, and on the lowest, I reached anywhere from 48-55 frames per second maximum, it would often dip below the lower number.\n\nPoint 2: The zombies are incredibly difficult to kill, and before you say anything, I know the game is meant to be difficult, very difficult even, but I certainly think there is a better way to go about it than having zombies that teleport back and forth at you! That is correct, and this isn't just on multiplayer servers either, but it is a bit worse there. This does infact happen in single player too. Atleast for me, this makes the game incredibly difficult, maybe even impossible to progress in, not to mention the zombie's attack range when this occurs is around 4 blocks away from you, meaning: It can hit you from 4 blocks away! That is much more than your own range of around 2 or so blocks!\n\nPoint 3: The community of people even playing it has shrunk an incredible amount. I'm not sure if this is because of the following reasons I posted, but I wouldn't be surprised, that is all i have for this point, this one isn't even the most important, but I for one like to play co-op or multiplayer with people.\n\nTL;DR:\nThe game is incredibly glitchy, the community has gone down alot, and the framerate makes your PC seem like a potato.\nDo not buy, right now atleast.","December 30, 2015","false","0.9"," 36 of 56 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","36","56","2","6"

One thing I do have to say is that there are a lot of complaints about hackers in multiplayer, this however is only a problem if you play on an open server, personally I play peer to peer or on private servers, so I have not come across a single hacker so far. It is something to look out for though if you like to join random servers.\n\nOverall though, the game is great, I would encourage anyone to give it a go, you may well be surprised at how good it really is. Also don't be put of by all the hacker complaints as its not every single multiplayer game that has problems with them and they can be easily avoided for most of us unless you absolutely must play on an open server.\n\n","December 21, 2014","true","110.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

First off, I've really, really enjoyed this game so far.  Granted, it's only been four hours of gameplay, but that's from a general lack of free time more than anything else.  I will almost certainly have a different point of view than anyone who started playing earlier in the Alpha, so bear that in mind.  My opinion will not have been infected (no pun intended) by having to have played through any "broken" builds.  I'll also try to be concise.\n\n- To begin, "A mix of DayZ and Minecraft" really is a great way to describe the gameplay, though the zombies are more of a menace than they have been in DayZ for a while.\n\n- Next, yes, there is only one world.  It is fairly large, though, so I expect to get another 10-15 hours out of play into it before I might start getting sick of it.  And that's assuming that there's nothing interesting underground.  That being said, there is a random world generation option coming.  If I get bored with this world before it is released, then I'll just shelve the game, and come back to it once it is an option.\n\n- More than anything else, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you play with friends.  While playing solo was fun, playing with a friend or two definitely makes the game more enjoyable.\n\n- This game is fairly difficult.  I've only been playing on the medium difficulty, and I still have to be very careful to be in a safe place by nightfall.\n\n- As for how well it runs.... well, I have a decent rig, with a 2GB video card, and the game on a solid state drive.  With this setup, I can run everything on maximum with no frame loss or lag whatsoever.\n\n- The only "bug" I've encountered so far is with the zombie dogs.  Their pathing is rough, they're hard to hit when near because they usually spin in circles between attacks, and they occasionally glitch through walls.\n\n- Speaking of bugs, the big flying ones are super annoying, and really the only thing I've found thus far that I dislike.\n\n\nIn conclusion, if you enjoy zombie themed survival games, enjoy games like Minecraft, and can get a friend or two to play with, you will almost certainly enjoy this game.  I have so far, even when playing alone, and I feel like it was worth every penny even in it's current state.  I look forward to getting to continue playing this game as it is developed.","February 1, 2014","true","114.5"," 49 of 80 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","49","80","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdvDarkness/recommended/251570/","AdvDarkness","AdvDarkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdvDarkness/","142 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n7 Days to Die is a highly customizable zombie survival crafting game set in an apocolyptic world. It is still in alpha, so take this review with a grain of salt.\n1) Graphics - (9/10) Stunning. With the settings maxed out, this game is on par with many AAA games of today. The settings can be played with to suit your PC, and there is a fair chance your PC will run this game. It caters to both spectrums of graphical quality, largely settling in the medium-high range. My only nit-pick is that the view distance is rather small (11 chunk maximum as of writing this review) it can take away from the immersion when you see unloaded chucks at the bottom of a tall mountain. The lighting is among the best I have ever seen in gaming. It would be 2am inside your small base, completely pitch black, until you figure out how to craft a torch (you also start with one if you still have it) then the area illuminates in a way realistically resembling a torch.\n2) Sounds - (10/10) You will be on the edge of your chair when you hear zombies shuffling through the grass just outside your mediocre base you hastely constructed 2 hours before nightfall. Your finger will also be hovering over the pause button when you hear the terrifying screech from one of the "things" scrambling around just outside your abode. You sit there silently, not daring to light a torch, or cook the meat that you foolishly left in your inventory. The screech soon converts itself into a bang as the monsters catch onto the scent of the raw meat. They are at your door. You wonder how long the scrap metal laden boards of the door will hold against the ravaging beasts as one layer of material breaks away, Bringing you one step closer to death. Your attempts to repair the continuous damage are futile, as you are now flanked on both sides. The zombies are now breaking down your walls, and your are completely helpless. The hinges on your door give way, and you are swarmed as if the zombies were angered bees. That is the end of your story. A story named 1 Day to Die... What did I do Wrong!?!?\n3) Gameplay - (10/10) - The menus are easily navigatable, so all of your seemingly trivial supplies are easily accessed. In addition to your inventory, you have easy access to your character panel (you can create and customize your own character in MANY different ways. Don't like your nose? Feel free to give yourself a nosejob!). You can craft armor that provides various protection against diffent types of damage, be it a zombie smacking you across the face, or the warm unforgiving sun of the desert. There are many different biomes, and you better hope you came equip with weather appropriate clothing or your goose may be cooked. Or frozen depending on where you are at. Be wary of stepping into a lake as the wetness will amplifify your loss of body heat. There is armor ranging from plant fiber to a suit of iron, that even zombies would have difficulty penetrating. Speaking of iron, you can mine that in caves or your own manmade mine. The mines differ GREATLY from the likes of Minecraft, and they are infinitely more realistic looking. You could build your manmade mine inside your base. Base building is definitely one of the most innovative features of this game. You place frames, and can use materials you've collected to upgrade the durablity of those blocks. Each upgrade has different models, and you are likely to feel more safe behind a wall of scrap metal reinforced wood walls, or even concrete or rubar walls. But always keep in mind... You are NEVER completely safe in 7 Days to Die. You will always have to leave your base to search for food and water, and your own bases defenses may just be your demise. If you manage to be successful in your adventures, you will level up, and earn skill points to spend that will make your continued survival just a little bit easier. If you don't go wandering in the wee hours of the night without heavy artillery... Even WITH heavy artillery, you might just find yourself on the correct side of the wellness bar.\n4) Animations (7/10) - This is the section, that the developer could touch up a bit. The deer running animation is still rather silly, even after many ALPHA updates, but the zombies animations (Especially running) exceed expections. There is even an death animation that you get to see the zombies feasting on your body! Cutting down trees also has a neat (TIMBER!) animation that occasionally bugs out. No worries, you get your wood either way!\nOVERALL - (9.5-10) - This awesome game is still in alpha, even though it feels past needing that label, as this game is MORE than complete. There is TONS of content to enjoy and to be terrified about.  If you are in the market for a survival game, even if you believe zombies are cliche, give this game a try. Be a walking cheeseburger for a hungry zombie today!","June 2","true","42.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","13","15","5","0"

I enjoyed the game so much, that the lack of any real story was fine... looking at the hours I've put in this game, well justifies the money spent (to me, getting at least 1 hour of entertainment per $1 spent = good buy).\n\nWhere this game has driven me away is the updates. I understood this was a game in progress. I understood that at times there would be changes made that were to improve the overall experience, but may leave my game unplayable and a new one would need to be started. After several new starts, the latest "upgrade" is enough. Total change in how the menu works. How you do things. How you fix, build, I opened this game one day, eager to get back into my "japanese style" fortress, only to find that nothing worked. The underground portion collapsed and my character generated underground in a small location that used to be a barracks, with no way out. Blocks no longer reacted in the same manner as before. The shovel I was using degraded so fast. it became frustrating. The MENU was so different from previous, that I looked at it a little bit and then gave up. I didn't want to spend the time it was going to take to re-learn how to use the MENU or how to construct or cook or what have you. I realized that at that point, it wouldn't matter... because the very next update could be another episode of game break, re-learn the menu, re-learn how to build, construct, cook....\n\nI have gone from my intial love of this game, to abosolutely despising it. The Fun Pimps have taken this game from it's simple menu and basic game approach, to burdening it with so much garbage, it just isn't fun anymore.\n\nI will miss the time I spent in this world, early on, before the Fun Pimps sucked the Fun out of it. I'm not sure they have and end goal in mind with this game anymore.\n\nIf this game is ever "complete" I may attempt it one last time. I fear, however, that the Fun Pimps have turned 7 Days to Die, into 7 Days to Kill by update.","February 6","false","290.5"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","27","42","0","0"

I started playing in Alpha 9 and it was amazing. As the game went on, it kept getting harder and harder to enjoy it but I kept giving it patience. This however is where my patience runs out; I cannot handle how buggy and complex this game turned out. Buggy and complex are not a winning combination for a game. I'll be honest: some of these aspects seem like good additions if they weren't so buggy. For example: the weather system, the vehicles, new zombie animations and actions, more animals. What I don't like however are things like: the increasingly complex leveling system (which makes the game more equipment based rather than skill based), the quality levels (this goes well for guns but not so much for anything else that can be crafted), the cars not respawning loot. I do hope this game gets better in the future, and if it truthfully can't be fixed then I would literally be fine with The Fun Pimps reverting the game back to Alpha 11 and releasing the full game like that.","January 23","false","449.5"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","27","42","0","0"

Before Alpha 13 update, the game used to be more fun and balanced (not very, but better than now). But now it's a giant step back and full of bugs, glitches, unbalanced or broken game mechanics.\n\nThe game is now quite frustrating to play, even with a friend on a server, we've been killed numerous times by packs of dogs that hated by many, and walking zombies that we can't even launch a one hit kill headshot.\n\nThe melee combat is a complete joke. There's no way that you won't get slapped in the face when you're trying to hammer the zombies with your iron club, as their attack animation is instant, you can't dodge them. One of the stupid mechanics is that, 99% of the time you'll get staggered and move like a slug, say goodbye, because you'll get slapped to death as you can't run. Also you'll have a chance to get infected which you'll die after a countdown if you don't take antibiotic.\n\nIt's impossible to survive sometimes, unless disabling zombie spawning altogether, as they keep spawning randomly in horde out of nowhere, including dogs which rapes your intestines out within seconds, if you couldn't outrun them. Especially in urban areas, you're literally a dead meat with or without stealthing.\n\nThe game UI is frustratingly sloppy, or it's just me since my rig isn't that great. It's difficult to drag items across as it doesn't alway work as intented. A crafting recipe displays to the right which a list of materials is required, but you can't click the listed materials to find out how to craft them, but instead you've to search for it on the crafting categories or through the search box. The hunger and thirst were hidden into the character UI which you're forced to open frequently just to see it, but it's just my opinion. Much worst as you have to drag wearables to your character UI to equip them. Oh, you can hold shift + click inside Character UI to wear them without dragging.\n\nThe next was either it's just me or there's no music at all, other than the annoying sounds of dawn and dusk. Character models in online sometimes glitches into white stripped textures or broken animations. It has never happened before as far as I remembered before Alpha 13.\n\nThe sounds were bland and ugly, mostly all about slapping. When you plant something it feels like you're slapping the seeds into the ground instead. When the zombies break down blocks or anything it feels like they're slapping it. Even dogs and bees slaps you. Placing blocks feels like you're slapping them down to place them. Literally almost as if there's no there's little sense of distinguishment of sounds between most interactions with different blocks and objects, but still okay.\n\nYou can't crawl through a 1 block hole, seriously?\n\nOverall the gameplay is still in the same unrealistic use of logic or broken, why do some food needs pots to cook? Boiling egg with a glass of bottled water doesn't return back the glass-- and it needs an utensil to cook, I mean, really and seriously? Ladders are hideous to climb up, sometimes you just fall to your death trying to lower yourself down. Dogs smash through doors like a sponge, not to mention zombies literally climb ladder faster than you.\n\nTrees and many objects are much harder to break now, although breaking some of these resources drops continuous materials into your inventory before they are destroyed from the world. One of the trees glitched and stayed after breaking it.\n\nThe zombies were like made of adamantite. An explosive mine didn't even kill one from the horde attack. Literally takes dozens of arrows to their skull made of adamantite before they stop dancing everywhere.\n\nI didn't even get to explore the game in depth as I can't even have a minute of peace rustling through the demanding UI, and dying left and right, in such unforgiving gameplay.\n\nOther than the negative side of the game, the graphics is fine and quite beautiful. It would be great to have options to toggle different types of zombies from spawning.\n\nFor this update,\nGameplay - 5/10\nGraphic - 7/10\nMusic - 1/10\nSound - 5/10","January 15","false","23.3"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","22","33","0","0"

WOW. Where do I begin? The game offers so many options in such an early stage, it almost feels complete! However, it is not. Since this is an Early Access review, it will be wrote as such.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom\n\nGameplay\n7 Days To Die, in my opinion, is a good cross between what DayZ could have been, with Minecrafts building mechanics and crafting, overhauled. From time to time, the controls can be a bit clunky, swaying around in a direction you hadn't intended. Mocap hasn't been integrated yet so walking, running, and other physical motions are dry.  It is however, very polished, and does not interfere with playability. The game itself handles fine on any well equipped PC.\n\nUI & Visuals\nOptions don't boast too many options in terms of video settings just yet, but offer enough to allow you to tune it to run either performance or quality. It isn't recommended to run it in ultra high settings (unless you can handle it of course), but at a mid point to save yourself from the lag in clustered POI's like cities, neighborhoods, and possible player built settlements.\n\nThe best part visual wise out of the whole thing is that the entire world is smooth. Everything looks natural and polished, and breaks and modifys just like any other voxel game. It is a learning curve to get used to it if you're just coming in from Minecraft, cause the angles of the ground, cliffs, rocks, etc can be offset looking sometimes, but it looks great and plays fine. The worlds themselves keep getting better and better looking with each update. As of Alpha 10.4, this game already looks wonderful. With the right tweaks, its is a place full of wildlife, and the undead.\n\nThe UI is nice. It has changed a few times in the course of Alpha 7 through 10, but overall is sleek and very efficient, showing you just your essential meters, belt, and compass. The Day and time count are small enough to be out of the way, and still legible. Nothing sticks out in a manner that would block peripherals, so you get full view of whats in front and next to you.\n\nMechanics\nThe mechanics to the game in general are fantastic. The crafting is what keeps me coming back time and time again. There are literally hundreds of recipes to choose from, and if that's not enough, you can make your own recipes out of items you couldn't normally craft! The community is good at coming up with unique ways to make the not so useful items useful again, and adding the recipes are as easy and copy and paste.\n\nThere are some glitches and errors that can be frustrating when crafting. At times, the forge will "eat" your materials, so that 534lb of Iron? yeah, it's gone. The same thing happens with the campfire.\n\nThere have also been times the zombies warp through the walls, and hordes end up inside our fortified prefab house. this doesn't seem to happen with player built bases.\n\nStructural integrity is the game changer. There will be no more building massive structures in 15 minutes. You actually have to think about placement. One wrong move, and half, or even all of your building will collapse. It creates ways to make traps, and take down players bases. It's really cool to watch the bricks rain down! It would be nice to see them fall over in a more realistic motion, but that will come in due time.\n\nZombies are pretty terrifying when setup to spawn in large groups. I play the role of a bandit, so my first habit is to try and set up in the wasteland. What might be done quickly in the plains or forest is damn near impossible to do in the wasteland biome. I remember the days of sitting inside the corner of a small 6x8 shack, listening to the hordes whisper and screech in the night as they run by chasing the animals. The fear was real at that point.\n\nSound\nThe sounds at first can be frightening, which is a good thing. You get that pump of adernaline when hearing the scream of a Spider zombie or a Zombie Cop bubbling up puke. But after a while the sounds become recycled. You might even notice some sounds from other games used. However, Snow zombies will never get old. That sound will haunt you in your sleep.\n\n\nOverall, I rate this game, in its current state, a good 7.5/10. The bugs need to be fixed, cause some of them can cause frustrated players to just quit, and it diminishes the replay value. Pathing is still another thing to consider, but it just tests your FPS skills for the time being :)\n\nWith my overall hours, I highly recommend this game. With future workshop support, Mods, and a great community follow up, this is one game that is sure to remembered by all Z fans for a long time.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros\n+Good pace of zombie action\n+dozens of different block styles to design your base with\n+Lots of loot to find\n+100's of recipes to craft\n+Creepy atmosphere (Crying wasteland babies)\n+Future Workshop and Mod support\n+Devs are friendly, engaging, and listen to the community\n\nCons\n-Hackers on mainstream open servers\n-Random little glitches\n-Zombies run through prefabs from time to time\n-unoptimized for low end PC's\n-Pathfinding on Zombies and Zombie Dogs is poor\n-Physics are poor\n\nOverall: 7.5/10","June 19, 2014","true","864.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Here's the elevator speech:\n\nIs it a Day Z clone?  Yeah, sure.  It's what Day Z could have been if it wasn't abandonwear.  The developers are very active and release updates constantly.\nIs it a Minecraft clone?  Sure, you could say that too.  It takes some of the best features of Minecraft and implements them well.  Yes, as others have said, it is a Day Z meets Minecraft love child, in all the right ways.  The crafting system is deep, tons of loot and a vast variety of it.  Lots and lots of building options as well.\nNow to address some of the ugly stuff a few negative reviewers have said.  Yes, the game is rough around the edges.  It is and ALPHA.  Sometimes things will happen, for better or worse, due to error.  Sometimes it's tragic, sometimes it works to your advantage, sometimes it's just hilarious, but when you play this game, you need to know you're playing an alpha.  Yes, some of the textures are ugly.  Yes, there are balance issues.  Yes, some features are less than reliable.  That all being said, this is the best alpha I've ever played, and it is always getting better.\nIt is also true that there is a learning curve.  Just like any game with deep crafting, building, etc... because there is a lot you CAN do, there are a lot of things to know.  Most of it is pretty intuitive, but you will find yourself reading forums and the wiki alot.  It's just that kind of game.\nI've been reading about rude moderators in the forums.  I don't know much about that, I jump in to find an answer to a question I have and jump right back out.  That may or may not be true, but at the end of the day, it doesn't make the game any less fun.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  If you like open world survival/crafting games, this is the best one of the lot, and I've played them all.  Better than RUST, better than DAY Z.  WAY better than all the other abandonwear and halfassed rip offs in this genre that polute the Steam store.  Is this a clone?  Yeah, it is.  But it's one of those rare clones that's better than it's own inspiration.","July 17, 2015","true","133.6"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","25","39","2","1"

Equipped with only your head & hands you must survive in a pocket of habitable land surrounded by blasted rubble & irradiated wastelands.   To make matters worse, the radiation has mutated a common flu bug into a terrifying disease capable of raising the dead.  Can you survive?\n\nFirst & foremost you must become a scavenger, loot every item you see. Pick up every rock, feather, stick, or scrap of metal you find, every item has a use.  You will need tools, if you happen to spawn close to a road carefully check for vehicles to loot.\n\nThere are usually also zombies around cars, don’t let your guard down.   If you are lucky you may find a tool or weapon, regardless you should construct a stone axe.  It may be crude, but it is the best multi-purpose tool at the start.  It can be used to dig holes, chop trees, break boulders and in a pinch can also bash in the head of an attacking zombie.  Once you have a home, it can be used to repair blocks.\n\nHow do you survive the menacing zombie horde?  Running away is always the safest option, but sometimes you have to stand and fight. What would Darryl do?  (WWDD?) Darryl would find a crossbow, or better yet MAKE One. This is where all those sticks & stones you've been picking up are going to come in handy. While you can find feathers in rubbish piles, loot  birds nests, AS they often have eggs, which you can eat - preferably cooked.  All the foods you cook can also be eaten raw, if you don’t mind at bit of food poisoning, which is preferable to starving.  If you have full or high health, and a water supply the food poisoning wont kill you, just make life uncomfortable.  Same thing with Diarrhea from drinking murky water.\n\nIn later versions of the game these will impact your "wellness" which most likely will affect things like movement and loot speed, as well as how long it takes to break blocks and zombie skulls.\n\nNow that you have a silent & deadly weapon, and a crude but effective tool, its time to start thinking about the future.  You can stealth to avoid zombies, and gather materials more efficiently with your stone axe.  Boulders can be broken & trees chopped to provide more sticks and stones, this is safer than wandering around gathering, and the zombies don’t seem to be alerted to the sounds.\n\nIf you have a decent melee weapon & full stamina, you can chase down a pig & beat it to death.  This will also alert every zombie in the vicinity to your presence, be prepared to run!   Rabbits are easier to kill, one hit with your crossbow will mean instant death if you can get one to stop moving long enough.  Bucks are the best, from a long distance you can often shoot one 3 or 4 times and it won’t even run.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you skin the animal, find a place to store the meat, even if you have to place a box on the ground & mark the location, its better than carrying it around attracting all the walkers in the area.  With few small stones and some sticks, and you can cook the meat & make a quick meal.\n\n\nTo move beyond subsistence level you need two items that can be a challenge to obtain, but once you have them your, future is assured. First thing is a short Iron Pipe, which allows you to build a forge, and clay to make molds for it.  Pipes can often be found in stoves & air conditioners,  if you aren't near a building, a blasted ruins may contain a toilet which you can break it to get a pipe.   Clay is found near rivers & lakes, or you can use corn meal!  If you are nowhere near any building, just keep searching. Some zombies may drop a pipe when killed if you can, loot any that you kill.  Follow any road you find, eventually you will find a gas station.\n\nBefore it gets dark, you MUST find shelter.  Wandering in the dark will get you killed.  If you happen to have a light source, it will attract them, and at night zombies are far more feral.  Find & fortify a house, or in a pinch dig a hole * crawl inside.  Night time is best used crafting, forging metals & boiling water.  Try not to make too much noise even if hidden indoors at night, as zombies sense your presence.   In fact they will often try to smash their way into your shelter even if you are completely undetected.  Make sure you have an exit for such an eventuality.\n\nIt has been my experience that every SEVEN DAYS there is a massive night raid, if you do not have sturdy walls they will get in.  Reinforced concrete walls, metal reinforced wood, or lots & lots of stone between you and any entry point are your only protection on those nights.   Be prepared to conduct extensive repairs once the sun rises.\n\nWhat comes next?  Scout the countryside & gather better supplies, having guns & ammo will make your life much simpler, and make your forays into the urban wilderness much less terminal.  The ultimate survival tool can be found if you locate any abandoned military outposts & loot the munitions boxes that they usually contain.  Having a 44 Magnum and a Sniper rifle make the experience even enjoyable!   With a submachine gun, you can decimate the largest feral horde.","October 17, 2014","true","646.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","1"

I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the developers thats for sure.\n\nThe new patch has rendered a once great game unplayable.  Granted, I like the new gameplay changes, what I don't like is how I can't enjoy online multiplayer anymore.  The latency and frame rate is unbearable.  You will get drops to 1-5 fps anytime more then 3 zombies enter on screen.  More then that?  Forget about it, you'll be dead before your game unfreezes.  It seems they spent more time on their new motion capture zombies that they are so proud of rather then spending time optimizing performance.  This is of course running the game on the lowest settings possible, making the game look like it jumped right out of 2001.  This causes their new HD zombies to stand out even more, since they clash with the low res environment. The lag is unbearable, try as many servers as you might, its all the same deal and everyone has this issue.\n\nIts funny because I was playing the game right before a13 dropped.  It was running fine.  Then I try to jump on that same server after the update and it had the framerate of a polaroid camera.  It was unplayable.  Of course I didnt get to enjoy that long as I was now being kicked for ping.  This is of course less then half an hour after I was playing on that same server just fine, no lag, no framerate drops.\n\nThe best part is the fanbase and official forums.  Having an issue with the game?  Don't bother reporting it.  If it isn't a posted consisting of nothing but praise for the gods that The Fun Pimps, you will be ravenously attacked by the fanboys.   All the resultings posts will insist that their version of the game runs flawlessly and that it must be your fault.  That is if you aren't banned immediately for daring to not get on your knees and pray to the devs.\n\nAs you can see I actually like this game alot, I have over 300 hours logged.  Its one of, or rather was one of my favorite games.  Now I can't even play it.\n\nSave your money.  If after 7 months of waiting for an update they honestly couldn't test this update and see how poorly it ran then they really don't deserve your money.  Even if they delayed the update for another year I would tolerate that so long as I could actually play it.  Instead they kept giving release dates, which they shouldn't have, kept failing to meet said release dates, then rushed out a broken mess.\n\n10/10 guys","December 18, 2015","false","621.5"," 47 of 80 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","47","80","6","8"

A minecraft like shooter with zombies. What more could someone want? While the game is in alpha stage, it still has a lot to offer. There's a large list of things I could talk about, but I don't want to write a book. Essentially the game is minecraft with zombies. However, compared to some other free roam games out there, you are very limited to what you can explore. Additionally, the things you can find get very boring once you have explored enough. Another thing to keep in mind when looking at this game is the lack of objective. If you are someone who needs a goal, this won't satisfy you very much. Its more of a sandbox as of now. Something else that I consider very important when buying this game is to make sure you have some pals to play it with. You will find yourself bored VERY quickly when playing alone. Also, the online community isnt the greatest, so I would not put your trust into that.\n\nTL;DR - The game is pretty good for the money, while it has its flaws, its only in alpha. Before you purchase, make sure you have some friends to play with and watch some gameplay videos.","January 3, 2014","true","108.5"," 153 of 277 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","153","277","0","6"

The game simply doesn't seem ready to me, granted I only played it for 2 hours so take that with a grain of salt, but overall I really wasn't impressed.\n\n*All water is basically a pitch black hole of "Iainttouchinthat" I expect it to get fixed at some point, after all, it's Alpha\n\n*The one deer I tried to hunt didn't give the slightest **** whatsoever when I shot him in the head with a hunting rifle, 6 times, or when I chased him around and beat him with a stick after said 6x headshot,\n\n*I killed a bunny and got 3 skinned bunnies(ok)\n\n*Night is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, pitch black, can't see a thing(to be expected) but there's no way to sleep through it and if zombies are out there, they will find you, and they will ♥♥♥♥ you, brutally, mercilessly, and without fail. Torches provide "some" light but you need to get quite a few for it to be workable, which is difficult at times, depending mostly on luck.\n\n*No idea what to do regarding zombies, since they apparentaly have been blessed by Hercules and can fistpunch through stone/wood/iron because rotting flesh appears to be in a strength league of its own, again, expected to be changed/fixed at some point. But I'm skeptical on whether or not I should bother to make and defend a house if some scrub tier zombie is going to punch through iron to eat me. Like.. srsly guise y u do this.\n\n*I bought and played this game after checking out the video proclaiming skill trees, when I logged in, no skill trees, looked it up, and no word on them even being implemented at all. Ok, -10 points to Gryffindor.. expected to be fixed at some point.\n\n*Despite the game registering things in blocks, it's very difficult to gauge how large a "block" actually is, Hopefully an option to display block lines is released at some point.\n\n*Food and water are fairly easy to obtain by simply grabbing blueberry bushes, because those appear to be all over the freakin map regardless of biome/animal habits, but other than blueberries, wildlife food source is a serious pain to get ahold of and I'm not sure where else to get water other than looting, because I'm damn sure not touching one of those black hole lakes no doubt spawned by Satan himself.\n\n*No "lock in" option when making games, allowing you to easily get frusterated, log out, change settings, and go back in, which may be fun for some people but for me, if the temptation to brb and return with a missile launcher overrides my "punching 40 zombies PITA meter" well, there goes a good challenge.\n\n*This is the biggest pain in the ♥♥♥ of them all, and is without a doubt the #1 cause of my "would not recommend" attitude. Flying. ♥♥♥♥ing. Zombie. Bees. I **** you not I'm sitting in a tent, with 20 torches everywhere, seeing all zombies coming at me, casually taking them out with guns/fist/knife/stick/w.e I feel like, and I hear this satanic buzzing, my only thought is "you've gotta be kidding me" No, the game does not kid, there are giant ♥♥♥ hornets the size of my dog flying around being annoying and of course attacking you. Know what the fun part is? Regardless of torches, you can't see them at night unless you have light going UP. Overwhelming zombies? Ok, Zombies eat through metal? wtf? I guess I can do that, Zombies run? Spit? Climb? Take 50 punches to kill? Ok. Flying zombie hornets? Nope **** this goodbye ~-~)p\n\nAlot more I'd like to point out but this review feels overly long as it is, the game itself sounds great, but as of the time of posting it's a bit sketchy for me, considering the fact that it's alpha I can look past it, however I feel as though the game is not CURRENTLY in a position that I'd recommend anyone to play.\n\nOverall I think it has potential to become an amazing game, but too many disappointments(coughskilltrees), ruined pants(WHY IS IT FLYING), and bugs(I hope that holetosatan water is a bug anyways) and lack of realism(tankdeer, punching through metal/stone with rotting flesh/etc) make it currently unappealing. I will, of course, check back with the game after a few updates and play it some more, maybe forcing a few hours in early(zombies.. o,..,,o) This is a game worth keeping your eyes on, but not currently playing, could easily be one the best games of the century!","March 2, 2014","false","3.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Dev's are active, and the game is still under development and it gets broken periodically. Overall - 6.5/10\n\nLong version:\n\nPros:\n- Very well done apocolypse sim\n- As of last update, one of the better crafting systems I've seen\n- Pretty easy to pick up and learn\n- Graphics are overall pretty good, and improving as development goes on\n- Dev's are somewhat active in the community, updates are somewhat regular\n- Motion captured zombies are neat\n- Minecraft-esque building, but with physics (see other thoughts)\n- Randomly generated maps\n- Pretty decent dedicated servers now\n- Really doesn't need that much PC horsepower to be playable\n- Weapon selection is broad enough for most to find a good weapon they prefer to use\n\nCons:\n- Minecraft-esque building, but with physics (see other thoughts)\n- Melee combat is a bit broken\n- Climate system is currently buggy\n- Dev's have a nasty habit of half-implementing features (Sorry TFP, but you KNOW you do...)\n- Frequent server wipes with some updates (see other thoughts)\n- A lot of new features, not a lot of new content (see other thoughts)\n\nOther thoughts:\nThis game has potential to really be fantastic. I've logged over 500 hours playing it since I purchased it shortly after it hit greenlight. I loved it then, I still love it, but I don't play it anywhere near as much these days. The majority of the negativity I feel toward the game is not the game itself, but to some of the way the game has been developed.\n\nThe minecraft-esque building is really great, except the physics of it can be a bit flaky. There isn't a lot of warning when your house on stilts is going to start collapsing, until  your floor falls apart when you walk on it. I would like to see that fixed somehow, although I don't know what a good way to do that would be. It's a good system, and with the most recent updates, pretty solid.\n\nThe maps are randomly generated, and have been significantly improved since first introduced. That said, they're still broken too. The caves are cool, but they currently don't always generate properly, or you will see a building which collapses the second you try to walk inside. Overall, still highly playable. What does cause issues though is digging / mining. The terrain does not always recalculate properly, which leads to "outcroppings" that you can't walk past, until you place and remove a block there then it recalculates and is fine.\n\nThe reason I don't play the game much is the developers, The Fun Pimps. Overall, they are great, and doing a good job with the game as a whole. When you take a closer look at the development however, they've done some things that I found and still find annoying.\n\nA major example of this is half implementing features. Now a lot of you may read this and say things like "it's a green light game, what did you expect?" or "you're being too critical, back off" and while to an extent, both are true, but also false. This game is and has been fully playable for quite awhile now, so to me, it's in development in the same sense that Minecraft is still in development, meaning it's a working, playable, functional game, that keeps getting new features and content. What is a bit of a problem with that though, is that in one update, they will "set up" for features in the next. A few very specific examples of this come to mind:\n\n- Mini bikes (which are sweet!) - but you cut the player movement speed in half in an update that came out about 3 months before the mini bikes did\n\n- Constant screwing with the terrain generation / cave generation / etc - but every time you "fix it" you have to wipe the server, and quite honestly, the routine is getting old, especially when things are still broken with it.\n\n- Skill trees (which are interesting) - now you gain experience for doing stuff. Cool feature, very similar to Ark: Survival Evolved in the sense of how XP is earned, but it currently doesn't much beyond improve crafting quality and loot chance at high level. Important, but apparently a "class system" is coming. A prime example of what I am talking about. Wait, do it all, then push it out\n\n- Climate / freezing / over-heating - Cool idea, again, works somewhat similar to Ark, but broken. REALLY broken. How am I over-heating when I'm under water, in a lake? It's been acknowledged as broken.\n\n- The Rocket Launcher (since fixed) was removed because it didn't work right following a major update...\n\n- Tungsten doors were deemed too strong and removed. Took a LONG time for their replacements to show up...\n\n- Acknowledging <INSERT FEATURE HERE> is horribly broken and will be fixed - I admit, to an extent I am being hard on TFP here, but I'm also being honest. Between the "we know it's broken and we'll fix it, but hey look at this other new thing!" statements, then after major update releases the game is typically broken to varying degrees, which again, I do understand happens, and with a lot of regularity, but I also feel like if the dev's backed off the throttle on the hype-train a little, and took a bit more time in testing and fixing their releases, the player experience would be even better, especially players who have owned the game for a long time.\n\nThe server wiping updates are a huge reason I don't play much anymore. I've dealt with the stretches where server wiping was a regular monthly or bi-monthly cycle, and right around the time you got back to where you were prior to the last wipe, "Hey all, new patch. Wipe your servers, loose your stuff again. Sorry!" then rinse, wash, and repeat, when in reality, I am pretty sure they could iterate through the chunks and regenerate them with a secondary utility, so that server wiping wasn't mandatory, or minimally, give admins a way to preserve player inventory, skills (as of now), etc. because for me, right now, I'm done dealing with it.\n\nA lot of the new features which have been added are cool, once they're polished up. The mini bike, the skill system, the new resource collection, zombie stun, UI revamp, have all been overall positive additions, or minimally, look promising. New content however, has been nil for quite awhile. Yes, they've added better graphics, which do look good, they've improved the weather system, finally added some weapons, etc. But the end game is still basically same as it was a year ago. It just takes longer than it did.I understand gating a lot of the crafting, and making things take longer (gasoline and forges are prime examples), but once you build a solid base with enough of a defense (admittedly, the defense requirements have gotten significantly higher), a garden for food, and a forge to make ammo, that's it. You've done everything you need to, now you can go mess with zombies or other players. Now again, you may say "it's a green light game" or "it's still in development" and again, I get it, and to that I say "Fair enough, except they aren't developing new content." The overall end game hasn't changed much since Alpha 10, except for the amount of time it takes to get to that point, which to a lesser extent, I agree with because there was a point where once you had a beaker, an auger, and corn, you could have a fully established base in about 4 real world hours if you knew what you were doing.\n\nAll of that said, and yes, I know how harsh I was, I still support the game and I do still overall recommend the game. Personally though, I am done until it's done, or minimally, not broken.","December 31, 2015","true","639.5"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","29","47","0","0"

Though I've never played it fully in singleplayer, that's probably the best way to go, or on a secure private server well monitored by mods and admins.\nI spent weeks building far away from noob spawn in a tungsten base.  Next I set up a base at hub city/noob spawn covered by over 64 claim blocks.  Once a cheater found it would be incredibly hard to break into my base, they just reassigned all claim blocks to themselves, taking ownership of my base.  Thus, weeks of effort are easily wiped out in a matter of seconds by individuals with no integrity. :p  What's the point in keeping interested in a game so exploitable?  Guess I'm forced to stay way out in fringes.  Kind of makes the point moot. (PvP server, btw.)\nSo while I recommend it, in concept, your experience may vary.

They clustered on the north wall until they broke through, climbing over each other's corpses.  At least I could see them better this time with the torches I'd placed.  I picked off some with arrows, but I should've used my meager supply of bullets.  In the end they surrounded me from the inner staircase and the 2nd floor balcony.  They chewed through the wall, the doors, and even halfway into the foundation, though the building's still structurally sound.\n\nGoals for next week: forge a pickaxe and start an escape tunnel from my base to the natural cavern I found earlier.  Mine for iron in the process.  Add another layer of spikes around the base and repair/strengthen the walls.  Stretch goal: start a garden with the corn & potatoes I've scavenged.\n\n***\n\nHere's the thing.  The zombies are coming in 7 days, and every week they get stronger.  So while there's a big world to explore and it may seem downright tranquil now, you'd better be one focused taskmasker if you're going to be prepared in time.\n\nYou'll go back and forth between nomadic and sedentary life.  You'll start out punching grass, and charring that pig you clubbed to death over a campfire (if you don't have to devour it raw that is).  You'll progress, hopefully, until you're sitting pretty in your reinforced bunker, dining on bear stew and blueberry pie.\n\nYou'll likely always be desperate for something, be it clean water, medicine, building material, metals, or that one part you need to make a gun.  Missing any one of these for long can be fatal, because everything connects with everything else.  The crafting is intuitive, and makes good use of the materials available.  For instance, when you kill an animal, you can get meat, fat, bone, and hide.  Each of these is useful for something very different, and while you may have an excess of some stuff, you'll be wise to never throw things away if you have the space.\n\nThe game is forgiving enough without being too forgiving.  By default, when you die you can respawn on or near your bed, and all your stuff is in your backpack where you died.  However, once in a while my backpack disappears and I lose some of my best stuff (bug?).  In multiplayer you'll have to defend yourself from other survivors, who are craftier at getting to you and your stuff.  But land claim blocks and locks are meant to alleviate this.  I've only played single player and with friends, so I can't say how good or bad PvP may be.","August 12, 2015","true","287.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

I'm not worthy! I'm not worthy!\n\nNo seriously, this game is excellent. For being an alpha game still under heavy development, it is fun. Several friends and I have made a few multiplayer servers to play on for days to weeks at a time. The developers are very active in the community with the players. While they do have a planned agenda, they do accept ideas from the players or suggestions and incorporate them into the game. This game will also be open for players to mod.\n\nWhile the graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, they aren't too shabby and they are friendly to low-end PC's. There are still a lot of bugs to be fixed. The content at the moment is a little limited in terms of building materials and the different types of buildings/structures that you encounter. However, they are consistently adding new content. I expect the finished product game to be nothing like the alpha I started playing a few months ago (for better or worse).\n\nGameplay is survival horror rpg. You start with nothing and build your way up to having consistent food, water, weapons, and shelter. Alternatively, you could be a nomad and live off of the buildings and structures you encounter on your journey. Either way, beware of the 7 day night horde. Health, stamina, hunger, thirst, and general wellness are all taken into account while playing. Negative things such as becoming infected by a zombie, broken legs, dysentery, and bleeding out are all things that you will have to deal with during your travels.\n\nThe zombies in this game are a force to be reckoned with. During the day, they are slow and can be dealt with individually if one is careful. If one becomes alert to your presence, many in the area will soon come to investigate. Fighting one zombie can easily turn into running away from fifteen. When the sun sets, the game becomes a whole new animal. Since the zombies run full speed at night, things can be absolutely terrifying. The sheer suspense of hearing the zombies search for you at night can be unnerving. Or the times where you are looting a house and you accidentally slam the cabinet doors in the kitchen only to realize that they heard you and they are coming.\n\nDid you ever wish that a game like Minecraft had formidable enemies that would smell you, hear you, and hunt you?Enemies that will dismantle your base and annihilate you if you didn't take proper precautions to protect yourself? That is this game.","May 13, 2015","true","274.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The concepts are somewhat new, and this is what makes it enjoyable, but because of the lack of content, the joy rapidly diminishes in the first few hours. The game is too pricy at this point in developement. I believe the price should be around 15$. Here are a few specific reasons why:\n\n1. There is only one map, and although its quite big, most of it is just terrain rather than interactive.(unless you consider dirt and trees interactive)\n2. Not enough crafting. There are an awesome amount of weapons, but the traps, tools and building blocks are lacking in variety. The game features farming, but there are only 3 different plants.\n3. Bugs and glitches. Sometimes creatures are stil spawning in thoroughly lit areas. When mining, the blocks sometimes fly out, or fall into space occupied by another block, meaning it cannot be accessed directly without removing the other block. When looking for multiplayer servers, it does not correctly display the current number of players in the server.\n4. Spawn trapping. When you dont have any weapons or beds,  and you die during the night, it is almost impossible to do anything without waiting till daytime. The zombies run at you and deal relatively massive amounts of damage, and they also spawn in waves.\n5. Lack of instructorial information. The interface is initally difficult to decipher, and the lack of any tips reduces our learning to nothing more than just clicking a button and waiting to see if it does anything.","January 1, 2014","false","54.6"," 232 of 426 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","232","426","0","8"

First off is the fact that the enemies pose so much of a threat, that it really encourages cooperation. This game is a must to play with friends. There's something really satisfying about building up your defenses, setting up traps, and then fighting together to survive the night. It's something that Minecraft hints at, and Fortnite promises (if it ever gets released), but this game delivers.\n\nThe PvP features are a bit lacking and, being an early access alpha title, there are quite a few missing features, bugs, glitches, and security issues. Cheats and hacks are still a problem on public servers. However, as a co-op base building / tower defense / horde survival type game, this one is tough to beat.\n\n7 Days to Die is a genuinely fun game, blending the crafting, building, and destructibility aspects of Minecraft with the over-the-top frenzied action of Serious Sam or Dungeon Defenders, where the enemies come at you in almost overwhelming numbers. It's already a blast to play, and continues to get better and better with each new patch. If this is what they've managed to come up with for an alpha release, I can't wait to find out what the finished product will look like.\n\nDon't let the haters fool you, look at how much time the positive reviewers have put into this game.

It's overly complex with all kinds of menus and systems for crafting that make it take half an hour just to try to accomplish the simplest of tasks.

I have eagerly awaited every update thus far and will play the game now and in the future.\n\nSome people say that this game is too difficult and favors veteran players. There are many possible difficulty levels available for players to choose from, so if you feel that the game is too difficult, you can simply lower the constraints to accomodate yourself. Loot can respawn more often, airdrops can come more quickly and zombies can be made weaker. 7DTD is not just geared toward veteran players - every game ever created would then be geared towards people who have played longer; that's just simple logic. Playing longer makes you better, and if you're new, put the difficulty at lowest.\n\nIf you found bugs in the game and you posted them on the forums, I commend you and think it's unfortunate that your good intents were met with hostility. You did your part in reporting bugs and then some, but forum moderators can make mistakes independent of the development team. Bugs will be fixed in due time, issues will be sorted out, and the forums are not integral in your ability to play and enjoy the game. I usually avoid forums in the first place, but I'm sorry that this had to happen to some of you anyway.\n\nI also would like to remind potential players of this game that everyone will have their own opinions, but it's important to formulate your own. I was not hesitant in buying the game at all because I like voxel games and zombie survival.

Why? You don't have to play with others if you don't want to, you don't have to worry about a hacker killing you and taking all your loot. Glitches/errors/things that got over looked, get fixed pretty fast. WarZ on the other hand, the bugs wouldn't get fixed in the next patch, no they're fool around with something like Loot spawns first... Yes I like WarZ but they waste a lot of time other less important things within the game, like remaking Colorado, when there are more pressing things that need to be fixed.\nEver patch, so far has improved the game. 1.1 was you started your game, you had no choice of what you gonna be man or woman, nothing. You had no option of the level of difficulty, the option to make how long the day and night cycles run, or is the Zombies could run (in the dark, all day long, or not at all). You couldn't start a game and make it public, or private, control the number of people allowed in. You could only make so many things, from then, now they've added so much more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rizzano/recommended/251570/","rizzano","Rizzano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rizzano/","143 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've played quite a few zombie survival games and even non-zombie survival games, and the one game that rises above them all, alpha stage or not, is 7 Days to Die.  While it does, at times, get a tad on the boring side still traversing the map looking for points of interest and taking several in game hours to find them, and while it does get a tad monotonous finding the same 2-4 houses time and time again, everything else pretty much falls into place.\n\nDon't get me wrong, every alpha game has it's glitches and bugs, and that's why it's alpha, but you don't see 7 Days to Die "starting over" like some other games out there *cough rust cough*, or being only playable enough to craft about 5 things and that's it.  There are only two alpha games I have ever bought where I did not regret it, and that is this one, and Factorio. (check it out via google. It's not on Steam.)\n\nNow on to specifics.\n\nFirst, environment. More specifically, audio. For me, I always choose to play with music off, so I can't comment on any music, however I do remember the 7 Days to Die menu theme to be prety catchy. I will say that this is the ONLY game I have ever played where I have literally jumped or felt actual fear when playing. Some people have felt that while playing F.E.A.R., Slenderman, or other games, but I really didn't. This one however, when I am looting a house, and I hear snarling, drooling, barking, vomiting, groaing, screaming, breaking wood, breaking glass, breaking concrete, and metal being hit, all at the same time, and I can turn around and not tell where all the sounds are coming from, it gets pretty scary.  And let me tell you, when you can't get inside somewhere safe at night and those zombies and dogs are running at you and you can barely see, that, my friend, is pretty darn terrifying. I don't get scared by much, The Fun Pimps do a good elicting the fear emotion out of me when playing this game.\n\nI do love the "AHA" moments of the random generaed maps now as well when I DO discover new things. Like the first time I discovered twin factories, I stood in amazement and thought of all the wonderful things to do with it. I tried making a base out of it but discovered it was much too large to defend alone, but it sure was fun trying.  Or the first time I discovered a non-center city on the map, or got my final magnum part. Those were pretty cool moments for me.  Sure, one could turn on creative mode and just give yourself those things, but that takes the fun out of it when you are working together with 4-5 other people and you are the first on your server to craft a magnum, or to find a factory, or something like that. Those moments happen for everyone.\n\nThe zombie pathing and A.I. is a bit glitchy, but they are fixing that soon in 9.2, so I won't talk much about that, but it is annoying.\n\nThere are little weird things like destroying cement ramps outside of a parking garage and getting wood planks as a result, or being able to plant trees on roads. Nothing major, but still there.\n\nGraphically, this game is amazing. I only started playing about 2 days before 9.0, so I never saw the game personally when it was more cubed, but what I saw in videos, the smoothing of the world is a big step up. I never knew this was a voxel game until I read it.\n\nPlaystyle is great, I wouldn't change a thing,\n\nCrafting is also great. There are so many things you can make, but I do feel there should be a few more things, such as the medicine cabinet, wall safe, and wall lights. I think those should be craftable. Maybe they will be in a future patch, I don't know.\n\nI don't know much more to say, other than all I really see are improvements from the makers, and they continue to do so. I haven't seen anything about adding fishing to the game, so I hope that is a plan at some point. Maybe it was a future stretch goal that didn't get met.\n\nUPDATED REVIEW: Alpha 13.8: I STILL highly recommend this game. It keeps getting better and better. Sure there are new bugs and still some old ones, but the developer team is small so they can only do so much. And it's still Alpha, so you are basically testing the game while playing.\n\nThe new UI and Crafting system is great in my opinion. I see a lot of people with 1000+ hours say they hate A13, that it ruined the game and would no longer recommend it, but I am of the opposite. A13, IMO, made the game better. And A14 is around the corner and is going to have perks, an introductory quest, and much needed fixes and optimizations. You CANNOT go wrong buying this game, and as of this edit, it is HALF OFF!","September 2, 2014","true","296.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

I must admit i was fearing for this game to turn out like the crappy Day Z or something like that, but the way this game has turned out is truly remarkable. It is so good i even bought a copy for my younger brother just to support the development team. Why is it good you ask? Well, the game contains key features regarding the freeworld, survival, RPG genres, which for example is interactive wellness needs (food, water, medication etc.) and extremely detailed building recipes and such, example: you cut down a tree, create planks, create wooden frame, fortify wooden frame, reinforces = zombie proof. This might sound like a lot of micromanagement but i assure you, it is not. You are always active while playing this game, always looking for ways to get better guns or better resources to fortify your magnificent Fort Knox of Reinforced concrete with a 100 meter deep trench......... With some wooden spikes in the bottom of course.\n\nIn short, most amazing game ever with the greatest potential i have witnessed.\n\nSorry for the long post steam-community here is a little song to cheer you up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ","December 29, 2014","true","79.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

This game, however, is definitely proving worth the cost.  It's only in Alpha 9.3 as of this writing, but it's already better quality than many "finished" games I've seen.\nI think the best way to describe the feel of this game is to walk you through a brief chapter of my most recent game.  I found a building made out of stone, and decided that it would be a good place to try to fortify.  An overhang on the second floor blocked line-of-sight to the front of the door for anyone standing on top of the house.  I knew that was a major weakness; once the zombies get to the door, I would have no way of killing them without losing my last line of defence.  I decide to try to use the cinderblocks that are lying all around to construct another wall around the house, built in such a way that I can shoot down on the zombies trying to break through it.  Less than an eighth of the way through building my wall, I look up and can't even see the end of the line of zombies coming at me.\nMy weapons are limited.  I have a crossbow, but it reloads so slowly that I'll only be able to take down three or so zombies before they get to me.  My sledgehammer can kill a zombie with one well-placed strike, but going into melee range with a horde that side would be suicide.  I've got about 100 rounds for a handgun, it's my only choice.  Taking careful aim to ensure headshots, I take down a half-dozen zombies.  More and more keep coming; I retreat up to the balcony.  I know that once the zombies get under the balcony, I won't be able to stop them from reaching me on the porch, but I reinforced the door, so I should be safe for a minute or two.  I try to pick off as many zombies as I can before they can hide under the balcony.  Once the end of the horde arrived, I knew that about ten have made it to the door.  I go downstairs to see how the door's holding up.  Luckily for me, the zombies aren't organized.  Some are trying to break down the windows, some are going for the door.  None of them have gotten a full breach yet.  I return to the balcony, trying to see if I can take down a few more before the wall is breached.  Some of the zombies notice me up top, and try to destroy a support column for the balcony.    This leaves them in a vulerable position, I take a few more down.  I hear breaking glass.  Trying to line up another shot, I fall off of the balcony.  There's still six zombies left, and they're all headed straight for me.  I open fire on them while backpedaling, hoping that there aren't more undead behind me.\n\nWith the carnage over, I repair the ground floor.  Night is coming soon, and I won't be able to finish the perimeter walls before sunset.  Time to see if I can cobble together the last part I need to build a shotgun.  If a horde visits me tonight, that Beretta won't save me.","November 3, 2014","true","65.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Lets do this in parts, its such a mental mess i will have to make an effort to keep focus.\n\nI used to like this game very much, yeah you read right, about over a year ago the game was good and kinda fun . I was ignorant and everything was promissing . Then, some day, they somehow managed to ruin what made the game "fun" and turned it into a massive pointless grind. It was such a pointless grind before, but lets say the grind was optional and was about working your ♥♥♥ to build. Now its becoming a refilling gauges simulator. Lets talk about these overlapping grinds, and the ones to be added "soon for sure":\n\n-Wellness grind. Its basically some mechanic they brough up from their arses to make the game artificially harder and "longer". The concept is simple. You start with half the HP and stamina a normal person would have and you have to gain your way to "being a healthy  person". Abusing game mechanics will increase it quickly, making it pointless once you abuse them enough, Dying will decrease it. A pointless grind that will just make you go nuts for how crippled your character seems to be at the start and also makes pvp not so desirable, but not only that, once you "grind it" its completely out of place and have no meaning. As game mechanic to add "content" as it was sold, its value as feature= 1/10.\n\n-Level Grind: At this point, you get level in 2 ways. Killing zombies and crafting junk. Yeah, its just that, gaining levels will allow  you to do stuff of higher quality. And this is where the thing becomes complex. They have mixed this level grind with the crafting quality and the chances of getting good stuff from containers aka "leveled loot". This is a funny mechanic for a coop/multiplayer game that leads to lame metagaming. So the level's grindl works for both crafting and looting.... but that is today coz in the next patch they will add another super awesome layer of grinding:\n\n-Skill leveling grind (the new kid of the block). Yeah, you read right. As it wasnt tiresome enough before, thy come with the nice idea of adding another 20 grinds on top, which isnt bad actually, if they had really added new mechanics or exciting stuff that made you level while just having fun, but that doesnt seem to be the case. You will be doing basically the same stuff you have done in the 12 alphas before but this time trying to fill another 20 more "gauges" so you can "improve". I really fail to see the "survival aspect here". The main diference is, i had to kill 3000 zombies and craft 5000 wodden ladders to reach full "performance" doing stuff like tools and armors. Now you need to do it for basically every action you can do it ingame.\n\nMeanwhile, at the same time, they are "streamlining" it for the next patch, which is basically a cool way to say "dumbing it down". Adding health bars , big arrows in front of your screen so you figure out things (that part is kinda insulting). They have reduced many materials to the basics, changed the food to a single generic "meat" material etc etc. They are basically making it more like more popular games like "rust" or "ark" instead of going for their own niche. This is the main flaw i find about this game. The crafting menu for the next update is a cloned version of Rust's one (this got me permabanned from the fun pimp forums, but more about this later). Which isnt bad but its something else, not what this game was at first. Problem is that they have been just "redoing" stuff mostly for like forever and having little advances.\n\n-The gunplay : It is very basic, Its based in raycast and weapons are very arcade with no aparent recoil and very glitchy when you use ironsights, something that has been happening since i first played this game, about alpha 8. Bullets dont exist, . You dont really enjoy killing the zombies like in other games like lets say killing floor but when its a massive horde of zombies, its exciting seeing them not so much shooting them down, you just kill them coz you need to. This might change a bit in the next patch since they are adding dismembering and some Mocap animations.\n\n-The sound: The sound only can be described as "terrible". Basically a mess. Distances dont exist and position is complicated. Many sounds are recorded in diferent levels, making you having to manage your volume while playing or just go deaf someday. This is supossed to be better for Alpha 13 where they have recorded new sounds and updated the sound engine.\n\n-Graphics: Graphics are ok, even good for a game of this kind. The draw distance is terrible though. It feels like you are in the "little's prince" world. Anyway, graphics arent that important for a solid game.\n\n\n-The comunity: If you like feeling like in north korea, this is your game. Worst comunity i ever saw in a videogame. Worst forum moderators i ever meet in a videogame too in my 20 years playing online. Fun pimps cant take critics, not even feedback. Anything they dont like, moderators go wild with editing, threats and bans. Its like that in both their oficial forums and the steam's section for it. You rather just follow the official  line where its all about increasing mod's ego and shoulder patting  or your are tagged as a troll. The amount of shoulder patting, silly post editing and  ♥♥♥ licking is so borderline that is embarrassing. Seriously.\n\nAmazing. Its not videogames anymore but they are like rock band's fans or something. Censorship is rampant. Anyone with decent feedback, but negative feedback, is tagged as a troll and marginated or even treated by mods depending their mood or how much shoulder patting and ♥♥♥ licking they have produced before. Actually, the forums have more survival aspects than the game itself, just not the kind i try to find when playing a videogame. Typical responses there are generic "you can mod it" or "its alpha" or "its early acess". Any smart person can see the irony here. Its sad seeing such egos, A developer team who was basically begging years ago for cash that goes full ego mode and disrespect their fans with stuff like calling half their users "12 yo cry babys" after a situation they actually have produced theirselves for the release of this last alpha.\nits an issue they created theirselves with poor PR.  Then just censoship when the ♥♥♥♥ hits teh fan. Very bad. They basically have failed as persons. Not coz the game is bad but coz they have no principles. But this is not new, they had a half developer/forum mod/ troll before called Dochussey before. It was super amusing back then, Super PR. Anyone who read that guy at least once knows what i mean.\n\n-The bans: Yes, its not a myth. I got banned there in fun pimps's forums. It was fun. One of the super fanboys was there saying he/she just have played Rust that last weekend and what he though was innovative (remember they are copying Rust craft for next patch) turned to just imitation and was upset about it. Moderator came in claiming that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and that the guys doing the UI never have played rust after i pointed out that it was a copy, warning me. So i replied him in PM  asking why he had to lie to users(specially since they dont pay him), why not just to admit what is evident. And that was it. Malthis is such a nice guy and he loves all the attention.

For example if you die on a car you lose all your stuff(backpack doesnt get created) but also other things like not being able to loot something because your inventory is full even tough you could stack the items, you would need to do it manually. If you were looking to buy this or dayz id recommend dayz for the current state of game. The graphics are really bad but since its just the alpha i will let it pass as is.

Compare it to other alphas like back when Minecraft was in alpha, and the quality is also notable. Few crashes in my 100 hours of play, biggest technical issue I have is a greatly variable framerate, on a GTX 970 still dipping to 20fps at times.\n\nOverall, people might say it's a Minecraft/DayZ... and it pretty much is, but in the good way. A challenge to scavenge, a variety of changing, persistent PVE as time goes on, and a fairly hefty crafting system that mimics Minecraft's simplicity-crafting-grid type scenario. The voxel system is a neat physics addition compared to most builders, I'd say this plays as a more realistic, harder Minecraft, but with a wide variety of game settings to tailor to your playstyles, a great addition.\n\nIf you like the builder-survival-crafting type games, I'd say this is one of the best at the moment, with a real reason to team up, especially on a public server, and not a total PVP deathmatch-with-zombies like DayZ or H1Z1. Can't say it's the most amazing of course, but I definitely enjoy my time with it and will hope they keep fleshing out the bugs and PVE side of things.","January 27, 2015","true","282.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

First lets talk about the good parts of the game.\n\nPros\n\n-Challenging pve\n-Great crafting system\n-Map generation is great\n-Graphicly getting better with each update\n-Building mechanics are done right\n-Plenty of levels of difficulty allowing the game to be as hard or easy as you like\n-level up system with item quality based on level\n-Craftable minibike\n\nNow on to the cons of the game\n\nCons\n\n-Lots of bugs that can cause items to dupe or dissapear\n-PVP has hackers (this just happens not much to be done about this)\n-Takes way too many materials to make the highest end buildings\n-Sometimes my legs randomly break VERY annoying\n-Updates come out very slowly for the game has been in early acess for quite some time.\n\nOverall this game is a 9.2/10 and extremely time consuming if you get addicted to sandbox games like me.

It mixes and matches far too many concepts into spots where they do not belong. Base building is slow and unrewarding, when even stone walls can be broken down by the horde, and when breaking the game mechanics is the only way to provide safe shelter. Mining is slow and unrewarding, digging for hours to only come up with coal and nitrite, only to say ♥♥♥♥ it, and use dynamite to blow open caves simply because you can. Combat is slow and unrewarding, when even a huge horde can bring you nothing but some bullets and pieces of paper. Crafting is slow an unrewarding, and in essence, bland, using the usual PICKAXE, AXE, EXPLOSIVE, FENCING objects to build, bringing nothing new or surprising to the table.

Complex crafting system that allows you to dismantle/reverse-engineer or build nearly anything you can find in the game. ALL TERRAIN completely deformable, by you, friends/foes, and the undead.

This led to stage 2 hypothermia that drained my stamina until I was mauled by a horde.\n\nSpawned in the same biome 3 miles away from where I died and this time I stood on my camp fire. Five real time minutes later, I finally stopped having hypothermia, but was still too cold to go get more fuel. Horde found my camp and chased me off. I soon froze.\n\nI was able to escape the snow, but ran into a city where a fat police spit at me. Was getting wet the entire time. Chased into the snow again and had the second situation happen and died.\n\nBy this time I had so little max health that anything could take me out. Got stunned by a lumberjack horde and died.\n\nThe run I was able to make a base, the game practically forced one style of building or else your base will crumble and all the above will happen to you over and over again.\n\nAlso, you need a dedicated server to play on, meaning you need to configure your network settings and spend at least an hour setting things up to have all the above happen to your merry band of survivors. Or you could buy a server from a third party hosting service.\nOr you could use the game's abyssmal "Survival MP" function that breaks every few in game days and forces you to reset your progress.\n\nTL;DR This game is another example of wasted potential, While it has good concepts, it's too difficult early on, forcing players to die numerous times before giving up, and looking up how to work around the game's numerous unbalances and glitches. Ask yourself this, how much crap are you willing to look past?\n\nCome at me 7DTD pros.\n\n(For the record, I was actually able to configure my own network to create an actual private dedicated server, but the program I used apparently was abandoned and no longer works. IMO, it's not worth it to wrestle with my network and the game again to get another server running.)","February 23","false","106.8"," 27 of 46 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","27","46","0","1"

I mostly play on scavenger as it suits my laid back attitude, but if your a hardcore nutter then max out the settings and see how long you live for. You can play multiplayer or single (I prefer single mode) and the game has a whole lotta things you can fiddle with to get the type of game you want. Gather supplies, build stuff or just tunnel underground and pray, you play how you like which is epic imo. Even though it's in the early stages and thus changing at times (sometimes needin a good tweek) it's good fun I have have no regrets buying into, it unlike a few other greenlight games I've bought.\n\nA14 and all I can say is from epic to more epic, when this game hits release in the future it will set a new standard, even at this early stage it is an awesome blend of survival/crafting/rpg elements. I only play single player and lan with my wife and I have not had a game that has so many options or different ways to play it. You should be warned though, the game has two sides to it, first you must learn to survive the enviroment and then there's the z's, both will try to kill you, good luck.","August 27, 2014","true","207.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Everthing in the world is destructable and usually provides resources.\n3. Your toon can jump!\n4. The world is persistent offline and online which means your structures and mines stay there until destroyed.\n5.

I have found much here i like from its crafting to it wide selection of server types. You want a Day Z experience with loss of everything when you die, they got that. Want a PVE server with more time to build amazing stuctures? They got that too.  In fact with so many server side options you can basically find a server type that suits your tastes.\n\nHas a result of my streams several viewers have also now purchased the game and I enjpy these adventures we're having. No matter how you like to play 7Days gives you plenty to do.  Once you experience your first encounter with a zombie horde you will be hooked.\n\nWith Devs hard at work on updates I look forward to seeing what comes next for this game.\n\nSurvive, build, create, its all there.

I missed the Kickstarter for this game, unfortunately, picking it up on the advice of a trusted Youtube Letsplayer at the stage of Alpha 1, and thought, wow this is for me.\n\nFrom its very early stage of development this game was fully and excitingly playable, and somehow you could tell it had legs.  This game was exciting, realistic, fully working with my PC spec. and totally absorbing.  Blocky graphics didnt matter;  I loved the  way everything but everything is destructable and craftable.  Many have said this is DayZ meets Minecraft, and that is true in all the good ways.  Building your own base, finding ways to keep hordes out, farming your own crops and killing your food after the post apocalypse world is looted out was a challenge, taxing and deeply satisfying.\n\nIts not enough to dig a hole in the dirt and wait for sunrise; Zombies in this game are worthy opponents.  You will NOT survive if you are out at night, or if your base is weak - these undead are fast, scary, loud and deadly.  Running away is not an option.\n\nThen as the long awaited Alpha 2 came out... everything got better and some things got even harder to survive.  Then further updates, more challenges, better graphics, sophisticated crafting tools, this is the gift of a game that keeps on giving.  Just as you thought you had it sussed, new zombie types were introduced, tougher landscapes, zombies that could smell you, hear you, sense you, hunt you.  But its not all in their favour, we now have stealth, smooth terrain, craftable guns, repairable weapons, it just keeps on getting better with each update, and slight (non gamebreaking) bugs are fixed every week and released every friday, so that for a YouTuber like me\n(  https://www.youtube.com/my_videos?o=U  )\nits hard to keep up with the stuff the Fun Pimps roll out.\n\nPractically every aspect of the game is adaptable to your level and your enjoyment.  You can play on their default settings or you can make it harder if you like Hard Core, or easier if you want to relax and choose less stress.  Want more loot? fine.  What fewer zombies? fine,  longer days and shorter nights? choose your ratio.  Want Airdrops of supplies? you got it.  Tailor the game just how you like it.  Singleplayer is great, Multiplayer is there if you want company, PvE or PvP, all are available.  The smooth terrain now makes it less like Minecraft or DayZ -  those days of that comparison are over.\n\nI believe that any Survivalist (the name we give ourselves in this game) will tell you there have been times when all of us have said "Darn, thats a bug, but hey - its Alpha, right?"   None of the minor problems along the way to Alpha 8.3 (at time of writing this review) have made the game unplayable,  7 Days to Die in Alpha is better than most games on full and final release, better than I could possibly have expected and worth much more than I paid for it.\n\nI fully recommend this game at whatever stage you come on board.  More bang for your buck - definitely.","May 29, 2014","true","286.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

There is no game that I know of that has crafting, survival, zombies, multiplayer of this caliber. This game is gorgeous. From the moment the sun sets in game, to the moment the sun rises the game is awesome.\nWhen I first tried the game, I was very skeptic, I was like great another zombie shooter game, boy was I wrong.\n\nThe amount of depth the game has at this early stage is pretty impressive. The Developers are always actively keeping us up-to-date on their progress and constantly showing pics of improvements coming to the game on their blog.\n\nI'm currently playing on a public pvp server alpha 9.3. When you first go into the game, it is extremely overwhelming as the learning curve is steep. There is no tutorials so you basically would have to ask people online, or look at some YouTube, wiki, and do some trial and error to learn some of the games mechanics. First person shooter players will feel right at home here, as the controls are basic.\n\nWhen you start your first game, you start out at virtually very little items. You quickly learn that zombies are all around you and you have a limited food supply. You quickly scrounge around in cars, trash bins for food and must collect items to craft basic items to help you with your survival.\n\nThe crafting menu is straight forward you start out with know recipes such as a stone axe. Crafting an items is simply as just clicking on what you want to craft from the list, drag the components to the grid and click craft. After a short time the item is crafted. As you progress in the game you will find more new books that unlock new recipes. You can create forges that smelt your mining ores such as iron, and you can create a campfire to cook eggs, and raw deer meat (yes you can kill bambi!). Sleeping bags and beds crafted are used to save home locations so when you die you can respawn at them. You can farm food to grow, such as potatoes or coffee beans.\n\nThe map is huge, plenty of room to roam around and explore or go underground and create secret underground bases by digging. Zombies are slow at day and fast at night, there cute and cuddly but enough to easily overwhelm any player base not properly prepared. You will die a lot in this game, from starvation, diseases and other craziness in the game.\nSo if you’re an explorer or builder type, this game has plenty at its development stage to keep you busy. I recommend playing with friends to enjoy the many "oh ♥♥♥♥" moments you’re going to have trying to survive against hordes of zombies.\n\nWhat also makes this game unique is the importance of certain blocks in the game that form the many structures in the game such as buildings and farm houses. For example cement blocks have both a structural integrity that can withstand a lot of damage and has a threshold on the amount of blocks it can hold when used for building. Exceeding these capacities when building and not placing the proper foundation to support buildings can cause the whole building to collapse, pretty impressive from an engineering perspective. You can fortify buildings and upgrade doors windows etc., to withstand more damage.\n\nThere are many things planned for the game, such as in game vehicles, npc's, and story etc. This game is a good mixture of everything we love in mine craft, left for dead, and fallout games.\n\nIt is a great game and I highly recommend!","October 30, 2014","true","376.5"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","0"

L4D made sweet love to Minecraft and a loveable baby called 7D2D was born". I bought the game imediatelly without even thinking twice about it (Yeah, im that st00pid).\n\nI started playing it and i was like "Oh come on, this thing sucks so bad it could be an industrial vaccuum..." Graphics were terrible, controls were clunky, weapons were unfair (You would get weapon magazines by the dozen with each killed Fatty) and building was very limited... i was disapointed... i was crying on the inside to find out that the baby was actually a deceiving little sh*t faced a$$hole. I never touched it again but i still kept an eye out for it.\n\nIt payed off, recently this game had just had a total overhaul so gigantic that it would make plastic surgeons around the world blush.\n\nI started playing it single player at first and i was freakin amazed on how the game changed... it looked like and entire different game altogether. Loved every single aspect of it... Combat was more fluid, melee weapons were awesome, firearms were somewhat rare and ammunition was even rarer. Single zombies are unthreatening and kinda funny actually but should you get overwhelmed, they will be the ones laughing over your pathetic corpse. Oh, you WILL die, thats for sure... Maybe not from zombies, maybe not from disease and even maybe not from a hidden trap... You will probably die while mining or while attempting to explore an unstable building. I built a freaking castle from concrete and reinforced concrete, complemented with forged Iron Walls and a huge moat filled with wood spikes and log traps. I had 2 Sniper Towers fitted with trap doors and a damn living room each with TVs, a fridge and other things totally (not) necessary for towers of death from afar... When i finished it, i went outside, looked up, puffed my chest and thought to myself "I'm an epic genious and i am teh bestest builder in the game"\n\nThe i remembered i was playing a single player game... "Oh f*** "THERE WAS NO ONE TO SEE MY MASTERPIECE AND I COULD NOT MEASURE THE SIZE OF MY E-PEEN!!!! D:"\n\nPS: Don't play it alone\n\nPlaying it with friends in controlled server (modded) is the best thing you can do. Don't play this game single player, you will quickly get bored of it and you will end up resenting it. No, best way to play is with friends/family and with voice chat to make things even better.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n-Massive maps that will take you literarly days to fully explore.\n\n-Very mod friendly game, you can find tons of mods to suit your gamestyle.\n\n-Melee Combat very intuitive and fluid, easy to master.\n\n-Ranged Combat is all about you... if you can aim, you can hit.\n\n-Crafting is now user friendly, showing the materials you need even when you dont have them in your inventory.\n\n-Intricate Wellness system adds to the survival mechanism, understanding of this system is a must for survival.\n\n-The sheer amount of customization makes building the best experience in 7D2D.\n\n\nCONS\n\n\n-Well, the biggest con is that this is a multiplayer game... there will always be people dead set in screwing other players over, no matter what. This isn't a con from the game itself, its from being multiplayer. Playing in a private and/or controlled server is the best you can do to prevent less reputable people from screwing you and your friend's fun.\n\n-Allthough this isn't really a con, the game is ruthless and merciless towards new players, making some of them cry like little girls... trust me, i know...\n\n-It's still an Alpha early access. (Not really a con, more like a reminder)\n\n-There are a few known major bugs that can be a pain in the a$$ but some of them can be bypassed\n\nBug 1: Sometimes when mining or jumping in a placed frame, you will fall through the map... yeah, kinda sucks but can fixed by leaving the server and reentering it.\n\nBug 2: Disconnecting (wether by choice or forced) while crafting something in your crafting window will cause the materials and finished products still in collect slot to disappear, thus losing everything you were crafting.\n\nBug 3: Sometimes when cooking food/drinks and/or using chemistry will cause the materials to completelly disappear without crafting anything.\n\n\nThese are the major bugs known in the game (A10.4 at the time of this review).

Singleplayer works without issues for me.\n\nOverall the game is actually quite fun, especially in Multiplayer (I love PvP). Having to consider other people wanting your stuff (or your life) makes it all the more fun when building your fort and sneaking around in a city or other point of interest to avoid getting seen by players is quite thrilling.\n\nIf I had to name any, I can think of two downsides:\n\nSometimes, Easy Anti Cheat (a third party tool included to ward off cheaters) is being a pest and causes problems (mostly kicks you from a server). It also didn't solve the cheater problem one bit as far as I can tell. I still see the same amount of cheaters on EAC servers. So you gotta find a server with capable admins that use global banlist and have plenty of staff around to ban cheaters immediately and can restore chunks that have been vandalized by said cheaters.\n\nAlthough not strictly a problem with the game, the developers have an absolutely terrible communication policy. If you're interested in what I mean, you can read up on the whole Linux drama with this game and it will become clear to you what I am getting at. It was bad enough that I felt the need to include it in this review and I still think they should improve this.\n\n\nAll things considered, though, I still recommend this game because it's fun.","January 1, 2015","true","385.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

This review is based off of the latest build (infinite world gen)\n\nThis game started off well, a good first alpha build that showed off the features of the game, but lacked content with a limited map and lacking item explations and crafting options.\n\nIn this latest build, the game now has an infinitely generated world (which I must say is very well done). After an hour exploring i found a mix of biomes from bombed out, desolated cities (including convincing bomb craters, ruined and intact buildings, ect.)  Goergous forests, stark deserts, lakes flush with wildlife, and frozen hilly forests. One could spend hours just looking for all the nifty features the terrain generator can create, and so far, I have found no real broken generator features.\n\nThe new crafting menu is vastly improved, eliminating a lot of the guesswork required while still requiring a challenge to find and assemble crafting components for rare recipies. Unlike older versions, the recipe shows all materials needed in the grid, but you need to know what the materials are, and find them before you can build the recipe.\n\nThe UI overhaul adds modular sets for different crafting recipes, eliminating the one huge recipe list, and also adds color-cordinated backlighting to different items, displaying what catagory of item they are. It also fixed the OCD aggravating clipping between the status bars and hotbar (Thank god).\n\nThe build still has some problems, sound for one is a huge issue. Zombies are unreasonabley loud at crazy distances, making scavenging overly panic inducing, and often causing injury or death because you can't tell how far away an enemy is. Footsteps and impact sounds also feel too roughshod, and could use an overhaul.\n\nOverall, I quite love the game, and i'll probably play around with this build a lot more. Until then, good luck surviving everyone :3 (also. Dysentery. 10/10)","August 16, 2014","true","180.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Still not enjoying playing this anymore. It is ridiculously dark pretty much all the time. Zombies can be heard almost regardless of distance but, because it is so dark, I can't actually see them until they are almost on top of me. The melee animation looks really stilted now for some reason and even on Adventurer with low spawn settings, zombies are everywhere, all the time. Bears, ditto. Yes, bears are less common since the patch but I still seem to spend half my time running away from either them, or dogs. The Crafting bit of the game has been over run by the Survival Horde part even from Day 1... Maybe I'll come back to it in six months and have another look but, right now, it's on my Can't Be Bothered To Play list.\n\nThis is really quite disappointing.  I really enjoyed Alpha 11 and clocked up well over 330 hours playing (yes, I know that's not much to many hardcore gamers but it's still my most played EA game on Steam). A12 appears to be rather odd in places and the community discussion boards appear (appear... ) to have a reasonable number of people making legitimate suggestions for improvements and being banned unreasonably quickly. It's definitely very dark, the weather effects are a nice touch but have reduced the visibility substantially and the wet-and-slimey look to the ground is just plain weird.  The bears are an interesting addition but appear far too often in my opinion and the zombie spawn rate appears to have been increased dramatically.\nI hope the Devs are listening more than some moderators appear (appear...) to be.  This should be an enjoyable game - my last few hours in Alpha12 (Nomad setting) have just been frustrating, dark and stealthing past zombies now seems almost impossible as there's likely to be a dog or bear just around the corner.  The ramping up of the difficulty seems skewed to me.\nAnyway, I hope those of us who have backed this game in EA (which, after all, is surely the whole point - to obtain player feedback on the game) will be listened to.\nNo, I'm not whining - I'm just looking forward to a patch that resolves a number of the legitimate issues raised by those of us who are supporting the Devs during Alpha in the hope that the final version will be as great as it deserves to be.\nSo, at the moment, I can't recommend this game to new players. I wish it were otherwise as Alpha11 was really good.","July 5, 2015","false","848.4"," 31 of 54 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","31","54","2","3"

Plus as should be expected for an alpha, balance is always being re-evaluated.  Of course I don't expect real balancing until all the features are implemented and much more debugged.\n\nThat said, the game has been fun so far.  I think a lot of people forget that it is an Alpha because the game does play relatively well and has a reasonable feature set already.  That may be part of the inclination to complain about the balance as they've forgotten as enjoyable as it is to play, it is also still very much in a stage where a lot of testing is required and the balance just should not be expected at this point when most mechanics are not in, anything now should be considered place-holder balance at best.\n\nAlso, modding has finally been given the OK with the expected 'not yet officially supported' and 'modders should expect mods to break with new releases and changes which may even make them redundant or impossible to recreate'.  Nothing new for a product in Alpha but given the prior confusion as to if modding was allowed (there was even a chill on modding discussion before) this is a great change.\n\nThey have even adding a Modding forum on the Official forums:\nhttp://7daystodie.com/forums/forum.php\n\nThe future is looking brighter for this zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe game itself is an absolute blast.  Tweaked to just how you want to play with the options they've given so far.  Nothing like using a crossbow to shoot bolts to draw zombies away from a building you want to loot instead of trying to kill all the zombies in Gravestown.  Make the whole feel of the game more alive and realistic.  So much fun and it keep getting better with every release.\n\nThe Random World Generation is some of the best I've seen with towns actually linking together across multiple biomes.  The latest version added paths from roads to even the side Points of Interest (example a gravel road leading to the out of the way camp site).\n\nGame just keeps getting better and better.

I would say if you like minecraft and dayz you will probably like this... its fun.  I do think the price tag is a bit high. but if you see it on sale for 20 bucks definatly worth it.\n\nI start out dropped in a desert like scene with broken down cars and garbage all over the roadway. I can hear the sounds of nearby zombies snarling and begin looking around to see if im being approached. I dont see any zombies so i approach the trash and am able to scavenge a can of food and some scrap metal. Next I approach a broken down vehicle where I am able to salvage more scrap metal. I break some small tree like bushes and get some sticks from them. By this time the zombies have taken notice of me so i take off running down into a canyon. I punch the sandstone and carve a small cave into the canyon side and use the sand to make some glass panes. I hear the zombies approching and get the glass up just in time to seal myself into the cave. i see the zombies outside pressed up against the glass wishing they could eat my brains. Inside the safety of my cavern i craft the scrap metal and sticks i gathered into a hunting knife. I then break the glass out and kill the zombie. By this time it is getting dark and out of almost nowhere i am swarmed by many zombies and killed.\n\nHighly enjoyable Sandbox.,,,","January 6, 2014","true","2.8"," 84 of 155 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","84","155","0","1"

It seems not only big but has more stuff in the world. More houses in different areas, some areas are the same but over all it's quite amazing. I love how the developers still update the game.\n\nSo as an avid survival player... i have to say this game definitely has a lot to offer. Although it's clunky and a bit slow the game has a lot of promise. As i said before you need to get past the graphics and push through the flaws of the game to truly appreciate the game itself.\n\nThe game has multiple to nearly endless crafting options along with building options. The game has a server base where you can sort of have a private server to play with your friends or you can join an open server with other players. Along with the update- able to add friends, track them on the map, having so many more health conditions... this game truly gives a survival aspect and the developers are definitely supporting the game as much as possible. You can build gorgeous houses and in zombie attacks have them destroyed... be raided by other players.. dig underground for resources, chop down trees, or even reinforce broken town houses. The game has a lot of promise.\n\nI do recommend this game... with it's flaws the game itself is quite fun, especially with friends.","May 31, 2014","true","18.3"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DBDman/recommended/251570/","DBDman","bobdylan401","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DBDman/","177 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is a great, great game I would HIGHLY reccomend, even at it's original alpha price of 35$ Now that it's 25$ if you like the concept of Dayz minecraft just make the jump and get it, you won't be dissapointed.\n\nI have bought Dayz, Rust and this, and while I like them all Dayz has been uninstalled. I like playing Rust a lot right now, but creatively I think this game takes the cake. I have always been entranced with the survival genre, and multiplayer games, especially games that encourage players to collaborate creatively. Rust is a more of a post apocolyptic survival game. Rust isn't a kos nightmare frenzy like Dayz is because you do get the ability to stash things and create bases, but as of right now pvp is the more mid-game/end-game goal as everything else becomes fairly easy once you get to know the mechanics. Rust (like Alpha Dayz) relys on the pvp to define the gaming exerience, and it basically turns into a fps where you want to loot cool pvp gear from other people. Just like Dayz. (Not bashing on it I am loving it right now.)\n\n7 Days to Die however is a different creation and an entirely unique game. It is truly a zombie survival sandbox, that can be enjoyed greatly without even going online. The Zombie AI is great, even in its Alpha phase. Even slow walking zombies have a way of creeping up on you without you knowing until the last second, or filling into a house blocking the exits as you are checking food cabinets, forcing you to jump through a window.\n\nI think the coolest thing about the game is that it is not just one game. You truly create the experience that you want to play. The Default (as you have probably heard) is that during daytime there are slow walking zombies, and at nighttime they turn into fast zombies. Extremely fast frenzied zombies that only slow down in the prescence of enough light (campfires, torches, ect.) The zombies will claw through any material to get to you. How long it takes for them to claw through a material depends on how durable that material is (stone is stronger than wood, which is clearly stronger than dirt.) A mudhut would be taken down in seconds at night time. Just being outside at nighttime in default is terrifying, encouraging a kind of forage and basebuilding during daytime, and fortifying and repairing your base at night time.\n\nYou can change pages of settings, and even more in depth settings not in the actual game to craft the game that you want, choosing how many zombies spawn, if they are always walkers, or always runners, how much damage they do, or you do and many, many more options.\n\nI never really could get into minecraft because while I loved the concept, I felt no immersion. I felt that the game focused more on the creativity, than the survival immersion, but not only am I not good drawing or art, let alone 3D art, but the 3D art that I could create was in my opinion not terribly interesting, or at least not pleasing to look at. This game is all about immersion, and the graphics are incalcuably better than minecraft (and constantly getting better.) Still the physics are solid and sound, and to me incredible. Every piece of the game world is some sort of resource that you can mine and collect. Every inch of dirt is diggable and obtainable. Every stone that you see can be picked up and crafted into stone "blocks" (They are starting to replace classic minecraft blocks with "smooth terrain" something that ironically in the present state I find less smooth and easy to work with than the original block style, but I am sure that will be refined and corrected.)\n\nThe reward of simply surviving is one very satisfying, yet incredibly hard goal, but really the sky is the limit. Jump on a friendly server and I am constantly shocked by the imagination these people have. They will have turned a warehouse into a castle surrounded by landmines and trenches with spikes on the bottom of them. Go into the castle and it is just a decoy, and ladders plummet deep, deep down into the earth where there is an entire underground world, with many rooms, undergound rivers, mines, bedrooms, lounges and tunnels. Above ground there are towers that lead to large gardens growing many different vegetables and fruit.\n\nThere is a sandbox "God" or "Cheat" mode where you can spawn any item or resource that you want at any time allowing you to create anything you can dream up.\n\nMy first online experience was on a new server when the game had just came out, and a bunch of us found a huge town where we intended to stay together. We did the first night and ended up blowing a staircase away as zombies flooded into the house, shooting them as they tried to jump up the destroyed staircase. We somehow survived and looted the town the next day, but I got seperated and nighttime fell before I could find them and I was trapped in a small shack with one other person and no good defensive resources. Needless to say we were destroyed. My next online game we were in the ruins of a town full of large half destroyed buildings, many floors high, but basically trapped with hordes of zombies below us.\n\nI could go on forever but I will end this with saying if you are on the fence look at the patch notes. Out of all of the Alphas, these developers seem to be the most dedicated and hardworking developers intent on providing us with amazing gameplay rather than just trying to let the community make our own gameplay. Every month a miriad of changed occur making the systems more complex and in depth and adding new systems. The map gets larger and larger, even though eventually they will let us create our own maps and create random map generators. The graphics got a huge overhaul in the last build. In the last build we have got a working stealth and cooking system, as well as the beginning of an armor system. These developers are dedicated to making a truly great game with great AI, and it really is refreshing. It is to me a really good example of how gameplay is more important than graphics, something that tends to be forgotten in this day and age. And the graphics aren't bad.","March 10, 2014","true","202.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

Think minecraft but better looking, more intricate crafting and faaaaaar scarier.\n\nMy Thoughts:\nWhen I first had a crack at this game it was brilliant, building my first castle and sniping zombies from the top was rewarding as was the scavenging all the materials required for it and fighting zombies with a stone axe. The game was tough but not overly so. You could got to the easiest setting and learn how it all goes then try harder setting knowing how to build the essentials.\nThen there was a patch that smashed my hard work. So decided to start again, another patch, hard work smashed. I decided to take a break to preserve my sanity (admittedly a small amount).\n\nWell I came back for another bash after a while and things changed for the worse I think.\nFor example, while playing this game now my innner geek would ask (or scream and gibber) the following:\nWhy am I dying when cold? After constructing a shelter, clothes and stood next to a fire.\nWhy am I dying when hot? After removing all my clothes, standing in shade, stood still and drinking water till I'm full.\nWhy am I dying at all in easy mode with no zombies????\n\nAnyway, to the review.\n\nPros:\nCrafting is quite easy, and ♥♥♥♥♥ing materials is fun as everything is destructable. Try going into creative mode and laying tnt around the base of a building then detonating it all with a missile.\nThe graphics are quite nice and the atmospherics are excellent. When the zombies come for you it sends the hairs on the back of your neck right up.\nThe base building aspect is really satisfying, if you manage to live past the first few days.\nI like the physics too, if you do bother to blast the hell out of that building I mentioned you will see it all fall in sequence, very well done to the devs for that.\n\nCons:\n\nFeels too hard mode even in the easiest settings. I know this is a survival game but if you set a game to the easiest mode and STILL die if you are spawned in an extreem biome (snow, desert or the blasted lands) then where's the fun? In previous iterations of this game you could build something glorious, turn on the zombies and see what happens. Now I can barely even survive to build a wooden shack unless I'm in creative. On a side note, there is nothing more demoralising as being told by the game to build a shelter, fire and clothes to stop hypothermia only to die, (very slowly) in your shelter in a lovely plant fibre outfit and cloth armour next to a fire, from hypothermia:(\n\nI might try this game again in the future, to see if the devs put something in to turn off the dying every 2 seconds because of being too cold or hot. I would have given a thumbs up before finding out some patches don't allow you to carry on with old saves. However, right now I can't it give a thumbs up.\n","January 16","false","127.2"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

Ive played alot of servivel games and so far this is my choice for best of all time. I would like to see developers add something to make grouping more benificial for players. I know the new skill system (jobs) in 13 patch will help but you can still make everything in the game just not as the other guy that is skilled at that job. Im talking buffs that help if in group. I get this is a pvp servivel game for most part but need to balance the time people are off line. I know i cant play 24/7 and probly many people cant. So what does that leave kids griefing bases just because they can when empty server. Ive seen my kids search threw servers that look good to them go in server for about 15 mins. and find people that have built above ground bases and raid them off line then go back when people are on and build and search for new bases to raid. My point there is kids they have alot of time to play can make a bad server. ive played since 4.0 i think i have played alot of hours and these 2 thing have been my complaint since start plz put in forms if you aggree with me.

I spent hours and hours building bases, crafting weapons, surviving hordes, and the ambiance of the game was so well crafted I found myself having nightmares about getting overrun by zombies.\n\nBut Alpha 13 was a bad start and Alpha 14 has just made the game downright unplayable. I think they've focused so much on securing deals with Telltale, they've lost focus on delivering a quality experience to their original gamers.\n\nHere are my complaints:\n1) the weather system is ridiculously illogical - I've been in heatstroke during a snowstorm. As a player, you will spend nearly all your time just searching for water and drinking red tea. This is not hyperbole - in a 24 hour day, I spend about 16 hours just trying to keep myself hydrated.\n\n2) while the graphics have improved dramatically, the bugs they've introduced are horrible. Zombies randomly clip through walls. Hornets spawn an endless stream of zombies so hordes several days.\n\n3) it's become a grinding-based game just trying to accumulate enough materials to build and maintain a base. Exploration isn't all that possible now unless you play the game fully-nomadic, in which case, you desperately need a minibike and loads of gas so you can simply outrun the bugged hordes.\n\n4) quests and skills weren't thought out well. They're there just to be there, not because they add any value to the game experience.\n\n5) on any difficulty above Scavenger, due to the spawning bugs, the game becomes impossible to survive as the weapon balancing has been readjusted so your guns are virtually useless vs. the literal hundreds of zombies that will come your way.\n\nI really, really wish they'd focus less on the aesthetics and understand that gameplay is more than appearance.","April 23","false","764.1"," 25 of 43 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","25","43","0","1"

The sandbox nature of the game makes it great for people who like minecraft however unlike in minecraft enemies in this game are formidable and will destroy the things you have build if they stand in their way. Combat is basic but not bad, crafting is done very well, and the suspense when a you hear a zombie hoard running in the night is gut wrenching.

People often argure "You can't rate a game down after 500 hours!"  Unfortunately, you can with ea.  The game I purchased is no longer in my library.\n\nThis game started out as its own role model.  It used the idea of minecraft and a few other games but applied all of it in a way that made 7dtd a Jewel, a shining star in a dim world of crappy ea survivals.  Then the devs started changing core gameplay.  Started making the game more and more like every other crappy ea survival out there and less like the game that we all invested in.\n\nAfter a while, the updates began to take longer.  5 months for a content update.  Every time the blog was full of "The biggest update yet!  That's why it's taking too long" and the steam forums were void of any communication.  Other ea titles like The Forest and Savage Lands are at least willing to give the players a timer and stick to that timer.  The 7dtd devs decided that they no longer need to give release dates of any kind which is basically saying "It'll be ready when we get to it."  It must be nice to not be held to any level commitment.  The devs have proven to go around in a complete circle within one content update.  The beginning of A13 was them spending TIME messing with the crafting system and changing the way the old  system would work.  By the 4th month of waiting for new content, the devs had decided to scrap the old crafting style that they had wasted time on and bring in a whole "new" system that was ripped right from all the other sub-par ea crafting games on steam.\n\nThe game has gone from the most promising to empty promises.\n\nIt breaks my heart to see this game going down the pipes,  but the devs are being childish by refusing to communicate on the steam forums where their consumer base comes  from and by not even giving the courtesy of an estimated release date for their extremely slow updates.\n\nI will  continue to hope for this game,  but I cannot support the recent choices the devs have made","July 8, 2014","false","170.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Long wait but worth it in the end. I know a lot of people had bug issues, but I was lucky enough not to have really any issues at all. It looks like all the major issues of world gen have been patched too. (Though I kind of liked the caves spawning on the surface, it looked like a meteor impact ha.) The new levelling system is something I'm very fond of, the new models are great and I like the new prefabs. (I'm pretty sure there are new prefabs right? Unless I never just saw them before.) The UI is really updated and I like it.\n\nBut anyway: If you're looking for a good zombie survival game it's a good one, especially if you like building and crafting. That's what this one has that a lot of the other ones seem not to.  It's fun on your own of course, but definitely buy a couple copies and send them to your friends.","December 6, 2015","true","395.7"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","28","49","5","5"

You can build shelter, find food from scraps, learn new skills from stores, and so much more. Best yet is that you can play with your friends and survive together.

Why? They can help you break the damn doors around every building you see. I DONT reccomend this game mainly because that every door in the game, (besides the one you built) is literally made out of a material that is resistant to a nuclear blast. +150 hits to break a door down, which means staring at the block your are hitting, for more than 2 minutes. In addition to that, after you break off the first layer, you HAVE to break the second layer in order get any decent loot. Therefore you have to grind for a long time to get any notable loot. Other than the autrocious doors, I think that everything is pretty balanced.

There is no shortage of zombie games out there, but this indie stands out. At the beginning of the game you basically get dumped into the zombie apocaylpse with next to no supplies. You have to start gathering and building things immediately or you WILL get eaten! Later in the game it has a Last Man on Earth/Omega Man/I Am Legend feel to it as you explore destroyed, zombie infested cities. Build your base well. If the zeds work out where you are (count on it) they will hammer their way through doors, windows, and/or walls.\n\nFair warning; as of right now the game is still in alpha. Every so often the devs bring out updates which require you to wipe your game save and start over. It can be a heartbreaker.

It does have a rough appearance but there are upgrades to graphics in the works. The core game is just great and these guys claim to be gamers and it shows in their work. so many great ideas and they keep adding to it!\nIt currently has soooooooo much crafting and content that it beats out pretty much all other games in this genre. the only problem is that it isnt getting the attention it deserves. I urge everyone to checkout this game and make your own decision but in my eyes its a diamond that is being polished continually.\n\nkey things i want to point out...\n-FF can be set on or off by server admins.

So i was able to set FF to off and not worry about players killing me so i could build, then next time i was able to turn it on again. imagine setting server to build mode and then reset and allow people to then attack each others fortified bases. the same goes for enemies, can be turned on or off whenever.\n-Multiple environments on same map. desert, snow, forest, city all in the same map!\n-----DIGGING, YES you can dig and build just like in minecraft. construct and deconstruct...Buildings collapse under stress. I was able to digg under a building in key points and cause it to collapse on one side only. made quite a mess too lol\n\n- they are planning to upgrade the graphics and overall appearnce so it isnt so blocky. vehicles will be added later around this same time. cant drive a car up a hill made of squares and steps lol. so they plan to make it more smooth/natural while keeping the digging and building system!!","January 15, 2014","true","22.9"," 42 of 76 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","42","76","0","11"

Earlier I was put off bit by the blocky terrain a'la Minecraft, while other graphics were aiming to some sort of "realism"(as realistic a zombie apoc can be) and now that the terrain is smoothed out, the game seems visually more in balance and it's easier to focus in crafting and everything else that happens in game.\n\nAs a survival game, you are pretty dependant of your own skills - ability to create, build, defend and fix. You can head out scavenging for supplies and weapons, making a home base in existing buildings or start fresh, pick your own spot and start creating your own new base, just the way you like it.\n\nMajority of the game's items can already be crafted yourself and I believe eventually everything will be craftable. Every item and building block has it's own mass and durability. That determines how easily a zombie can bash through different types of wall materials and defences. It also determines how many building blocks you can stack or build in air without proper support before it crashes down. For example, a concrete roof will keep it's form under a heady load, while a scrap metal roof is likely to fall down if you walk on it.\n\nThe zombies in 7 Days To Die have a short memory span and can follow you for a moment, even if they don't see you. If they can't see you, they will eventually forget you and you can try sneaking away. The Zeds also have great hearing and sense of smell, so carrying raw meat (or eating dog/cat food that causes gas!!) can cause problems if surrounded by living dead. And no, mining a new basement floor on urban areas isn't a smart idea.\n\nCurrently it feels like the game has more than enough to keep me and my friends occupied for a long time, though I can't wait for the next major patch (alpha 9) that will include some AI tweaks, randomly generated worlds etc.\n\nFor an early access game, 7 Days To Die offers a lot to do and has pretty good options to fine tune the game more into your liking. You can adjust the speed of time, the amount of zeds, AI skill, moving speed and threat, how often you get air drop supplies and so on.\n\nSo yes, I do recommend this game.

My first review was premature and I probably made the game sound much better than it is. If my first review made the game sound like a 9/10, my more realistic 140+ hours of gameplay review would have to put it at more like a 6.5 or 7 out of 10.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a thumbs up. The game is fun to play, even with all it's problems. If you really enjoy sandbox type games, then 7DTD will appeal to you, despite all it's flaws. It's like Minecraft on steroids with zombies, ruined cities, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and eventually, will have driveable cars. I'll list a few of what I consider to be the most important points. Keep in mind that at the time of this review we are still in alpha. If you are considering buying the game in alpha, you should expect there to be bugs, a lack of content and other problems. If you get mad at bugs and other problems, don't buy the game in alpha. With that in mind, here is a rough picture of the game in it's current state:\n\nPro: Being tossed into a HUGE game map with zombies and discovering ruined cities and surviving and building your first base = fun, though a bit grindy.\n\nCon: The map is huge but repetitive. Running for hours and seeing more of the same randomly generated map biomes gets boring pretty fast. On one hand, the technical achievment of a randomly generated maps is impressive. But then you realize it just gives you a huge bland boring map. There is something very important added to gameplay when you design an intelligent, creative, realistic, immersive, interesting, fun map. Just having an algorithim spitting out huge empty boring maps is NOT an improvement to gaming.You could also view this trend of procedurally generated maps as developer laziness. Gone are the days now when maps where intricately designed to lead the player on a grand adventure of discovery. The trend with the current batch of games is have an algorithim do all the map making. Will we one day have entire games that are procedurally generated and devs don't even need to do anything more than change a few textures and repackage the game with a different title? This will not be an improvement people, trust me.\n\nPro: In MP, it's kind of nice that you can go miles away from all the other players, and build your base, and maybe even find your own city that nobody else knows about (at least for a bit!). So the huge infinite map gives you some privacy, and maybe the ability to have your own private city, at least temporarily.\n\nCon: MP servers are having major issues with lag, freeze ups, crashes and rollbacks. One server I was on the server owner couldn't even get it to start up anymore, so he had to delete and start over, thus deleting everyone’s bases and loot. There is speculation that these problems are directly related to the infinite maps as it seems the further out people explore on the maps, the more the server lag increases. It hasn't been definitively confirmed yet, but there is suggestive evidence that it is related to the map size / generation. Now considering we don't need infinite maps, I'd much rather have a stable large map then an infinitely unstable map. I've played many MMOs with huge stable game worlds (and thousands of players), and map space was never an issue. Since this game is not an MMO, and is designed for small sized server populations, we really don't need infinite maps....Please devs, just give us a stable comfortably large map.\n\nPro: Compared to Minecraft, the graphics are amazing!\nCon: Compared to all games made after 2007, the graphics are not very impressive! With that said, I always give much more weight to gameplay and fun, and graphics are just a bonus. I'd rather play a game with great gameplay and low end graphics any day than a game with top tier graphics and crap game play. With that in mind, the graphics for 7DTD are adequate.\n\nPro: Building bases can be fun!\n\nCon: At the moment, the building customization is probably lacking compared to say Minecraft. But that will surely change as game gets updated. Another con for me anyways is the complicated integrity, max load system. If you don't like to do a bunch of math (which I don't, when playing games), it is very likely your uber base that you just spent 20 hours building will ...collapse.\n\n\nOk, now the absolute biggest con for this game atm, is.....multiplayer. Yes, unfortunately the pain will increase dramatically as you begin playing multiplayer, and you will start to realize just how f**** up this game really is! Multiplayer servers are plagued by hackers in god mode, flying around, spawning them selves all the weapons and TNT they want, filling up peoples bases with bedrock (which can't be removed), shooting through the environment (exploit, not really a hack), causing the server to crash, destroying peoples bases that they spent 200 hours building, etc...the list goes on. I actually have NOT been the target of a hacker ...yet...but every server I have been on has had multiple instances of hackers and other players losing everything because of it.\n\nOn top of the hacker problem, there are other major problems causing servers to lag and freeze up and crash, and many times this results in a rollback --- causing you lose several hours of progress. For example on my current MP server, I got dropped at one point, and for one hour I tried to log back on, and I couldn't, even though the server was still up. At some point they reset the server, and the next morning when I logged on, everything I had collected the previous night (over a period of a few hours) was gone. One of my game neighbors lost his entire base! I had just happened to get lucky on the previous game session and scored a major haul when I found an unprotected player base / farm, and had looted about 600+ food supplies! After starving for a week (realtime), I had finally hit the jack pot and found 600+ food! Then ….all gone. It makes one feel like it's very pointless to even build up an uber base or gather a bunch of loot, when you know you can log in the next day and it's all gone.\n\nDespite all these problems, you can easily play for a hundred hours and not have any of these disasters happen to you. The rollback I just talked about was really one of the few major annoyances I have experienced. Well except when my first MP server decided to quit, and I lost 3 (real life) days worth of gathering and building. But I do constantly hear other players on the servers I am on, complaining about their base disappearing, or large stock piles of loot just vanishing! So it is fairly common.\n\nIn single player I haven't really had any major problems yet, other than just getting bored of the repetitive nature of the game map and the grind of gathering resources, and building up a first base. And then of course a new update comes out...and you lose your SP game save, and then you have to decide if the new features that were implemented are really worth starting all over again, just so you can see them. My biggest complaint of the SP experience is the game runs a bit laggy. I can run a game like Skyrim on ultra smooth as butter, and here is this game with vastly inferior graphics to Skyrim, yet it runs way crappier. It's not unplayable, but the graphics lag is quite noticable and irritating sometimes. This is certainly because the developers are inexperienced at making modern high end games, it really shows. But despite all the negatives, most of my 140+ hours of game play have been entertaining. But also repetitive and grindy! LoL. A tentative thumbs up. Worth playing if your bored. I can guarentee you will have many hours of fun. But far from being a great game in it's current state. You may just want to keep an eye on this game and wait for another year of development to pass.","August 17, 2014","true","299.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

I was excited to get my hands on it even if it was only in its alpha stage. When this game first came out it is was a huge disappointment. I was crushed. I couldn't tell you how much I didn't like everything about it. I played about 2 hours trying to understand what was going on and I kept telling myself I was missing something; some huge part of the game that would make it what I thought it was supposed to be. I wasn’t missing anything... The game was so early alpha that it was just a concept held up with a bit of scotch tape and some toothpicks. I deleted the game feeling scammed; like I had just wasted my money. Fast forward a month or so later. A friend of mine had been playing religiously every night. I couldn’t understand what he saw in the game. I was bored enough one night to say what the heck and re download it and jump in for some j-j-j-jolly cooperation. I was blown away! Was this even the same game? Everything had been completely re done. The graphics had been significantly increased. HDR, bloom, lighting. The zombies had rag doll physics (Big plus in my books.). The menu, crafting, UI, features, items, weapons. Everything had been made 100x better and re imagined with more content. The way the game played was amazing compared to the day 1 alpha release which was like scraping your eyes on a chalk board and getting the sound from nails. Everything about the game was, surprisingly better. Like a million times better. Like, how could this happen?! I want to believe in magic but at the same time I also want to believe in god. I went from feeling like a kid at Christmas who was good all year but still got coal to feeling like a man who broke open that coal to find a diamond.\n\nThis game really was bad when it came out. But since it has gotten the updates that have been promised I can't stop playing. It is extremely fun. It is a mix of FPS, survival horror, crafting, mining and so much more. And! Everything is destructible. If you have looked past this game then give it another glance. I know I am glad I did. It is easily one of my all time favorite games for too many reasons to list. It is the best zombie game on steam. A must own for everyone. This game has come a long way and I am excited to see where it goes.","February 6, 2014","true","380.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

But beyond that, I have never felt any real desire to survive beyond the hours spent building this or that. This is Minecraft+zombies. Not open sandbox survival-horror.\n\nI just spent about 3 hours trying out the new things added with the 7.0+ patch(es) and am finding myself getting frustrated with how the ground has been smoothed, making it difficult to tell exactly where you're striking with an axe or shovel (which makes mining out an underground base almost impossible now, at least with any sense of orginized structure to it). A couple of pluses are the 'veins' of ore now, instead of just a block here and there of this or that ore you can find streaks of ore through the dirt, gravel, and stone layers.\n\nThe other additions, such as the wait to loot, noise penalties, stealth, and crafting systems are good window dressing for making the game more 'realistic'. But the big selling point for the game (for me at least) has now been ruined, or at the very least complicated for me, the building. As the game stands at this very minute, I can not recommend it at the rather high price of $25. My suggestion: If you're thinking about getting the game, wait until it is out of Alpha to spend your money.\n\nPS: I would also like to add that there are better 'sandbox survival-horror' games out there. State of Decay comes to mind immediately. If you want a 'sandbox builder' stick with Minecraft, it's less expensive and for now, better over all. If the developers don't flub things up too badly, in a years time 7 Days to Die could be one of the best sandbox survival-horror games out there. -IF- they don't flub it up...","March 4, 2014","false","48.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Okay, it can be fun at times but rarely and it gets boring very quickly. It crashes frequently and black screens your PC making you force restart your PC.

It does not matter how good your PC is the game will crash, and it will black screen it.

I like to compare it as: DayZ meets Minecraft. It's literally just that. You have to survive day and night by finding items, such as food, water and weapons. Not only with that you can survive, you also need to build a safehome, where you are safe from zombies and hostile-players. Both compared you have an excellent chance of survival.\nYou can craft your own stuff too, weapons, blocks, doors, windows, stairs, etc. etc.\nWorking together with friends and other players is not neccesary, but needed for better survival, especially versus other people.\n\nSome settings you can change in the game are handy. You can start off easy and disable the zombie-spawn. You can also put the spawn-time on normal and even on fast.\n\nDaytime is safest, that's my first tip for you. Now go try it yourself!\n\nI recommend this game. It's fun and you really put your instincts to the test. With friends it's even more fun, on a LAN-party it would be funniest. I can play this all day long, not alone though. Just like in Minecraft: you can play it for hours, but with friends you can play it a couple hours more.\nFor a decent price you can buy it in the Steamstore.\n\nRating:\n8.5/10\nNo 9 or 10 because the game is still in it's Early Access, it's nothing near finished. That doesn't mean it isn't fun. The game is already this fun, can't wait for the fun I'll have when the game is fully released.","May 19, 2014","true","7.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

Problem is, it seems every time they update, they decide add in something to make the game more tedious and make the beginning even more trollishly hard.\n\nThe last straw for me was the every 6 day dog horde that forces you to stay hidden until you have a big enough gun to shoot a pack of dogs that can run almost as fast as you do and the weekly 7th night horde that know exactly where you are no matter where you may be. It's also not a small horde by any stretch of the imagination. If you don't have a strategy for it, you die and the zombies wreck your base. The dog horde wasn't actually so bad, it'll just get you if you're not ready and it spots you.\n\nIt wouldn't have been such a terrible thing if the game waited, say, 14-21 days to give you enough time to prepare before it sends you a weekly death squad. It's kind of sad to have to build a base just to abandon it on the 7th night and stand in the middle of an open field to be killed because there's no way in hell you're going to be able to handle a horde on night 7.\n\nOf course, this game is a work in progress and future balancing may fix the various imbalanced aspects, but considering what I've seen so far, I'm not gonna count on it.\n\nI suppose one could disable the hordes and enjoy the game. However, at this point in development, I just can't recommend it.","December 31, 2015","false","318.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

This game is far superior at its current stage of development than most others.  I love the fact that you can change the zombies to the classic George Romero slow walking zombies or even turn them off if you want.  The crafting system is pretty good and fairly easy.  I would only recommend a tutorial on using it.  The addition of more biomes is deffenately a plus now just adding in some weather for rain and snow and your all set.  I have read some bad reviews about this game and I can tell you from my experience with this game, those reviews just don't hold any truth.  They might have had some validity in the begining but those issues have apparently been delt with.  All in all I'm glad I bought this game and would recommend it to any one considering buying it.  If they keep working on it and, I'm sure they will, It will deffinately be worth the price.  As of the writing of this review the game currently has 3 different game modes, single player and multiplayer, adjustable modes for the zombies, many differnt blocks for building and sculpting the environment, a vast crafting system, four different playable characters, and just plain tons of fun.

It was Alpha 1 and they were going in such a unique direction where the zombies were a legitimate threat at night and nowhere was safe, so you had to board up your house and hope they dont knock your house down into rubble, however, the very next update removed all of that and went in a fairly standard, well worn, direction of making a completely safe house where the zombies sit idly outside.  It's like minecraft where they sort of sit outside, hopeing for you to open the door.  Once outside, the game turns into a call of duty nazi zombies gun fight minus the difficulty.  It's like playing round three throughout the entire game.  You could always jack up the difficulty, but i'd rather not have poor AI zombies take 2 shots to take me down.  I'd assume the online gameplay may be better and there are promises of a semi return to their original idea in Alpha 1. but even their promises only offer a semi-return to it "if you make amature mistakes" which doesnt provide quite the same thrill the original Alpha 1 release did for me.  I'd do my research on whether or not the multiplayer is worth it to you, because the core ideas as of alpha 6 are not worth the 35$ i paid.","March 28, 2014","false","51.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Play in creative mode and it's clear the survival detraction from creation is intended to mask the numerous lengthy time sinks. It is not possible to balance time sink, survival, and creation with game settings. As such, this game fails to capitalize fully on any of its many features. In single-player.

This is a great way to develop a game.\n\nThe new GUI is excellent and I can finally craft items without the infuriating need to remember where to place resources in some silly grid. All you have to do is search for the recipe and click craft. This is very simple and very effective.\nInteracting with items is easy and quick. All you have to do is click on an item and you can see every action which can be done with that item. (By action, I mean eat it, drink it, drop it, etc.) The new GUI is also clean and non-obtrusive. There are no silly bars of ambiguity; it's all done with numbers, overlaying a horizontal bar. Genius!\n\n\nZombies in this game are truly marvelous. Thanks to the recently added motion capture technology incorporated into the game, they now move how a real life zombie would move. They limp around in the day and still pose a threat in whatever activity you are doing. What makes these zombies so excellently designed is that they repsond "well" to damage. Something that some zombie games lack. If you hit a zombie, they may become stunned. The zombies will also be knocked back slightly and won't hit you the instant you strike at them. Their growls are scary and this makes for a tense experience at night.\nAt times, the zombie hits will be inconsistent, which can be quite annoying. However, this is an early access game in aplpha, so you shouldn't expect everything to be polished.\n\nJust a little footnote, the zombies look excellent too :-)\n\n\n\nThe random world generation is (in alpha 13.2) average. Biomes have no transition between them. By this, I mean that you may have plains (Savannah-like biome) suddenly boarder a deciduous forest. I hope that the developers will add "transition biomes" to make for a realistic experience. However, the biomes do not negatively affect gameplay, so therefore, there is nothing wrong with them. I just would prefer something a bit more realistic. I have noticed that caves are generated with very, very, very low gradients. I have seen multiple caves stretch for a good 3/4 of a mile not even submerging beneath the desert plains. This is a recent issue and I'm sure it will be fixed. (Once again, this does not affect gameplay, so nothing is wrong here either)\n\nBody temperature works well for the most part, but admittedly, it needs some tweaking. The wetness  system works well though.\n\n\nI have a few issues with the game, though. My first is with the hydration and hunger systems. I think that there should be an option (because not everyone likes hyper-realistic games) to follow the 3 3s, or whatever Bear Grylls once said. "3 weeks without food, 3 days without water and 3 minutes without oxygen." I'd love this to be either a permenant gameplay feature or at least an option. I think it's a bit silly how you can die after 2 days without food.\n\n\nThe final issue, if not the most important issue, is the performance. This game runs atrociously. My laptop isn't bad. I can run Killing Floor 2 at 60fps on just about everything set to max, (apart from AA of course. Who would want that on?!) which I am quite proud of, since the GPU is only a GTX 850M. Anyway, the game runs at about 20-30fps. The only time I've ever got 60fps is when I stare into space. I would recommend waiting for the game to eventually become optimised, or to buy two Titain Xs and run them SLI or whatever it's called. Then, you'll probably get a solid 32 fps. :-D\n\n\nIn all seriousness now, this game is fantastic. The new update is very good and lots of people negatively reviewing alpha 13, just hate change.\n\nI am positive that 7 Days to Die will continue to grow and develop and reach the pinnacle of "survival horde crafting"ness.","August 22, 2015","true","37.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

(about 1 Minute if i'm correct)\nYou can deactivate that setting when Joining a World though, so that is not that Big of an issue.\nIf the Developers would change the Time it takes to Open a Container I would propably even use that Feature, since it Stops you from Rushing through a City, opening all the Things to never be seen again.\nThis is a good Transition to coming over to the Next Downside:\nIts really Easy to just Run through a whole City in less than 10 Minutes or so since the Zombies are rarely an Issue and finding Weapons is way too easy, but the Night takes this Back down because its rather Difficult to Survive if you haven't build a good Base.\nI am looking forward to the Full Release of this Game, and Proud to say that I Supported it since almost from the Start.\nI'd Recommend this to everyone that likes Zombie games with a nice Atmosphere, and Enjoys Fighting off said Zombies in a Self-Made Base.\nI think even Minecraftians will Enjoy this Game.\n\nTL;DR: Its a Zombie Tower Defense game with Crafting elements.\nBuy it.\nThis was my First Real Review of a Game on Steam, let me know if I did good.","May 16, 2014","true","17.2"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","8"

Most everything looks noticeably better.\n\n- Alpha 13 essentially made the game copy more aspects of Ark Survival's interface, so if you like that interface, you'll likely enjoy this factor a bit more.\n\n- The costs for items is a little crazy now, it seems almost randomly chosen with no real rhyme or reason. Some items are changed to the point they are useless now.\n\nExample: for the same amount of materials in Alpha 12 instead of making 25 arrows, you make one. Yes, a single arrow. While this is more realistic, without increasing the power of the arrows to actually make them useful at one arrow per craft... you basically just made them useless as it took multiple arrows in the head to kill zombies at higher difficulties anyway so you'll spend just as much time gathering supplies for arrows in the early game as you would trying to customize your base.\n\nAll of this is understandable and fine. Here's the big problem...\n\nThey completely broke the spawns for zombies. Even at low spawns on the second to lowest difficulty on the first night (yes, the first night) you can literally fight an endless amount of zombies if you're spotted even once. A single screamer zombie (Banshee) will call a horde if it spots you. Normally a single horde isn't too bad, but the problem comes with the additional screamers which spawn close to the end of nearly every horde, before it's actually finished. Nearby zombies can alert them to your presence and if they see you, they scream and summon another horde. This is nearly impossible to avoid at all times in the early game as you don't have any feasible way to destroy screamers at a distance or avoid screamers if they happen to catch you in your house at the wrong time.\n\nSo, if you get spotted once, most of the time it's game over after a long grueling fight which makes you just not want to play anymore.\n\nUp until Alpha 13 I would have gladly recommended this game, but until this is fixed I would recommend steering clear of 7 Days to Die.","December 14, 2015","false","219.2"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","26","46","0","7"

You can find my first review further down.\n\nIn short, 7d2d stole a lot of ideas from games like ARK or Rust and implemented it. Also implemented it pretty bad. I'm not even talking about the tons of bugs, they will get fixed eventually.\n\nNot sure what exactly happened, but I would say that someone else now has the creative lead. One of the strong sides of the game was so far the easy gameplay with a lot of depth.\n\nThis clearly is getting completly changed and complex systems replace the easy one. Systems that add not so much depth, but mechanics that constantly force you to do things. It also prevents you from easy starting anew again. Instead of making the endgame more interesting/rewarding they made the beginning painful (not in terms of difficulty, but in terms of achieving anything). IT's A GRINDING GAME NOW!!!!\n\nA few examples:\n> Characters got gimped and a skill system was implemented that adds nothing except to bring your char back to where he once was without the skill system.\n> There is now poop in toilets\n> There is now a heat system in place that forces you to change your clothing constantly\n> There is just one sort of meat in the game instead of a different one from every animal, in general there are less recipes available\n> The hud got simplified which took a ton of immersion away (you need now to go trough different menus to see for example how hungry or thirsty you are\n> Fighting mechanics took a blow for the worse. Graphics will prevent you from making clear shots, also the way zombies move now make every shot unpredictable\n> You can literally be safe now with just tons of wood spikes around you, building anything more is not fun now but just a pain in the ♥♥♥ that needs tons of ressources to keep it repaired (repairs were free before)\n> Less interaction with objects, less materials, less recipes, takes a lot of immersion away\n> Random terrain generator is completely ♥♥♥♥ed up now - you basically need to build in the desert, because you won't find anywhere else water. And water will now disappear in time.\n\nI could go on for hours like that. The games has issues that would need attention (implement NPCs, make a better random generator, more prefabs, better security against hacks, implement electricity or similar system with logic operators, etc...) but the devs ignore those completly and invest instead only time into changing systems that were fine. As it stands I can only recommend the game to play the older A12 version. That one is a lot of fun. Other than that I'd recommend to buy something else.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nReview for up to version A12\nYes, I recommend it. It's an awesome game and you would miss out a lot by not playing it if you like zombies and/or base building, crafting, survival games.\n\nGrab one or a few good friends, open a server and try to survive against waves and waves of zombies during the night while you scavenge for food, supplies and weapons during the day and fortify your base as good as you can.\n\nAlways in a race against the clock. The game get's harder the longer you play it. Building on a spot generates heat and this attracts zombies. Also every night until the final 7th night the zombies get harder.\n\nIf you survived a week and manage to rebuild the damage you got on the 7th night it cools down. But make no mistake, because week 2 will be harder than week 1.\n\nOnly when you managed to survive around 7 or 8 weeks you will be pretty safe. That's also the time to quit and play on harder difficulty as there is not much else to do after.\n\nMultiplayer Servers work different and would in theory give a longer incentive to play, but be aware, that the not whitelisted multiplayer servers are completly flooded with hackers.\n\nThe game uses the unity engine (big mistake for any serious multiplayer game nowadays) and you will loose all your stuff and well built base because they take it over with hacks. So multiplayer is a complete NO-GO! with this game.\n\nBe VERY AWARE of that before buying it.","December 21, 2015","false","257.0"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Highly unrealistic and highly agravating.\n\n#2 The server version keeps reseeting its time to 22 days once it hits around 45 days. Its done this twice so far in a row... pointless to keep a server up.. especially when two chinese can coe in and blow up my bass in seconds.. literally, flattened gone.. kaput. Cheatprotection, my ♥♥♥,\n\n#3. It's just plain boring. Once your base is built.. its mostly game over. No more fun to be had. Not enoughd ifferent creatures. Not enough different pre-built structures to explore. LOD distance on max settins is unrealistic. I shouldnt be able to see ground splat textures abruptly stop from atop a tower. Endge of map is jus an empty space like far cry custom maps. WTF is this? 1999? Use a proper skybox that blends your terrain to be percievably never-ending, fool.\n\n#4. Placement of objects is annoying. Ever try repairing wooden spikes ? Yeah.. good luck repairing them all. Most will need destroyed then new ones placed. The colision is way way off on the repair tools for the spikes.\n\nI fear these earlt access fames are all mostly the same... boring... buggy and will NEVER ever become a final release.\n\nGood money-making scheme though.. dont ever have to make the game fully entertaining.","March 11","false","105.8"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

If you have been sitting on the fence wondering whether this is just like all the other sandbox survival games out there just stop it and purchase this game right now.\n\nThis game plays great solo, co-op, or pvp depending on your tastes.\n\nThis game delivers a real challenge and you will die a lot at first until you become familiar with what you must do to survive. There is no tutorial but there are lots of videos on youtube and helpful people on the forums to answer questions.\n\nCrafting, building, exploring, survival.....all are done exceptionally well especially for a game at this stage of development.\n\nI have owned this game for 1.5 years as of this writing and can attest that the developers are active and passionate about this game. There is very little risk of abandonment that I can see and even if it were to happen the current game is worth the price all by itself so you just can't lose.\n\nThere are a lot of exploration and survival sandboxes out there but this one stands apart due to its voxel based world and the sheer fun of playing.\n\nNow the negative.... Like all of the sandbox survival games in early access there comes a point where all the threats have been overcome and then the game is boring. The good news is that tougher enemies are planned for this stage of the game and quests and NPCs that you can gather as followers will extend gameplay beyond the initial survival scope. But that isn't in yet.\n\nAlso like all early access games you must be patient and forgiving as bugs and wipes will cause you  pain. But if you enjoy experiencing games as they develop and are interested in the survival sandbox genre you will absolutely love this game.","February 20, 2014","true","113.7"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"

There have been times the updates didn't do what we wanted or, more often enough broke the gameplay. But we have to remember that this is an EARLY ACCESS game currently and it is still in Alpha. The developers are usually quick to fix the game breakers and are making regular progress towards their listed goals. As a singleplayer game, it is fun for a while and definitely worth sinking some hours into. As a multiplayer game, it is fantastic. There are many different interactions in MP with some people being friendly and willing to trade items and there are some who would rather take by force. I was dissapointed most in the map. In a multiplayer environment it was easy to just run around and find people, but now with random world generation, it has become an entirely new game. Perhaps the best feature of this game are the consequences. Every little thing you do has an effect. Drinking unboiled water might fix your thirst for a time, but you stand a good chance of contracting a disease. Eating certain food types boosts energy but drains hydration. Choice of builing location is critical. If you build next to a road or city, someone may find you. Too far away from loot spawns and you're going to tooless.\n\nTL:DR\nThis game is great and offers a lot of features and performance especially in alpha/early access. It can be buggy and there are things that need to be tweaked/fixed but it is worth it to play nonetheless. I highly recommend the game and suggest you pick up a copy to support the developers as they improve this game.","September 13, 2014","true","369.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You need to allocate resources in order to make things yourself, or trade for better items. Need iron armor? Have fun acquiring it. You'll need not only someone friendly to trade it from, or you can hunt for the schematics, items for a forge and recipes, then gather the materials and do it yourself ( my preferred method, I'm only a bit anti-social ).\n\nSo, about the 'Like' or 'Similar To' Minecraft bit : I've never played the game, or seen its cubey appeal, but that doesn't matter too much to me. The main pull from it seems to be the open world mining and building system, and I think its quite fun. In 7 Days to Die, you actually need to think about things like load bearing mechanics, and structural integrity.. though that doesn't mean you can't build some very impressive structures.\n\nAnother nice thing? The Developers update the game with either larger patches, or hotfixes rather frequently. So, if you find a problem or issue regardless of what hardware combo your PC features, there's probably someone else that has either the same or similar issue, and the Dev's know.\n\nSo, here's the end of a review, one of many for the game. Yes, it's an alpha, and it might have the occasional glitch or FPS drop. Thing is far as I'm aware, it's what an Alpha is for : Adding items and fixing bugs, at least a friend tells me so. I believe him.\n\nBeen playing this myself in single player, or on servers with or amongst others since late Alpha 8 or so, it comes reccomended from me.. -if- you like these sorts of game elements, listed above.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ancientaliensguy/recommended/251570/","ancientaliensguy","Ancient Aliens Guy™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ancientaliensguy/","123 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlright, this is one of my first reviews, so bear with me.\n\n7 Days to Die is, as advertised, a survival game with hordes of zombies every seven nights. If you ever get bored in-between then, just visit your local Pass-n-Gass and enjoy decapitating the rotting meatsacks. Anyhow, let’s get down to business:\n\nGameplay  Well, to start, it’s a pretty solid game, really. You spawn in a world, no skills, no equipment, and are forced to figure out how to survive in 7 nights when a horde of angry reanimated corpses comes to rip your face off. You create some simple tools and harvest resources, usually wandering around for a while to find a suitable place to live, collecting flowers, rocks, and cotton as you go on. You can use all of these to your advantage, making teas, dyes, and clothes. Oh, did I mention you spawn in boxers?\n\nYep.\nIt’s pretty normal to be caught with your pants down by zombies. Who knew the apocalypse was gonna be on a Monday?\n\nAnyway, after finding a nice place to build a fort, or hijacking a pre-fab generated by the game (you lazy sack of plant fibers), you can start to make progress. Every action you do in the game gives you experience.  After enough experience, you level up, giving you skill points to put towards skills to increase your advantage against the ravenous horde currently calling dibs on certain portions of your body. These points can, for instance, be used to increase your crafting skill or mining skill, or saved for later,  more beneficial upgrades.\nWhen you’re not starving or thirsting to death, you’re usually looting for nifty items or parts for other crafting tools, like pipes for a furnace. In most cases, you find turds, paper, or just your usual aviator goggles. (I have actually found more of these than I care to recall. They are not useful in any way except for wearing. More pipes, please!) That’s in addition to hungry zombies, who again, want to rip your face off. Occasionally you stroll up on a tool shop or book store and find some really good loot. Really, it’s more often than not, but you get unlucky sometimes. In essence, cities are your best bet for good loot and loads of zombies.\n\nMining and hunting also come into play when you’re finally trying to make a forge. It’s harder than you think. Now, back in the earlier Alphas, it was just some rocks and clay. Then, you put in what you want, click on what you want back, and bam: materials. However, in the recent updates, it is extremely tedious. First, you need a Bellows. This is made by 1 Pipe, 12 Animal Hides, and 8 Wood. So you need to have found at least one pipe and killed at least 2 animals to even attempt to make a forge. So, for the forge now, it requires the bellows you made, 50 stones, another pipe, and 50 clay. Now, you have at least had to find 2 pipes. When I say these suckers are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to come by, I mean it. Maybe not so much in Singleplayer, but in Multiplayer, when 75% of everything you look at is looted; it’s a pain in the ♥♥♥. Back to mining: you need to do this every other day to maintain a steady supply of materials, because they go fast the first time you’re making tools and structures.\nEven though the forge is hard to come by, it is a wondrous tool. Once you learn Steel Smithing from the skill menu, everything gets a little easier.\n\nOh, right, I left out the horde that comes on night 7 to rip your limbs off. About half of the previous comes after night 7, depending on what you have your timescale set to. When night 7 comes, the horde is immediately running to your location to kill you. If you die during that night, you will respawn a ways away from your base/last location, so it’s a good idea to mark with a waypoint where you’re staying that night. The best thing is to wait for morning and kill the horde off. Zombies are much easier to aim at when they’re not running around dodging your axe swings or arrows in the dark.\n\nI probably left some things out, but I'm probably killing your eyes too, so I’ll wrap this next section up quickly.\n\n\nMechanics  To start, it's a voxel game, so there's that. There is no lawn mower, so your fists have to make due. The only way you can flatten a piece of land is to remove the grass/stones/whatever and place wood frames over it. When you place down dirt yourself, its automatically flat. If that was any other way, I would probably eat my hat.\n\nWhen building structures, you have to be very cautious about supporting the floors. Big rooms require pillars for support underneath, so when starting out, build small. 9x9 is a good starting base, leaving 7x7 in the interior when the walls come in. When you know your going to want a basement floor or two, I've found that digging that out and building it up from there is the best method. Digging underneath your current house (with everything you've achieved staring down at you) and supporting it as you go isn't exactly my type of relaxation.\n\nTraps and exterior walls prove an effective way to keep zombies from reaching you. Traps include wood log spikes (upgradeable), normal wood spikes (which break down after some time), and barbed wire. Concrete walls with wood log spikes and some type of net (iron bars) to keep spider zombies from crawling up your walls seem to be a great way to protect your home. When building your home in the plains or somewhere temperate, it’s a good idea to use iron bars for windows and metal trussing for the corners on the window layer. Both of these items you can shoot through.\n(This is starting to sound more like a guide than a review, but I want it to explain about the game in depth, so.)\n\nCrafting is smooth, simple, and effective.  Sub-categories help when looking to craft for experience. That's really all I can say.\nNow, for the ONLY Con of the game:\nI find that the only con of the game is that it is highly unoptimized. the VRAM leaks constantly no matter what graphics card you use, and this can kill frames easily, and has caused my game to crash several times. The only way right now to fix it is to go into the video options and hit 'Apply' on your graphics settings, which seemingly resets the memory when it reloads the visuals. I have a NVIDIA GTX 770 on this rig and I have the potential to run this game on max settings no problem, with only 2 GB of RAM on my card. (Don't get confused, I have 16 GB DDR3 on my motherboard.) If the devs would work on fixing the VRAM leaks and cleaning up the engine a bit, this game would be so much more enjoyable than it already is. Despite this crucial flaw, I still have to give this a thumbs up because it’s such a great game with potential in both the game and the graphics. Cough cough. @Devs.\n\nThank you for reading, and have a good one!","June 4","true","118.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Any respectable gamer knows that isn't even a chop-shop games amount of time to beat. With said time, I've been building the "best fort ever", mining, crafting, getting a handle on the zombie horde times and how to survive them, and playing each and every game mode. All have a great way of balancing the fixes of the other mode. For example, survivor leaves you with a map that will eventually be looted out of all objects left around for you without going into folder files and changing things. When you switch to the zombie horde mode, you get care packages filled with a bunch of random weapons, tools, accessories to survive the upcoming battle. The only problem I've seen so far are the glitches like in zombie horde where the zombies just stop appearing. This could likely be due to not overtaking my strong fort on the first wave and giving up. When you finally feel burnt out of the crafting, scavenging, etc, you do have the "cheat mode" option for your survival game where you can place just about (if not) everything in the game. This fixes your loot problem as you can simply go into cheat mode, fill up bags with these items while on a password basis, and then switch it back to public playing and no cheats. It's great for the server host to keep things fresh, fair, or even down-right crazy. I highly recommend you buy this game if youre a fan of the sandbox/crafter games. It's a huge step up from other said games with a zombie mode- counting graphics, AI, and everything else in the mix.","February 17, 2014","true","547.6"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

A wrecked car sat in the road beside me surrounded by my worldly belongings and the desert wasteland was entirely unfamiliar to me. Gathering up my few worldly possessions I boldly set forth into the unknown and was immediately set upon and ripped apart by a pack of wild dogs.\n\nSo exactly like Silent Hill then.\n\nMy next few attempts fared little better. I tried to break into a house and was snuck up on and stunlocked to death by zombies, I approached a car junkyard and mysteriously died with no apparent cause like in the opening of 13 ghosts, and I had another go at meleeing zombies getting myself stunlocked to death.\n\nPart of the problem is that zombie moans barely change in loudness depending on distance or facing, so a zombie could be trying to extract itself from someone's scummy backyard swimming pool 3 blocks away and you will still hear it hissing in your ear, which makes it hard to tell when zombies are actually close since you just stop listening eventually.\n\nSo I quit for a couple of months and came back in another patch when the sound bug had supposedly been fixed. It's still there but not as bad as before, you can't hear them as far and the sound does somewhat scale by distance, just not very well, and I can at least tell the difference between a zombie 20 metres away and one 5 metres away\n\nNonetheless it seemed like a rather dull survival crafting game. Zombies are easily outrun and can be dispatched with little trouble with an easily crafted bow which fires needlessly slowly and draws out the boredom.\n\nMaybe I'll go play something else. Oh look it's dark now. Oh I can see another player run... oh no that's a zombie! I'll just nerd tower onto this sawmill roof and wait for morning. Oh god they're ripping down the walls! The roof is falling down!\n\nHow I survived that first night I'll never know but with that the true survival horror nature of the game became clear to me. As I told my friend of my experience he replied "Just wait til night 7 lol". "Wait, what's this about night 7?", I replied. "You do know why it's called 7 days to die right?"\n\nApparently on the 7th night a massive zombie horde attacks your location. They know where you are and will claw through wood, dirt and even concrete to reach you. If you stand on the roof or take out the stairs they will rip through the walls til the house collapses and brings you to their level. What's more special zombies start to appear including acid spitters, spider zombies, hornets, dogs and things that look like they belong in attack on titan! What's more, the hordes get progressively bigger every 7 days with new specials and more waves.\n\nSo my next 3 days (as I had reached day 4) were spent in a manic rush to gather supplies and fortify my position. I dug a trench around the house I had taken. I filled it with spikes. I built an extra layer of wall around the first floor with an overhang to keep out spiders. I blocked up the windows and reinforced the doors. I searched for meds, guns, crafting books and crap metals for the defenses. And finally the fated night came around...\n\nAs the sun set the night was erril quiet. 10pm came, 11pm came, eventually midnight came without any activity. Perhaps my friend was wrong I thought, disappointed and relieved at the same time. Anyway by 6:30am when zombies stop running I was barricaded in my bedroom with 5 zombies clawing at the walls, one of which was crawling in through a gap, with 2 bullets left, 5 arrows and a slither of health!\n\nSomehow I managed to survive that and get patched up but it was clear my defenses weren't good enough. And so the cycle continued. 7 days to gather resources and prepare my defenses, 1 night of sheer hell which progressively gets worse each time. I kept thinking I would reach a point where all challenge would end. At one time I had a 4 block deep trench, a 3 block high wall made of metal trussing the second strongest material and one that can be fired through, very high hp, a shotgun, a handgun, hundreds of bullets and a ton of supplies. That was night 42 and saw a ton of acid spitters, I nearly died 3 times that night!

A wrecked car sat in the road beside me surrounded by my worldly belongings and the desert wasteland was entirely unfamiliar to me. Gathering up my few worldly possessions I boldly set forth into the unknown and was immediately set upon and ripped apart by a pack of wild dogs.\n\nSo exactly like Silent Hill then.\n\nMy next few attempts fared little better. I tried to break into a house and was snuck up on and stunlocked to death by zombies, I approached a car junkyard and mysteriously died with no apparent cause like in the opening of 13 ghosts, and I had another go at meleeing zombies getting myself stunlocked to death.\n\nPart of the problem is that zombie moans barely change in loudness depending on distance or facing, so a zombie could be trying to extract itself from someone's scummy backyard swimming pool 3 blocks away and you will still hear it hissing in your ear, which makes it hard to tell when zombies are actually close since you just stop listening eventually.\n\nSo I quit for a couple of months and came back in another patch when the sound bug had supposedly been fixed. It's still there but not as bad as before, you can't hear them as far and the sound does somewhat scale by distance, just not very well, and I can at least tell the difference between a zombie 20 metres away and one 5 metres away\n\nNonetheless it seemed like a rather dull survival crafting game. Zombies are easily outrun and can be dispatched with little trouble with an easily crafted bow which fires needlessly slowly and draws out the boredom.\n\nMaybe I'll go play something else. Oh look it's dark now. Oh I can see another player run... oh no that's a zombie! I'll just nerd tower onto this sawmill roof and wait for morning. Oh god they're ripping down the walls! The roof is falling down!\n\nHow I survived that first night I'll never know but with that the true survival horror nature of the game became clear to me. As I told my friend of my experience he replied "Just wait til night 7 lol". "Wait, what's this about night 7?", I replied. "You do know why it's called 7 days to die right?"\n\nApparently on the 7th night a massive zombie horde attacks your location. They know where you are and will claw through wood, dirt and even concrete to reach you. If you stand on the roof or take out the stairs they will rip through the walls til the house collapses and brings you to their level. What's more special zombies start to appear including acid spitters, spider zombies, hornets, dogs and things that look like they belong in attack on titan! What's more, the hordes get progressively bigger every 7 days with new specials and more waves.\n\nSo my next 3 days (as I had reached day 4) were spent in a manic rush to gather supplies and fortify my position. I dug a trench around the house I had taken. I filled it with spikes. I built an extra layer of wall around the first floor with an overhang to keep out spiders. I blocked up the windows and reinforced the doors. I searched for meds, guns, crafting books and crap metals for the defenses. And finally the fated night came around...\n\nAs the sun set the night was erril quiet. 10pm came, 11pm came, eventually midnight came without any activity. Perhaps my friend was wrong I thought, disappointed and relieved at the same time. Anyway by 6:30am when zombies stop running I was barricaded in my bedroom with 5 zombies clawing at the walls, one of which was crawling in through a gap, with 2 bullets left, 5 arrows and a slither of health!\n\nSomehow I managed to survive that and get patched up but it was clear my defenses weren't good enough. And so the cycle continued. 7 days to gather resources and prepare my defenses, 1 night of sheer hell which progressively gets worse each time. I kept thinking I would reach a point where all challenge would end. At one time I had a 4 block deep trench, a 3 block high wall made of metal trussing the second strongest material and one that can be fired through, very high hp, a shotgun, a handgun, hundreds of bullets and a ton of supplies. That was night 42 and saw a ton of acid spitters, I nearly died 3 times that night! I didn't realize they could spit at me through trussing, then they dug under the walls and attacked me from behind, then I retreated into my house and thye somehow made the roof collapse on me by climbing on it!\n\nI do think I'm finally at a point where I'm untouchable though, night 70 and 77 saw me emerge without a scratch and my defenses barely scatched but I've now reinforced the sides of the pit with 2 layer thick trussing, and placed another double wall with spikes running under it (so if they break through a bit they continue taking damage and their bodies likely block the hole) before the trench. And I now have a sniper rifle as well. However I was playing on moderate settings and I'm told the last patch dropped the number of zombies to the point where veterans consider the game trivial and even released a patch to restore the zombie numbers!\n\nSo I think I will wait a few months til more content is added, then try again with max difficulty settings and the community challenge patch for the challenge of my life!\n\nIn the end I think what distinguishes 7 days from other survival crafters is that it's a true sandbox survival horror. You simply can't waste time on extravagant building projects like in Minecraft, due to building integrity and the very dangerous night hordes you are forced to build for defenses and cannot cheese the game with floating houses. Every minute is precious as you rush for resources or to finish that row of spikes before fun night, and until you become an experienced player you will never feel safe, and even then there are plenty of options for returning the game to the hopeless survival hell we love so much :D\n\nSo final verdict is 8/10. The sound bug needs fixing, there needs to be more variety in enemies and the map edge death zone (the junkyard that killed me) needs to be more clearly marked. Can't comment on the multiplayer Reign of Kings put me off that.

It's a voxel based survival crafting tower defense game that touches on gameplay similar to Minecraft and Fallout 3. At first I was quite apprehensive about this game, mostly because of it's poor reviews and, at that time, the price. I nabbed it when it was on sale, then learned that the developers had lowered the price indefinitely. As I played, exploring immense landscapes, learning crafting recipies, and adapting nighttime survival strategies, I began to wonder why this game had gotten such poor reviews. I know now that I should have bought this game long ago, even at its high price. I have enjoyed watching 7 Days to Die's progress more than any other early access game I have played up to this point. I've found myself on more than one occasion reading players' conflicting suggestions and complaints, then come next update realize that the developers had actually listened to that constructive criticism and developed a method to try to satisfy everybody. You can adjust different settings to cater to your specific preferences and difficulty, even after you have started your game. If it gets too easy, just bump up the zombie spawn rate, or vice versa. I wouldn't recommend this one to gamers who have no patience for early access bugs. Don't expect glitch free bliss with this one. But the pros highly outweigh the cons. Judging by what I've seen the game progress to, I have a good feeling that for us patient gamers who appreciate meaningful development...the end product will be well worth it!","March 20, 2014","true","145.8"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","0"

But off of the fact that if you want to play this game with a friend in a co-op game that is private is almost impossible without spending more money on a server or joining someone else's server. I preferably love this game, great potential, but it is the most aggrevating thing when a friend works his hind end off to get enough money to buy the game, and quickly come to find out that it takes nothing short of money or a miracle to join his friends game. If anyone has found a way to do a private co-op match then let me know. At this point if you have hopes for you and your buddies to survive this apocalypse in a unpenetrable fortress that all of you created, it is not worth it.","April 27, 2014","false","156.6"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","0"

With the added skill trees and the natural progression you gain from just doing random things such as using a bow or crafting is a really nice added feature.\n\nThe game definitely gives you chills, and you can't hide forever, The zombies WILL find you, and one night what ever little shack you decided to stay the night in will be destroyed and you will have to run while a horde of sprinting zombies chase you down. Hope you have good stamina or GGWP.\n\nI did come across a nice place located in the middle of a river, (coordinates 580N, 70E) I've been shacking up here and it survived an attack from a horde, if you are having trouble this is definitely a good place to set up camp\n\nOverall this is a very good game, and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a scary survival game.\n\nPro Tip: Don't fight bears.","May 15","true","89.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

It used to be fun but it becomes more and more of a ridiculous grindfest and if u have a job or you study but want to get far in the game then forget it...\n(i played in a group of 4 and it was still just lots of grinding with no end)\nThe developers try to force you to spent more time in game by making simple things more complicated with every so rare patch instead of actaully adding new content to the game that would keep u busy on advanced stages. On advanced stages its exactly as boring as it was, now it will just take you longer to get there.. trough lots boring and time consuming endless grinding...\nTerrible , lazy solution if you ask me.\n\nPROS:\nGreat Building aspect.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Object/Weapons textures could be way better i mean even the original not HD Skyrim was better and that game is like what 3-4 years old now?The landscape textures are just bad, but they added HD light effects? set your priorities straight...\nSound quality is super cheap. Game performance is poorly optimized if you can talk about optimization at all.\n\n-Glitchy graphics like see trough ground textures. You may eventualy fall trough such a glitch into a endless fall.\nGlitching terrain textures which will form some awkward shapes and block your path so you could even get stuck in them.\n\n-Glitchy zombie animations (which can get you killed)\n\n-Lags ,many lags, even if your machine fits the optimal requirments or is above.\n\n- Finding a decent community is very hard.\n\n- Too many hackers and no decent protection to keep them out.\n\n- Leveling... Well this is the worst level/upgrade system you ever saw besides of the fact that it kills immersion and dances on its grave, It just feels not realistic and annoying as if it was pushed in just to exist because hey all other games have that so lets kinda have one too.All the drops are now level adjusted says you have no chance of getting any even partly decent weapon/tool. It sells it self as a realistic survival game right, says it depends on scavenging and looting for things which will help you to keep the fight and stay alive... those are things which depend on luck , you should be able to find something great or trash... here you will find only trash till you get to a higher level no exception.	 Where is the thrill of what is in the next house im going to loot? What keeps me motivated to go on? 20 more levels of trash and no hope? probably not.\n\n-Extreme time consuming farming for resources. I get it here they wanted to make it suddnly more realistic on this part right? And they did it, exactly on the spot where no one would like it to be.\nI mean did i buy a mining or wood chopping simulator and didnt know it?\nIf i would love to spent hours and hours on braking stone and chopping wood i could as well just go outside now and do it in real life.\nImmersion is great but not in everything.\n\n- Bugs spawn endless stream of hordes for several days which will ♥♥♥♥ your base.\nAt this moment kiss your ammo good bey (which is hard to get) not only because the hords will really not end but also because now you will miss your target even if you aim dead on.\nWhy? Because you dont have the skill points spent on this type of a weapon.... and that is supposed to be a ego shooter? a game where your true aim doesnt count for sh*t?\n\n-You will spent most of the day just eating and drinking or searching for food and drink. There is no end to your thirst and hunger.\n\n- Now the furnace takes like two hours or so (real life time) just to let you use the resources u grinded hours for already.And that is only for you to be able to start crafting and that doesnt include the long crafting times yet.\n\n- The weapons and tool crafting system is insanely bad, back in time you would have to advance from wood to iron to steel as far as you would get those... now u have to level up tool smithing to insanity just to get a dam pickaxe which will not break after some couple of hits. I dont start on the guns.\n\n- Devs dont listen to the community and seem only to fix things which are ultimatly game breaking while closing eyes on other known bugs.\n\n- Fixes take too long or dont happen in some cases, even though they tend to releas some hot fixes after every patch there are too many bugs which survived over a very long period of time.\n\n- I see no new content for almost a year and god this game lacks on that.\nAnd when they do add some little new thing to the game, that thing is going to be bugged!\nlike those mini bikes,that took you hours maybe days to put together and would glitch trough the ground on your first ride saying bey bey. just one of many examples.\n\n-PvP is crap. Besides the hackers that will destroy your base no one can raid anyone! Because of the land-claim block which makes buildings indestructible.\nAgain one point where they need more immersion but hey stone chopping realism was top priority i guess so they had to leave the less important game aspects out.\n\n\nI could go on for a longer list but i think this is enough info to form a opinion on the product.\nIts very sad how they keep ruining this game.\nAnd by now the game it self looks like a dead end. Sadly i see no future for this project, I would be happy if they would prove me wrong though.\n\nDo i recommend this game? No, definitly not anymore!\nI would strongly recommend to not buy it at the current stage.","April 27","false","771.1"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","20","35","0","0"

Wait no more! This game truely has a coop mode where everyone teams up and kills the infected. It contains elements from minecraft and survival games including Day Z. When you play during the day you might say to yourself, the zombies only walks, and the only real threat is the Police man and the zombie dogs. INCORRECT. At night all thoses walking zombies you can out-run them in just 1 second are now running, stronger, and more dangerous then before. Even a Vertern player with the best guns can fall and become zombie food at night. So what do I do at night if the zombies are too deadly?!?!?!? Well there's 3 options, go at them at full speed and get kill in 2 seconds. Be a sneaky snake and pray they dont find you. Or you can man up and build a home!!! That's right you can build your own home. Now I'm safe right? NOPE! Zombies can smell and hear you still and they can look through windows. There some special zombies like the spider zombie that can climb up to your so called "sniping spot" on your roof and slaughter you. At day you must gather food, water, weapons, and supplies. At night you must stick to the shadows... unless you and you're friends are epic enough to take on what ever comes at you! Craft things like pistols, sniper rifles, smgs, crossbows and hunting knifes to stay alive. Make a farm to ensure that you have a steady food supply coming in. Get a bucket and make a well so you have unlimited water supply, make sure to cook that water because lake water isn't safe during a zombie invasion!! I highly recommand playing this game WITH A FRIEND. More friends you have, the better! Oh god, it's like Day Z, it's going to take forever to find friends... NOT! In this game you can add your friends and track them on the map and meet up with them fairly easy. Craft sleeping bags in ensure that you spawn in your home if you have even fallen in battle with the undead. Make a giant wooden house, a small metal house, or maybe an undergroud base! (make sure you dont make a home to big or you can break your leg, a broken leg is going to make you slower and you can't run with a broken leg! Leave supports for your underbase as well or it might just fall on you!)","September 7, 2014","true","106.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I wasnt very knowledgable with sandbox games and how much fun they can be. If you are the type of person like myself with a busy personal life but seeking a game that is challenging/easy going (subject to your game set up options) alot of fun and prefer to enjoy coop with friends than online inc pvp then look no further. Having the freedom of doing whatever you want to the environment and building bases to survive, looting, crafting, messing around with friends for giggles and having to look over your shoulder from zombies especially during the night then this comes highly recommended. We all seek different needs from a game and i am easily satisfied with one. With the randomly generated worlds coming in one of the next updates this game is always going to be fun for me personally and others who enjoy this sort of thing. You can make the game as hard as you want or as easy as you want with the ingame options but may have to do a little bit of trial and error to find the most enjoyble setup.

Scary monsters banging on your house, and you'll be there, crouched with your crossbow, ready to shoot out of any hole that will appear in your shabby, wooden house.\n\nBesides this, you'll also have a long list of items to craft, different areas to explore, and to build your own.\n\nThis is an alpha, and it shows.  They have some tweaking to do on their game so it's more efficient for FPS & smoothness (particulary for multiplayer) , as well as add more content.  Still, even in its current state it is already a game that will hook you to your pc for days and have you looking forward to every future update.\n\nIf you like this genre, this is definetly worth your time to check out.","April 8, 2014","true","161.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It is still in developement, but is better then anything most major game studios have put out in years.  Easily.\n- If you at all have interest in killing zombies then this is for you.\n- If you at all enjoy immerisive survival(ie splinting your leg when you take a fall, drinking boiled water instead of water straight from a pond) this is for you.\n- If you like exploration this game is VERY MUCH for you.\n- If you like crafting/building games (ie minecraft) this game is right up your alley.\n-Please note, this game will take you more then a half hour to understand.  It is hard, you will die, a lot.  Once you get your feet under you, and start procceding along the learning curve, the game opens up and is quite exciting. I have been playing avidly for over a week now and I am still being amazed by the content I am discovering and starting to incorporate into my play style.  (ie farming coffee so I can go caffine crazy and sprint like a track star.  etc)\n\nFurthermore, it should be mentioned that when creating custom worlds to play in the user can extinsivly customize the game settings, tailoring the game to whatever is more entertaining for their particular play style and interests.  (ie I have a friend who doesn't enjoy survial games, he plays it as just a FPS zombie horde slaying, exploration game.)\n\nIn conclusion, this game brings together aspects of a lot of games, in one package that functions quite well and provides a challenging, immersive, custimizable, and extremely fun experience.  Expect to find your self playing this game significantly more then you may of anticipated. I sure have!\n","October 2, 2014","true","157.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It's totally minecraft meets The Walking Dead... there are a few things that still need some work and things, but for a game that is still in its Alpha stage its agazing\n\nUpdate:\n\nFrom the time of this initial review till now there have been some substancial changes. Random Gen. maps, lighting adjustments, physics, etc. you can read the patch notes if you would like a complete list of changes. there are sill a few minor flaws with the game but in my opinion it is VERY polished and functional for an late alpha stage game. Mining, salvaging, crafting, farming, sandbox free-roam / build. and Zombies.. we can't forget the zombies. The zombie AI is a bit... off if you ask me, but thats just my personal take on it. bodies de-spawn WAY to quickly after death leaving you unable to loot all the bodies when say a small horde of 8-12 zombies are finished off you have have the opertunity to look say 3-6 depending on your speed and how quickly you dispatch the group.\n\nThere is a hang up with cooking fires and forges when maps hit around the 900+ day marker where you can put fuel and ingreadents in, but the timers don't count down and therefor don't make your food / water / smelt, etc.\n\nBlock tie-ins are a personal annoyance to me and a few rotations on specifics as well. for example the Iron Bars. when placed you can ONLY place bars in the vertical orientation from left to right, front to back, diaginal etc. you can't rotate them to place then horizontal AT ALL for placements like ledges or overhangs. They also DON'T tie into the blocks around them as they don't "occupy" the full block there is a gap on the side of them that is easily walked thru... and thus zombies can bypass them aswell.\n\nThese are a few of the flaws I am aware of, but have come to accept as this game is still in development and is progressing VERY nicely and is updated often with LOTS of improvements and changes. In closing, its WELL worth the $$ for the amount of time you can easily spend in game exploring both your survival instinct and your creative side.\n\n\nUpdate: 5/2/15\n\nThe game is now in 11.4 and is progressing nicely, there are above ground nodes for iron and random underground tunnels in the game, the random gen world system is in my opinion working VERY well. the recent glitch fixes for duping have been nicely fixed. there are a few graphic anomalies when zombies are killed, you break/sprain legs a bit to easily when jumping/falling at heights of 6-8ft...? heights of 15-20 ft or higher I could understand, but such a short distance is a bit much. zombie decay is a bit too fast in my opinion especially if you kill 10-12, you don't have time to loot them all before the bodies decay. Other then that I think the game is progressing at a very nice rate and the Dev. Team is doing a remarkable job with this game.\n\nIn short, If you like Minecraft, but with better graphics... you'll like 7DTD, If you like survival and Zombies.... You'll like 7DTD.\n\n5/12/15  new issue found\n\nWhen disconnected form servers while crafting ALL mats in crafting window including crafted items not yet taken are gone... I was crafting rebar frames and had about 33 left to go when poof, disconnected and and when reconnecting ALL the mats and all remaining frames were gone with the wind... over all still worth buying","April 6, 2014","true","454.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It's still in Alpha, but playable with a few bugs (sniper rifle).\n\nI would compare this to a L4D2/Minecraft combination. With that being said, the game can get frustrating at the begining, but once you have a system down it becomes less frustrating and more resource stockpiling. In that it is a combination of those games, you will see alot of enemies that are very simular to L4D2 enemies. Cops are almost identical to the Spitter in the series. A few enemies are quite unique and can be a headache while trying to gather equipment. The idea you have to build everything is quite simular to Minecraft, except the list of available items to create and thier plans are all right there, removing the need to go wiki to look up ingredents.  The game does last longer than 7 days as a contridiction to the title, which is nice.\n\nThere are many different options when starting a game. From single player to multiplayer, random map or Storyline map. The options of what happens to your gear when you die, how often items reset, how often airdrops happen, and even the legth of each day (way awesome).\n\nSome very interesting ideas that the game does offer is the ability to become infected, suffer from injury and disease, and attract zombies with some of the items you can have in your inventory. The ability to go into "sneak" is almost exactly like Skyrim, to include the HUD icon.\n\nThe multiplayer portion of this game is what seals it down as a great game. When set up right it makes things interesting for a 4v4 multiplayer map as teams can fight over resources in an area, all while also trying to keep from being killed by zombies.\n\nThe down side to this game is that the crafting time can be really long and some resources aren't easily available as fast as you will go though them (brass and gas). If you don't have a good balance of difficulty you can find yourself spending your time just grinding with little to no challange.\n\nTips: Leave your zombie run to Default, set your bag to "delete" when you die, and set your day/night ratio to 50%.","January 10, 2015","true","450.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I kept checking back and reading reviews and forums to see how it was coming along even though I owned a copy.   I was waiting to see when it reached a point where family and friends might decide to dive in.    That point was reached a few weeks ago.\n\nI downloaded the Dedicated Server and fired it up in my house.   Myself and two of my sons jumped into it and spent A LOT of time dying.   We loved every minute of it.   We could immediately see it could be a challenge and it had a lot of things to do.    The effects of drinking unpurified water from lakes, rivers, etc and getting the little squatting and pooping icon in the lower left corner while you run around with the effects of diarhea is just one of numerous funny things.   However, the game is serious and even though that is funny it is a serious thing and is simulated as such.   It is only funny to realize the game simulates to that level and can be quite amusing.\n\nAs this game is in early access it keeps getting better and better.    This is all my son, and wife have been playing for about two weeks straight now.   They'd put spikes strategically in river crossing points for zombie hordes, they've built towers for sniper posts, they've dug and built larger underground homes with large amounts of storage, they've established corn, cotton, coffee, potato, blueberry, and other farms near their location.\n\nThey currently exploit a bug where if you are deep underground and stand close to a wall and look up it will clip and you can see the surface way above you and watch the hordes of zombies wander around.    This game is very stable from our experience, has a ton of features, and is for the most part bug free.    It has come a long way and can be a lot of fun.\n\nAlso, if you've wanted a more co-op Zombie Survival game than the DayZ fare and don't really want to deal with the PvP aspects that is an option here.   However, it can be also run in the free for all style where newbs are fair game to camping  veterans who hunt them.    Our personal dedicated server this is not a problem and we just deal with surviving and exploring in the environment.\n\nIt does have a standard map that it uses, but it also generates random maps that work really well.\n\nIn this game surprisingly the DESERT biome is a nice place to be.

I kept checking back and reading reviews and forums to see how it was coming along even though I owned a copy.   I was waiting to see when it reached a point where family and friends might decide to dive in.    That point was reached a few weeks ago.\n\nI downloaded the Dedicated Server and fired it up in my house.   Myself and two of my sons jumped into it and spent A LOT of time dying.   We loved every minute of it.   We could immediately see it could be a challenge and it had a lot of things to do.    The effects of drinking unpurified water from lakes, rivers, etc and getting the little squatting and pooping icon in the lower left corner while you run around with the effects of diarhea is just one of numerous funny things.   However, the game is serious and even though that is funny it is a serious thing and is simulated as such.   It is only funny to realize the game simulates to that level and can be quite amusing.\n\nAs this game is in early access it keeps getting better and better.    This is all my son, and wife have been playing for about two weeks straight now.   They'd put spikes strategically in river crossing points for zombie hordes, they've built towers for sniper posts, they've dug and built larger underground homes with large amounts of storage, they've established corn, cotton, coffee, potato, blueberry, and other farms near their location.\n\nThey currently exploit a bug where if you are deep underground and stand close to a wall and look up it will clip and you can see the surface way above you and watch the hordes of zombies wander around.    This game is very stable from our experience, has a ton of features, and is for the most part bug free.    It has come a long way and can be a lot of fun.\n\nAlso, if you've wanted a more co-op Zombie Survival game than the DayZ fare and don't really want to deal with the PvP aspects that is an option here.   However, it can be also run in the free for all style where newbs are fair game to camping  veterans who hunt them.    Our personal dedicated server this is not a problem and we just deal with surviving and exploring in the environment.\n\nIt does have a standard map that it uses, but it also generates random maps that work really well.\n\nIn this game surprisingly the DESERT biome is a nice place to be.   You can survive on Cactus fruit, and make Yuka Juice. :)   It has quite a number of Biomes.\n\nMore realism is hopefully coming in the future such as greater thirst in deserts, and needing to have clothes or something suitable in the winter environments.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subOptimized/recommended/251570/","subOptimized","(sub)Optimized Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subOptimized/","23 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFriday 7 March 2014\n\nFirst off, I would like to say that this game was not always fun or playable for me. When I got it in Alpha 6 for $25 bucks, it took forever to load and initialize, the game lagged badly and frequently, and there were definitely some features, such as the random map generation mechanism, that simply were not there. My laptop is running Windows 8 with a 2.7 GHz AMD processor and 4GB of RAM, so lag should not have been a problem according to the posted game requirements. It made me upset, and I was very unhappy that I was unable to play the game I had just dropped $25 on.\n\nAnd then along came Alpha 7.\n\nThe developers "crunched hard" on making Alpha 7 significantly better, and they kept their word to release it by the end of February. I logged onto Steam on February 28, and ---BAM-- there was an update for 7 Days to Die. It was about damn time for something to be done about the games' various bugs and alpha shortcomings.\n\nWhen I opened this game after the update, I was overjoyed to see that the lag problem had almost completely vanished, new items, patches, and options were in place, and that I could finally start enjoying the game.\n\nSo far, I am loving every aspect of this game, especially the realistic strategy and tactics. One of my favorites is putting hub cap land mines in various clusters around a Survival Horde map. When they explode, they both kill the zombie that activated it, and draw all the other walkers toward the noise, away from me.\n\nI would say that 7 Days to Die is definitely worth the $25 I paid for it, although you might want to wait for a sale to pick this one up. Can't wait for Official Release!\n\n\nP.S.-If a developer is reading this:\nI would really like to see the random map generation feature released soon, so that by Alpha 8, we can all make unique maps to play on. That is the biggest thing that I absolutely can't stand about this game currently. Great game! Thanks for working hard to improve it.\n\n\nUpdate:\nThursday 10 April 2014\n\nAfter the 7.9 update, I have to say I am rather unhappy with the current Co-op and Multiplayer abilities, but very hopeful for their future. Something this game seems to never be able to shake off entirely is its lag problem. If one update makes the game run smooth, the next may bring it back down to, make it worse than, or make it better than where it was originally. I know that the devs are working hard, as is evidenced in their persistent updates.\n\nI will still recommend you wait for a sale (perhaps the Spring Sale in a week or two?) to buy this game, as $25.00 is kind of a lot for the game in its present state.\n\n\nUpdate:\nSaturday 24 May 2014\n\nIt has been two days since the release of Alpha 8.2, and I am very impressed with the way that this game is maturing. It has certainly come a long way since I got it back in Alpha 6, and I believe it is safe to say that it will only continue to get better. Ever since Alpha 8, I haven't experienced any major lag, frozen screens, and glitching (except when I set off ~100 barrels of oil- then there's a few second's delay), and with the addition of land claim blocks to go along with improved co-op and multiplayer options, my private server is all ready to go for my friends and I.\n\nI really like how you can get a potentially deadly 4-stage infection now if you are attacked by the undead, and require appropriate medicine (antibiotics) to save yourself, as well as the newly implemented clothing and armor system. Although I am getting a little anxious waiting for the random world generation option, I have to remind myself that I haven't quite explored all of Navezgane yet due to being occupied with building my reinforced-concrete-and-iron-bars bunker.\n\nAlso just trying to survive in general now requires some effort, as I refuse to play on Beginner and Adventurer difficulty anymore---I am not saying that you are somehow a wimp or noob if you currently play with or prefer to play with these settings for whatever reason, but I have enough experience that I can now turn up the difficulty and have tons of fun, rather than die of starvation, zombies, radiation poisoning, thirst, etc., every 15 minutes, like I did for the first 5 hours of playing this game. Give it time, you'll get there, and then you'll have many hours of exciting and challenging gameplay ahead of you.","March 7, 2014","true","68.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Crafting:\n- Building: You can craft pretty much whatever you want to build out of. Cobblestone, brick, prick paver for a pool, stone, whatever.\n- Traps: You can also craft pipe bombs, sharpened sticks, land mines, use spider webs, anything to help fortify your hold.\n- Food: Yes you can make multiple kinds of food though a cooking and items like gas cans through the chemistry system.\n- Aestetics: What fun is the zombie apocolypse if you can't have pretty things in your house? You can now craft items (or steal them, and tv's/paintings from rich people), to decorate your house!\n\n2. Fighting:\n- Players: ALWAYS fun\n- Zombies: The way the game is set up the person who hosts (if they choose to host) gets to set the "difficulty" This is an actually impressive customized system. The host is able to set anything from zombies: How many zombies, how hard they hit, if there will be zombies at all (thats right you can turn off zombies and other enemies COMPLETLY if you just want a  pvp game) and if the zombies will run or not. It also lets the host decide how the day/night cycle is handled, if there will be more light than dark, etc. Also how many hits blocks take to break, and more. It lets you and your friends (or just you) have a customized experience. For added fun turn down the damage you do, increase the zombie health, make night predominent\nand turn on running. Oh and increase the spawn rate of  zombies by 200%, really, trust me,  it's so fun.\n- Weapons: Many different types of weapons including guns (snipers rifle, shotgun, piston, machine gun), crossbows, melee weapons, or if you're feeling like just plowing through people, pull out a chainsaw or auger.\n\n3. Ambience: The background noise for this game is ridiculous. It actually has made me jump a few times. Nothing like being in the middle of a ruined city, hearing the wind blow around you and then..a baby's scream.\n\nThis game updates VERY often, and really does listen to the community. The developers really seem to care about this game, and i've been very impressed with it so far.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns I had with this game before I bought it though was the ability to play on a server with JUST my friends. This game lets one of your friends "host" a game and load up a server just for your friends, so have no fear! Also an added bonus is the fact you can CHANGE GAME settings whenever you load it back up. All your progress is saved AND you can change it. Finding zombies to much? Easy log out, reload and change it.","March 19, 2014","true","175.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Yes.\nLook further down for a longer explanation.\nI recommend this game, simply because the game is brilliant and it only gets better with multiplayer. This is a great game for you and your friends and you are gonna have a good time. However, this is not a perfect game at all and I will list my impressions of this game so far (remember it's early access, things can change).\n\n+\nYou can play alone, with friends on LAN and on servers\nGame cointains Navezgane-map and random generation. Navezgane will be boring to play after a while because you will get to know the map quite well. Random generation, however, will create your world entirely random as for landscape and prefabs via a seed system like in Minecraft.\nMany recipes for craftable items for building, weaponry, armory, food, drink, medicin. You start with basic recipes and will unluck some as you find recipe books.\nSmart gravity, fitness and quality system makes the game a lot of fun; even after 10 hours because the world feels alive, you can improve your stamina, so there is a reason for playing it awhile and the quality range as for weapons and tools makes many items unique and rewards the player for her/his hard work.\nMany lootable places such as houses (small ones, tall ones, big ones), waste bunkers, cinemas, supermarkets, shopping carts, vaults, weapon shops, gas stations, banks and apartment buildings.\nDifferent types of enemies: Zombies (feral zombie, slow zombie, fast zombie, nurse zombie, spider zombie), dogs, bees. There are animals as well (although they're not aggressive. Bears will come in an update soon, though)\n\n-\nThe game is not optimized at all, even after switching to Unity 5 (the engine on which the game is build).\nEven on a high-end pc, this game won't look particularly beautiful, at best it will look decent.\nDifferent bugs (which might/might not be fixed) such as: Texture flickering, extreme impact from small jumps resulthing in sprained or broken legs, some zombie bodies will bug out (you'll know when it happends).\nThere are too many server wipes and not enough people to fill out the variety of servers.\n\nFinal conclusion and a comment:\nCurrently, the game is 8/10 in terms of overall quality. Play it for gameplay and content, not graphics. Otherwise, you will be disappointed. As for my final comment, I will talk a little about the developers: The Fun Pimps. The game is, as you might already know, in early access and it is being updated frequently. These updates are big updates cointaining huge chances such as Unity 5 and random generation, but also smaller updates addressing bugfixes and improvents. In other words, the updates are very various. However, as for the developers, communication isn't what they do best. When they wanted to switch to Unity 5, it took months and many people was frustrated because of the lack of information on steam. However, if you are interested in their project, whether you have the game or not, check out their tumblr account. Look for Joel Huenink on Tumblr and youtube and you will get an insight as to what they are currently working on.","May 6, 2015","true","130.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kratoscrux/recommended/251570/","kratoscrux","Fasio_Vita","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kratoscrux/","990 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is by far the best in its genre.\n\n7 Days to Die is the perfect mix between crafting / survival and building / sandbox. The multiplayer is very similar to that of RUST or Day Z on public servers, with a much more intricate crafting and building system.\n\n7DTD is like a combination of everything good about Minecraft and RUST. It has a voxel based, infinitely generated world and block based building system similar to Minecraft, and a crafting system that far exceeds that of RUST. There are randomly generated points of interest, including many shops and stores filled with valuable loot. Three types of animals can be found (pigs, deer, and rabbits) and the zombies are plentiful and varied.\n\nThe gameplay is multi-staged as you build and grow a base. Scavanging is essential to find food and water in order to survive another day, until you are able to start a farm for food. There are many different types of edible items, some of which give positive or negative buffs.\n\nThe buff system is a masterpiece. Eating rotten food will lower your stamina temporarily, coffee can increase your stamina for a period of time, and zombies will infect you with enough damage. Antibiotics will cure your infection, but they are rare to find and hard to craft. Luckily it takes days for your infection to progress, up to three stages before you will die from it giving plenty of time to find that essential cure. Painkillers increase health over time as well as medical bandages, and a hit from an enemy can cause you to bleed out if you aren't careful.\n\nThe penalty for death is extreme. Every time you die, your wellness is lowered by 10 points, meaning your maximum stamina and health goes down 10%. Wellness starts at 100 and goes up to 200, but for a new player this is a crippling handicap. Increasing your wellness is very hard to do, as the only thing that really helps is the very uncommon antibiotics. You can cook several types of items together into a pie that will increase your wellness, but during the early game without a farm this is an impossible feat, and the benefit is very small. If you are experienced enough to survive, increasing your wellness will double your health and prevent you from dying nearly as much.\n\nEvery 7 days a super horde spawns, with many powerful zombies that will see you nomatter where you are. You can not hide, you can not run. As zombies run at night, having a base strong enough to survive their assault is required. Scavanging for and building guns and bullets to fight the horde is an intermediate skill, as you need to mine for coal and potassium nitrate in order to create gunpowder.\n\nNow that the positive things are out of the way, here are the negative things. As I'm writing this review during early access, please note that some of these things might change. First off, the wellness system needs some work. Once you die a few times it is nearly impossible to get back to full health. They have attempted to fix this by making it scale to your health, so the lower your health the more wellness you will get but at it's current stage it is still very flawed, and detracts from the game experience. This is especially important for new players, who will find themselves unable to damage zombies or sprint for more than 10 seconds at a time.\n\nThere are still many glitches present, most notably the fireplace glitch. Sometimes when cooking large amounts of food or water you will lose everything. Occasionally you will duplicate an item. This is a serious glitch that I hope gets addressed soon. I have wanted to quit many times after hording enough food and water to survive, just to see it dissapear before my very eyes. If you have a full inventory, harvesting your crops will result in losing your crops, as harvested plants don't drop but instead dissapear. If you are crafting an item and log out, you will lose everything in your crafting area. This is very bad because certain items, such as TNT, take a long time to craft and you can forget that you are crafting them and log out, leading to a large waste of very precious resources. There are a few other glitches but none of them are noteable here.\n\nAnother gripe I have is the lack of tutorial or information, similar to Minecraft. Almost everything in this game can be found by playing, but certain things like food recipes and controls aren't very obvious such as the RUST-like opening of doors and fireplaces. It would be nice if they added readable books in the environment to at least address this issue.\n\nAlso the ingame voice chat could use some work as it does not seem to function well or at all, and communication in a game like this is absolutely essential.\n\nMy final verdict is to BUY THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY. The develeopers The Fun Pimps are constantly updating this game with bug fixes and new features, but in it's current state it is well worth 30$. I Kickstarted this game because the quality was immediately visible, and it has now become the gold standard of early access in my opinion. I would strongly recommend that you play this with others as the difficulty is rather high, and building / defending a base with friends exponentially increases the fun. If you have ever enjoyed Minecraft, RUST, Day Z, or other similar games like The Forest, this game is a must buy.","December 17, 2014","true","473.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

WHICH I TOUGHT WAS UNFAIR. http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999172691/recommended/251570/\n\n"Alpha 9 was the zenith"\n\nYou mean back when you could rush in the city, get an auger and a sniper rifle (effectively ending the game) and be out before night fall? Not that nightfall mattered back then zombies were so slow and stupid it was too easy to kill them with any melee weapon.\n\nA9 was way too easy and became tedious much faster, now you at least have a sense of progression. You can't have everything you need in the first hours of the first day.\n\nDog hordes on the 6th day: why not? Any half-competent player can deal with them with spikes or with a bow. I welcome those dog hordes it added a sense of urgency to what you did prior to day 6/7.\n\nItem quality was a GREAT addition, maybe you didnt read the dev's plan for this game but they always mentionned they wanted more RPG features. It prevents you from running into town day 1 and getting every weapon/tool you'll ever need. Gives a sense of progression. Only thing I agree with you here is the "forge ahead" book. But they removed that and made the recipe harder, which was a nice move.\n\n"In my first few spawns on literally THE easiest, most bludgy settings that still involved zombies I died in under 2 minutes." Sorry but that's a l2p issue, dogs can easily be outrun and bears can be heard from miles away and give up very fast. No reason you should ever die to them.\n\nThis review sounds like a lot of complaining for the sake of complaining, a lot of players have adapted their play style and love the new difficulty much more then before. Alpha 9 was the easiest alpha they ever released, it was a cakewalk and you were done with the game by day 7.\n\nP.S for all potential buyers, give it this game a try. It's only getting better and better despite what some players, who refuse to adapt, are saying.","August 21, 2015","true","691.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

Love the mix of crafting with first person shooter aspects, along with the building physics which add a nice touch. Generally I feel a sense of desperation while I play it as zombies whittle away at my defences during the night and I have been scared ****less as those flying hornets that fly straight at my face. I find this game gives me a decent amount of enjoyment and is a good time killer.\n\nUnfortunately, these experiences are somewhat dulled down due to a clunky interface and fractured gameplay. This can be mostly forgiven due to it being in alpha stage of development so nothing is going to be perfect, however the price tag is misleading and gives the impression of a far more polished game. £22 is ALOT to be spending on an unfinished early access game, and does not match the experience and features that you will get. I understand that the developers may be looking to boost their funds to continue polishing this game, but £22 is a long shot for a game that has this many issues. I have to admit that if I hadn't seen youtubers play this game I would not have paid as much as I did, and if I had the opportunity now I would rather wait until later on when the game is more complete until I commit myself to buying it.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? In the future, maybe. In its current state? Probably not. Although it is guaranteed to give you a few laughs and some enjoyment, I would recommend waiting to see how this game unfolds before you part with your cash.","December 15, 2013","false","3.6"," 75 of 142 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","75","142","0","4"

It's a great game to mindlessly play at low difficultly settings while listening to some crap. ;)\n\nThe game has been updated frequently and now has some real good looking graphics after updating to Unity 5. Along with the updated graphics comes optimizations. I never get low frames that much anymore even with maxed settings.\n\nStill a great game to play.\n\n\nThe following is my thoughts and experiences of the game after 48.7 hours of playing alpha 8 through 10.4 hotfix.  (December 21, 2014)\nMy experience has been a little less enjoyable after playing for so many hours straight. Hordes spawn too fast with as much as only 2 minutes between horde attacks even when the game is set to low spawn rates. It's only day 3 on this new world, I don't think they should be coming this fast. But I guess that just adds to the challenge that many say is the proper way to play the game.\n\nThe game's unoptimized state has never really bothered me that much as I was always able to maintain a good 60 in nearly all parts of the map with settings turned to low or off. The city was where it'd some times drop to 50 and below. But with how fast these hordes are spawning my fps frequently dips to <30fps while they're around making the game stutter and hard to defend against attacks.\n\nEven with these issues I'm still going back to the game multiple times a week. It's great watching the game slowly take shape with each update from the dev team!\n\n\nThe following is my thoughts and experiences of the game after 22.8 hours of playing alpha 8 through 10.1.  (November 30, 2014)\nI like it.\n\n\n\nThe reason I had any interest to pick up this game was because of the Game Society Pimps and their videos. If not for them I might of just passed on this game.\nThis is a very fun open world sandbox zombie survival game.

It's hard to believe that a game with graphics this bad can run so poorly. Even if the terrible looking enviorment and zombies don't bother you, the unstable framerate is ridiculous.\n\nThe combat system is garbage, probably the worst hit detection I've ever seen in a first person game. A zombie can strike you from 2-3x their arm length. You'd swear it's a latency problem but then you realize you're playing single player. Escaping from zombies doesn't seem possible anymore, they can spawn a few feet in front of you right out in the open.\n\nI didn't mind the incredible amount of time between updates when it was actually improving the game.

I have been around this game since the days of alpha 8. However I cannot recommend this game in its present form. Alpha 13 broke so many things that didn't need tweaking in the first place. The crafting system is gone (it’s still there but is a former shell of itself) right clicking is gone to search is gone. The whole new interface practically slaps you in the face to break immersion it simply doesn’t fit. It looks like a computer interface it’s too clean almost if that makes any sense. the inventory interface doesn't feel like it belongs in a survival game rather then a down and gritty crafting aspect we are left with something that has all the recipes listed that you can just click on and it auto crafts them for you what did this need fixing ?. Zeds take forever to kill now, and can still hit you from 10ft away. The rate at which you get cold or hot is way off balance.

It was literally my favorite game, I remember calling my cousin just to tell him he needs to buy it so we could play together. He doesn't even play games, I was just so excited I wanted someone to ♥♥♥♥ around with on this crazy new game I found, it was so fun.\n\nThat was back in A9 or so, though, and I hate to say it's gone downhill from there. While the game improves visually (it's honestly damn sexy for a voxel game especially if you get to play it on max) the fun just slowly disappears. I'm not getting bored of it, it's just getting not fun. Crafting is being dumbed down while survival is getting harder, the interface has been so simplified that it's become complicated (it makes sense if you've played it) and the scavenging/foraging has turned into literally nothing more than "hold click until the tree/rock/dirt's healthbar reaches nil" which takes absolutely forever on everything now and just makes it feel even more repetitive than it already was.\n\nI've tried a few times to play it during A13 and now it's finally reached the point where I just can't. I'll try again in A14 but for the time being I can't even reach the point where I can craft a forge (literally the point where the game actually starts) without giving up out of boredom. It's just grinding now, except instead of killing zombies you're killing foliage. It's much less suspenseful.\n\nIf they can stop trying to complexify and simplify at the same time I think the game's still got a chance, but right now the game's developers seem more confused than I do and that's never a good sign.","December 31, 2015","false","165.6"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","18","32","0","0"

And that is AFTER they've manged to SLOWLY grind their way to the same action speeds new characters had when starting in A12.5! Front loading the tedium to make you EARN to have fun later is not the way to go.\nYet one of the more prominent people in the  developer team for this game is very rude, and constantly acts dismissive of many complaints the community has with the game. His fanboys are even worse, and it's frankly sickening to watch.\n\nSo, why do I?\nBecause the game, at its core, is really good. It is, and it has so much potential to get even better. If this was still A12.5 I'd recommend the game in a heartbeat.

Yes there are a hundred minecraft clones out there, but this one really takes the win in terms of actually fun.\n\nEven just being in alpha, there is a lot you can do and more is being added over time. One thing that I really like about the game is buildings and mines actually have a structural integrity.\n\nBy that, you can't just build a skyscrapper and expect it to stay standing. Even a one story building that is built to large will collapse. Mineshafts also have to be kept small otherwise they will collapse on you.\n\nNow, being in alpha, the game does have its occassional bug. Right now in a world with my friends, we barely get any zombies to spawn and when they do, they spawn walking towards our location in a line of anywhere between 10 - 40 zombies. The other day when I wasn't playing, they told me a wave of at least 50 showed up.\n\nDefences are helpful but do not last long with the zombies. Different kinds of zombies and enemy types add interesting elements to the game.\n\nOne example is normal zombies will just attack your building when they sense you and you can easily repair the damage, but Cop zombies actually puke corrosive bile at the building and destroy blocks instantly.\n\nWe have yet to hit night 7, as we had to restart our world a few times to get the hang of the game, but it sounds like it will be a real challenge.\n\nOne last fun item is exploring the world is a real treat! Nothing makes you happier than finding an Auger in a random building, which makes digging out a mine 100x easier.\n\nMake sure you have the wiki for the game open if you plan on playing!

Behind you, a stange moan emerging from the trees.  A walker pushes forward and savagely pursues you with humger in its eyes.  Do you fight?  Do you run?  You get one hit in and then are scratched by the creature, begin bleeding out.  Your only hope is that you are not infected as you quickly apply your last bandage and run for cover.  After running a great distance and forging for food, you feel your stomach rumble as you enter a town.  It is swarming with walkers.  If you stay quiet, they may not see you.  The sun is beginning to set, they thrive during the night.  Now it is time for another choice, do you creep into the town hoping to go unseen, running for the safetly of a boarded up home?  Or retreat into the woods, hoping a small hole will hide you until dawn?  How will you survive the first night?**\n\nI cannot say enough about this game- it is exactly what I hoped for!  If you enjoy the gut-wrenching fear of being chased by zombies (most especially for the first several days), mixed with an open world full of crafting, scavenging, and building- then this is certainly a game worth purchasing!\nI remember the very first days on the server, with little to your name besides a jar of water, can of beans and a torch.  You are then forced to run or fight, build better weapons, search for food to sustain you and board up and existing home or create your own for the fear of night where the zombies become feral and of course, preparing for the doom of the 7th day horde.\nThis game has a variety of zombies, lots of variable difficulty options, tons of loot, a completely interactive world, things to craft, things to learn and all with the added fear (at least for me) of being bitten and eaten alive.\nI love this game!","January 15, 2015","true","413.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was intrigued by the trailer and when the game went on sale I bought it. I don't have a true dedicated gaming computer and I can't run the game on the high setting like you see on some of the YouTube videos of this game and I've never gotten my FPS past 30. That being said I love this game.\nThe up and down side of this game is that it does not hold your hand and tell you how to do anything. The first three days I played I spent in an adrenaline soaked fearfest. After spending the night crouching and doing nothing in my fortified prefab I made some sort of noise and within moments dozens of wicked fast zombie ripped the walls down and tore me to shreds. After logging off in a panic I went to various wiki pages and YouTube to educate myself. After learning the massive crafting system and the all important first day order of operations (check out Oak's Game Room 7 Days to Die tips and playthroughs) I have since been able to make it 7 days without dying consistantly. I have not played much multiplay and no PvP (for me the zombies are enough to think about, thank you) but I can see the draw, especially because once you've had a chance to make a base, mine ore, find and read the books, craft guns and ammo and stockpile food you become a stand alone army. You will go from hiding from the undead to carrying meat around to attract more, allowing you to further cull Zach's population. That chilling fear of ever present death will be replaced by the rush of power as you look down in complete safety as the undead rush toward your stronghold and kill themselves on your redundant defences, leaving you to tend your garden in peace.\nSince the game is in Alpha (I started in 10.4) there are still some major changes coming down the road and a few bugs (very rarely crafted items will disappear from the crafting window if you search for something else), but the game is very playable and quite fun. There are plans to make a story with missions and so on, but there is none of that now and it is still crazy addictive.

I have seen some reviews compairing it to Minecraft, they must have been a bit of time ago because the game has come a long way since then. The land and items are no longer blocky. Hills are a nice and smooth incline and you don't have to jump constantly to navigate it.\n\nThe crafting system is great. Some things, like the stone axe (whice normally is the first thing / weapon / tool that you make) can be crafted from the onset of the game. Other items you have to find the recipie and learn it to be able to craft the item. There is also a time element in the crafting, depending on how complex the item depends on how long it takes to make it. The good thing is that if you need to craft a lot of something, like say arrows, once put the items in the grid and start the crafting you can close your inventory (which is where the general crafting grid is, there isn't a crafting table) and the items will keep crafting. It's great especially when you have a group of zombies on your tail and you run out of crossbow bolts. There are several forms of crafting in the game but I will let you figure those out.\n\nThe zombies, in my opinion, look and act pretty darn good. There is a nice amount of zombie models and they look good. What might put some off is that even though there are a good amount of different models of zombies, each specific zombie looks the same. The big fat zombies look all the same, no variations. That is no big deal to me, the rest of the game more then makes up for it. The zombie animations are good as well. Sometimes they might act a bit wonkey when traversing an obstical, like when they are stuck in a spike trap they have a tendency to hop and hop. They are creepy as hell when you have a bunch of them shambling towards you and completely terrifying when they are running straight to you (if you have them set to run) with arms out stretched. If you do have them set to run at certain times of the day, the game gives you a great sense of urgency. You know you better be inside somewhere before they start running because you will be dead if you don't, unless you are armed to the teeth.\n\nThe devs are great. If the community askes for something, they try to put it in. If the community then decides they really don't like the change they take it out. I have never had the oppretunity to talk with the devs, but everything I have seen on the fourms shows that they listen to what the community.\n\nThis is my first review and I hope that it has helped some. If you are still on the fence check out some reviews or let's plays on your favorite video site. But if you like zombies, get this game. If you like crafting, get this game. If you like getting the ever lovin crap scared out of you when you are holed up in the attic of a house and the zombies are outside tearing the house to pieces and you know any second the house is going to collapse, then GET THIS GAME!!!!","January 30, 2015","true","30.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I like that there actually is a danger out thereand your bases must be designed wisely. Getting the perfect base takes time, and you might end up losing everything after some weeks of surviving so the game is a constant challenge.\n\nThe online gaming is great most players are nice and respectful, even on PVP, sadly the game seems to have poor security, cause twice in one day hackers logged in and screwed the game for some players. Losing everything to a horde or a fair fight with another player is ok, but spawning TNT through the walls is just frustrating, but that happens rarely and it's a very small minority of the players.\n\nStill a few lags and bugs, but nothing game breaking and very enjoyable during LAN parties. If they keep developping in that direction this game will stay awesome and get even better.","January 16, 2015","true","518.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The fact it's still in Alpha makes that even more impressive.\n\nFighting off zombies hordes while trying to find enough scraps of food and cups of clean water to survive long enough to mine for resources to build a defensible safehouse has never been so much fun.  Add to that the exhilaration of creating and detonating TNT....and you have a damned-near perfect game.\n\nThe A11 update still has a few bugs (though I haven't experienced as many as others), but it restored my excitement about playing 7DTD.  Zombies are freakin hard to kill now, it's nowhere near as easy as it had been to run aound out in the open, and crouching now rightly makes movement painfully slow!  Though it's aggravating as hell to have to recraft so many early weapons/tools because my quality is low since I haven't leveled much yet, I find this adds even more tension to the game.","January 19, 2015","true","831.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Found some meat, and had some walkers on my butt within moments. Soon after, I noticed a giant Wasp, which cottoned on to my existence and stung me to death.\n\nNow, after that whole death spam, I made it into a derelict metropolis, noticed a lovely building with plenty of easily exploited areas for drop pits, pungees, and all round safety for my scaredy-cat self. I went out after the first night had finished, hearing sounds of a plethora of walkers that wanted my tasty flesh and took axe to skull... got overwhelmed, and died. Nobody looted my corpse, so that's a bonus. I then began constructing my ultra-secure, 4 story building repairs. Not a soul made it into my place alive.\n\nI began making high powered weapons, and had a very great secondary and tertiary base, all nice and cosy, away from dogs and wasps. The downside being: your bases only have 1 mattress over all bases, so, essentially your respawn may not actually be anywhere near your homebase (really, I'm just an idiot and didn't realise soon enough).\n\nPROS:Super duper easy to kill yourself from things like - water, food, rancid food.\nGet drunk.\nSo. Much. Space. I literally ran for DAYS attempting to reach end borders, or other signs of civilization. I found a few rebar drop fortresses but that was few and far between.\nZombies are smarter than the average bear - they can sniff you, they can hear you.\nWhen night comes, an immense sense of oh shi~ begins. When you get weeks into survival, you can still get mobbed by ever increasing intelligence.\nRespawning gun safes, cabinets, book shelves; which all allow recipes and blueprint discoveries - so fun collecting whole sets!\nPlaying with friends, especially new friends on vent, TS, Skype etc. is hilarious when they're trying to find you and hilariously get mobbed to death before you arrive.CONS:While the Zombie design is cool, there's a lot of rehashed skins, there's little variety to actual Zombies - essentially bruisers, fast walkers, slow walkers, and occasionally a bloat type...\nDogs suck balls.\nWasps suck even more balls, especially without some kind of Crossbow/ Gun on hand.\nUnderestimating falls and leaps; easily gib yourself...\nSometimes dogs and wasps can warp into your shoeboxes (if you're out on the hunt and need a safe area to die if you're too encumbered).\nClimbing Zombies, which I guess is technically a pro, because they also show you your base flaws.\nOverall, I really enjoy this game, it's too bad I don't get to play it more, really. P.S. While there are a dime-a-dozen free world Alpha Zombie Survival games, this one does have a certain, I don't know what that really tickles my fancy.","January 31, 2015","true","24.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The last one was based on 30 hours of gameplay. That might've been when the game was at Alpha 5, 6 or 7.\n\nThis is for you, the reader & gamer; NOT the devs!\n\nYou are probably looking to invest time in a survival game. There are plenty out there, including "Survival: Postapocalypse Now" selling for $4.99 at the time of this post. It doesn't matter cause you will NOT find a better, more complete survival gameplay experience, IN ALPHA for that matter, anywhere out there today.\n\n- 7DTD now uses the Unity 5 game engine. Depending on your system, the graphics are fabulous. Even when running at any setting less than HIGH or ULTRA. Excellent framerate and control responsiveness.\n\n- The gameplay has really been expanded. The zombies behave like zombies but they aren't totally out of control or spamming wrecklessly all over the game ruining your experiences. That doesn't mean they aren't tough, though. They can be hell to deal with at times. Very challenging encounters will be had.\n\n- The crafting system is much better than most. Items are abundant in 7DTD, BUT, the crafting system is where this game is shining. You will have access to a host of recipes from the offset; however, you will gain more recipes from exploring the huge map (more on that later). You can craft weapons, armor, food, health kits, supplies, housing materials, tools, resources, resoucres for other resources, booby traps, mines, smithing items...the works.\n\n- Your character can level up based on a lot of things like: killing, cooking & eating, or just surviving over a period of time; meaning the day and night cycles. I still haven't quite figured that part out yet but i'm sure you'll find it in the Wikis.\n\n- THE MAP! Oh god, the map. This map is huge. The devs have done an excellent job of making a world in which it will literally take FOREVER to explore everything. You will come across stuff to explore almost at every third step. There is trash on the sides of the road, in the road, on the road, in the woods, in the desert, in the snow, in the buildings, on the hills, by the river bed...there is a chance to loot and find USEFUL stuff all the time. There are cars to loot, buildings to loot, graveyards to loot, zombies to loot, chest to loot, backpacks to loot, purses to loot, suitcases to loot, gunsafes to loot, camping grounds to loot, dead half eaten bodies to loot, ruins to loot, dead animals to loot....\n\n- At the time of the review, we can only hunt deer, rabbits and pigs. They make for good eating and supplies. They help boost your character level as well. The only downside is that I can't craft a head mount for my walls. I would luv to be able to kill a deer, loot its head, and craft a trophy mount for my wall. There was a post somewhere that said the game will add bears. I hope they add moose, wolves, bobcats, badgers and mountain lions too. And add that freakin' wall mount to the crafting system.\n\n*** But lets talk about what you came here for: the gameplay. When Unity 5 was introduced, I died a lot. They made the game more difficlt at the beginning by making early craftable tools weaker. By dying so much, I had to change my tactics. Now that I'm used to it, I find the gameplay much better this way. It forces me to explore the environment in search of better loot, weapons and resources to craft.\n\nSpeaking of dying, as bad as it is to have to start over, the good thing is the random starting position you're subjected to if you have NOT made a home base. Without my bed roll, I could die in one place and respawn a world away in another place. Oh, don't worry. Everything I had in my backpack and on my belt is still in the place I died. I just have to get there. Sometimes that would take 7 days and nights, I kid you not.\n\nSo I have a choice: pick up loot and start another backpack or not touch anything and try to get back to MY backpack. Or I can place a waypoint on the backpack and start a new backpack. So if I die again, I'll know where both backpacks are. But that's neither here nor there because what I want to share with you is what happened when I respawned.\n\n+ One time I respawned in a rural area on the side of the road. I made a trek toward my last backpack and ran across this HUGE factory. I never saw it before and didn't know it was in the game. Of course, I had no weapons, no armor nor clothes of any kind, and a crap load of zombies alerted to my presence. I'll be back!\n\n+ I respawned in a field of tall grass. After running for my life, I came across this large campsite. While still running from zombies during the twilight of the day-to-evening cycle, I blow up. As I'm waiting to respawn, I'm asking myself, "What the hell just happened?"\n\n++ On the very next respawn, I went back to the place I blew up. By now it is completely dark and the zombies are in their night time frenzy. I get close to my back pack and "KABOOM", I blow up again. Okay, now I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\n+++ New respawn during the evening. Crouched down, didn't move, and waited for daylight. Made my way back to the land of death...and my two backpacks. Well holy ♥♥♥♥! Found out why I died twice without a zombie touching me. This ain't no "campsite"! It's a military bivouacing installation heavily protected by a huge mine field. Again, something I had NO IDEA was here! So now zombies are chasing me. Fine. I maneuver in such a way that they perish to beautifully orchestrated explosions across the early morning skyline. Now, lets get down to business! :)\n\nAs I sign off here, I'm on my way to retrieve another backpack that has all my armor and other goodness I need to correlate with the goodness I just looted. No spoilers!!!\n\nIn short, I not only recommend 7DTD; I encourage you to try it for yourself. I thought about getting The Forest & Project Zomboid among other titles. To be honest, nothing holds a candle to 7DTD. There are so many things to do that never get accomplished by the time the next patch is rolled out. It took me a realtime week to loot out a town of about 16 different buildings. I looted several houses, a few garages, a gas station, store, a school and a couple of municipal buildings. The next week, I strolled down the street and found an even bigger neighborhood. If you really want something to invest in, to cure that bordem, to find an ultimate survival gaming experience; I say place your bets on this thoroughbred. Your own experiences will be better than ANYTHING you find on videos OR reviews!","May 8, 2015","true","95.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's an intense struggle to survive but usually the most fun.\n\nMiddle: You have a somewhat decent base that'll keep you relatively safe during the night and getting food/water isn't as bad as it once was.\n\nEnd game: You have a pretty OP base, more than enough food/water to survive for quite awhile, many guns, loads of ammo, and you are pretty well off on gear. (This is the least fun part of the game for me)\n\nThe game was a blast while just playing PVE with my girlfriend, however if you enjoy PVP then you won't be let down by this game either. Playing on a pvp server is filled with suspense. One second a guy who's naked says he is friendly, the next he is trying to chop your head off with an axe just so he can jack your stuff.\n\nThe game has a ton of playability, there was only one VERY SMALL bug that I ever encountered while playing and it wasn't even close to game breaking, and the developers are actively adding new stuff to the game.\n\n7DTD is definitely worth the $25, however you can find it on ♥♥♥ for like $8-9 if you would like to save quite a bit of money.\n\n10/10","January 20, 2015","true","190.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The moral of the story never trust a bridge in the middle of a zambie apocalypse. 9.5/10","February 9, 2015","true","23.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","0"

I might have put some time into this game so far. Almost entirely on random generated worlds- each start being a unique experience and extremely rewarding. I started with the basics and now I've modded just about every xml file to personalize the gameplay experience even more than the very thorough options they give you in the menu.\n\nMy wife and I play on a custom server together (that was easily made in about 5 minutes) and we are honestly excited about every update and often check the dev blogs to see what is coming down the pipe.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. Hell, this is not even close to the finished product they have promised. This is a game that is still in Alpha. But the thing about this game... it's so good and addictive despite the state that it's in and the updates ARE coming, and the development team IS  keeping an eye on the community's ideas and  complaints- that I have faith that when the finished product arrives it will be exactly what was promised. And more importantly, I'll be happily playing while we wait for that day.\n\nYou may not want to put the money in on it today- I totally get that.

It's an intense struggle to survive but usually the most fun.\n\nMiddle: You have a somewhat decent base that'll keep you relatively safe during the night and getting food/water isn't as bad as it once was.\n\nEnd game: You have a pretty OP base, more than enough food/water to survive for quite awhile, many guns, loads of ammo, and you are pretty well off on gear. (This is the least fun part of the game for me)\n\nThe game was a blast while just playing PVE with my girlfriend, however if you enjoy PVP then you won't be let down by this game either. Playing on a pvp server is filled with suspense. One second a guy who's naked says he is friendly, the next he is trying to chop your head off with an axe just so he can jack your stuff.\n\nThe game has a ton of playability, there was only one VERY SMALL bug that I ever encountered while playing and it wasn't even close to game breaking, and the developers are actively adding new stuff to the game.\n\n7DTD is definitely worth the $25, however you can find it on ♥♥♥ for like $8-9 if you would like to save quite a bit of money.\n\n10/10","January 20, 2015","true","190.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The fact it's still in Alpha makes that even more impressive.\n\nFighting off zombies hordes while trying to find enough scraps of food and cups of clean water to survive long enough to mine for resources to build a defensible safehouse has never been so much fun.  Add to that the exhilaration of creating and detonating TNT....and you have a damned-near perfect game.\n\nThe A11 update still has a few bugs (though I haven't experienced as many as others), but it restored my excitement about playing 7DTD.  Zombies are freakin hard to kill now, it's nowhere near as easy as it had been to run aound out in the open, and crouching now rightly makes movement painfully slow!  Though it's aggravating as hell to have to recraft so many early weapons/tools because my quality is low since I haven't leveled much yet, I find this adds even more tension to the game.","January 19, 2015","true","831.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Found some meat, and had some walkers on my butt within moments. Soon after, I noticed a giant Wasp, which cottoned on to my existence and stung me to death.\n\nNow, after that whole death spam, I made it into a derelict metropolis, noticed a lovely building with plenty of easily exploited areas for drop pits, pungees, and all round safety for my scaredy-cat self. I went out after the first night had finished, hearing sounds of a plethora of walkers that wanted my tasty flesh and took axe to skull... got overwhelmed, and died. Nobody looted my corpse, so that's a bonus. I then began constructing my ultra-secure, 4 story building repairs. Not a soul made it into my place alive.\n\nI began making high powered weapons, and had a very great secondary and tertiary base, all nice and cosy, away from dogs and wasps. The downside being: your bases only have 1 mattress over all bases, so, essentially your respawn may not actually be anywhere near your homebase (really, I'm just an idiot and didn't realise soon enough).\n\nPROS:Super duper easy to kill yourself from things like - water, food, rancid food.\nGet drunk.\nSo. Much. Space. I literally ran for DAYS attempting to reach end borders, or other signs of civilization. I found a few rebar drop fortresses but that was few and far between.\nZombies are smarter than the average bear - they can sniff you, they can hear you.\nWhen night comes, an immense sense of oh shi~ begins. When you get weeks into survival, you can still get mobbed by ever increasing intelligence.\nRespawning gun safes, cabinets, book shelves; which all allow recipes and blueprint discoveries - so fun collecting whole sets!\nPlaying with friends, especially new friends on vent, TS, Skype etc. is hilarious when they're trying to find you and hilariously get mobbed to death before you arrive.CONS:While the Zombie design is cool, there's a lot of rehashed skins, there's little variety to actual Zombies - essentially bruisers, fast walkers, slow walkers, and occasionally a bloat type...\nDogs suck balls.\nWasps suck even more balls, especially without some kind of Crossbow/ Gun on hand.\nUnderestimating falls and leaps; easily gib yourself...\nSometimes dogs and wasps can warp into your shoeboxes (if you're out on the hunt and need a safe area to die if you're too encumbered).\nClimbing Zombies, which I guess is technically a pro, because they also show you your base flaws.\nOverall, I really enjoy this game, it's too bad I don't get to play it more, really. P.S. While there are a dime-a-dozen free world Alpha Zombie Survival games, this one does have a certain, I don't know what that really tickles my fancy.","January 31, 2015","true","24.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The last one was based on 30 hours of gameplay. That might've been when the game was at Alpha 5, 6 or 7.\n\nThis is for you, the reader & gamer; NOT the devs!\n\nYou are probably looking to invest time in a survival game. There are plenty out there, including "Survival: Postapocalypse Now" selling for $4.99 at the time of this post. It doesn't matter cause you will NOT find a better, more complete survival gameplay experience, IN ALPHA for that matter, anywhere out there today.\n\n- 7DTD now uses the Unity 5 game engine. Depending on your system, the graphics are fabulous. Even when running at any setting less than HIGH or ULTRA. Excellent framerate and control responsiveness.\n\n- The gameplay has really been expanded. The zombies behave like zombies but they aren't totally out of control or spamming wrecklessly all over the game ruining your experiences. That doesn't mean they aren't tough, though. They can be hell to deal with at times. Very challenging encounters will be had.\n\n- The crafting system is much better than most. Items are abundant in 7DTD, BUT, the crafting system is where this game is shining. You will have access to a host of recipes from the offset; however, you will gain more recipes from exploring the huge map (more on that later). You can craft weapons, armor, food, health kits, supplies, housing materials, tools, resources, resoucres for other resources, booby traps, mines, smithing items...the works.\n\n- Your character can level up based on a lot of things like: killing, cooking & eating, or just surviving over a period of time; meaning the day and night cycles. I still haven't quite figured that part out yet but i'm sure you'll find it in the Wikis.\n\n- THE MAP! Oh god, the map. This map is huge. The devs have done an excellent job of making a world in which it will literally take FOREVER to explore everything. You will come across stuff to explore almost at every third step. There is trash on the sides of the road, in the road, on the road, in the woods, in the desert, in the snow, in the buildings, on the hills, by the river bed...there is a chance to loot and find USEFUL stuff all the time. There are cars to loot, buildings to loot, graveyards to loot, zombies to loot, chest to loot, backpacks to loot, purses to loot, suitcases to loot, gunsafes to loot, camping grounds to loot, dead half eaten bodies to loot, ruins to loot, dead animals to loot....\n\n- At the time of the review, we can only hunt deer, rabbits and pigs. They make for good eating and supplies. They help boost your character level as well. The only downside is that I can't craft a head mount for my walls. I would luv to be able to kill a deer, loot its head, and craft a trophy mount for my wall. There was a post somewhere that said the game will add bears. I hope they add moose, wolves, bobcats, badgers and mountain lions too. And add that freakin' wall mount to the crafting system.\n\n*** But lets talk about what you came here for: the gameplay. When Unity 5 was introduced, I died a lot. They made the game more difficlt at the beginning by making early craftable tools weaker. By dying so much, I had to change my tactics. Now that I'm used to it, I find the gameplay much better this way. It forces me to explore the environment in search of better loot, weapons and resources to craft.\n\nSpeaking of dying, as bad as it is to have to start over, the good thing is the random starting position you're subjected to if you have NOT made a home base. Without my bed roll, I could die in one place and respawn a world away in another place. Oh, don't worry. Everything I had in my backpack and on my belt is still in the place I died. I just have to get there. Sometimes that would take 7 days and nights, I kid you not.\n\nSo I have a choice: pick up loot and start another backpack or not touch anything and try to get back to MY backpack. Or I can place a waypoint on the backpack and start a new backpack. So if I die again, I'll know where both backpacks are. But that's neither here nor there because what I want to share with you is what happened when I respawned.\n\n+ One time I respawned in a rural area on the side of the road. I made a trek toward my last backpack and ran across this HUGE factory. I never saw it before and didn't know it was in the game. Of course, I had no weapons, no armor nor clothes of any kind, and a crap load of zombies alerted to my presence. I'll be back!\n\n+ I respawned in a field of tall grass. After running for my life, I came across this large campsite. While still running from zombies during the twilight of the day-to-evening cycle, I blow up. As I'm waiting to respawn, I'm asking myself, "What the hell just happened?"\n\n++ On the very next respawn, I went back to the place I blew up. By now it is completely dark and the zombies are in their night time frenzy. I get close to my back pack and "KABOOM", I blow up again. Okay, now I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\n+++ New respawn during the evening. Crouched down, didn't move, and waited for daylight. Made my way back to the land of death...and my two backpacks. Well holy ♥♥♥♥! Found out why I died twice without a zombie touching me. This ain't no "campsite"! It's a military bivouacing installation heavily protected by a huge mine field. Again, something I had NO IDEA was here! So now zombies are chasing me. Fine. I maneuver in such a way that they perish to beautifully orchestrated explosions across the early morning skyline. Now, lets get down to business! :)\n\nAs I sign off here, I'm on my way to retrieve another backpack that has all my armor and other goodness I need to correlate with the goodness I just looted. No spoilers!!!\n\nIn short, I not only recommend 7DTD; I encourage you to try it for yourself. I thought about getting The Forest & Project Zomboid among other titles. To be honest, nothing holds a candle to 7DTD. There are so many things to do that never get accomplished by the time the next patch is rolled out. It took me a realtime week to loot out a town of about 16 different buildings. I looted several houses, a few garages, a gas station, store, a school and a couple of municipal buildings. The next week, I strolled down the street and found an even bigger neighborhood. If you really want something to invest in, to cure that bordem, to find an ultimate survival gaming experience; I say place your bets on this thoroughbred. Your own experiences will be better than ANYTHING you find on videos OR reviews!","May 8, 2015","true","95.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's an intense struggle to survive but usually the most fun.\n\nMiddle: You have a somewhat decent base that'll keep you relatively safe during the night and getting food/water isn't as bad as it once was.\n\nEnd game: You have a pretty OP base, more than enough food/water to survive for quite awhile, many guns, loads of ammo, and you are pretty well off on gear. (This is the least fun part of the game for me)\n\nThe game was a blast while just playing PVE with my girlfriend, however if you enjoy PVP then you won't be let down by this game either. Playing on a pvp server is filled with suspense. One second a guy who's naked says he is friendly, the next he is trying to chop your head off with an axe just so he can jack your stuff.\n\nThe game has a ton of playability, there was only one VERY SMALL bug that I ever encountered while playing and it wasn't even close to game breaking, and the developers are actively adding new stuff to the game.\n\n7DTD is definitely worth the $25, however you can find it on ♥♥♥ for like $8-9 if you would like to save quite a bit of money.\n\n10/10","January 20, 2015","true","190.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I pretty much got it when it got on steam, and wow what a great 2~ish years it has been.\n\nIf you are looking at a game in early access, you want one thing, and thats propper development.\nWell stop looking since this game had exactly that and much much more.\n\nIn the years i played it up till now, this game has always been great, and it just keeps getting better with every update. This review is for version 14.5, but i will also take the development in the past years into account.\n\nIll give an overview of pros and cons, then a summary of when to buy this game, and last some game tips and tricks for when you start off.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros;\n+ Large open world, multiple biomes each with a unique feel to them\n+ Interesting, realistic and versatile crafting system\n+ Great gameplay (controlls, movement etc)\n+ Skill and level system\n+ Good grafics, and music\n+ Lots of  tools and weapons, for everyone something (melee brawling, guns blazing or stealthy, you can play how you like)\n+ Lots of loot and building materials\n+ Weather system, that changes depending on the biome your in.\n+ Set world, random generated worlds, single player and multiplayer (with easy to set up server)\n+ Propper development, every update makes the game better\n\nCons;\n- Its an early access game, meaning you might encounter some bugs, and saved games might not work after major updates.\n- Loading screen takes long when you start the game up.\n\nThe few bugs or gliches that i have encountered in the past years are few and got fixed in a matter of days sometimes even hours.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen should you buy this game?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you like Zombie games, Survival, Crafting, Building, Lots of loot, the option to play the way you want, and a game that keeps getting better with every update, this is the game for you.\n\nIf i had to compare this game with other games, i would say it reminds me of Minecraft, and survival games like DayZ, Rust etc.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow i will give some tips on how to start off, beware of MINOR SPOILERS!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLast updated: April 2016\n---------------------------\n\nWhen you start off in the world you get only the most bastic needs, a bit of water, and food, a torch, and a bandage.\nFirst thing you want to get as fast as posible, is a stone axe, the game tells you in a little tuturial what to do. You need to pick up stones laying arround with the button ''E'' or hit some boulders with your fist (left mouse button), then you need some grass, hit it with your fist to pick some up.\nThen you need wood, any tree or bush will give you some when hit.\nYou can craft the stone axe in your crafting menu by pressing ''TAB''.\n\nThe stone axe is a multi purpose tool that is your new friend, you can use it as a club to smash zombie heads, use it as an axe to chop down trees, and a pickaxe to get stone.\n\nMake sure you pick up a lot of stone, wood, and grass becouse you will be making lots of stone axes.\n\nYou might want a save way to kill a zombie here and there, the bow is a cheap and easy item for this.\nYou will need some wood, and grass to build the bow, the arrows can be made with stone, wood and feathers.\nFeathers can be found in bird nest that are scattered on the floor here and there (and in or on some buildings)\n\nFood/Water; you can fill glass bottles and empty cans with water from rivers and lakes, also you can cook the water on a campfire so you wont get sick.\nFood can be cooked in different ways, altough not all food needs to be cooked to savely eat it, all canned food can be eaten right away.\n\nSurviving is your main priority at the start of the game, you want to loot as much as you can and stay away from zombies, getting hurt early in the game is a bad idea, and dieing (if you dont have perma death on) will lower your wellness, wich is the maximum hitpoints and stamina you have.\nOnly take out the lone zombie here and there if they are in the way of a building you want to loot, by using a bow and/or using the hit and run tacktic. Try hitting zombies in the head.\n\nYou can find Cloth fragment by looting, breaking down clothing you find, and by crafting it from cotton plants (those bushes with white fluffy balls on it). You will need it for making bandages, and first aid bandages in case you get hurt.\n\nWhere to survive your first night: Its best to find 2-4 buildings together, and choose the highest one. There you would want to make your first base at the top floor or roof.\nWhile one of the  buildings will be your starting base, the other buildings can provide food and materials to survive.\nIf you play with a seed or random generated game, you might have to do with what you find, always try to be from the ground so zombies cant reach you straight away. (shops have a flat roof with a ladder at the back and will do just fine)\n\nEvery 3 days, unless set differently a plane will fly over and drop a supply crate, this always contains resources like antibiotics, medkits and sometimes other suplies.\nIf you get infected you have 3 days to live unless you take antibiotics or honey, so make sure you get that crate, since its a great help.\n\nUsefull loot: Canned food, Water, Medical suplies, Mining helmet (great protection and flashlight that you can turn on with ''F'')\n\nTips!\nIf you are having trouble with surviving at night, instead of setting the dificulty lower, you can also set the zombies to always walk. As default the zombies run when its dark and walk when in (day) light. I always have them set to walk becouse it feels to me like zombies should walk.\nThis however does not affect zombie dogs.\n\nDont go into cities or any big cluster of buildings, more zombies and also stronger zombies spawn here.\n\nEvery 7 days at night time a horde will come for you, if you are having trouble with them or find them anoying, either keep moving when they come or go back to menu when they have spawned and then go back into the game, and they will be gone.\n___________________________________________\nI hope this review was usefull to you.","January 6, 2015","true","537.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Nothing, but I just saw my own profile and the games I played.\n\n7 days to die just shot up to 2nd place in most spend game time. and I would not be surprised if one day Skyrim will lose its number one position on my list of most played games/spend game time.\n\nNow I utterly dislike minecraft, for the reason it just looks to blocky, the way it looks does not say the gameplay of minecraft is bad, cause  a lot of people from age 5 till over age 50 are playing minecraft, for me , I tried minecraft but i just hate the graphics, and yes im a gamer that prefers quality graphics over gameplay.\n\nBack to 7 days to die:\n\nNow admitting on what i said earlier, graphics over gameplay. 7 days to die might not be looking as stunning as some 1st person games, still its appealing enough.\n\nI don't quite understand what exactly grasps me so much in this game, its maybe just does moments where you sitting in the dark, and hear the zombies near you, trying to demolish the building arround you when they sense you.\n\nThe sound effects in this game are very well done, the sound of a nearby spider zombie just creeps me the heck out.\n\nThere is a certain magic about this game which enchanted me to play it for nights in a row.\n\nJust the mere and vast creativity on what you can build. (conerning that i might start to understand people who play minecraft a little bit better, still nope I cant get past the blocky minecraft graphics, i wont touch it)\n\nNow in all honesty, this game is still in alpha and i was not there at its beginning I just start playing about a week orso, but for an alpha this game is worth the monies! and the support.\n\nIt only gets better in the future.  I hope so.\n\nso yeah if you use your pickaxe and spend a few hours to cut away all the concrete support pillars and the building still wont collaps and it just floats there on an invisable barrier, its probably somethign they will fix later :)\n\n---------------------------\nConnectivity / multiplayer\n---------------------------\n\nI dislike PVP,  but i like to play coop.\n\nI found that its very hard to see your game listing when you start a public game.\nbut if you are playing this through steam, just start the game, and then let your buddies join your game through VAC ( so they need to click your name in their steam friendlist and say join game).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell, a lot of talk, and maybe my first adn only longer semi.. review...or just personal feelings about the game.\n\nhere is the short version of my review:\n\nDEV TEAM: TAKE MAH MONEY!!\n","September 9, 2014","true","335.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, after watching Markiplier and LordMinion777 play it, I decided to give it a shot.\nWithin minutes of playing, I already became addicted and wanted to play more.\nMy two best friends also recently bought the game and we decided to try it out together. At first it was a little rough, all of us were spawned so far from one another and it took us a while to meet up. We did have to start over a few times until we got a hang of the game. But once we were able to group up and figure out a plan, we were able to get a grip on the basics farily quickly.\nThis game is alot of fun and well put together. The zombies are actually scary (esapecially at night), the different biomes are amazing and well put together and the survival is a bit of a challenge but fun.\nOne of my favorite things is the consequences for your actions. Most zombie games you just charge it, weapon firing and if a zombie got too close you would just lose a bit of health that could be replenished with a health kit then you carry on. But in 7 Days, zombies are more of a threat for you not only lose health but can get infected, bleed or even break bones, each of which require something different to heal you. I also like that you to be weary of what you are carrying and what you are doing as some smells and noises will attract more zombies.\nOverall, this is a great game so far and I can't wait to see what the next update will bring.\nA few things we are looking forward to:\n1. Possibilty of cars- cars would be helpful for scavenging far from camp or if one person has a broken leg and can't run.\n2. Weather effects- this could make the game more of a challenge\n3. Zombie bears- I'm not looking forward to this one but my friends are...\nA few suggestions we have:\n1. Add more wildlife that may be huntable, such as birds, fish, etc.\n2. Clans, groups or tribes that you can create and join\n3. Silencers for weapons\n4. Tripwires, trapdoors, etc for setting traps\n\n","September 2, 2014","true","289.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I play this most days with my partner (she loves the game and plays very little else). The feel of the game is very good and the night times can be truly intense if you caught out in the open, and even in your base when a full horde comes it can get very intense.\n\nThings I like:\n\n- Building is pretty solid at the moment, especially if you install one of the modded recipe packs\n\n- Defence is a lot of fun and you can be very inventive\n\n- Cities are great fun to raid provided you don’t go in guns blazing\n\n- Graphics are not bad for an indie though with alpha 11 it looks like they will get a major update\n\n- Combat is straight forward and feels about right in my own eyes.\n\n- Crafting system is good again is event better with the modded recipe packs I Have not played on public server's so can’t give a review of them as we play on our own private server\n\nThings that could do with a bit of an update:\n\n- Building variety/biomes feel a little repetitive in random generated maps, a modded prefab pack improves the buildings but the zones still feel a bit cut and paste at times. Alpha 11 will be changing the random gen so this may well change very soon.\n\n- Need to add some prolonged goals other than getting the Sniper Rifle/Magnum, yes this is a sand box but still needs some long term things to work for - skill system may fix this to some extent but they need to add some areas that are a lot harder to loot/get in to until your better skilled/equipped or something.\n\n- Mining/chopping feels a bit slow but this is probably to stop people destroying your base to fast on PvP servers.\n\nOverall for an alpha this is a very good game that I would recommend to people as a must buy, I know there are probably better looking games but the feel of this game just sits well with me. It is so much better with friends than solo this I cannot stress enough.","February 5, 2015","true","588.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I have all the movies and try to play all the games. However, I have always been wanting a game where it was me and some friends surviving against hordes of the living dead. I have played many games with zombies, and have lots many, but this game is the closest I have ever been to the perfect zombie game.\n\nI have played several zombie games, across many platforms, and I have spent 10x more in this game than any other. I love the combination of the survival aspect and the buidling aspect. I love that the zombies actually pose a threat and you can't just hide in your home. With the combo of the Zombies and the physics based gameplay, you must be innovative in your attempts at survival. You cant' just pillar up and wait out the night. You can't just dig a hole and everything will be alright. The zombies will come for you.\n\nI also love the fact that the devs have allowed options inside the game. For example, my current server I play on is walking dead style. Walkers Only, No specials. You can set length of days, if the zombies run or not (when they run too), loot probability, and so much more. No matter your style, you can tweak the game to your satisfaction.\n\nHowever, I do want to emphasize that this game is Alpha. You will find bugs. You will have to start over several times. Things will go wrong and you will get frustrated. Very frustrated. You will probably rage quit a few times. I have. However, each time I do, I soon come back for more. In fact, on my server, I am known to be the one who finds bugs and to get stuck in them.\n\nAs the game stands now, it's a 7 out of 10 for me. Which, honestly for me, that's a very good score. Very few games score any higher.","July 11, 2014","true","866.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Although still in Alpha, as of 06/13/15, this game easily could be in Beta and in most other cases I believe any other dev probably classify it as such. The game runs fluently, even on a crappy laptop if set to easily adjustable lower settings and a large majority of the gameplay is functional. With this in mind there are obvious bugs present and lots of things that need work but it is still in development and the vigilance of these devs more then compensate for continuing bugs as well as new ones that arise when each update occurs. Overall, it's exactly what it says in the title, it is "The Survival Horde Crafting Game". And with devs that back the game and take some pride in their work I would definitely recommend it for those who want to have a quality game with guaranteed improvements in the future.","June 13, 2015","true","57.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Keep in mind that this is indeed an Alpha game, and a work in progress. Currently the game is in patch 10.4, with another patch planned soon.\n\nExcellent Things:\n- Developers that care. I would highly recommend visiting the forum to see the developer's interaction with the community. A lot of discussion and feedback. There is also a Tumblr blog one of the developers keeps that gets update around twice a week with some of the cool stuff they're working on.\n\n- Fully destructible world. Don't like that hill there? Move it. Feel like the apartment building is blocking your view of the wasteland? Tear it down. A lot of "similiar" games to this one lack that feature like Rust or DayZ, and it makes 7 Days to Die stand apart.\n\n-Zombies are actually a threat. They are everywhere until you clear an area out, and some like to sneak up on you, especially the dogs. By default, they are slow and stupid, but at night they are stronger and faster. Currently, a mesh system is in place that allows you to keep an area maintained and mostly zombie-free. Travel outside the cleared area, and you will encounter more zombies who are happy to see you. Wandering hordes will make your life difficult unless you are quiet. Also, if you make too much noise building, mining, cooking, or shooting guns without caution, you can trigger additional hordes of zombies to come your way.\n\n-Crafting and upgrading. Though crafting is not an original idea, there are plenty of different things to make, and recipes to unlock through books. You can also break down many items into scrap or weapon parts. The more rare guns and armor are only unlocked by finding rare schematics, which gives you incentive to keep exploring.\n\n-Character Appearance and Customization.  The Fun Pimps recently added character creation, allowing a wide range of customization. A lot of sliders and hair/skin/eye colors to pick from. They are also continually adding different colors of clothing for additional appearance options.\n\n-Base-Building. Along with the idea of the fully destructible world, you can craft basic building frames from different materials, usually metal or wood. Placing different frames currently allows you to place, build, and upgrade wood, scrap metal, cobblestone, and concrete bases, with many more upgrade paths planned. Traps and trenches are good lines of defense, or, if you are in a pinch, you can clear out and reinforce an already-existing building.\n\n- Random World Generation. Every update the randomly generated worlds get better and better. There are occasional bugs, like buildings being placed inside of each other, but I find they are rare. You can encounter massive cities spanning many blocks. You can attempt to slowly conquer towns and cities, or just tear them down searching for scrap. Environments range from burnt forests, to deserts, forests, and snowy hills, or just some wasteland. Eventually they will add environmental effects like heat and cold, but that is currently not implemented.\n\nNot-So-Excellent Things-\n-Bugs. Of course there are bugs. It's an Alpha. If you can't handle that, it's fine. Don't buy it yet, or buy it now and play it later. But this game will absolutely pay off. The developers and moderators are quick to address and fix bugs. Every time a major patch is released, there is another hotfix within a day or two in response to community bug reports. The most important thing with bugs is that they are not ignored, and in 7 Days to Die they are not being ignored.\n\n-Somewhat Harsh Learning Curve. I'm puttting this in my review because it's a common complaint in the forums. The devs recently implemented the wellness system, rewarding players for playing safe and staying alive by increased health and stamina over time, which can be boosted with good food and medicine. On the other handing, players who frequently die will end up with a lower max health. Personally, I agree with and enjoy the wellness the system, but there seem to be many people who do not. I'll just put it this way: It's a survival game. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DIE, and if you do, at least you get to try and retrieve your things from wherever you died. Many survival games have a perma-death system, so as far as that goes, this game is quite lenient. Still, you may find yourself struggling at first due to lack of in-game tutorials. If this happens, read the wiki or check the forums for tips and guides.\n\nLack of Endgame. (Currently) I won't put much into this bulletin point. Just a warning that once you've established a base and can fend off the feral hordes and whatnot, the game becomes fairly easy. This will be addressed later on as tougher zombies, better loot, and the campaign mode are added. If you find yourself becoming bored in the PVE aspect of things, I recommend finding a good PVP server to test your wits against other players.\n\nThat's all I've really got to say for now. Progress on this game has been astounding. Since its first Alpha, this game has made leaps and bounds graphically and gameplay-wise and hardly even looks like the Indie game it is anymore. Buy this game if you love survival and crafting and smashing zombie heads witth wooden clubs!

The game works as advertised and has a great track record of consistent and substantial updates. Personally, I find the zombies to be a little tough to kill and the zombie dogs to be a bit overkill but if you like your survival zombie games more on the challenging side then this should appeal to you. Lots of things to craft, building a fort and surrounding it with defenses is a good time. You can even mine for ore like that one game (you know which one). Playing with friends is fun as well and I have not had any large issues with lag or network connectivity.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about this game, which isn't so much the game itself but the Early Access aspect of many games, is that you will play it and get tired of it long before the game is completed. Again, this is my opinion. This is a solid game as is right now and it is good. But that just makes me want to wait to play it until I can get the full experience.

You are tasked with providing yourself with a home be it temporary or not to protect yourself against the inevitable hordes of the un-dead that WILL prove a problem to you least you own a gun or good melee weapon. You get get food from basic scavenging though it gets scarce after a while so you must learn to hunt local deer, pigs and other animals or you can look into farming. You'll be wanting to get water from scavenging more than anything since there enough water bottles in a local town to drown the Ugandan population. Zombies can travel alone or travel in hordes and as you survive for more days they get tougher and tougher until you need to be more intelligent with how you do or rather do not deal with them. Overall it was a fun game while it lasted if not a bit...repetitive. The animations were a bit off. The graphics weren't exactly gorgeous to look at and 7 Days to Die is one of those game where there is no shame looking up the Wikipedia for how to build things or get ♥♥♥♥ done.

So if you're not cool with that, better bugger off.\n\nIf you wanted a game set in "The Walking Dead" universe, minus the people. This is it.\n\nYou clear out a house, it's perfect. There's a gunsafe, beds, food, a fridge, multiple exits, the works. Then it gets over run and you're back on the road.\n\nFind another house, clear it out. Same deal, suits your needs. You see a far off explosion. "Oh boy" you say as you go to investigate, could be anything really. Then you see it, a huge camp surrounded by Barbed wire and Landmines.\n\nLoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of the joint, set up the defences around your own house, live out your 7 days sitting on the balcony watching zombies get blown to ♥♥♥♥.\n\nDay 1\n\nI've set up camp in a large 2 story house. It's fantastic. I have 5 guns :D\n\nDay 2\n\nHouse got overrun, 1 of my guns is broken and i'm out of ammo for the rest.\nI've found another building, it looks like an old garage (Y'know, like a repair shop)\nIt's quiet in here but it's filthy and dark.\n\nDay 3\n\nI don't know how to craft a damn thing, i've sacrificed 2 of my remaining guns for scrap iron so i can make myself a pickaxe.\nI went scavenging today, raided 3 houses and a campsite. Nothing much was found, mostly food.\nI have too much food.\n\nDay 4\n\nGod damnit. Today sucked, i'll start with the morning.\nMined for a bit, killed some zombies, survived a horde, started farming blueberries, normal stuff this morning. Then I found a gas pump out the back, because I'm a god damned fool, I shot it.\nIt exploded, blew up half the building and destroyed my gunsafe which had everything in it :/\nAll I have is 1 hunting rifle, my pickaxe, some boiled rabbit and a torch.\n\nI'm moving.\n\nDay 5\n\nI've been searching for a house all day. All I can find are tents. Tents suck. I finally settled on a little tent next to a huge building. I wanted the building but jesus christ the place is crawling with zombies.\nIt's a decent tent, i made a door and blocked up the windows, it will have to do until i find a real place.\n\nThe last 2 days were awful, man :(\n\nDay 6\n\nGOD DAMNIT. It's the middle of the night. I just wrote the diary for day 5 and went back to playing.\nY'know how I mentioned that I was a damned fool? I PUNCHED THE WINDOW IN MY TENT (Yes it had glass pane windows)\nThis may not seem bad to you but the game has gravity. The entire roof fell down.\nI've had this tent for 5 minutes.\nWent hunting, killed a few rabbits and a pig.\nCut down some trees, started melting down some iron to make a gun safe. I want one because I need storage and gun safes are the biggest kind.\nI started building a little shelter across the road  from my campsite. I hope I can build a huge base eventually. I'll start a fence tomorrow/\nSo it's about to tick over to Day 7 and a giant bee thing flew up to me. It was obviously an enemy because it was marked on the map. I shot it down with my hunting rifle. It didn't drop anything or even leave a body. I'll look it up on the wiki because I've never seen one before and i'm tripping out right now.\n\nEdit: Hornets. It doesn't say anything about them being rare so I don't know why I only saw my first one on Day 6\n\nDay 7\n\nI hope this game isn't literal and I actually suvive today.\nSo I went for a walk, found some guns in a building down the road. Nothing much else.\nToday was very uneventful until I got attacked by a zombie and got infected. Of course, I didn't know I was infected until I did some research.\nThankfully you can craft antibiotics and fix it.\nUnfortunately that's not easy.\nI needed to scavenge some moldy bread, some potassium nitrate powder and a beaker then cook it on a camp fire.\nI had no beaker or bread. Crap. I've got the camp fire and the potassium nitrate from cracking open some rocks though.\nSo I bolted to the nearest building I hadn't touched and bang! 2 beakers and 3 guns. Nice!\nOn the way out the door I accidently pressed 'E' to search some garbage and you'll never guess what's in the garbage. Mouldy bread.\nI couldn't beleive my luck. I cooked it up right then and there, took my meds and went on my way with some left over. Today was a good day.\nI logged off before the sun went down so I'll edit later.\n\nEdit: Nothing major, cooked a bunch of meat and some more antibiotics, which was lucky because I got infected again :/\n\nDay 8\n\nThis morning was boring as hell, I just cooked and stuff. Still haven't built a new place for myself. Tent's just fine. In the middle of the day a huge ♥♥♥ horde moved through my camp. Like 40 zombies man. I have screenshots to show for it. I killed them all and was looking for anything useful on their bodies when I heard a plane fly over. I looked around and saw it drop 2 crates! I bolted to the first one, nothing major, bandages, food, 2 antibiotics. Then I went over to the second crate. Medical supplies for days: 50 antibiotic pills and 20 bandages. I'm in heaven.\n\nNight's coming as I write this. I'll keep you posted.\n\nSo another horde attacked. On the same day. It as even bigger this time, I think. I took another screenshot but I had killed most of them beforehand.\n\nDay 9\n\nAnother horde attack in the morning, nothing major today. Made some leather clothing, collected heaps of water because I didn't have any. Planning on starting a farm.\n\nThe tent is pretty much wrecked.","July 2, 2014","true","9.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is a rare gem in that it is similar to minecraft but not a terrible cash grab knockoff game. Visually it is ok but not spectacular but certainly a step up from the blockiness of minecraft. Building is a nessicity rather than an outlet for you're creativity. If you don't have a reinforced shelter then you aren't going to last long.\n\nThe thing that keeps this game fresh is the huge expanse of crafting options available that gives you a reason to survive. A huge range of food and medicines can be crafted from crops as well as biofuel for chainsaws and drills or you can mine for metals and ores which can be smelted and made into tools and guns.\n\nThen you must improve and upgrade your base and defenses which is where your strategy and creativity comes into play. Make use of trenches and spike traps with land mines and barbed wire, maybe throw in some lookout towers and you might just be able to survive a few nights against the zombie onslaught. However as the days and nights go on the zombies get tougher and are able to climb over walls and tunnel under your base and can easily overwhelm you.\n\nEach life offers you another chance at building a better base and trying a new idea. Maybe an underground base? maybe build on top of the tallest building in town? underwater? Grab a few friends and get into a game for the best team playing survival experience.\n\nI almost forgot its still in early access which seems hard to believe but I can't wait to see all the future features they have planned.","May 13, 2015","true","86.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The game works as advertised and has a great track record of consistent and substantial updates. Personally, I find the zombies to be a little tough to kill and the zombie dogs to be a bit overkill but if you like your survival zombie games more on the challenging side then this should appeal to you. Lots of things to craft, building a fort and surrounding it with defenses is a good time. You can even mine for ore like that one game (you know which one). Playing with friends is fun as well and I have not had any large issues with lag or network connectivity.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about this game, which isn't so much the game itself but the Early Access aspect of many games, is that you will play it and get tired of it long before the game is completed. Again, this is my opinion. This is a solid game as is right now and it is good. But that just makes me want to wait to play it until I can get the full experience.  So while I have spent a significant time with the game and it's systems, I have not tried to dig deep into the games meaty bits.\n\nOverall, I would strongly recommend a purchase; especially if you have a buddy or two to survive with.","May 26, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You are tasked with providing yourself with a home be it temporary or not to protect yourself against the inevitable hordes of the un-dead that WILL prove a problem to you least you own a gun or good melee weapon. You get get food from basic scavenging though it gets scarce after a while so you must learn to hunt local deer, pigs and other animals or you can look into farming. You'll be wanting to get water from scavenging more than anything since there enough water bottles in a local town to drown the Ugandan population. Zombies can travel alone or travel in hordes and as you survive for more days they get tougher and tougher until you need to be more intelligent with how you do or rather do not deal with them. Overall it was a fun game while it lasted if not a bit...repetitive. The animations were a bit off. The graphics weren't exactly gorgeous to look at and 7 Days to Die is one of those game where there is no shame looking up the Wikipedia for how to build things or get ♥♥♥♥ done. Honestly it was fun while it lasted, which was about a few hours. It isn't really any fun without friends.","May 27, 2015","true","21.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I ran away crying like a little girl.  Today I went back.  Two pistols, two shotguns a hunting rifle and my trusty crossbow - a 1000 rounds of ammunition.  Today I was Clint Eastwood.  The fight was dirty and mean.  I shot a cheerleader in the face.  For a moment the thought crossed my mind that perhaps she had once been pretty - but I couldnt dwell on these things and pumped two rounds into a fat guy in a hawaiian shirt - next up a couple of nurses, I put them down hard.  I saw a cop out the corner of my eye, spun, switched to hunting rifle and he bit the dirt, they were coming at me now in twos and threes from all directions - I pulled  my pistol out - remember your training - get  a little height and pick off the closest first,  stay calm, aim fire, aim fire, aim fire.  The fight went on through the night, by now I was playing hit and run, the crawlers had snagged me a couple of times and my leg was broke,  by morning the damn hornets were buzzing around me and I could hear the wails of those long armed mutant freeks that I new meant trouble.  I fought my way back to the mound I had been stood on nearly twenty four hours ago and we started again - Some trophy wife in a red dress took one in the back of the head, I heard somebody giggle, It was me.  The strain was showing, I knew I was gonna crack, I pulled out my shotgun and started walking down main street - You tell 'em I'M coming... and hell's coming with me...\n\nThat was day 86.\n\nI play "no death"  If you die you start again from scratch, no plane drops, no running, no crying for mummy.","May 11, 2015","true","379.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

I play this most days with my partner (she loves the game and plays very little else). The feel of the game is very good and the night times can be truly intense if you caught out in the open, and even in your base when a full horde comes it can get very intense.\n\nThings I like:\n\n- Building is pretty solid at the moment, especially if you install one of the modded recipe packs\n\n- Defence is a lot of fun and you can be very inventive\n\n- Cities are great fun to raid provided you don’t go in guns blazing\n\n- Graphics are not bad for an indie though with alpha 11 it looks like they will get a major update\n\n- Combat is straight forward and feels about right in my own eyes.\n\n- Crafting system is good again is event better with the modded recipe packs I Have not played on public server's so can’t give a review of them as we play on our own private server\n\nThings that could do with a bit of an update:\n\n- Building variety/biomes feel a little repetitive in random generated maps, a modded prefab pack improves the buildings but the zones still feel a bit cut and paste at times. Alpha 11 will be changing the random gen so this may well change very soon.\n\n- Need to add some prolonged goals other than getting the Sniper Rifle/Magnum, yes this is a sand box but still needs some long term things to work for - skill system may fix this to some extent but they need to add some areas that are a lot harder to loot/get in to until your better skilled/equipped or something.\n\n- Mining/chopping feels a bit slow but this is probably to stop people destroying your base to fast on PvP servers.\n\nOverall for an alpha this is a very good game that I would recommend to people as a must buy, I know there are probably better looking games but the feel of this game just sits well with me. It is so much better with friends than solo this I cannot stress enough.","February 5, 2015","true","588.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Often times this is more irritating than rewarding as a new player your inventory will be filled with "stuff" you don't know what to do with, and then you will end up dying and losing everything without actually learning anything.\n\nSo basically... if you are not willing to watch 2hours+ worth of youtube tutorials on how to progress in 7dtd, than I'd suggest passing this one up.

The game runs fluently, even on a crappy laptop if set to easily adjustable lower settings and a large majority of the gameplay is functional. With this in mind there are obvious bugs present and lots of things that need work but it is still in development and the vigilance of these devs more then compensate for continuing bugs as well as new ones that arise when each update occurs.

I have all the movies and try to play all the games. However, I have always been wanting a game where it was me and some friends surviving against hordes of the living dead. I have played many games with zombies, and have lots many, but this game is the closest I have ever been to the perfect zombie game.\n\nI have played several zombie games, across many platforms, and I have spent 10x more in this game than any other. I love the combination of the survival aspect and the buidling aspect. I love that the zombies actually pose a threat and you can't just hide in your home. With the combo of the Zombies and the physics based gameplay, you must be innovative in your attempts at survival. You cant' just pillar up and wait out the night. You can't just dig a hole and everything will be alright. The zombies will come for you.\n\nI also love the fact that the devs have allowed options inside the game. For example, my current server I play on is walking dead style. Walkers Only, No specials. You can set length of days, if the zombies run or not (when they run too), loot probability, and so much more. No matter your style, you can tweak the game to your satisfaction.\n\nHowever, I do want to emphasize that this game is Alpha. You will find bugs. You will have to start over several times. Things will go wrong and you will get frustrated. Very frustrated. You will probably rage quit a few times. I have. However, each time I do, I soon come back for more. In fact, on my server, I am known to be the one who finds bugs and to get stuck in them.\n\nAs the game stands now, it's a 7 out of 10 for me. Which, honestly for me, that's a very good score. Very few games score any higher.","July 11, 2014","true","866.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Often times this is more irritating than rewarding as a new player your inventory will be filled with "stuff" you don't know what to do with, and then you will end up dying and losing everything without actually learning anything.\n\nSo basically... if you are not willing to watch 2hours+ worth of youtube tutorials on how to progress in 7dtd, than I'd suggest passing this one up. It IS fun for a while with friends, but I feel like the crafting system and lack of hints / information is what is truly holding this game back.","April 28, 2015","true","22.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

While I must say that it is still in early developmental stages, quite a few "annoyances" still exist such as players being able to duplicate items, quite a few methods for "hackers" to enable Creative Mode are available, and it's almost not shocking to find a regular player "no-clipping" around from time-to-time. But getting past these bugs and exploits, the game itself is taking on a good direction and the developmental team seems to be hard at work releasing patch after patch to fix known bugs. The only thing I wish they would focus on after this bugs, is the fact of optimizing the game. Video settings are very minimal, and even with a powerful PC; you may experience frame drops on a regular basis.\n\nOn the server management side, setting up a dedicated server is relatively easy to do. However the "modification" aspect of your dedicated server will remain very limited for the time being as most of the files are compiled .dll files. While I can understand this on the client-side, it makes it very difficult to write any new add-ons for your server as far as server-side action is concerned. Alloc who is also on the 7DTD team, has written a few add-ons which I would recommend you pick up, including the "Alloc's Mod". It includes a lot of additional features that you can execute via the in-game console once you are in debug mode that assist with managing players which includes viewing player inventory, an unban function, a better teleporting feature, and a lot of other great assets.\n\nI think it would be unfair to give the game a rating due to it being in developmental stages, so I'd just recommend everyone pick up a copy and try it out. Definitely not a "waste" of money, and will be a lot better once the above things are worked out.\n\nRegards,\nRichard\nYouTube: IAMRichardT","December 4, 2014","true","416.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

Used a recommended seed called KillMeNow on the random generation (highly recommend, lots of POIs). Ran for awhile until I found a nice cabin with a forge and stone walls close to a town and other scattered buildings. Cleared out the zombies and started fortifying with wooden log spikes. It was the first night as I sat upstairs that I realized a bear had spawned in the place of two stair blocks in the house I had chosen for myself. Alright I thought, I'll just kill him and fill in the stairs, nope he can hit me through the walls. that's fine, I'll have a bear defending the stairs then, no problem. Bear starts to tear away at my house, heading for me medicine cabinet. He has to die now. Spend the night crafting as many arrows as I could, it was not enough. Day breaks and I start gathering materials, including a barrel of oil... I ran back to my house and placed the barrel above the bear. Ignorant of the ways of the barrel, I punch it, BOOM! It explodes instantly and I die, the bear SURVIVES and is now loose on the bottom floor of my home. I quickly change my outlook on the situation, I now have an indestructible bear defending my stairs, he can have the bottom floor, that's fine, I'll Make it work. The bear had other plans. Sensing freedom for the first time in its life, the bear makes a b-line for the door, even better, I thought, I'll have a bear outside my house defending against zombies from all sides. The bear rips its way through my door and dies on the log spikes.

The early blocky look just did not do it for me but I always would come back every month or two and check on this game because I saw some depth that could be interesting later on. Fast forward now to version alpha8.6 and this game is quite fun, has dumped the blocky look and has me quite excited for the future. They have borrowed some of the better elements from games like Rust, Minecraft and DayZ and combined them into a quite complex crafting/building game with sizeable numbers of zombies that can be a real menace to you at times. If you have some friends to play with online and you enjoyed the building and base raiding of Rust but wished it were more complex in the crafting area, you should get this game.

I've seen whole castles built and cumble because the smallest error. I've seen wars fought over land and food, and seen teamwork come to fruition, This game has had many, many memorable events.

I'm not using it as an excuse, if you dont like it, To each his own, I'm just pointing that out, Somethings just need patience, You can't take every word as truth, and every image as plausible.

I personally started out scavenging till I found a pickaxe and shovel only to find out later in the game that a stone axe can work however slowly and can be made from gathered materials.\n- Players Per Server\nUnfortunately the only huge thing is the amount of people that can play before it takes a massive dive in server sync which can ultimately drop everyone from the server or just make the few people experiencing it rubber band like crazy. Watch your server population and limit who plays or else it will happen.","July 13, 2014","true","155.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

DayZ (mod and standalone), War Z (now called Infestation: Survivor Stories), Rust, Unturned, etc. This is the one I stuck with hardcore, and it's not even done yet. I've played since Alpha 1, when everything was blocky and there was no stealth system. That game was terrible, yet still held its own compared to most other survival games. Looking at it now, with a complex crafting system, stealth, hordes, random gen, and so much more that's been added since those first weeks... This is THE game. If you buy one survival game, make it this one. I guarantee ya, you won't regret it.\n\nEdit: After reading a few of the negative reviews, I have to add that this game is IN ALPHA. There WILL be gamebreaking bugs, in fact they released an update (A3 I think) that crashed my buddy's computer. This was before they released on Steam, ofc. Ever since, there have been no problems as far as corruption goes, but these things CAN happen when you buy a game that isn't finished yet. Not specifically talking about anyone in particular, just sayin'.\n\nAs for the forum moderators, I suggest sending a pm to Joel on the 7dtd forums. He's a great moderator, fair and funny, but he's not paid to be a babysitter. He's an actual dev who is doing his part to create this game. Still, if you have a valid complaint, I'm sure he'll listen. He helped me link the game to my Steam account when he could've just sent me a link to Google and told me to figure it out lol.\n\nPoint is, this is a great game with a great dev team, and though there WILL BE BUGS, they're doing the best they can with what they've got. This isn't Bohemia Interactive, this is a group of guys making a badass game. At 900+ hours, I've gotten my $25 out of this game many times over. Best game I've ever paid for.","November 21, 2014","true","336.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It looks very promising and things that they're planning to do and goals are quite interesting and unique combinations from different genres. Semi-Block system from minecraft with better graphics and visuals.. add survivability with not only food and health but also water.\n\nAble to play it in Co-Op? YES!\nCrafting system? Yes!\nLots of guns and weapons? Yes!\n\nUPDATE:::: 26/07/2015\n\nPersonal feeling:\nI haven't played a long-while until 11 & 12- builds, the game became SIGNIFICANTLY more responsive and polished compared to what it was. The textures can still use some improvements here and there, but the apocalyptic set-up saves it slightly... I just find that in some cases (i.e character ) it still hurts to see low quality textures/graphics. But normally nothing distracting me from playing the game... after first few days you'll be wearing clothes anyways. The gameplay itself got significantly better to and as it stands is actually fun to play, run around and loot, kill zombies and so on.\n\nImprovement speed:\nGame is developing and taking shape in big leaps, something to be expected for an Alpha, I am "slightly" concerned about them stopping "before it's baked" because for me, so far I see almost infinite potential...\n\nSmall Feature Wish-list:\n* More different kind of zombies, maybe even "boss" varieties? As much as I understand this game's desire to strive towards realism + zombies, but I would love some other hazards, like maybe some dangerous mutated plant-life or something.\n* More biome-specifics, like deserts need cactuses that are useful for something ect.\n* More "metals" ... Cloth/Wood -> Iron -> Steel is nice, but adding a few more "tiers" would be amazing. If they want to stay "realistic" they could do:  1) Low-grade Steel -> Regular-Steel -> Damascus or Stainless/High-Grade Steel\n* Copper deposits/ore or some way to "mine" it.\n* More pre-made maps\nOverall there's plenty of great ideas people are giving to them in the forums already, and I think they're seriously considering the good ideas.\n\nGame-modes & variety:\n* You can play it solo undisturbed.\n* You can play solo and at some point have some friend(s) joining and "help" them out a bit. (if they want)\n* You can play on a server or a lan and start with friends working in coop or racing them in zombie kills count or "recipies learned" or some other metric.\n* You can play on a server and even have some sort of PvP. ( not sure how good that is yet )\n* You can edit the xml-file for custom random gens, alter zombie behavior, items spawn rates or quantity ect.\n* You can ( or will be able to ) download some player-created content or balances to adjust the game, once it's released or even already now.\n* You can enter cheat-mode and just be building a base, or a town, or castles... There's 1 concern as of right now... Building underground is very time consuming/difficult.\n\n\n\nOnly thing I DO regret is that I got the game ( 2 copies actually ) for 30 Damn € a piece , when it is now 20€ and I feel "ripped off" in a way. Because not only did they reduce the price to 20 € a piece they also made a " 2-game bundle" that costs nearly as much as I paid for 1 game back in the days. =/ But well.. you win some, you loose some.","April 6, 2014","true","257.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I opted to leave the original as well for reference.\n\n\n------ORIGINAL REVIEW: VERSION 7.11----------\n\nI played this game for a little bit when I first purchased it, just before alpha 6 was released. I was impressed. I played again later, around version 7.11, and I can say without a doubt that I enjoy this game. Having to take structural integrity into account to make sure your buildings and mining tunnels don't collapse on you rather then just as eye candy is a very welcomed plus. While there is equipment degredation and normal needs (food, hydration, stamina,)  I have never felt that these were too prevalent, yet it's just taxing enough to make you actively think about it.\nIn the end, it will be very interesting to see how this game turns out, but from what I'm seeing right now... We're all in for a very good game.\n\n\n\n---------NEW REVIEW: VERSION 12.4---------\n\nOk, I've put a good amount of time in the game between each patch. So far I am greatly impressed with the changes that the team has made. The game is starting to take shape and it leaves so much potential for mods when it's done!  But, this isn't much a review without actually reviewing it, so here we go.\n\nGraphics: As I said in the opening, they have upgraded the engine and it now supports better graphics as well as weather effects such as rain, fog and snow. Unfortunately, for one reason or another, there seems to be some kind of issue with high end video cards and the game. That, however, will be patched out soon enough. The night sky looks great; first thing a friend of mine said when he saw it was "Woah, check out that blue nebula!"\n\nSound: The ambience is much, much better then it was before. Not saying it's the greatest in the world, mind you, but it's much better none-the-less. Before, it would just repeat the same one or two ambient noises. While they aren't 100% "there" yet, the new ones at least make sense and fit the time and area. Game sounds, such as shooting, could use a touchup, but it still sounds good enough and I believe there are plans to improve upon that. In fact, I think they recently updated the reloading sounds as well gunfire.\n\nReplayability: A lot. There have been quite a few world clears (due to patches) over the time I've played this and I generally have at least 1 SP game and 1 MP game going on in tandum. Even now, with so many of the promised mechanics not yet in the game, there is still many ways you can change up the playstyle to keep it interesting. Things like: "This time I'm going melee only!", "I can only use a crossbow! That means I can't actually kill a zombie until I get one!" and "I cannot eat canned food or drink purified water. I must eat only cooked food and tea."\n\nI don't like to give numerical ratings due to the misconception that "7/10 = crap" that reviewers such as Game Informer do. However, if I absolutely had to I'd give 7 Days to Die (in its current state) a ...\n\n7/10\n(5 = average, so 6 = slightly above average and 7 = above average)\n\nCan't wait until it's finished.","April 24, 2014","true","362.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It was fun and entertaining and I loved building a base from starting out with not much. However, the gameplay got repetitive, it involved a lot of play time in order to maintain everything you owned and to try and make sure nobody blasted your base and took your stuff while you were offline. As a father and single income worker, my free time for games is limited. The other issue is that updates for Rust have been very lacking lately and it has just become a bit stale. DayZ seemed even worse with updates, and the amount of content in the game is very lacking in comparison to 7 Days and Rust. It looks pretty, but eye candy can only go so far.\n\n7 Days to Die is impressive and deserves a larger player base than it currently has. I was originally put off by the graphics in its early versions a few months back, but that was clearly a mistake. Besides, the graphics have been getting better and currently are about par with Rust. The reason I can see for the lesser quality graphics is that they focused so much more on the gameplay and content and it all works very well, especially for an Alpha.\n\nThe other issue I had with 7 Days to Die back in January was its price, which was the most expensive out of the three. Now it has dropped in price and is cheaper than DayZ.\n\nAnd for someone who doesn't have a lot of free time to play games, having a single player / offline mode to play is great. The Zombies are very effective and keep you on your toes. With the new update coming with the motion capture animations for them, it's just going to get a hell of a lot better.\n\nNow, let's say you get the basic stuff to survive for the night, or so you think, now you gotta find a place to settle down.

I'll put my stuff in the fridge, make some storage boxes, start crafting a few things. Hmmm.... it's getting night time now. Guess I won't be going far. Wait, what's that noise? Footsteps?

I recently purchased it off a discounted price and I have to say its quite fun. At the start it was really frustrating, you will die from lots of reasons. Running into radiated zones, getting shot by bandits, dying from zombies and even dying from lack of food/water.\n\nYour basic stats include stamina,food,hunger and health.\nStamina affects your physical activites that range from running to felling a tree with an axe. The lower your stamina, the slower you interact.\nFood/Water are your basic survival stats. There is a constant challenge to build a decent food/water supply and foraging for food in the wild is also difficult. The more stamina you drain, the faster your food/water stats will go down.\nHealth is the usual. You would require medicinal items like bandages or first aid kits to heal.\n\n\nThe game crafting is quite developed but theres still room for more. When I first started, i was totally lost and i needed to wiki/google search how to do things. Although the recipes are provided, you are missing some and you have to learn these by reading skill books that can be found in various loot drops around the world.\n\nCombat is moderate. There are a couple of guns, ranging from pistols to hunting rifles or shotguns. Crossbows are also available. You can even make a bone shiv from large bones that you may come across. However, fighting with zombies is rather dull. You just need to avoid their swipes. A huge horde can become a big problem. Typical zombie swarm problems.\n\nThere are a couple of zombie types. Crawler zombies crawl towards you slowly and they can sneak up on you in thick vegetation. Normal Walkers have a few variations, infected women, nurses, cheerleaders and fat walkers. Naturally the fat ones would have more health and it would take more effort to bring 1 done. There are also cop zombies that hurl acidic vomit at you. Zombies will drop loot according to their variation.\n\nI managed to group up with a couple of people and setup a huge base. Normally if you're on your own, raiders tend to pick on you more. And when i mean raiders, those are other players that attack other people for resources or for the fun of it. You will die and you will be annoyed. But thats the fun. Picking up from where you lost and rebuild.\nI got raided by a pair of bandits and they jeered at me. Infuriating as it is but i teamed up with other survivors and continued playing.\n\n---------------\ntl:dr,\nYOU WILL DIE. ALOT.\nBut you learn from those mistakes and pick yourself up again.\nHave fun out there!","December 28, 2014","true","355.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

One thing i would like to see improved would be searching for specific servers. The search command rarely works, which at times can be very frustrating.\n\nI see people saying 'save your money, get it when its playable', but it if you buy it now you're actually saving money as you get free updates for life. I have faith that The Fun Pimps will stick to there word and complete this game, however the release is drawing near and if The Fun Pimps really want to make this game all it can be they will probably extened the release date, why release something thats half done? I'd much rather wait longer and play something thats awesome/ all it can be. The Fun Pimps have the money and the know how, all it takes is time.\n\nI am hoping for a major game update to come out ASAP, i am also hoping for new weapons and traps.

The game also features a more in depth physics system, which has structural integrity and a really neat mining system. The terrain is also something different from a typical voxel building game, it's really something you just have to see for yourself.\nThe game is multiplayer and has deathmatch, survival and horde game modes.\nAs with any alpha game though, there are still some glitches that needed to be resolved.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TpBPF9m7lg","May 27, 2014","true","192.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

To start off I'd easily give this game a 4.5 out of a 5 star rating. I'll say I had my moments when I first started playing that I got wrecked over and over by the zombies and that the looting wasn't always in my favor, but then again thats what the whole custom lobby bit is for. But the features of this game to me heavily out does the small problems I've ran in to along my hours of game play. Let alone the replay vaule of this will more then likely sky rocket as time passes and the random world gen kicks online. But for now, if your looking for a game that has zombies, has a realstic building and structure feature, and holds great moments when it comes to friends playing with you, then stop right now and go hit that buy game button and share it with friends. And dont always judge a book by its cover to say the least, I'm a huge person on reading reviews, and I saw some of the thumbs down reviews and thought "is the game worth it?" But once in-game and playing with a series of friends, this game, to me, has easily out down most of the games like this out there as of right now. Let alone like I said, the moments you create in game with friends is just something you cant get past, like the moment your friend thinks this is MineCraft and trys to build a super building and next thing you know his house falls in on him and kills himself, funniest thing ive seen in a game in a long time. Finally the last comment I wish to make is I saw a lot of comments of, "Man the dev takes forever to update this ♥♥♥♥, or, this ♥♥♥♥♥ been broken since day one and still isnt fixed." Which personally I havent seen much of because the Dev, as I have seen at least, updates a hell of a lot faster then some games. And even then, what people don't understand is that it takes time to do these things, as someone who went to school for game design I know the hardships of trying to get bugs out, let alone folks lets face it the men and women who make games arent robots, they have lifes and im sure family and friends, as to where they put many hours in a day to bring us a game that doesnt always mean they willnt get ill or a family member needs help, so just chill out and wait on updates, stop puting thumbs down just because you cant hold out for a few months or so. But to finally end my review and small comments, If your looking for a good zombie game with many different features from breaking iteams down to rebuilding anything from a small home to a fort with friends, then simple buy the game and test it out, im sure its not everyones cup of tea but for true fans the game will be well worth it in the end.","April 19, 2014","true","248.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Maybe it isn't fair to review this game seeing as (at the time of writing) it is in 9.2 Alpha version. But seeing as this review is mostly positive, it should be alright.\n\nThere's a few things about this game I'd like to talk about:\nGameplay\nGraphics\nCrafting\nZombies\nMultiplayer\nPros and Cons overall.\n\nGameplay:\n7DTD is a sandbox game. At the start of the game, you get dropped at a random place in the world. This can be one of four locations:\nSnowy mountains\nForest\nDeserted city\nDesert\nFrom there it is totally up to the player to decide what they want to do. To keep survivng the player will need atleast food and water. Shelter is optional but highly recommanded, seeing as zombies get stronger at night.\nAs player you need food and water to survive. You can also get infected, or get diseases like diarrhea. Ofcourse those things can be cured by things you find while scavenging.\n\nGraphics:\nIn my personal opinions, the graphics aren't terrible, but they could be better. To be honest, for the graphics it has, it should be easier to run. Even on a high end pc it sometimes has lagspikes or crashes, wether this is because it's still in Alpha or not I don't know. Either way, don't excpect anything fancy.\n\nCrafting:\nCrafting is pretty big, most things you see outside can be destroyed and used for crafting. You can chop down trees, or chop down entire buildings and make them collapse. The remains can be picked up en used again for crafting.\nBushes, rocks, and grass are things that are mostly used in crafting, espescially at first, when the player is getting started. Later wood and stone become very important, for building a base.\nLater, guns and armour can be crafted, But those require molds and blueprints\nThere's also a farming system, but I'm not a big fan of that. Just like real life the plants need time and sunlight to grow, but it just takes too long.\n\nZombies:\nThere's multiple version of zombies. Zombies are both called 'zombies' or 'walkers'\nA few examples that you're going to see a lot are:\nBloated zombie: A fat zombie, does more damage, and takes more damage. Drops better loot as well.\nNurse zombie: A normal zombie, except she has more chance to drop medical items.\nZombie dog: Probably the most annoying type of zombie. Fast and does a lot of damage.\nSnow zombies: Zombies that live in the snowy mountains. They are all a tougher than normal zombies.\nPolice officer zombies: They're like blaoted walkers, except they also have a ranged puke attack.\n\nMultiplayer:\nUnfortunatly, multiplayer doesn't really offer anything new. It's just a second you running around in the world, except he isn't controlled by you. You can track other players.\nAlso unfortunate is that you have to rent a server to play with others, but if you know how to 'port forward' you can host a server without charges. More info for that go here:\nhttp://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/Server#Port_forwarding\n\nPros and cons:\nPro:\n- Fun to play\n- Multiplayer\n- Good crafting system\n- Building is well done\n\nCons:\n- More fun to play with others\n- Once you've set up a stable base, which includes food, water, and protection, the game can get stale.\n- Have to rent servers\n- Game has lagspikes and sometimes randomly crashes\n\n\nOveral I'd rate this game a 7.5/10, and it's still in Alpha mode.","September 27, 2014","true","32.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","2"

Ive currently built a spiraling tower of wood concrete and steel surrounded by blackened spires in within a darkened forest... Its the place where zombies come to meet their end...\n\nIf you have spent any money at all on any other Survivalist/Zombie Apocalypse Games then you owe it to yourself to get this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmakTalk/recommended/251570/","SmakTalk","SmakTalk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmakTalk/","259 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThankfully I purchased this game after ignoring some of the previous negative reviews (including one top-ranked review that listed screenshots and all this back and forth) because it turned out to be one of the best survival sim games that I have recently purchased. . I can't speak for the previous state of the game, but as of right now it is a great survival game.\n\nLet me start at the top, with the gameplay. It's FUN! There is plenty to learn, see, and do. Scavenging around there are various weapons and items, all used for something. On the default settings, it is nearly impossible to survive a night by yourself - you need friends! This is not a single player game, it's meant for multiplayer/at least one friend with you.\n\nThe game has plenty of different buildings around the world, all unique. It has a lot of different building materials, all can be reproduced or placed by the player. You can dig up carpet, take paintings and tvs, then take them back to your own base to place them. Weapons can be dissasembled into parts, all weapons and tools have durability that can be repaired. Once you spend the time to learn the game, it is not difficult to maintain your weapons or tools. There are plenty of different foods, some foraged or cooked. You have health, hunger, thirst, and stamina to maintain. The variety of places and things to scavenge means it is not too difficult to maintain these basic stats. When I say 'varied', I mean it has at least multiple items of that type, unlike several other games that only have a few of each type. Even though items like food tend to be the same (they have different stats but they are similar) it is nice that they have several different ones of each type, it keeps the game interesting to find new things.\n\nUpdate: They released a dedicated server component that you can download via Steam by clicking on Library and selecting Tools. If you scroll through the list of games in Tools, you will find 7 days to die dedicated server. Downloading it puts all the files you need in your Steam\steamapps\common folder.\n\nThe multiplayer server component is included with the game and it works similar to minecraft or terraria. You host a world on your local machine, and you can create new worlds to host. It has the ability to create new worlds or continue previous worlds. Once you select to create or continue a world, it asks you to press enter before entering - but by that time the world is already hosted. In this way, you can start a server/host a game without actually joining - the server is not a separate executable like some games but that doesn't diminish the ability to host a server. There is a list of settings you can change, and that are changed for many servers. The number of zombies spawned, whether they can run in darkness, how hard they hit, increasing the loot, etc. Right now there are around two thousand servers when you browse for a game, some labelled PVE and others PVP. You can see each server's various settings when browsing for a server to join.\n\nThe map is reasonably large for current survival sim games and it looks and feels like a recently inhabited world. Doors are blocked by chairs and windows are boarded up. I can't compare it to DayZ because I haven't played much of that game, but compared to Rust the world is much larger and much more varied. The game is easy to learn and get into and the building system is easy like Rust or minecraft.\n\nOne unique feature this game has, is that the world is destructible and structures require support. If you are building a bridge and destroy the support beams, it collapses. Trees fall after you chop them. Parts of houses will collapse if you destroy enough of the walls. It's not very complex, but you can only build blocks that have reasonable support and you can not build over thin air very far.\n\nAs much as I can tell, everything can be mined or destroyed. Interestingly the axe works much better than a pickaxe on wood, and pickaxes work much better than an axe on metals and minerals. The game has a shovel and an auger, which work very easily on the earth. It's really nice that you can find/create different mining tools that work better or worse on different materials. Guns, knives, clubs, they all do some damage to break materials down just not all equally well on all types. Metal is not difficult to come by, many items can be broken down into scrap metal. You can smelt scrap metal into iron ingots. The forge has a "mold" system, you need to build and place the proper mold into it to produce the output you desire (iron, lead, copper molds, bullet molds etc). Scrap metal can be used to build metal siding that can be applied to wood (or anything), which make them much stronger against the hordes trying to break them down when you are inside your home. Once you learn how to craft the different items you need, it is easier to survive a night and it is a casual learning curve.\n\nThe game is easily accessible, the controls are intuitive and the same as many first person games. The crafting system is easy to understand and use, and supports queued/multiples crafting. You can find most of the materials you need close by, whatever your spawn point into the world is. Destroying parts of houses usually yields materials also.\n\nThe graphics are on par with modern games (as shown in the screenshots in the game store). I am using an older generation graphics card and not the latest CPU, and as long as I turn off Anti-aliasing the game runs fine. The game has settings for visible distance, view angle, anti-aliasing, etc to allow adjusting performance.\n\nThe sound and music fit very well with the theme. Sound effects work well, you can tell if a sound is far away or close up and in which direction it came from.\n\nOverall it is worth the current price, and it is better developed than other zombie survival games recently released at the same (or more) price...\n\nPlease thumbs up this review if it was helpful!","May 2, 2014","true","122.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

If you like Minecraft, Left 4 Dead, Project Zomboid or DayZ this game might be for you!\nThere is still alot to be added but as of Alpha 5 you can mine, (like minecraft) craft items, build a fortress to survive the night. You'll need to eat and drink water which will force you to raid houses and town full of zombies and eventually lead you to farm.\nDont get caught out after dark (in normal settings) zombies run at nightime and will tear down your walls, tunnel down through the soil to break into your bunkers and do all they can to get to you. The AI is still reasonably dumb but its still fun for zombies!\n\nIf you like the games i listed or are just keen on zombies and dont mind a few bugs grab this game. Ive been playing co-op for days with my friends supports up to 20! player games its worth the $30 early access fee which means you paid $30 to play now and get the full finished game when its out for only $30!\n\nIf your still on the fence as with ALL early access games youtube lets play videos and watch a couple.","December 19, 2013","true","811.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Players "idiots" witch are playing not to survive but to destroy fun other players, are plaenty. Of course we have CLAIM BLOCKS to secure our base but many 99% of sevrvers has defult configuration, so claim block will not help you. I can advice to play this on alone, or on closed server witch you can host self.

Still flashing polygons, some times without textures especially on characters, choppy animation on animals and zombies when running, hopping and attacking is offensive to my eyesight, and the performance even with medium quality settings mocks my intelligence or rather my computer's ability to show complex scenes, since I know what is capable of, and the same does injustice on its skills.\nIn conclusion, I do NOT recommend this game, unless you like to die often by poor physics, slow responces of your camera turning and while it tries to be realistic, it needs a lot of work to be convincing at that aspect, since it fails utterly with all this gliltches that after years and months of patches is inadequently fixed.\n","July 8, 2015","false","6.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's been sitting in my library for 18 months now and I just cannot get into the game.\n\nI do not have a particularly powerful computer but it can handle most games pretty well, and yet with this game even on low-settings it feels laggy, slow and my computer quickly heats up like an oven. I'm wondering whether this game is just poorly optimised. Either way, it makes the game almost unplayable for me.\n\nAs for the graphics, I tested the 'ultra' settings and they just seem very poor to be honest - and not the sort of low-resolution style that is acceptable (e.g. Minecraft). It just feels like playing a game from 10+ years ago, and feels miles behind the standards of today's survival game graphics. I particularly don't like how the game just 'fades' into black in the distance.\n\nFurthermore, from the short time I have played the game, the sound quality isn't great either. Zombies for instance, will sound as if they are a metre or two behind you with loud footsteps, and yet are barely visible when I turn around.\n\nThe combined poor sound and visual quality doesn't make the game particularly immersive.\n\nAlthough, perhaps I'm being a little unfair. After all, graphics and sound aren't everything. Game mechanics are also important - and possibly something I haven't played enough to truly appreciate. Either way, for a survival game, I am impressed (and a little bewildered) at the character's ability to pick up countless cinder blocks without any help and yet take 100's of punches to kill a zombie.\n\n18 months and I haven't seen a huge amount of progression to address the above issues. At this rate, I feel I'll be waiting years for a playable game to be produced out of this. Sorry, but life is too short for that.\n\n£18.99 is far too expensive for a game of this quality.","July 29, 2015","false","2.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

But it's definetly not for the casual gamers : it's not the type of title you'll end up with lots of friends playing on it.\n- netplay : you end up on a huge map with only 8 poeple at the same time, at most.  We're really far from the other titles of the genre (H1Z1, Rust, ...) that can handle 50+ poeple easely.  So the netplay can be pretty much boring.  If you like PVE more than PVP, it's definitly your type of game.\n\nOn another side the game itselfs has good ideas :\n- tons of items / crafting\n- you can interact with the terrain, make your base | hideout | mines.\n- if you have friend to coop with, it's still a nice game to play.","July 30, 2015","false","1.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

Dogs arent much of a problem when you have a good weapon as a hit to the head can just instakill them.\n\nI suggest this game because it is very creative, realistic, and overall just fun! =D","August 1, 2015","true","230.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

On top of this, the devs set a great example for how to release and develop an early access game.\n\nConsidering the subject of most of the top comments I'll start by talking about the dev process. I play regularly with a couple of mates and we all regularly comment on how great the regular updates and communication from the devs is. Blog updates let players know clearly what is being prioritized and why, and what we have to look forward to in the upcoming patch. Patch notes are thorough and understandable. Decisions about what the devs are prioritising make sense. Major patches are very regular considering the size of the dev studio, and contain big servings of new content. AND WHEN THE DEVS STUFF SOMETHING UP THEY FIX IT IN THE VERY NEXT HOTFIX. For example, in a recent patch bows became very underpowered, forcing low level players into deadly melee combat with zombies. Coupled with this, the forge (which is a key part of progressing from weak hand crafted items to better metal items) became very hard to come by. Both of these issues were identified by the community, the devs listened, and they were rebalanced in the very next hotfix. I can't think of another early release game where I have been so impressed by the dev process.\n\nNow about the game itself. It's brutal, tense, replayable, and heaps of fun. In order to survive and progress you need to make intelligent decisions and think about how you're going to use your time. Difficulty progresses as you do, so you never feel overpowered or underpowered (or when you do get rekt you realise it was your fault). The world is interesting, unforgiving and diverse. The zombies are scary, in a good way. If you do die or otherwise suffer a setback you feel it, but you can make a comeback if you play it right. I regularly find myself on the edge of my seat, or scared, or elated, or just generally having an interesting and fun time. It's also great to play coop with a few friends. You can employ different strategies, and you will realise the outcomes of your decisions. It's a great way to play.\n\nWith that in mind, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!\n\nAs a final note, THIS GAME IS IN ALPHA. If you can't deal with bugs, or losing your save game with each major update, or incomplete features, THEN DON'T BUY IT. If you can't deal with these issues then don't buy ANY early access game. At this point if you buy it the devs DON'T owe you a complete game. They do owe regular and reasonable progress towards a final product, and in a perfect world they should have open, 2-way communication with the community during this process. In my experience both of those are true. Mad props to the devs, they're doing a great job.","July 27, 2015","true","130.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

When I left the game about 2-3 months ago (I was burned out playing it, moved to another game), the game ran perfectly, the loot system was great, and all around a solid game. Now if I try and play it, it lags like f***ing crazy, not network lag, LOW FPS LAG, on a computer with 16 gigs of ram and a 4gb graphics card and 6 core processor. This game should be running perfectly, but now it sucks. Not only that, somehow, the graphics are WORSE. So, worse graphics and a low FPS, when before, improved graphics and high FPS.....DOESNT MAKE SENSE TO ME.\n\nAlso, the loot system is now RUST. You hit a tree with an axe, you get wood EVERY TIME YOU HIT IT. Before, you had to chop down trees for logs which can then be crafted into planks and other things....Now you get wood every time you hit trees, dirt, rocks, god knows what else. This game is now an abomonation that needs to roll back these latest updates to fix what shouldnt have been messed with, cause now, Im playing 7 days to die, and now I feel like Im playing RUST.","December 20, 2015","false","259.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Simple minecraft inspired zombie survival.\nUnfortunately the developers quickly showed that they are completely out of their league. With every patch the game took 1 step forwards and 2 steps backwards.\nI played the heck out of it in the early alphas, but now the game is a complete mess.\nThe simplicity of it is gone, its insanely poor optimized and full of half implemented idears that the developers will doubtfully ever get fully working.\nWith every patch this game just gets worse and worse.\nUltimately its just been out too long, that the developers can continue to hide behinds the Early Access tag.","December 30, 2015","false","255.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

Put in over 2,500 hours on this game but they have changed it to the point where I have no further interest in it. Perhaps when the game is officially out I can find a modded version I would enjoy.\nSo on a scale on 1 to 10, I would give this game a 4, If I still have to kill 5 rabbits with a nail gun then I'll drop that to a 2 out of 10. Just for lack of imagination.\nIF I could sell my copy I would.","May 19","false","593.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"
