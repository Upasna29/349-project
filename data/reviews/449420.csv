The world of this game looks like Super Mario 4 and Rayman. The game is pretty long with plenty of levels and can keep you entertained for hours on end.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game features very cute, almost flash-like graphics. The game ran smooth for me and I had no problems with the FPS whatsoever. The game’s art style is nice too but nothing too fancy but the nice colorful palette is pleasing to the eyes. Some levels feature Limbo like graphics as you can only see the silhouette of the terrain and character and the background is nice and colorful. Can be seen in the below image:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687279845\n\nSound:\n\nWhile the soundtracks are cute they get repetitive. The voice acting somewhat is also has an emphasis on being cute and it really is nice hearing the little girl say “fireball” or “Ouch” every time you upgrade or get injured your spell.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay of this game is not the most original but it is quite fun and you won’t be bored with this game if you had nothing to do. The game features a lot of level, even though they’re not long they do have their own unique designs. There’s a lot of different types of enemies e.g. snails, bees, bats, frogs etc. Every 10 levels you get to fight a boss e.g. first boss was a giant frog. You have a spell which is short range and you must be near enemies to kill them with your spell attack. You can also upgrade your spell attack to fireball attack which can be shot and is long range. Some spells give you invulnerability for a short time You can kill enemies by stomping them just like good old Mario. When you stomp or shoot them with your spell they go in this bubble (think bubble bobble) and you can shoot or jump on them once again to earn more coins. You can collect coins, stamps etc. which are scattered everywhere in the levels. Mini also has a wall jump ability which can be used to climb some areas.\n\nSome of the levels offer different variety as well, like the magic carpet levels, in these levels you ride a magic carpet and you can shoot bees and other enemies coming towards you and the screen keeps auto scrolling. The carpet can be a bit difficult to handle though. Some levels feature un-killable enemies which will follow you throughout the level (sort of like the angry sun in Super Mario Bros 3). There can be teleporter levels as well. When you collect enough coins to earn 3 stars you unlock challenge mode which is the same level just harder.\n\nYou start off without any extra hearts and you can find hearts hidden in blocks which can be with either head-butting them or using spells on them. The game is also playable with 3 people locally. You can bind keys so it’s pretty easy to co-op locally with friends if you have controllers. Hit detection is a bit so-so in this game, as you must hit the enemies in the exact spot or you can miss them. The game gets difficult as the level progress but not too difficult. Hidden spots are also pretty common in this game.

Kids will especially enjoy this title as it has very cutesy, fun looking graphics and sound. If you have nothing to do, this game will definitely keep you entertained for at least 6-8 hours as it has many levels and lots of stuff to do.","May 19","true","5.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

There is a secret to find in each level as well as additional challenge that can be revealed only if you find enough number of coins, so you could play the same level twice but on completely different difficulty level. Since I'm writing about levels, there are nearly hundred of them all packed with those challenges and coins :) Shortly it's very nice game from the small developer, that will entertain me for couple more hours :)","May 16","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
