It mainly uses the same concept: an island where women are in charge and take care of the businesses and economy, and the men mainly populate the pleasure district of Yoshiwara, where they work as courtesans.\n\nYou are the heir to the rich and respected Somei family, with a famous fabric and clothing shop. You are being sent to Yoshiwara by your mother specifically for the purpose of becoming with child to continue your family line. There are five courtesans you can choose from, from young and innocent to arrogant and famous, and from passionate and flirty to stern and mysterious... Which gentleman of the night will sweep you off your feet?\n\nThe Good+ Lots of content, including sequels & date scenarios\n+ Beautiful character design & artwork\n+ Some of the characters have deeper issues & development\n+ Intimate, steamy scenes (18+)\n+ The protagonist is an active, business-oriented character\n\nThe Bad- A few grammar errors, typos & weird translations\n- Not all characters are as interesting as others\n- Still only a couple of background songs that loop endlessly...\n- Only a few new backgrounds compared to Kikuya\n\nImprovements Compared to Kikuya+ The translation to English is A LOT better\n+ The protagonist went from passive & weepy to active & confronting\n+ The art feels more thought out & less rushed\n+ You can now put the game on fullscreen in high resolution\n\nIn many ways, this game feels very similar to Kikuya but with major translation and grammar improvements. I enjoyed it even more because of that! It has slightly less content, but the more pro-active and confident protagonist was a big improvement for me personally (she is still a bit passive, but not overly). I also felt the game focused more on the personal development and character depth of the courtesans and was less preoccupied with the whole oh-we're-so-in-love-how-can-I-get-you-out-of-here? angle.\n\nVery unexpectedly, Asagiri turned out to be my favourite, because he inspired the heroine so much in her daily life and was so passionate.\n\nAnyhow, it's a romantic, slighly steamy otome game with lots of content & lots of guys to choose from, so what more could you want? :)","May 1","true","8.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Instead of the woman being the courtesan, the men are the objects of affection. The music and artwork are great as should be for this type of game. I have done 3 out of 5 of the guys routes and I love that they are each very different. You know a lot of the time when you play these games the plot is the same just with a different guy, but that is not so for this game. Each guy has a very different plot. The only thing that I wish is that Musashi had a route because it become quite obvious that he loves the protagonist although he may be a bit older. Still great game and I highly recommend.\n\n***The only I guess negative thing I can say about this game is at times there are a few translation and grammar issues...but I didnt find that it really detracted from the story as I loved all the characters I have played through (so far).","April 21","true","18.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

What surprised me the most was that while I am usually attracted to certain types, the way the stories were done was immersive enough for me to forget that for example - I usually dislike overly flirty, feminine or fickle personalities, but Asagiri somehow won me over in the end.\n\nEach route has completely different plots and sets of problems that comes your way, and to me, I like that there is substance to their journey of falling in love.

Yoshiwara is a pleasure district where women buy the services of men for either pleasure or to conceive a child. The lady's mother has tasked her (you) to bear a child to continue the family line and heir for the shop. You grew up in a strict and rich household in the mainland and never step into Yoshiwara before.\n\nWhen you reached Ohgiya, you are presented with 5 courtesans.\n1) Takigawa - The most popular courtesan in Ohgiya and has a arrogant personality.\n2) Asagiri - He is a free and wild spirit who refuses to be tamed.\n3) Gakuto - A confident and rugged courtesan. He still someimtes shows an emotional side that is starved for love.\n4) Utsusemi - He is honest and forthright. Imbuned with a deep kindesss and teasures his companions above all others.\n5) Ageha - He is obedient and straightforward and have yet to take on a customer.\n\nPersonal opinon:\nI have choosen Ageha as my first as he is really adorable and he is my type. His storyline so far is quite amazing. Even though there is noticeable difference between Yoshiwara:Kiyuya and Yoshiwara: Ohgiya, I truely enjoyed the story I went through with Ageha as his type of personality was not in Kiyuya. I shall not spoil any spoilers but honestly, this is an awesome otome game.\n\nPros:\n- The money is worth the price, unlike Voltage, 1 main story for S$6. You get to enjoy 5 Main story, 5 Sequel and 5 Date Scenario for the price of S$16.\n- Beautiful CGs and artwork throughout the game.\n- The storyline actually made you feel like you are dating that men you choosen.\n- Music really brings out the mood and makes it feel like you are in that place itself.\n- 5 different personality types to suit different girls, find the one that you really like the most.\n- There is quite a few 18+ scenes where you might enjoy *cough* *nugde nugde wink wink*\n\n\nCons:\n- Music relooping over and over again. You might get sick of it by listening it so many times when you are stuck at the same scene.\n- No awesome opening song unlike Kiyuya. (I really love Kiyuya's opening song)\n- MUSASHI NEEDS HIS OWN STORYLINE. I feel so bad for him whenever he has to come and save me but we can't romance him.\n- Quite little development plot between you and the choosen man.\n\nDifference between Kikuya and Ohgiya:\n- Both sides have their own unqiue personality courtesans.\n- Kikuya has an awesome opening song but Ohgiya doesn't.\n- Some music used in Kikuya was used in this game as well.\n- The interface for Ohgiya is better than Kikuya.\n- I guess there is more development between the characters for Ohgiya than in Kiyuya.\n- In Kiyuya, you are a lady from a lower class standards that never step into Yoshiwara before. In Ohgiya, you are from a strict and rich household but never step into Yoshiwara before.\n\nI honestly love this game a lot as I have high hopes for it after finishing Kikuya stories. I'm quite glad this didn't disappoint me unlike "My Secret Pets". However, if you are reading for development between the two characters, this game might not be up to your expectation. If you are into romance and 18+ scenes, I would highly recommend this to you. Have a good day!","May 28","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/narucch/recommended/447200/","narucch","☆ Naruchin ☆","http://steamcommunity.com/id/narucch/","120 products in account","I was waiting for Ohgiya to come out on the Play Store, since I know that an English version has been available for quite some time on a Japanese equivalent of it. Instead this jumped right on Steam! And I couldn't be more pleased with it.\n\nFirst of all, no need to play Kikuya at all, although having played that before makes the cameos of the Kikuya men twice as funny, because they're so salty you are going to Ohgiya! Kagerou despises everybody. So entertaining. Having the sprites of Kikuya and Ohgiya side to side shows the dramatic improvement in the art (although I have to admit that I liked the old, flashier coloring better). This shows in the CGs as well, not a single one is derpy (can't say the same for Kikuya). Some backgrounds and music are used, but a good bulk of new assets are present as well.\n\nBefore talking about the routes, shoutout to the MC. Yes, she is inexperienced and easily flustered, but she can put up a fight! And sure, she could be dense but she could also play by the courtesans' rules. And she had eyes in all the CGs! She made me so happy.\n\nNow, the men. I honestly can't pick a favorite or rank them. This is actually the first game in which I read all the routes. Coming from mobile, I usually read my favorites and brute-forced my way to the achievements via skipping. Not in Ohgiya! The routes were shorter than in Kikuya, but more concise and to the point. Something was always happening, which is great.\n- Takigawa is the last one I picked. I don't usually like arrogant types, so I didn't actually expect to like his route so much.  His narrative is a take at the 'I'll make you fall for me' game that rarely works but here worked so well! I was smitten. Really liked the MC in his route (albeit dense, she quickly moved to action).\n- Asagiri was dazzling. Easily the most charming of the options. A quote of the MC that roughly says 'is Asagiri real or is he a dream?' sums him up perfectly. But because he was so amazing, the MC felt really dull in comparison, and I really couldn't see how he fell for her. That was my only complaint, that he overshadowed her so much she truly felt like nobody and the romance felt a bit forced because of that.\n- Utsusemi is genuinely a good person and his route suprised me positively. At first I thought he was a weird Okita/Naruto hybrid, and his narrative plays a lot with the concept of family and bonds (and jealousy). Really liked the MC in his route as well. The other guys give him a lot of ♥♥♥♥ in their routes and it's funny having him as the butt of their jokes XD\n- Ageha was cute. He cried a lot. He also m'kayd a lot, but the others give him ♥♥♥♥ for that. Purity and innocence were the main themes of his route, and I liked the dynamic of the couple. For someone coming from Kikuya, his route is probably the best to start with because it highlights the difference in customs between the two shops. While in Kikuya Iroha was basicall cheering for you and Kagerou, getting together with Ageha will be more difficult.\n- Gakuto... TW for ♥♥♥♥ in his route and idk it all made sense to me, but the ending felt anticlimactic and almost like the game didn't want to go too far. Which I totally get because of the 10 chapters limit, but I still think it could have been handled better and pack a better punch. I liked the MC the most in his route.\n\nCan Musashi get a shout out? Poor guy is in love with the MC and has to see her leave every time. I hope his character will be released, I wouldn't mind to pay extra for his DLC.\n\nThe translation flowed really well, and although there were mistakes (and weird ones... 'needen't' in Asagiri route caught my attention a couple of times) there weren't enough to make me complain. But I'm no native speaker.\n\nTo conclude: the art is gorgeous and the sprites beautiful; the characters are well developed, have interesting interactions and the MC is a good one; the narratives are all entertaining, and if you want more date scenario and sequel are included; there are more tracks that in Kikuya and they fit the game well. The price is a steal. Must have for otome fans and good introduction for neophytes :)","May 1","true","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In all honesty I've probably only played about 4 hours of it, 2 hours for each of the 2 routes that I've played and finished. I completed Ageha's route first and I don't recommend starting with him in all honesty.\n\nThe game plays like any other visual novel, it took me about 2 hours to complete one route which has 10 chapters and a little "End of story" chapter. There are 6 CG's for the two characters that I finished and once you finish a main route you unlock the date scenario and the sequel which I have yet to play around with. I'm a rather fast reader so it may or may not take you longer to complete each route.\n\nThat being said, the game moves very fast, extremely fast for my comfort. It's not a huge release game like Code Realize: Guardians of Rebirth or any of the Hakuoki games (I highly recommend Hakuoki if you're looking into purchasing this game). I enjoy getting to know my characters, I love to find out what interests them and how different they are from everyone else, I love the build up to the first kiss or even the first time that the main character holds hands with them. I'm a huge VN supporter and that's why I jumped on this title (plus the artwork is gorgeous and I want more).\n\nI'll be playing through the end of each route and jumping into their sequels and date scenario, for $10 I recommend it, I'm not sure I'd purchase it at it's full price though just because there aren't that many CG's for each character.","April 21","true","25.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

This game is even worth the full price and I would willingly pay even more for it. I'm right up there with the rest of the reviewers, to admit that this game DOES have its faults. Admittedly, some things didn't bother me for quite some time but did begin to wear on me toward the end.\n\nCouple of Cons;\n- Re-used CG's from Kikuya. (Some were understandable, such as the outer portions of Yoshiwara - but inside the brothels should have been designed differently.) In some areas it was weird, such as Asagiri/Utsusemi/Ageha having the same bedrooms? Even Gakuto and Takigawa had the same room..\n\n- The music did become extremely repetitive, after about the first three routes. I wound up muting it in favour of my own music. However, I didn't find it as bothersome as Kikuya's. I actually enjoyed the music for quite some time! The theme reminds me very much of the track played in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's Spirit Temple. It's quite nostalgic and very beautiful.\n\n- Odd translations, but I would consider this to be a plus. I had a great time screenshotting and making inside jokes about some of the typos! To me, it really added; but to others, it would mostly be a con. However, the translations HAVE improved since Kikuya, but I believe a patch update for some of the worse translations are needed. Proofreading is something that definitely can be worked on in the future.\n\n- CG's. I personally felt like the story CG's had a lot less per route than in Kikuya. I haven't confirmed this, but it just felt that way to me. While the artwork and each CG was absolutely beautiful, I feel like there should have been more. It also felt like in areas where there should have been CG's, there weren't. For example, the wedding ceremony of Ageha and Kiyoha - there were several scenes in Asagiri's route as well as Utsusemi's that I truly felt could have been given graphics.\n\n- Easily romanced characters. I understand it's not really the type of game, but I feel it would've been smoother to have characters disapprove in some situations. There were instances where Kiyoha was HORRIBLE to them (namely Asagiri). Be it with or without an option, her harsh words never truly affected relationships as much as it should've. Even if it didn't set the likeability back any, you shouldn't even gain 1% in some scenarios. It's pretty hard to get anything but the best ending on your first playthrough, unless you really try.\n\n- The outright awful treatment of Musashi and how his feelings were stomped on repeatedly in each route. While I don't believe he should've been romanceable, I was truly upset by how everything turned out for him time and time again. I feel, at least in one of the routes, he should've been able to move on/find some other young lady.\n\n- No voiceovers. I thought, for SURE, that Ohgiya would be voiced. I was very disappointed to find out it wasn't. However, I do have mental headcanons for who voice actors would be. (Kenichi Suzumura (or maybe Suwabe Junichi but SuzuKen fits him better IMO) as Asagiri,  Takahiro Sakurai or Hikaru Midorikawa as Takigawa and Daisuke Ono as Gakuto, anyone?)\n\nNow, that might seem to be a hefty list of cons, but do not allow that to deter you - there are FAR more pros to this game and to be honest, I think it rivals and even outdoes Kikuya in many ways.\n\nA few of MANY, MANY pros this game offers;\n- Better, updated artwork although the same style. I love how much detail has been placed into their eyes and you notice, especially in Asagiri's route, that his eyes are his charm point - they're practically animated and they truly use this throughout the renders.\n\n- I believe there's more than enough save slots which actually let me double-back and re-play Asagiri, halfway through finishing another route.\n\n- The plotline and writing. Especially in Gakuto/Asagiri/Ageha's routes. The character development of the courtesans and the heroine was astounding. Each character truly is dynamic and have things about them that make them believable and even real; you're truly immersed in the story. Truly, my only two complaints with the plotline are in Asagiri's route when she lashes out without an option to choose not to. I understand the mindset and plot progression on it, but it was the only thing that really felt rushed and like it was ONLY to move the plot forward. Another was the RANDOM AND COMPLETLY HEARTBREAKING APPARENT DEATH/ATTEMPT ON TOKIWA FROM KIKUYA'S LIFE??? LIKE? It tied in PERFECTLY with Tokiwa's storyline in the first game which just blew my freaking mind. Heartbreaking and totally freaking uncalled for, but perfectly timed.\n\n- The cameo appearances of (most) of the Kikuya characters. As far as I recall, Takao, Kagura, Kagerou and Tokiwa all make appearances.\n\n- Despite there being quite a few chapters, to be honest, you hardly notice. The plotline flows extremely smoothly from chapter to chapter. Even when there's a cliffhanger or two, the suspense was built for quite some time and you truly fall in love with each character the same way Kiyoha does. They're quite long and they're very detailed, truly immersing you. The romances are slow, believable and downright passionate.\n\n- I loved how often the scene changed and how you truly got to explore the world of Yoshiwara.\n\nI personally had a VERY difficult time in choosing between all of them. That is one thing I would say I think Kikuya accomplished better; thoroughly introducing the courtesans in the prologue, enough that you felt prepared enough to make a choice. In Ohgiya, I truly felt the Prologue was too short and that they didn't interact enough with the lady. They mostly interact amongst themelves (which is actually nice and I did enjoy that. I actually ship a couple of the men together, whoops! Kikuya didn't have nearly as much interaction amongst the courtesans, in comparison.) But for the Prologue, I feel the majority of the interaction should've been between the men and the lady as you need to see how they interact with her to choose who you wish. I felt a little bit of a pull toward Ageha and Asagiri (who later turned out to be my two favourites) but in the end decided on Takigawa first. Simply, due to him being listed first and knowing how I regretted not playing Takao first in Kikuya.\n\nI don't regret my choice, I really enjoyed his route! I then played Asagiri/Gakuto/Utsusemi/Ageha. I do believe Ageha should be played last due to how powerful and sweet his route is; I think Asagiri should be saved second for last. I do recommend playing Gakuto before either Utsusemi or Ageha. As well as Takigawa before Asagiri.\n\n(TLDR; I suggest playing in order of: Takigawa -> Gakuto -> Utsusemi -> Asagiri -> Ageha. Takigawa and Gakuto are interchangeable, but Gakuto does throw you in the deep end - so I do recommend Takigawa first.)\n\nOkay, enough of my rambling! All in all, I'm very passionate about this game. One of my favourite Otomes, for sure! Highly recommend!","May 8","true","42.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It has less romancable characters, five in all, but their stories are a lot more interesting and less generic. Plus the story flows fluently and the translation is not as akward as it was in Kikuya. The interface is identical in both games, as is music, and the art is equally lovely. It's quite easy to navigate and save your choices at any point, you can also see how much affection you get with each choice, so you won't be left picking a dialogue option blindly.\nAll in all, it's a great adition to all the otome games we have in english to this day. It has less content than a game like Dandelion, but if you want to try a game from this developer, it's a lot better choice than for e.g. Kikuya.","April 30","true","12.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The music is used and some of the background pictures. The art work is amazing and beautiful. The characters stories pulls on your heart strings and it's pretty cool how some of the characters from Kikuya is included in a couple of the characters' routes. The thing I was worried about was because their were fewer chapters compared to the first game. I wasn't sure what to expect from the storyline since it was cut down 6 chapter shorter. It didn't really make much difference because I grew to like the characters quite a bit.","April 25","true","15.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"
