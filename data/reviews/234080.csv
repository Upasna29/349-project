"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kruzenshtern/recommended/234080/","Kruzenshtern","Krusenstern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kruzenshtern/","95 products in account","I must say I never played a Castlevania game before, so forgive me when I lack some background for a proper comparison to the previous installments.\nOverall this game is fairly good. It has some problems like the strange hitboxes which seem a bit off sometimes (you can get hit even though the enemy's attack actually didn't reach you and things like these), but this happens rarely. The other negative point is the static camera which sometimes positions not very idealy, preventing you from viewing parts of the screen and sometimes missing hidden areas.\nIn terms of art direction this game is gorgeous. Mercury Steam really had some talent working on the world design of this game. If you like gothic european fantasy art styles, this game delivered in my opinion. Art direction is stunning at times and I even stopped for a few seconds here and there to eyeball the scenery. It's a very pretty looking game.\nThe voice acting is also of decent quality. Story might not be god tier like, but it's still remains interesting with a few surprising plot twists in the second half of the game.\nWhat needs to be said is: The game takes a lot of time to get really started. The first levels are basically tutorials where you gain new equipment and movesets. It gets more interesting after the 3rd or 4th chapter.\nThe combat is a bit comparable to God of War's. Your weapon is a whip-like chain that lets you perform direct attacks to center on single enemies or areal attacks for groups of enemies. You can mix these attacks and also learn new movesets and combos the more experience points you gather. These combos and attacks can be combined with the light and shadow powers you receive throughout the game. That way you pile up a nice plethora of combos and movesets at your disposal which gives the combat system enough depth to not get boring. Not Devil May Cry-tier but still nice.\n\nIn short: Do you love european medieval gothic art styles and are looking for an action game with nice visuals and somewhat meaty combat system? Try it. Also try the demo first. Just know that the demo only represents the very beginning of the game and is not really a good indictation of how fleshed out the game gets.","November 25, 2013","true","62.8"," 273 of 321 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","273","321","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/234080/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","As someone who has never played the old Castlevania games I went blind to Lords of Shadow. I didn’t knew anything about the story other than that it involved vampires. The only thing that made me buy the game in the first place was the huge amount of positive reviews. And, like I usually do, I waited until I got the other two Castlevania games on Steam to start playing the first one. A few hours into the game, I was having a blast.\n\nFrom top notch music to gorgeous and memorable locations such as forests, gothic castles, desert lands and ruins from an old civilization, this game has it all. Combined witha fast paced action combat (with tons of unlockable combos) this made for quite the epic experience. Although enemy variety was somewhat lacking, certain locaitons had a specific set of enemies assigned to it, thus making it harder to forget those zones. As for the gameplay itself, as I mentioned before, it is quite fast paced. You have to adapt to changes in the enemy behavior, aswell as bosses, and use a variety of attacks to effectively defeat your foes.\n\nThe game itself is rather long, taking around 20-22 hours to play it through, which was rather a surprise for me. Of course, for all the completionists and collectible hunters out there, Lords of Shadow also has something in store for you. The game is divided in 12 chapters (+2 chapters corresponding to the DLC included in the Ultimate Edition), and each of those chapters is subsequently divided into several stages. It is in these stages that you’ll be able to explore and collect scrolls containing letters from fallen brethren of the Brootherhood of Light, and you’ll also be able to find gems that enhance your abilities. And if you’re into bigger challenges, you can try completing Trials for said stages which, I believe, reward you with an achievement. So yeah, not only the game is a blast on its foundations, but it also rewards exploration, which, in my book, is always a plus.\n\nNow, enough talking about all the good things this game has, and lets talk about my only gripe with the game, the controls, or perhaps my terrible skills at precision platforming in a 3D game. I swear that sometimes the game just made me want to shove the controller through my monitor (anger issues perhaps?). Very rare were these situations, but they were infuriating when they occurred. I honestly can’t tell you if it was an issue with the controls, like the inability to control with precisio where you want to land or if I’m just really bad at jumping from platform to platform in a 3D game.\n\nThat said, I can’t recommend this game enough. It is an epic journey through some amazing landscapes and it has one of the most insane and thrilling soundtracks I’ve ever heard on a videogame. Please, do yourself a favour and do not keep Lords of Shadow on your backlog.\n\nI hope these words accomplish my intenteded goal, which was raising awareness for a series that I feel that went under the radar for alot of PC gamers. Or perhaps that is just me, afterall, I have never played the old Castlevania games and I only played this one three years after its release, maybe that’s why.\n\nPS: Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nIf you're looking for good reviews, consider joining Good Games Giveaways & Reviews group.

However, much to my disappointment I found this game lacking and I would not recommend it.  Stubbornly, I finished the game.\n\nThe good?  Great voice acting, extremely beautiful environments, good music, and a fair story.\n\nThe bad?  Well, everything else.  My number one gripe is the fixed camera.  As you navigate through the levels, the camera arbitarily positions itself.  You have no control over it whatsoever.  As a result exploring the levels, or pitching the camera to get an ideal vantage point for battle or movement is completely prohibited.  The game almost feels like 2.5D.\n\nThere is none of the exploration or freedom you feel in games like Symphony of the Night.  Levels are extremely linear.  They are no alternate routes, like Dishonored, and there are ton of invisible walls.\n\nCombat is a mixed bag.  I used my Xbox 360 controller, which I don't mind at all.  Sometimes combat is fun, but there's a lot to control towards the middle-end game.  Double tap an analog controller to sprint?!?  Crazy bad game design there.\n\nThere's also a ton of quick time events, a la the action is paused and you have to hit a button at a precious moment.  Really takes you out of the action.\n\nI guess I was hoping for something between Dark Souls and Darksiders, but this game was far too restrictive in the controls for my tastes.  I'd rate it a 5/10, and highly suggest people try the demo before buying!\n\nUPDATE: I'm puzzled why people would consider my review anything other than my opinion subject to my own preferences and playstyle.  Of course my view is subjective, I bare no responsibility to review the game objectively as would a professional journalist.  If you find Castlevania: LoS to your liking, then my opinion should have no baring on your enjoyment of the game.  However, your opinion does not invalidate my own opinion, it's just that it's your opinion.\n\nI think strong comparisons could be made to this game with Darksiders.  They have similar combat systems, incentives to revisit levels to unlock more upgrades, and similar settings.  Personally, I thought Darksiders did a much better job executing an action/adventure game.  The first big win is a positional camera.  The second would be just the way you explore the world, while not an open world it just feels like you have more freedom to choose your path than Castlevania.  Castlevania also suffers from a lot of invisible walls unlike Darksiders, where a lot of the platforming is nearly risk free.\n\nAgain, if you haven't purchased the game yet, I strongly suggest trying the demo first.  I have not played Devil May Cry or Metalgear Rising, which may serve as a more fair comparison.  Maybe this game does very well satisfying gamers who find that type of game appealing.  Again, as I haven't played them I don't know how Castlevania compares.\n\nThe game was good enough to complete, but not good enough for me to recommend.","December 16, 2013","false","40.5"," 605 of 850 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","605","850","0","39"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/generomachina/recommended/234080/","generomachina","DaveBot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/generomachina/","596 products in account","[This is a no spoilers review]\n\nOof, this game, I really have mixed feelings about it. It has some incredible visuals and the soundtrack is also pretty nice. The story is decent, but not particularly noteworthy - although the general lore is interesting, if you like arthurian legend and vampires.\n\nBut in the end, everything in this game is a mix of ups and downs. It almost feels like they didn't really know how to make games, but tried their hands on it anyway, just to get a format for their ideas. So many rules are broken, design inconsistencies, introducing mechanics to people then suddenly they work differently "just because." It can be a really frustrating experience, and most of the game is absolutely riddled with invisible walls (every single level will have you go "wait, I can't go there?"), plus the fact that you have no control over the camera.\n\nThere's platforms and jumping puzzles all over the place, but all of it is completely on rails. For example: You can't jump out from a wall, if there's nothing to jump out to and grab. This is a sign of lazy design, where instead of working on adequately communicating when the users SHOULD jump, they just don't let them jump at all, if there's nothing to jump to. It might not sound like much, but it feels incredibly restrictive, with absolutely no illusion of freedom at all.\n\nYou can find a lot of general inspirations in this game, but it's almost like it has no idea if what it wants to be. It's all brooding and dark, but then there's the occassional joke they crack up, completely out of context, leaving you feeling very awkward afterwards. Unfortunately, lacking narrative and mechanical identity, means that it never does anything but visuals and music properly. In here, you'll see strains of Devil May Cry mostly, with the occassional "Shadow of the Colossus" moments, which are often very poorly implemented, lengthy and frustrating.\n\nI usually play DMC with the difficulty all the way up, because it feels rewarding to progress, thanks to the fact that its rules of play are consistent. But for this game, I ended up turning down the difficulty; because Lords of Shadow is really hard, but in a very frustrating way, by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over its own rules from time to time. It takes all sense of user responsibility away, leaving you with no feeling of "ouch that was my own fault, need to get better," but instead an ocean of "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!" With ultimate edition especially, with the final boss in the extra chapters, they just end up going full ♥♥♥♥♥♥, by telling you to "watch the moves of the boss to avoid its attacks," while simultaneously forcing you to jump into the air where you can't dodge. There's about a fraction of a second for you to react, but if you're in a wrong position, you can get screwed hard and even stun-locked until you're dead. Not a nice experience.\n\nOn the upside, at least, it is a pretty long game. If you want to stroll around and take in the environmental design, you'll be pleased to see just how varied the landscapes are.\n\nFor the 25 euro asking price, I can't recommend it. However, if you ever see it on sale and want a lengthy, decently interesting experience, you should probably give this game a look. Just don't expect a very polished experience.\n\n[Edit]: Oh yeah, just thought that I'd add the fact, that despite the really stupid moments this game has, the rest of it still made well enough up for it, for me to sit through nearly 20 hours and completing the story. It's not a terrible game, but it's not amazing either. It just has content from both ends of the spectrum.\n\nOh and for god's sake Gabriel, there is such a thing as too many dramatic pauses when you speak!","November 15, 2014","true","19.8"," 73 of 86 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","73","86","4","6"

There is incredible detail put into every level!\n\nThe game is decently long too.  It doesn't feel like it gets old either.  The levels are refreshing and there are a ton of boss fights.  There isn't really any ingenuity in the gameplay- I've seen it all elsewhere, but that's fine with me.  As long as it doesn't fail-  which it does not.\n\nI honestly think this game should've gotten Game of the Year back in 2011, instead of Skyrim.

This game builds on that and you will chuckle many a time as you try out new combos and fun powers to experiment with.\n\nI had a great time playing through the whole thing. Sure, it's a long game, maybe too long for some, but for me it was just about right.\n\nExcept for one annoying instance that took me many tries to beat, the game felt very balanced when shifting between medium (warrior) and easy (squire). And believe me when I say you should play it on either of those two difficulties, if you'd like to preserve your sanity. You may play for challenges if you wish, but they are not mandatory, so even the non-masochistic players can enjoy their METAL CHAIN WHIPPING game. QTE's are never great, but I didn't find them too annoying here. Cut scenes break up some of the game, but it's still very enjoyable.\n\nOh, and the art is mostly DROP DEAD GORGEOUS - I want these artists to decorate my house if they ever get tired of pouring their HEART and SOULS into games like this.\n\nYou can do some combat parts by button-mashing, but you should learn to counter, block and time your hits after some time. BUT FEAR NOT, because this is both fun and super-satisfying - the blood party starts for real when you pull something awesome off with your METAL CHAIN WHI...(okay, you got it), and the game goes into slow-motion as you smack your enemies around, consuming leftover dark and light energy orbs from their corpses, to fuel your powers for another round of METAL CHAIN WHIP (sorry, it's just the best weapon ever) carnage.\n\nMy playing it for all those hours should tell you one thing - to buy this game as soon as you get the chance.","August 27, 2015","true","41.2"," 68 of 81 people (84%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","84","68","81","36","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/234080/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Castlevania: Lords of Shadows is an action adventure game, developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami Digital Entertainment. Releasing in August 2013 on PC, Xbox 360 and PS3. The game is set in South Europe during the Middle ages. This was a reboot of the Castlevania series, where you play as Gabriel and you follow his quest to revive his wife.\n\nGameplay is played from a third person perspective. Your main weapon consists of a retractable chain, and you can learn up to forty different combos to use in the hack and slash combat system. As you progress through the story mode, you will learn new abilities along the way, as well as picking up new unique pieces of equipment which boast uses in both combat and non-combat situations. Gabriel will learn how to muster magical powers of light and dark. Light powers enable the player to heal any damage taken in fights by hitting enemies, whilst dark allows the player to deal extra damage. You are able to renew these magic powers by hitting a high string of attacks together without being interrupted, which will release magic orbs for you to collect. You will encounter tons of different types of enemies, from trolls, zombies, and spider’s right the way up to gigantic titans. Each enemy has their own strength and weakness which you will be able to use to your advantage.\n\nThe boss fights throughout the game are some of the most intense scenes I have played in a game. Each boss has multiple different phases of fight, each requiring you to act in a different way. The titan boss fights are long processes which normally also require an element of platforming. These can become a little bit of a pain when you first start out the game as you are still learning how to use all of the mechanics but by the last titan boss fight, it shouldn’t pose any problems for a veteran titan killing machine.\n\nWhilst the game does have an element of platforming in a few boss fights, the game also has small amounts of platforming included throughout the story mode too. Of course jumping puzzles are always going to be my biggest enemy, and sadly they also make an appearance and are as frustrating as usual.\nGraphically, Lords of Shadows is stunning; it is difficult to think that this game was released in 2013. It looks gorgeous. The cut scenes are almost a step down in graphical fidelity compared to the in game graphics. There is a huge different in how the game looks on PC compared to the consoles though. Animations throughout the game are all fluid and perfectly designed too. The sound effects are spot on, with some brilliant voice acting to be heard also from the likes of Patrick Stuart.\n\nThe game has various levels of difficulty, and you can also change them on the fly. The easy mode is essentially just a way to see the story as the combat poses no real threat. Paladin mode is the game’s hard-core mode, where enemies are more dangerous and Gabriel is significantly weaker than usual. This will add an extra layer of replay ability to a game that already boasts over twenty five hours of content. On top of the lengthy story mode, each stage also has a “trial” for you to complete as well, these can be simple tasks such as completing the stage in less than a specified amount of time, or more challenging such as not being able to use your magic’s throughout the stage.\n\nI initially thought I would be able to play the game on 4k resolution given the age of the title, but unfortunately, I was not able to, not because my rig was not powerful enough, but because when setting the resolution to anything over 1080p, the screen in game began to flicker violently – this required a hard reboot of my system before I was able to get back into the game to change the settings back to 1080p. I would also strongly recommend people play this game on a controller; it plays perfectly on an Xbox controller and the keyboard controls would just become a huge chore to anyone regardless of their skill.\n\nOverall, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is an underrated title that is definitely well worth your time in checking out. The game’s price tag of £19.99 is perfectly matched at the game’s length and production values. Fans of the series will be pleased with the amount of lore and plenty of tributes to older instalments in the franchise.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

This game has the most amazing setpieces I have seen in a game ever!! Yes it has elements of games like GOD and DMC but the game is totally different. I think it borrowed but it did extremely well creating an original game. The story is amazing and one of the longest games I have played. The score is beautiful. Finally no techno and classical metal with catchy tunes. No, this game has a full orchestra playing beautiful Music. Not one level repeats itself and you always discover something new and different. It's full of hidden items and unforgivingly hard Trials that give the game great replay value. I have been playing over 60 hours and not even once have I been bored. The game is very hard specially if you start on Hardened and then go back to do the trials. Be prepared to die ALOT since at the beginning your character is  very weak. But isn't that what we want? A hardcore difficult game were it actually takes skill to get to the next stage.

The world is beautifully designed and extremely interesting to explore. The enemies are very cool looking too, especially some of the bosses that you come across.\n\nUsually I find myself turning music off in my games, but the soundtrack is great and definitely adds to the overall experience. If you’re a fan of beautiful music made with the help of a full orchestra then you’ll likely appreciate this as well.\n\nCombat is pretty fun, albeit a little too hack n’ slash for my taste. My biggest issue with combat is that you are often times required to complete a finishing move on your enemies. If you are like me and a bit rusty with the controller, you might find this to be a bit frustrating as failing to press the designated button in time can result in your enemy regaining some health despite their health bar being completely drained previously. I’m not a huge fan of finishing moves in the first place, but if you don’t mind them or are skilled with a controller then this shouldn’t be an issue for you.\n\nThe biggest issue in this game is the fixed camera. The angles can be incredibly awkward, sometimes causing difficulty in seeing what you are doing or where you’re going. This can be extremely frustrating at times, so be warned.\n\nThis game is definitely meant to be played with a controller, not even worth trying without a keyboard and mouse. I tried and failed pretty miserably before resorting to my trusty XBOX controller, but perhaps others might have more luck.\n\nIn all honesty this is not a type of game I would usually go for, yet I still am enjoying it very much.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/234080/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","NOTE: Two primary complaints people have is that this game was either 1. "Not old school and therefor not a real Castlevania game" or 2. "God of War Clone". I have played only one other Castlevania game (Symphony of the Night) and have never played any God of War title therefore I'm reviewing this BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE.\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow is a reboot of the classic Castlevania series. Originally released back in 2010 on the consoles. It finally made its way to the PC 3 YEARS later. This version includes all the previous DLC releases.\n\nYou play as Gabriel Belmont, a member of the Brotherhood of Light who is on a quest to end the reign of darkness and avenge the murder of his wife Marie. In your struggle against the Lords of Shadow, will Gabriel fall victim to the very evil he seeks to destroy?\n\nPROS:\n+ Sound: -This game has some of the best musical score I have heard in a video game. As a bonus, the game also boasts superior voice acting from the cast. Robert Carlyle's Scottish accent gives Gabriel Belmot a unique and awesome voice. Sir Patrick Stewart brings his top notch signature voice playing as Belmont's friend and senior.\n\n+ Graphics: -The 1080p support for the PC does wonders for the game. It looks much sharper than the console counter part with very detailed and high quality textures, followed by a breath taking world and scenery. Animation quality is fluid and enemy variation is plenty. My only complaint is that the graphics option and customization is severely lacking.\n\n+ Story: -I like the story, easy enough to understand, complex enough to not be boring. Like a TV series, the end of a chapter makes me want to know whats going to happen next.\n\n+ Puzzles: -The puzzles in this game are either stupid or smart. Luckily for us, the smart puzzles are challenging and satisfying to solve specially without the help of guides. I do hate the fact that the game will allow you to spend experience points to automatically solve the puzzle for you.\n\nCONS:\n- Camera: -This game has the WORST camera I have ever experienced, a camera so determined to make you look at the scenery rather than the combat. 75% of my deaths came from falling off the edge during the platforming sections because I can't see where I'm supposed to jump, or unseen enemies lurking behind the FIXED camera angle who you won't be able to dodge or block because they are outside your effective sight range.\n\n- Auto-targeting: -Aside from the camera, this game also has one bad auto-targeting system. Your character will end up having the tendency to attack pottery or statues, rather than the three warewolves that are biting your face off, all because the pottery was the closest target from you.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nGOOD GAME AND A GOOD BUY. Definitely worth your time specially if you're looking for a narrative driven story.\n\nAlthough I'm sure some of the hardcore and die hard old school Castlevania fans disagree. For me, who likes, but is not an avid fan of the original games, find Castlevania: Lords of Shadow to be a very good game in its own right.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The best word I can come up with to describe this game is 'tedious.' Everything in this game is tedious. It has all of the makings of a good game, but something comes off in a way that makes it feel off, just a bit.\n\nThe weapons lack any 'punch' and it doesn't feel like your attacks have any effect on enemies. The platforming is almost fine, but there are inconsistencies with how far Gabriel can jump, what ledges he can grab, etc. Tedious. Dying leads to three confirmation screens about respawning, which quickly gets aggrivating.\n\nThe graphics and the story were fine, but this was seriously a chore to play. I can't think of a game in recent memory that I didn't want to play as much as this one.\n\nI played the majority of the game on hard, so that may have lent to some of my frustration with it.","December 16, 2013","false","22.9"," 110 of 165 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","110","165","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/234080/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is pretty cool I guess.\n\nNow, to get this out of the way. My experience with the actual Castlevania series is about as thin as the condom my parents used on the night of my conception. I played a little bith of Symphony, a little bit of Rondo of blood on an emulator when I was 11  a Super Nintendo, and a little bit of Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin for this magical two screened device I found in the back of a dumpster.  This being said, I do like the series even if I haven't gotten around to playing them. I know who Simon Belmont is, and who Dracula is, and who Trevor Belmont and Richter Belmont are. I know the general lore and backstory behind the games, and I know just how deep and involving the series was, especially Symphony of the Night and onward.\n\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/castlevania/images/5/51/DracSymph.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080227221523 This is Simon Belmont, right?\n\nAnyway.\n\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow is a reboot to the long standing and venerated Castlevania series. Set in Southern Europe during events that totally happened. When Earth's ties with Heaven is severed, a bunch of bad things happen such as dead people walking and evil monsters knocking on your door and asking for a donation in human flesh. Knowing that the end of the world is upon us all, the Brotherhood of Light decides to send only their tallest and most handsome knights on a crusade to stop this evil and save the human race.   Seriously, they're all jacked.\n\nBut the tallest and most handsome of them all is Gabriel Belmont, a newcomer to the series. Gabriel is seeking atonement for the sins of his past as well as vengeance for a love lost to him. He does this by grabbing what could possibly be one of the coolest weapons in video game history and punching the love of Christ into anything that looks like it came from a Bram Stoker novel.\n\nWhat seperates Kings of Comfortable Shade from other Castlevania games is that it's a hack-n-slash brawler in the same vain like God of War, a big departure for the series but I feel like it did good in this regard, if not better than it's angry Greek man counterpart.\n\nAll of Gabriel's attacks have this meaty weight to them, the general crunch of his combat cross and the big flashyness of the impact give an impression that hits a little harder than your average human. Take this and add it to a simple yet versatile combo system, and you have room to make your enemies say "That was sick" right before their skulls are punched out the back of their heads.\n\nBut how does it play out?\n\nLords of Shadows is, to my knowledge, the first Castlevania game handled by a studio outside of Japan, though I'm probably wrong. But you can tell that Spanish based Mercury Studios put a lot of love into the world and lore of this game. Lords of Shadow has that advantage that many games of it's calibre lack, and that is that Lords of Shadow isn't afraid of explain things to the player. The way the world works, what does what, who is who, and what I'm punching in the head is all laid out and explained to Gabriel and, in turn, to the player.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means I know that a guy called Gandolfi created the combat cross after playing with a yo yo and thinking "This could probably hurt somebody."\nI know that the more human a vampire looks the more likely it is to go all Sith Lord on you with the lightning hands. I know that the Forgotten One is a huge prick, and I know that there probably aren't any cute lycan girls. They wouldn't date you anyways so it's okay.\n\nShould you play Fortressmania: Dukes of flashlight?\n\nIs it a good game? I would say so, it does many things better than it's competitors, It's world is unique and interesting enough to make you want to learn more, and Gabriel himself is a pretty cool protagonist for what it is. It also helps that the game's plot is narrated by Patrick Stewart. You can hear his bald, it's amazing.\n\nBut is it a good Castlevania game? I'm probably not the best person to ask. I like the series, don't get me wrong. It's just that I have never actually gotten around to sitting down with all of them. if you treat it for what it is, a reboot seprated from the main franchise, then you'll probably like it. But if you look at it as another piece in the main adventures of Belmont and pals, then it would probably leave a bad impression with you.  But I, personally, enjoyed the game and have a new respect for murdering the hell out of things with a crucifix.\n\nCombat Cross carnage: The reckoning gets 9 cheesy PS1 era dialogue lines out of 10.\n\nVampires can only enter your home if you invite them in. But they'll still feel uncomfortable if you sit on your bed naked with a rose in your mouth. Don't ask how I know that.\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation\n\n\n\n\n","July 31, 2015","true","20.7"," 60 of 84 people (71%) found this review helpful 84 people found this review funny","71","60","84","84","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/234080/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Castlevania: Lords of Shadow Ultimate Edition came to PC after a successful debut on Xbox 360 and PS3. Although a re-release, this version is special in a few ways that make it a good buy. However, there was a specific purpose that was in mind with this edition.\n\nThe story follows Gabriel Belmont, a member of the Brotherhood of Light, in his quest to revive his murdered wife. With the help of the mythical God, Pan, Gabriel journeys through various lands to kill the Lords of Shadow; three powerful demons responsible for a spell that has cut off God's connection to the world. After defeating each member of the Lords of Shadow and some lesser bosses, Gabriel gains various armours and medallions that grant extra moves and powers while also upgrading his Combat Cross, a weaponized chain whip – the main weapon. There are twists and turns with plenty of cinematics and dialogue which keep Castlevania very much story orientated. Gameplay is very similar to titles such as God of War and Dante's Inferno, with a third person view and jumping, dodging, blocking and parrying, grabs and button mashing and timing grapples, all playing their respective roles in combat and level progression that is smooth and intense. Base enemies vary in difficulty and tactics, with each enemy type having their own signature moves and fighting styles so there is no 'upgraded bad guy with the same moves as the last one' going on. Each area has its own minions who will not likely appear anywhere else, so combat is kept fresh. There are lots of combos that can be learned, some of which can only be used when certain extra abilities are activated. These combos also help to keep things fresh as many enemies will not be affected the same way by the same combo or move; where as one is stunned by a ground-pound, another will shrug it off. There are such a large number of combos and moves that a player will likely find the few they like the most and stick to those. A complaint from some, the large volume of moves at least gives wiggle room for alternative play styles.\n\nBoss fights focus on a cinematic approach rather than straight forward smash 'n slash beat downs. As with the previously mentioned titles, the aim is to take down a small amount of health with standard fighting then, when the boss becomes vulnerable, tired, or fooled into running headlong in to a wall, must be grabbed or will recover most, if not all, of the health that had been taken away. When grabbed, a series of timed inputs, or rapid mashing, will take the player through a preset sequence of blows and recapitulates that, if successful, will break down the boss bit by bit until, finally, a longer and more engrossing sequence will play out for the ending death blows. These sequences are well planned out and show some imaginative choreography, however, the player will most likely miss many of the subtleties in these sequences as the inputs will be the main focus. Environment design is an important part in the immersion of any visual art. Castlevania has some of the best level and environment design out at the moment. Large, sweeping castles, forests, tundras, and canyons, titantic towers, spires, mountains, cliffs, huge and dilapidated stone warriors strewn about in aimless deaths, all and more immerse the player in a world of gigantic beings and powers. The sheer size of many places shows the great feats that Gabriel will have to overcome both physically and mentally if he is to succeed.\n\nCastlevania also demands the player climb and jump through the level in order to progress. Many, if not all, of the environments have obstacles and areas that can only be surpassed and reached, respectively, by climbing. Ledges, of course, are the primary mode of this form of transportation. The Combat Cross also comes in to play as convenient branches of wood and stone, embedded rungs in walls, and broken turrets can be latched on to and used as an anchor to ascend, descend, and swing on.\n\nSet in to the level design is the regular appearance of puzzles that must be solved in order to continue. These puzzles are usually story relevant with only a rare few being put simply to confound the player with abstract riddle. These puzzles can be simple manoeuvring challenges which rely on the players quick and nimble controller movements, to logical conundrums and riddles that must be understood first before the pieces may be moved in to their correct places. There is a wide variety of these puzzles that occur on a regular basis and whose completion gains experience. These puzzles can be solved instantly if a scroll on which a hint and description of the puzzle is found. The side-stepped puzzle does not give out an experience bonus, though, so the challenges are well worth the time they take while also giving an out for the particularly stubborn ones.\n\nWhat this re-release offers as extras in its Ultimate Edition is reason enough to buy. Lords of Shadow is now soaked in magnificent drawn and painted representations of every enemy type, boss, and character. Once met, a notification will show and the games menu will direct the player to the amazingly detailed pencil portraits depicting the enemy or friendly along with a description and a visual representation of its defences and weaknesses, where applicable. Points can also be saved and spent in an Extras menu in which concept art, storyboards, and painted level designs can be accessed after the completion of their respective chapter. These drawings and paintings are indeed works of art and any fans of the Castlevania series, dev team, or any aspiring and established artists will find these pieces both beautiful and technically sound.\n\nThe jewel of the proverbial crown, however, is the DLC. Reverie and Redemption, two extra chapters that lead through the aftermath of the Lords of Shadow storyline, take us to the desolate castle of the defeated vampiric Lord of Shadow where more events unfold that inevitably set up the story for Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2. This Ultimate Edition does not just give what was already given, but adds to it with upgraded graphics and beautiful and interesting additional content. The foundation of such a strong revamp of a classic series to the modern action-adventure genre quiets most complaints and comments right off the bat. Those who have played or are interested in Lords of Shadow know what they will be getting. If one was looking forward to the sequel, this Ultimate Edition brings the player up to speed all for one price. On a personal note, I very much enjoyed this Castlevania and am looking forward to finishing the next one!\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","March 31, 2015","true","28.4"," 42 of 54 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","42","54","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ge0stigma/recommended/234080/","ge0stigma","geøstigma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ge0stigma/","227 products in account","Funny thing is that when I first tried this game on its release date is that I liked the gameplay and story setting but was unable to fully enjoy it because the static camera bugged me a lot so I gave up. Later, for reasons unknown, I decided that this game deserves a second chance (mostly because I heard that Hideo Kojima was on the project. Take that Konami!). I'm so glad I did that ^^\nCastlevania: Lords Of Shadow is now without a doubt, one of the best action adventure games that I have ever played and definitely in my top 5, maybe even top 3 (haven't really gave it that much thought) of the most beautiful and artistic games I ever saw! Just browse through my screenshots and you will see what I mean. I sometimes finished a session with over 20 screens that I just HAD to take, unable to resist the call of f12 because the game looks so f***in amazing! Every scene in this game is polished to the max with so many beautiful details and every 3rd scene is breathtaking and calls for a screenshot. If you like eyecandy, that's reason enough to play this game but there is so much more to it. The beautiful scenery and fixed camera angle really made me start loving that fixed camera and continue playing with enjoyment.\n\n- As for the gameplay, its simply brilliant. This is one fine example of console games that the PC audience has the privilege to play. Its action packed with varieties of different enemies and by variety I mean around 40 different enemy types if I'm not mistaken that are all quite unique both in appearance(and by that I don't mean just retexture of the same model) and required combat approach but, fear not, they have the numbers but you have the combos. There are so many combos that you can master and use to battle these creatures and the game actually encourages you to learn and master all of these by incorporating a combo gauge system that fills up and rewards you with magical orbs the longer you combo, the more diversity you use in your battles and as long as you do not take any damage. And if that isn't enough for you, you have two unique alternate stances that give unique finishers and damage properties to your existing moves as well as 4 types of gadgets at your disposal. Pretty hardcore, right :)\n\n- Once you take down a pack of werewolves or grind to dust a band of skeletons warriors that just refuse to die and keep respawning, you will frequently find yourself solving all kinds of puzzles. Now, this is a 50-50. Some people will love it, I know I did, but then again, some people will hate it and to those who don't like the puzzle and adventure aspect and prefer to focus mainly on combat, I strongly suggest getting Devil May Cry or Metal Gear Revengence instead. From what I understand, puzzle solving has always been a part of Castlevania games and I am really glad that they decided to keep that gameplay aspect. Puzzles are not really challenging but will sway your thought off of monsters and challenge your mind a bit, rather than reflexes. It feels natural to have this aspect in a game with a theme as this one, but I know that people will be split in two groups when it comes to this so consider yourselves warned puzzle haters.\n\n- Last but not least (somehow I write that in pretty much every review) we have these amazing boss battles. I left them as the last topic since they incorporate all of the above. Bosses are like puzzles that you have to battle. Big, massive, challenging and beautifully thought and designed puzzle/battles(I'm sure older gamers will know what I mean). It is not a simple matter of beating them senseless, you will have to figure out how and when to hurt them. Some stages will require you to do environmental interactions or provoke a boss to strike at a specific spot so you can... well, do stuff to them. I don't wanna go into too many details since its kind of a spoiler but, rest assured that these are super cool and very memorable.\n*Anyone familiar with the game Shadow of Colossus will find a coupe of these battles to look very similar to some of the Colossus(If you have no idea what I just said, I am really sorry for you and the best comfort I can offer is the insight that Shadow of Colossus works great on PCSX2. Don't wait, don't think, just play it and thank me later)*\n\n- There is also one more thing worth mentioning. Its a Complete Edition meaning that it has a DLC and extra stuff added. The DLC is not that great but its not bad, I'm just saying that compared to the main game, it doesn't seem that well thought and balanced and my guess is that they made it hastily just so that they can open the gates for the sequel to follow(which I am playing as I write this and all I can say for now is: Holy sh*it this game is awesome!)\n\nAlso, let me just compare it to Darksiders 1 and the original Devil May Cry 1(save for the backtracking, there's none in Castlevania since its a linear, level based progression system), its very similar to those games and chances are, if you liked those, you will most likely like Castlevania: Lords of Shadow too. As for my recommendation, its already pretty clear. Go for it!","December 19, 2015","true","43.7"," 56 of 78 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","56","78","6","2"

Gabriel has access to various moves that work the use of heavy and light attacks to chain together combos.The beginning of the game is an awful demonstration for Lords of Shadow’s combat as it starts by offering the player the most basic moves. It’s not until a few hours in, where you’re pulling enemies in and pulling off ridiculous combos combined with Gabriel’s magic that you appreciate the diversity on offer with the combat. It’s not on par with something specialised like Bayonetta, but the game offers deep and varied enough combat that it feels satisfying for the people that want to do just more than mash a few buttons.Magic is very important in Lords of Shadow and early in the game you’re given your first taste of it through the light magic, which when activated and used in combat will gradually refill Gabriel’s health bar with each hit of the Combat Cross. Later in the game the shadow magic becomes available, adding extra strength to each attack.What I really love about Lords of Shadow is how the developers have incorporated the weapons and magic into the game’s platforming and puzzle solving. Nearly every tool is used at points throughout the game. The ability to double jump is worked in by having longer jump sections, which are often mixed with the use of the sprinting boots that allow Gabriel to jump greater distances. The gauntlet is used to punch objects to move them across areas or to activate switches, shadow magic is used with a shoulder charge to smash through weak walls, and the hidden chain in the Combat Cross is used to cut down stone obstacles.Lords of Shadow also looks mighty impressive on the PC.The amazing character models, comprehensive texture work and environmental artistry by the team at MercurySteam are on full display. Textures are sharp, extremely detailed and really help make the Gothic nature of Lords of Shadow come out at its fullest, even holding up well for PC standards.If you’re a PC gamer who has never played Castlevania: Lords of Shadow or a hardcore fan that is looking to replay the game you should certainly pick up the PC version.","December 18, 2014","true","27.5"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","0"

As there must be some big evil behind it, he journeys through the world to kill three lords of shadow, to kill everything evil with his holy battle cross, and to steal powers of each lord. That's all you need to know about the story, which is poor. If you read through all notes and background texts in the game, you'll be looking forward to see the depth of the unusual fantasy world on Earth (many years after our civilization has fallen), but in the real action the story just lets you cringe, as things only happen to move the plot forward without proper explanation or sense. In the end, it's all about killing evil things and keeping the decreasing faith to God.\n\nIt's a typical hack'n'slash console game (released on 2010 for consoles) with purely linear gameplay - the whole game is split into chapters and levels. While there are some parts where you can choose a path, there aren't many of those, so you'll mostly be just walking forward through corridors or climbing and jumping on the ledges (with only one right path) like in Tomb Raider series.\n\nMany people hate the game for the fact that you can't control the camera. Every place has static camera that feels annoying and may cause some problems with controls (when you move between two scenes where the camera angle change), but I felt it's important for Castlevania's level design, as there are many secrets based on you trying to explore places where the camera isn't showing you can go, many secrets are located behind the camera. Other secrets are usually made in a way that you can't get to them in your first playthrough, as they require some late-game core item. Replayability is also encouraged by various bonus objectives, which you can see after your first playthrough of each level.\n\nThe action gameplay is enhanced with ability to mount big enemies, which is usually mandatory to move forward - e.g. you have to mount a huge spider to let him make a spider web bridge for you, or you have to mount a big troll to destroy a stone wall. Otherwise there's nothing unexpected or extra original, the game's offering classic hack'n'slash combo system with unlockable skills. Besides health, you'll be working with light and dark magic - light magic makes your attacks heal you, dark magic boosts your damage; and that's all.\n\nThere are totally 4 difficulty options, I played on the second one (similar to "normal") and the base game, 12 chapters, felt easy. The final two chapters (which are DLC content on consoles) has much bigger difficulty, especially with the final boss that took me 3 hours to beat him. Boss fights can take more than 10 minutes, but you don't have to be afraid of repeating the whole battle - there are always few checkpoints.\n\nThe game, for a console port, is optimized fine, I haven't met any critical problem through my play. Graphics are pretty for a 2010 game, there are many beautiful sceneries which motivated me to make many screenshots; there are also nice details that you'll usually see thanks to the static camera. The soundtrack is good, to describe it I'd say it's classic fantasy melodies which definitely improve the atmosphere.\n\nConclusion:If you keep your expectations low, ignore the story and just enjoy the linear hack'n'slash gameplay, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a fine game that can offer you about 20 hours of entertainment for a single playthrough - and if that won't be enough for you, there are more difficulty settings and many secrets.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","May 15","true","24.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Gameplay mechanics of this game is a piece of crap compared to those games.\n\nDark side and light side magic activation is a huge failure. You beat up the creatures, you get some orbs and you choose which magic to fuel up. Fueling up the magic is incredibly slow while consuming is incredibly fast. Besides why do I have two kinds of magic? Why not combine them? Why it takes soooo long to fuel them up? Bad design. Very bad design.\n\nSkill combos are poorly selected and they have the worst key combination I have ever seen in such a game. God damn it, even a million times complex Bayonetta has more plain key combinations for combos!\n\nDouble tap the analog to run fast. Have you lost your mind? What kind of gameplay design is this? Developers have serious issues here...\n\nCombat. You play an action adventure, which is actually a beat'em up game. Combat gotta be brutal, right? See God of War? You shake the bones of your enemies, rip them apart. But in this game, you feel like you are tickling enemies with your chaines. Your blows do INCREDIBLE low damage. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!? You grab an enemy, you WAIT for a f-word button sequence to complete the action sequence. Why not auto-execute immediately like other games? Why force the player to wait in the middle of the combat? Combining the poorly implemented combos, combat is miserable for a game in this genre.\n\nRidiculous puzzles. Well, not all of them are ridiculous. But some of them are so bad, you think like "What the hell am I doing by playing this game?". See the scarecrow puzzle and music box puzzle, which are played sequentially. RIDICULOUS is not enough to describe them.\n\nF. this game.\n\nWe got Soul Reaver series back in the time. Those were the games. Proper action adventures. Not this technologically advanced piece of crap.\n\nI highly NOT recommend this game. You should stay away from this abomination. If you like action adventure games, Darksiders 1 and Darksiders 2 are on the Steam. Those are fantastic games, and it will be a shame if I compare them to this game. Whatever this game represents in the negative way for modern action advention genre, Darksiders represent the positive way.\n\n2/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 19, 2014","false","14.3"," 47 of 75 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","47","75","0","13"

What it is, in reality, is a masterpiece which combines some of the best elements of the Castlevania series with an improved version of the fantastic combat system pioneered in God of War.  The combat system is simple in premise, but complicated to master; challenging, but not unfair.  The addition of a magic system (which later God of War games attempted to replicate) for extra damage or health corrects the irritating lack of healing in God of War without making the combat any easier.  The story is remarkably compelling, the voice acting is superb, and the majority of the characters have considerable depth.  If you're a fan of Castlevania, you'll love the visuals and the new way to fight old enemies.  If you're a fan of God of War, you'll love the more nuanced combat system and the new enemies.  If you're not a fan of either, you might well be after playing this game.","October 19, 2014","true","41.9"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

I played thru it on xbox and again now on PC (going thru DLC now, so far awesome).\nCombat is fast and furious and challenging on normal or above. (normal gets easy after u get used to it so u can change it anytime to be harder)\nOne recommendation i will make for playing is to limit the use secondary weapons. like daggers, fairies, holy water, and esp the demon crystals. on Hard mode these items are a saving grace and really needed for some situations. On normal tho i felt like the game provided WAY to much secondary weapons. The pink demon crystals are way overpowered for normal mode unless you are in a swarm of enemies or you want to soften up a strong boss. otherwise they make the game to easy and create a feeling of "thats it".  Holy water may be an exception to this when used in combo with light magic as it provides a good shield without wiping the screen of enemies in a split second.\n\nWhile the game works fine for keyboard and mouse i do recommended and prefer a gamepad for the fast paced combat and  navigating the platforming of the game.\n\nOverall this isa fantastic game with a lot of variety of weapons and enemies and amazing environment and level design.

Unfortunately, this could function as a case study on what's wrong with modern AAA action games. It's a tedious, boring, borderline insulting mess. It's a prime example of style over substance and spectacle over gameplay, which felt more like a standardized test than a game.\n\nTo give credit where credit is due, much of the artwork is beautiful and some of the voice acting is solid, particularly with Patrick Stewart. Which just makes it sadder that everything else is so awful.\n\nThis game is absolutely infested with quicktime events. They're everywhere. Apparently they'd rather not have those pesky players get in the way of their flashy spectacle. So instead of making, you know, gameplay, they'll just tell us when to press what button.\n\nThe combat is a dull experience. There's a system of earning points which you can spend special attacks made up of arbitrary button combinations, none of which are worth your time to commit to memory. Fights are boring and time consuming.\n\nCamera angles are always fixed, there's no looking where you want to look or aligning your view to make platforming or combat more practical. The game just sort of herds you from one section to the next with the camera. There's nothing wrong with linear games, but this feels less like a linear path, and more like the a series of check boxes.\n\nThe story is mostly delivered through exposition dumps, and it isn't very interesting. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters.\n\nThe keyboard controls are poor, and I don't just mean the default bindings are bad, though they most assuredly are. I mean things like the game more than once expecting you to mimic the rotation of an analog stick with the directional keys, or the fact that the jump button won't work if you're moving diagonally by holding two directional keys. Controller support is sketchy, despite the description of "full controller support". Mine wouldn't work at all.\n\nThe whole thing is just such a tedious chore of a game.

You either drop it after first bunch of levels, or you keep playing. In my case i actually forced myself to play past first chapters after dropping it a couple of times just because i wanted to play Mirror of Fate (which is your classic side scrolling sequel for Lords of Shadow) with a full knowledge of plot.\nPlays completely different from original Castlevania games (at least these i played), but still is good, i guess.\n\nIf you aren't sure about spending money on it i'd recommend to wait for a sale, but i think it's current price (in my country at least) is fair.\n\n+ personally haven't encountered any bugs + no issues with wired xbox 360 controller for me\n+ plot\n+ amazing soundtrack and voicing\n+ good combat system\n+ amazing and fair boss fights that require nothing but skill to beat\n+ really good and interesting puzzles\n+ levels actually have some replay value for collectibles that can only be picked once you get certain abilities later in game and challenges that are only available if you beat levels at least once\n+ amazing artworks/concept-arts that you can buy in game for these who's interested in that stuff. Like me.\n\n- a very, VERY slow start\n- biggest and hugest nope goes to the final boss in the dlc. While all boss fights in the main game were amazing, this one was hard, tedious, annoying and unsatisfying. And don't git gud at me, there's a difference between a good and a bad boss design, that's all.\n- graphics might seem a bit outdated but still looks good\n- repetetive not memorable levels with invisible walls and points of no return (which sucks when you run into one of two similar looking corridors and accidentally lock yourself from picking a collectible in the end of another one. Whoops)\n- sountrack is amazing but some pieces seemed to be kind of...out of place with what was going on the screen?\n- no level exploration. It fits fine with the game itself but we're talking about Castlevania series here.\n- no camera control at all. Wasn't much of a problem but in a bunch of places.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UnknownBelmont/recommended/234080/","UnknownBelmont","Belmont","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UnknownBelmont/","369 products in account","First off, I'm a huge fan of the Castlevania series.   So that foundation may color my opinion of this game and it's ensuing interquel and sequel (which I'm currently in the midst of).  Something about medieval through Enlightment era Europe with a heavy gothic/baroque aesthetic, corrupted through dark forces that threaten the world?  Awesome.  Tons of monsters pulling on a multitude of inspiration from the myth cycles of antiquity through the modern Universal monsters?  Yes, please.\n\nKonami struck gold initially by creating these dark adventures that took a quite serious tone for the early Nintendo systems, offering a beefy challenge of vintage Nintendo difficulty through several increasingly impressive platformer games.  They then evolved into the famed Metroidvanias with the release of Symphony of the Night on the Playstation - trading a bit of the reflex-intensive difficulty for massive sprawling environments that took forever to explore and fully unlock - and followed this formula with several excellent installments on Nintendo's handhelds where they found their most sustainable home and success through the late 2000's.  Then Konami, sensing the increasingly stagnant nature of the series as it became mired in repeated iterations of SotN's sprawling platformer/RPG hybrid, started searching for a way to revitalize the series again, just as SotN ignited a sort of Golden Age for the series.\n\nAs the winds throughout the greater video game market were blowing increasingly towards epic, story-based RPGs, Spanish-based developer MercurySteam was contracted to take the series in a new direction (probably due to Konami's increasing focus upon more purely profitable directions, such as the Japanese gambling market).  MercurySteam, for their part, took a pretty bold new direction though this was not without its share of controversy.  The good came from a heavy focus upon story and aesthetic.  Gabriel Belmont, who apparently becomes the progenitor of the famed vampire-slaying family in this continuity, is dispatched by the human agency, the Brotherhood of Light to confront and destroy the eponymous Lords of Shadow who have become a blight over the world of humanity, separating the Earth from the Heavens and unleashing demonic horrors upon the hapless human kingdoms and villages.  Interestingly, this game devotes a lot of exposition to the powers of good as well.  Traditionally, Castlevania always had an air of horror and darkness, though maybe not a sense of supreme evil.  LoS heavily invokes God, Satan, and, to a lesser extent, Christ and the church.  The old games had less direct references though they were still there with Judeo-Christian enemies as well as religiously themed environments (though due to the setting, Baroque Europe, this is hardly surprising).  LoS made the series simultaneously more and less personal.  Gabriel is on this quest in the hopes of reviving his dead wife, Marie and we spend a great deal of time getting to know him through his terse interactions with the allies and enemies he encounters in his quest.  On the other hand, the game focuses much more of the scale of humanity as a whole.  The powers of Heaven and Hell are very real in the LoS universe and they are actively vying for the souls of men.  Say what you will about the old 'vanias, they were great but while Dracula might wreak havoc on the world, he generally wasn't portrayed as damning his victims souls to an eternity in hell.  That however is the stakes for LoS.  MercurySteam went all out, bringing back narrative cutscenes, securing an A-list voiceover cast, and threw in a few Shadows of the Colossus style battles for variety.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a departure from the old series as it is a third person 3D platformer/adventure game.  Combat draws heavy influence from God of War leading some detractors to label the continuity God-of-Vania.  Given the Belmonts are famed whip users throughout the series (even non-Belmonts like John Morris and Nathan Graves got in on the whip action!), I'm fine with that decision.  The only annoying aspect of it is the volume of endurance heavy enemies.  I get it, I'm using a whip which isn't the most devastating of medieval weaponry (even if it is made out of holy-blessed metal) against creatures with inhuman carapace, hide and endurance.  It just gets a bit tedious at times is all I'm saying.  The whip combat is fun and creative though it could stand to be a bit more visceral.  Hits just don't feel like they have a ton of impact which makes bashing endurance-heavy enemies feel like a chore instead of exciting.  The game does offer an array of other options though to keep things fresh with the ability to infuse the Vampire Killer with Light and Shadow magic as well as several subweapons including classic staples like throwing knives and holy water.  The environments are big, winding, and varied and have a lot of detail invested in them, even if they aren't overwhelmingly interactive (though there are a number of destructible props placed about to makes combat a bit more tangible).  Being sort of a platformer, there's loads of obstacle courses and climbing sections to navigate that will break up your time between fights and give you a chance to cool down.  This generally works in that when you start to tire of combat, the game gives you a navigation section.  When you get tired of climbing around enormous walls and platforms, the game will throw a dozen monsters at you to slay.  In short, things in this world are huge, in terms of scale.\n\nThe shortcomings of the game tend to focus around repeating enemies (enemy variety has always been a staple of the series), the heavy God of War influence (though any departure from Koji Igarashi's metroidvania genre would have received a similar outcry), and the almost minimal touchstones of being a Castlevania.  By this last one, I'm referring to limited focus on the Belmont family, settings outside Dracula's castle, and chief antagonists other than Dracula.  These are complaints of taste in my opinion and while Lords of Shadow doesn't scratch those particular itches very well, it wouldn't be the first to break any of these commandments.  Bloodlines, Circle of the Moon, Aria and Dawn of Sorrow, and Order of Ecclesia all had non-Belmont protagonists and didn't really ever bring the Belmonts into the plot in a major way.  Gabriel, being the first to take the surname, simply doesn't really have a family history to call upon like the later Belmonts do in their increasingly storied feud with Dracula, never mind that Dracula doesn't exist in LoS1 as the Lords of Shadow are the antagonists.  Bloodlines had you gallavanting all around World War I era Europe with only the first level in Dracula's castle.  Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow - some of the highest regarded games of the metroidvania era - feature a focus on non-Belmont Soma Cruz and feature primary antagonists who aren't Dracula.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand the complaints and can empathize why longtime fans might feel alienated by the new direction and perceive the genre shift as pandering to younger markets (particularly the God of War style combat).  But I think the things it does well; story, atmosphere, music, symbolism, intensity, and variety make up for the departures.  It's an alternative continuity that freshened the series up and gives gamers of other genres and option to get interested in the series and the lore.  For that, I think it's a good thing.  Or it would be if Konami ever developed its IP franchises.  But alas, "Mobile is where the future of gaming lies." according to Konami's current CEO.  For shame, Konami!","April 22","true","86.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

This game has problems. It's not that it's riddled with bugs or anything. I just truly didn't enjoy the overall gameplay experience of Lords of Shadow. Everything felt tedious, monotonous, and/or adding artificial length to the game through grueling repetition. For example: The Chupacabra enemy is in my opinion a completely unnecessary addition in what is already a linear game. It will steal your 'gear' and force you to chase it into a section of the level in order to get it back - and serve no other purpose.\n\n3d Vision - Required a patch from Helix Mod for acceptable 3d presentation. However, it's worth noting that this rejuvenated the last quarter of the game for me. I wouldn't have finished it were it not for a third party gimmick.\n\nGameplay - The gameplay is a mixed bag for Castevania: LOS.\n\nWhile combat isn't necessarily hard (or varied) - it's often plagued with problems stemming from either the camera. The camera is locked in place and limits your view. This usually means you're going to be hit by an enemy who wasn't in frame by either an unblockable attack or an attack that's too quick for you to have dodged in reasonable time.  This sounds manageable, however, the high damage from the lowliest of monsters quickly turns that notion on it's head.\n\nThe puzzles, while plentiful and occasionaly good, are tedious and unforgiving. The developers had enough foresight to include a "skip puzzle" function at the price of exp points you would normally gain from completion. Sadly, this does not in fact skip the puzzle. Rather, it shows you the solution to the puzzle you did not want to do - forcing you to still trudge through it.\n\nThe platforming is sloppy. I was frequently left with no idea where to go because it wasn't clearly defined in some fashion and simply suffered loss of life or death for it.\n\nGraphics - Pretty. Environments are skillfully crafted with lovely architecture you probably won't be able to enjoy because you can't move the camera. Everything is stylized in a kind of neoclassical gothic amalgam that turns out quite lovely. Character models do look a bit over stylized, though (long necks for example).\n\nStory - Really liked it.... um... until the last part. It felt very tacked on (as many sections of the game feel) in order to make the playtime longer. Otherwise a good fun story for the setting.\n\nConclusion - Playing this game felt like I was doing homework so I could go play outside. It was just plain boring and took forever. Watching it would have been a much better experience. So, if it's on sale and you really really want to see if you can power through the game... Well, I still have to recommend you don't.

That said, I still finished the game because I wanted to experience said story, but this will be the first and last time I ever play this game.\n\nBoss battles are way too gimmicky and often rely on you climbing around and sh*t rather than actually fighting.\nThe climbing itself is also kinda badly implemented, with the character just ignoring grapple commands every so often, ending up in me falling to my death.\nOh, and the developer seem to really enjoy the concept of having the player actively pull a crank only to be interrupted by enemies when you're 80% done so you have to beat them and then do everything over again. That's happened 10-or-so times.\nThe biggest issue by far though is the camera. Who in their right mind uses preset camera angles in a third person game nowadays rather than giving the players control of it? There's a reason most developers have moved on from that formula.\n\nThere are also some pretty annoying bugs in the game, and if you keep reading, I'll give you an example.\n\n(minor spoilers ahead)\n\nI was searching for the last fairy in chapter 3 for quite a while (managed to miss that I could use the crank on a second gate), found it and went back to the ground floor to open up the fairy door. As usual, the gates before it had closed, so I turned the crank, some werewolves ambushed me and destroyed it, and then after I beat them, all my fairies were gone and I had to collect them all again.\n\nUnless you're a diehard Castlevania fan who wants to play this game for the story, don't waste your money and time on it.","April 28","false","20.7"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

This is a reboot, and as such, it takes a lot of liberty in the source material that might make the long time fans who prefer the old continuity to look away and not give the game a fair shot, but the story here is decent.\n\nHere's my main opinion on different parts of the game:\n-The fact you cannot change your camera angle here can be a real pain, resulting in many unnecessary hits coming from the bottom of the screen (which is a real problem on the higher difficulties) and can hinder exploration of certain areas because you cant focus your camera on what you want to check out.\n-The combat is usually pretty satisfying, but I just can't agree with being hit by an enemy who is receiving a steel chain across the face (should be stun locked, but that's just my opinion), but other than that, the attack variety and satisfying whip sounds make combat rather fun and can usually avoid being tedious.\n-Most of the puzzles are pretty lame, and while they break up the combat and exploration, they're usually just not that fun to solve.  Thankfully, you're  given the option to learn their solution instantly at the cost of not getting an exp bonus, so this complaint is slightly null from that.\n-The music is now going to win any one over.  I don't feel it lives up to a long line of catchy music that Castlevania has produced, but at least has a good tune here and there.  At the very least, the music fits the feel of the game.\n- Graphically, this game is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.  I'm rarely ever wowed by graphics these days, but I was constantly wowed by the gorgeous locales the game renders, and some of the really cool enemy designs.\n\nSo tl;dr. if you've been on the fence about trying this, wait for a sale and give it a try.  I don't regret my time spent with LoS, and I feel like there's a game in here that really shines sometimes but is often held down by some questionable design choices.  I know LoS2 will let you control the camera, so I'm hoping to see other improvements made in the game play and shine where its predecessor could have but didnt.

The story is basically incomprehensible, but in an ok way (think Bayonetta). Come to think of it the combat is very reminicant of Bayonetta also, with a bit of DMC (new one) thrown in. The Game itself moves along at a nice clip (after that first five hours oof) through the small explorable arenas that make up each chapter. You are obviously expected to do several runthroughs as each level has areas that cant be accessed untill you unlock your new evil spiked cross or whatever. Happily though this menu is easy to navagate and as the story is a pile of jibberish you wont feel youre missing anything by retreading old ground.\n\nI hear it gets better after the hump that took me a few days, Ill report back, at this point I would say hold off for 4.99 unless you enjoy that Bayonetta flashy action type of experience.\n\n\nDont go into this one thinking God of War. Its not. Its totally different, you will only have the wrong bar set too high and make those first five hours miserable.","February 12, 2014","true","23.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doshftw/recommended/234080/","doshftw","M.D. Chaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doshftw/","385 products in account","This is one Truly Superb game. It's one of the few games i've played that excells in every area, and has little flaws in it. I've enjoyed other castlevania games, but Lords Of Shadow i'd say is the one i've enjoyed the most since Rondo Of Blood.\n\nThe Story follows Gabriel Belmont, who is part of the Brotherhood of light ( A group that basically fights werewolves,vampires,etc). Before the adventure starts, Gabriel's wife is killed and seeks out an artifact called the God Mask(which has the power to bring back the dead). There are these beings called lords of shadows(some of which are recognizable to castlevania fans), which 3 of them has a piece of the god mask. Gabriel must find all 3 pieces, so that he can restore life to his wife. Now the story starts off weak, but it gets way better later on and not only that, it also becomes one of the most incredible stories you'll ever experience in the game. The characters are so well written and you genuinely care for them, due to the great dialogue that's in store. Now this is a reboot of the castlevania series, so it doesn't share the same continuity with the old games, it is it's own thing and I do like the direction MercurySteam went for the game. I would talk more, but Spoilers do not apply.\n\nThe gameplay of Lords of shadow is a mixture of Hack n slash,platforming, and Puzzles.\n\nThe combat has a lot of weight and impact to it, and there is plenty of moves to do to keep each battle fresh and exciting. There is the typical regular and area attack, but there is also a counter system which when you block an enemies attack at just the right time, you'll be able to attack them back. There is also some qtes, however these are more timing based, which I do like. you have some secondary weapons like daggers,fairies, and holy water, each of these is very effective depending on the enemy you face and it offers more strategy to the already superb combat. Later in the game, you'll get light magic(hitting an enemy will replenish your health and dark magic(more damage to the enemies), which like the counter attacks and QTE make it a unique experience. There is also a Dark gauntlet, which adds another demension to combat and it's also quite effective like the combat cross. You progressively get a new upgrade from each lords of shadow like super jumping and sprinting. People would say "oh it's just a god of war rip-off" when it really isn't, since it does several mechanics to make it stand out from the crowd(and also God of war Ripped off Rygar and Devil may cry so ha).\n\nThe platforming is similar to the uncharted games, which not only is fluent, but also gives a break from the combat. there is also puzzles, which are all different. These are all fun and challenging, and if you're lost just buy the solution to it Literally.\nLevel design is more linear, but there is exploration to find upgrades to your health and magic, which is reccomended to returning levels.\n\nThe game is no cake wake, the game is geuinely challenging, Especially with the boss fights. The boss fights are usually a lot of fun to fight and require memorization, now the worst bosses are the ones where it's like shadow of the colossus. Why is that? well all it's just climbing then hold QTE(which is the only qte that annoyed me) and then repeatidly smash weakpoint, thankfully there is only 3 of them so no big deal.\n\nIs there any flaws? yes, like some levels felt padded and it got a bit dull in some places. Other than that the game is really enjoyable as a result, and it's really lengthy up to 25-30 hours.\n\nThe visuals in this game, still hold up even 4 years later. It's art direction I think is quite Unique for the series, and goes for a more mideval setting than past games. The texture work is generally rather solid with tons of deatail put into them, with the occasional odd texture. The animations are fluent and are fun to watch.\n\nThe sound is Stellar. The voice acting is up with the finest Quality, With voice talents of Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle doing a Swell job. Sound effects have a lot of weight to them, and the music, While different from past games, is Really good and is atmospheric.\n\nNow does it feel like a castlevania game? I Think so yes, it gives off the same rewarding adventure you have in the NES days, unlike the metroidvania games. In Short, I highly Reccomend the game, it's Really fun,looks great,sounds great, and just overall great.\n\n9/10 One of the best Action Adventure games you can get your hands on.","April 14, 2014","true","29.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","7"

This game gots almost everything you require from genere. The only thing that could be improved is a solution from devil may cry series which is punishing player from doing same combos over and over again. Besides that you get what you pay for. Don't bother listening to the ones who says its a bad thing to have fixed camera or no open world. In my opinion it's even better that you don't have to worry about your camera angle during fights and and the 2nd complain is just stupid. The game is long for nowadays standards and in addition on each level you can try doing trial which means you have to beat the level once more with a special conditions - so much for demanding challenge players.

Critics are supposed to love writing them, because it gives them the opportunity to throw out all these zingers and sound really clever. I'm not clever, heck I'm not even smart. In fact if I knew anything at all I wouldn't have subjected myself to the entirety of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow.\n\nBy now we're all familiar with Gabriel and his quest to rid the world of evil. He has a cross that behaves like a whip, control over the powers of light and dark, and a really thick neck. He meets a variety of unusual characters, fights the same 4 or 5 monsters, and all the women he talks to don't have shoes. In the 17+ hours I spent with this game, I put together a list of everything I hated about it.\n\nOne of the first stages you explore is a SWAMP. This what I like to call unforgivable game-design. It's not uncommon to see swamps in a fantasy-adventure game, they're spooky places with potential for grotesque abominations. However, a swamp is not what you want to introduce your game with, particularly if it includes sections where you have to slowly make your way through the mud.\n\nThe controls lack finesse. Gabriel moves well enough, but he's incapable of those subtle movements. For those times when you just want to move a foot to hit a switch. Instead you have to make several steps and go up up down down lef..errh..It's just a bunch of unnecessary motions to accomplish the same task.\n\nBalancing act. For whatever reason, LoS has a ton of high beams. These narrow sections force Gabe to keep his balance as he crosses. I hate this glitch-ridden garbage. If you don't approach the beam at the right angle, you might end up getting stuck. There are even times where you'll mash the analog stick around like Gabriel was caught in a spider-web, just so he'll cross the beam.\n\nChupacabra? More like chu ca suck ya? Nevermind. There are a few run-ins with this little joker. He steals all of your powers, and you have to waste time getting them back. This adds nothing but padding to the game.\n\nA plethora of puzzles to ♥♥♥♥ you off. Lords of Shadow has a LOT of puzzles. Action-adventure games (like God of War) have puzzles, so it's natural to expect a few in this game. However, smart-puzzle design is incorporating elements of the game, and knowing when and where to place them. Most of the puzzles in LoS are based entirely off of the kind we're overly familiar with. At one point some kinda chess game has to be played, there's a sliding-block puzzle, Something where you make light go through maze, some other puzzle where you make blood go through a maze. There's also the sliding block that goes through a maze, and the maze itself has sliding pieces, and THERE ARE PORTALS TOO?!!?!?! All these puzzles are simply mind-numbing. Oft-times the solutions are easy, and you can buy the solution if you don't mind losing out on experience rewards, but you can't actually skip them, even when you replay the stage. If it's pointless and doesn't add anything of quality to the game, it must be padding.\n\nA combat system that you can never appreciate. In God of War, Kratos learned a ton of different moves and acquired a handful of weapons. However, most of these techniques were ineffective in actual combat. For the most part combat was using the weak attacks to chip away at enemies, and then following up with the shockwave. The handful of stylish moves didn't see much use, because Kratos was always on the defensive. Lords of Shadow suffers from the same issue. A lot of interesting moves can be purchased, but you'll probably never get the opporunity to use them in battle. The lack of decent hit-stun and functional mechanics make fights more tedious than challenging.\n\nA number of fights suffer from bad camera-angles. I'll file this under nit-picking, since it's something even the best 3D Action games have trouble with.\n\nA total lack of variety in terms of enemy-design. Claw-swipe, weapon-swing, dash-attack, shockwave, trail of fire, swinging a weapon twice. What does all this mean? That's the move-set of almost every fiend in Lords of Shadow. There are exceptions, but everyone in this game fights as if they're just some evil guy with a weapon. Imagine if you were to fight Medusa. Let's say she can whip you with her tail, use her petrifying gaze, and throw snakes. It sounds sensible enough doesn't it? Now let's throw all that out the window, and give Medusa a sword and shield instead. Suddenly she's nowhere near as interesting an enemy to fight. This is just shockingly uncreative. Mercurysteam had the entire Castlevania play-book at their disposal. This is a franchise with hundreds of different monsters, tons of bosses, and all sorts of potential for creating some really impressive and unique encounters.\n\nInstead you get this: Claw-swipe, weapon-swing, dash-attack, shockwave, trail of fire, swinging a weapon twice.\nWhy?\n\nWhat this game isn't lacking in is game-play segments designed to make you angry. This isn't like flicking a switch and suddenly you're drowning in various bodily fluids. It's a process that encorporates every bad element in a game. Everything comes together and you're given something that is just plain balls.\n\nSPOILER ALERT:\n\nEnter the Forgotten One.\nThis is the true final boss in Lords of Shadow. In the console version he was part of a DLC quest, but lucky(?) for us he's included in the PC version. Reaching this final boss-fight involves a lava-rising segment, a gloriously stupid moment where Gabriel has to hide from TFO by crawling around a pillar (in-game it looks like some Bugs Bunny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), moving platform shenanigins, and my personal favorite: balance beams over rising lava.\n\nAfter all that mess you get to the actual fight, and the game doesn't even grant you the courtesy of a health & magic re-fill. As with the rest of the game, if you come to a fight with low health and die, all you'll get when you retry is half.\n\nTFO's weakpoint is on his arm, shoulder, and then head. You have to jump to hit these spots. This is easier said than done when most of his attacks are keep-away stuff like shockwaves. After a certain amount of damage is done, TFO pulls off some gimmick. The gimmick is something you'll likely not figure out the first time. After messing up, you're force to bring his health back down so he'll repeat the gimmick, and hopefully you can move to the next phase. There are two moments to attack it, when it slides a ball & chain across the ground, or when it summons missiles from the sky. The only reason I, you, or most anyone else is going to defeat this boss is through the checkpoints after each phase.\n\nThis isn't a fun battle, it isn't even tolerable, it's just a brick-wall built to house a black hole of entertainment. The Forgotten One fight is one of the worst I've played in a game. This is a fight that would bury a good game, let alone this one.\n\nBut I did it, and for what? Just to say I did? I'd say I lost a lot more than I gained from playing through Lords of Shadow. I actually tried this game back when it was only available on consoles. I didn't care for it then, but I gave it another chance, and now I just feel horrible. The worst part is, as much as my review indicates otherwise, this isn't a completely miserable game. It does just enough....just enough right to keep you playing. Maybe it was Avery Bullock's dreamy narration that kept me playing Lords of Shadow, because my idiot brain can't come up with any other reason.","November 17, 2014","false","17.4"," 40 of 70 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","40","70","2","1"

While it was gifted to me during the Christmas steam sale, I have played through it several times and I still cannot justify owning or purchasing this game. As a diehard fanatic of the series from the very beginning this game lacks everything that made the series fantastic. This is not to say the game is bad, however, it is completely mediocre . The potential for greatness IS there, however, it fails to truly deliver. For every stunning visual scene in the game it has twice as many glaring, disgusting bland LEVELS that serve no absolutely no purpose. In fact, the game feels lopsided when it comes to level count. The second chapter has by far the most levels in the game and yet the two chapters afterward only have two apiece to them. I fail to see the logic behind this besides trying to fit a familiar theme, however, this only makes chapter 2 a daunting, boring, trial to complete. There is no  FLOW to this game. It stops and goes at its own pace, and it feels disgustingly rushed. The gameplay is a mashed together blend of several popular action games ranging from God of War to Shadow of Colossus that fails to deliver any of the finer points of any of those games. Combat is simple, yet, frustrating from the lack of meat behind it. The 'whip' (I'm more akin to call it the blades of chaos but I'll bite) is better described as a wet noodle. Enemies have very little to not hit registration so it makes it feel like all of your blows either do nothing or bounce off of them with little to no visible effect. Enemies are not chained, nor can you combo properly in most cases making it more of a game of unleashing a flurry of attacks, and then either parrying them to stun them for one second or dodging past them if you cannot. This is all there is to combat, there is very little variety between enemy types and their attack. Each enemy may seem differently, but the majority of them have three same attacks. The types of attacks are as follows: a quick jab, a slower stronger attack, and a shockwave. I have successfully described 99% of the attacks you'll be dealing with in this game. To try and amplify Gabriel's abilities he comes across a small selection of subweapons and magic to try increase variety in combat.  These fail to do anything but be useless or completely trivialize encounters all together. Take for example the earliest subweapon you get, the silver daggers. You are given ten of them near the start of the game and are given enough refills to completely destroy any werewolf type enemy in a single hit, aside from heavier lycans. This is the equivalent of having an 'I win' button which should never be the case in any brawler. Yet alone you are purposefully given an ability soon after that lets you oneshot any small enemy with a simple QTE regardless by tapping the right trigger/R2 button. You cannot be harmed during this, and you can chain this quite easily, leaving only the big, burly enemies, whose attacks I've already described, to easily be dealt with. In fact, the only time combat is truly challenging in Lords of Shadow is during engagements with multiple big enemies, which are few and far between, or when the camera forces itself lodged into a wall. I've have many a moment where the camera simply refused to show me the enemies, leaving me to guess blindly in the dark where they could be attacking from. This is simply unacceptable in any game in my opinion. The absence of good in my mind is not bad, it is average. Lords of Shadow is the definition of an average game. It functions, most of the time, within acceptable limits, but, does not excel at anything. I cannot recommend Lords of Shadow to someone who enjoys the series, since it is simply not a Castlevania game outside of name alone. It's a mediocre, bland, boring brawler that does its best to rip off other successful franchises but fails to capture any of its own rich history that spans twenty years in the making. This is what infuriates me the most as a fan of the series. This was truly a game franchise that I loved, that I avidly looked forward to whenever I heard it announced. Yet, despite playing through this game nearly three times at this point, I cannot excuse the ball of mediocrity that is Lords of Shadow. No matter the console, no matter how well done the port is, I cannot recommend this game, and I am sad to say that I’ve wasted too much time trying to force myself to love something that is not only undeserving of it, but also a failure to the series name that this should be abortion tries to live up to.","February 9, 2014","false","12.0"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","25","42","0","2"

That doesn't make it a bad game, but it does mean that if you're expecting to be up to your eyeballs in gothic architecture you'll be in for a disappointment. The atmosphere here feels a bit disjointed, like they had a few really good settings and just mashed them together. Unfortunately, without that trademark flavor, the rest of the game doesn't do much to distinguish itself.\n\nI'm reminded a bit of the talk around Darksiders when it first came out. That title had a lot written about how it played like a sort of mish-mash of other, better known games. But where Darksiders managed to pick out a bunch of elements that worked and fuse them into a cohesive whole, Lords of Shadow mostly reminds me how good Devil May Cry, Assassin's Creed, God of War, and Shadow of the Colossus were and how I really ought to replay them one of these days.\n\nNow, even though it's generic, the game is still pretty fun once you get into it. Combat is fast and frenetic, heavily favoring an aggressive and ultra-mobile style while still forcing you to master timed parries. While it can get a bit mashy, the better encounters are quite memorable. The game has a good learning curve, but the better boss fights in it will require you to master the system - Cornell in particular is a standout here, and while it's controller-shatteringly difficult, that boss fight alone is worth the sale price. The rest, unfortunately, fall into the standard formula of "Wait for the boss to do something stupid, punish, repeat," which is aggravated by the game being a bit too fond of quick time events. There are also three "titan" boss fights, which are straight ripoffs of Shadow of the Colossus.\n\nOverall, this is a decent way to kill an afternoon or two. Wouldn't recommend you pay full price, but it's worth adding to your collection if it's on sale.","November 29, 2014","true","26.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

There are too many parts, fourteen acts in total to be exact and my playtime compiled to around six hours.  By the end  of chapter 2 I thought the game over but was astonished to find that there were twelve chapters to come.   If you can make it past the first two chapters then there is quite a journey ahead.\n\nChapters three through twelve are where the meat sticks to the bone.  Some may critique the game as a God of War clone but that's not necessarily a bad badge to wear.  What's important is the content not the cover and the pages read Castlevania.   From a gaming perspective this portion of Castlevania brings much enjoyment.   A fantastic and lengthy part of the game packed with so much content and beautiful scenery ready to be posted to your desktop. A wonderfully orchestrated score worthy of a night out to the Boston symphony.  Well designed combat based on skills that you can purchase at any time given you have acquired enough of the games currency.  Well designed and animated chapter ending enemies that truly invoke a sense of awe.  A theatre worthy dramatic narrative voiced by Patrick Stewart.   Imaginative puzzles and mini games, but perfectly presented such a way that you will not think of consulting a hint guide.  What Castlevania does best, above all it's wonderful attributes is that the game takes the player on a journey.  Few games have ever communicated such a fantastic sense of journey and the connection made by the game to the player in this respect is remarkable.\n\nIf it all would of ended with Chapter 12.\n\nApparently, for those unfamiliar with the history behind the production of the dlc, Castlevania Lords of Shadow was a huge success.  So much so that Konami was caught off guard by how well the game sold.  Konami had planned no dlc for Castlevania Lords of Shadow but hurriedly produced chapters thirteen and fourteen to capitalize of the success of the game.\n\nWhat's wrong with the dlc is that it appears that Konami could of sold the two chapters as one chapter and that they split them into two for profit.  $20 in total at the time of release.  Content that would not approach one chapter of the main game.  As a whole they are short, have annoying plat-forming sequences based on precision not present in the main game.  The dlc incorrectly purports to tie up any loose ends left by the ending put in place by chapter 12.  If you skip the dlc you aren't missing anything.  Further, there are no professionally produced staged intermediary scenes as contained in the main game, only immersion jerking sketches left to tell the story of our hero.   The sketches are so poorly done in places that I could not discern what was happening upon finishing the dlc.\n\nFinishing the dlc.  Let us cross that bridge into the ultimate abyss.  The dlc amazingly gets worse.  What awaits you at the end of the dlc is unfortunately a most frustrating experience.   Given that you have traversed such an expansive game and have taken the time to trudge through the cretinous dlc, you may be compelled to try and finish chapter fourteen.

It begins quite slow fighting Goblins and lycanthropes reminiscent of Lord of the rings not Castlevania, however around 6-7 hours in the game shifts and becomes darker, you quickly forget the lush forest scenes that you travelled through previously and embrace a more familiar settings a eerie town, a abbey and of course a castle.\n\nGood points\n\n+Music - It's not your typical chip tuney cheese of old castlevania but instead well composed pieces with a lot of depth, not to everyone's taste if your not willing to forego your nostalgia\n+Art - The settings are incredible, the graphics are good but it's the art and the art direction that make the game stand out they get the most out of it by locking the camera in place\n+Combat - Alot of variety and generally really fun switching between differnt "stances" Neutral, Light and dark and then there's other items that enhance your abilities beyond that\n+Story - I really enjoyed it, it's dark fairy tale reminiscent of something like the brothers grim.  Good doesn't always triumph evil\n\nBad Points\n\n-Combat - Variety yes, however it could be more tighter, Example Air combat yes you can launch enemies into the air but you quickly realise that being in the air is dangerous with no air block/air dodge you sort of hover in the air for unattended times open to enemy attacks, there is a stomp move that brings you down quicker but really should have taken a page out of bayonetta book here,\n\n-Oh the camera, I understand why they did it (I previously mentioned beautifull scenary) but the camera in combat can get stupid, it fixed so depending on the angle of the player and the enemy there can be times were you get punished cheaply from attacks off screen, not good.\n\nWould I recommend it yes, if you enjoy GoW combat, willing to give it 5-6 hours to get to the good bits (it's fairly lengthy game at around 20-30 hours) and not looking for the next SOTN.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xelis/recommended/234080/","Xelis","Xelis - work","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xelis/","152 products in account","A storm is coming. Mankind faces ruin and despair. The world is changing, yet hope remains in the hearts of the people. We go about our daily lives never knowing the forces that can change our destinies forever; we are oblivious, ignorant like sheep to the slaughter. This night in the year of our Lord 1047, marks the beginning of our journey together; a journey into darkness, into madness. I watch him from the shadows. Is he the one? He has come far already but he will be tested; tested to the very limits of human endurance… and beyond. This night he rides looking for the old gods, armed with an amulet that has led him here; tonight he will begin his journey into oblivion.\n\nCastlevania:LoS is a hack & slash, very similar to the god of war series. You play as a member of the brotherhood of light, a man named Gabriel on his quest to fulfill a prophecy, and to bring his dead wife back to life. The game takes you through all sorts of environments, from lycan infested forests, old decrepit castles, mountains and valleys, and eventually hell. All of which are narrated by Patrick Stewart. Throughout the entire game there’s a foreboding feeling of things to come. With each location that Gabriel passes through, it takes its toll on him, one that is shown and felt through the great writing and character development, and even gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay itself again is similar to the god of war series, combat being driven by combos, magic powers, relics, equipment, QTE’s and so forth. All of which can be upgraded with experience points, which you gain by completing puzzles and killing enemies. Some combos and abilities are intertwined with each other, and inaccessible until you upgrade a few or all abilities completely. The combat is really fun and fairly simple. Your main weapon is the combat cross, a chain weapon able to attack multiple enemies at once and dish out all sorts of pain, which can be seamlessly linked with any other tool in your arsenal, making the combat very fast paced and fun. Mixing up your combos, using differently abilities and not spamming the same stuff over and over is rewarded via focus. Focus is a bar that fills up as you fight, giving you more focus for preforming different abilities in conjunction, and generally being stylish. Once the bar is filled, your attacks start draining orbs from enemies, which can be absorbed into either light or shadow magic, used to power attacks and abilities in either form. Being hit once however will completely drain your focus, so it’s good idea to keep on the move, or get good at parrying(Of which, gives you full focus upon a successful parry) The light and shadow magic is an interesting system, both have meters that drain when you make successful attacks or preform magic in either stance. Light magic heals you upon successfully hitting an enemy, shadow magic makes your attacks deal more damage. Both have an array of unique abilities that can be used, and you can switch between them seamlessly.\n\nThe graphics are decent but this is one time where the game actually looks better on consoles. The game makes use of blur and depth of field, of which on consoles, running at 720p hid some of the muddy textures and blocky meshes very well.  Again they’re not bad, but I remember when I first played this on the 360 I was blown away by how good it looked, and this was in comparison to games like Crysis, battlefield and heavily modded skyrim.  However, the environments are pretty stunning at times, presenting you with gorgeous vistas and locations with beautiful  and varied architecture. The animations are pretty damn good too, Gabriel moves, jumps and his attacks flow fluidly, as well as all of the creatures and enemies you encounter.\n\nOne of the game’s strong points is the music. You’ll get beautiful orchestra music as you traverse levels, and brutal, tense scores in battles. The actual implementation of the music being perfectly timed as well, tempos kicking up during pivotal moments in combat and as you approach vistas and panoramas. Also, Belmont’s Theme. THAT’S ALL I NEED TO SAY.\n\nAll in all, Lords of shadow is a very fun and superbly made, albeit sad tale. I don’t want to spoil much but Gabriel loses much, if not everything during his quest. Being a reboot, It sets up the series pretty nicely in creating probably the most prominent figure in the series. I got a good 15 hours or so out of the story, not counting the dlc which I haven’t started yet.\n\nCombat is amazing fun, brutal and addicting, flowing between combos, magic and abilities is fluid and satisfying.\n\nThe story is well written and emotionally provoking, which surprised the hell out of me when I first played the game, didn’t expect such from a castlevania game.\n\nPATRICK FREAKING STEWART NARRATES THE GAME AND IS THE VOICE OF A MAJOR CHARACTER.\n\nBELMONT’S THEME\n\nOkay this is getting way tldr.\n\nAt $30 I’d buy it, but I was lucky enough to nab it on sale during the winter sale. If you like castlevania I recommend this, if you like Devil May Cry, God of War or other third person action/adventure games I recommend it. If you like Patrick Stewart I recommend it.\n\nProtip: avoid all media/videos/pics, information or any posts about Lords Of Shadow 2. It’ll spoil this entire game.\n\nAnd so it begins, the necromancer’s abyss lies at his feet. He is dark and terrible and the cries of the dead follow him wherever he goes. There is nothing but hate in his heart. Hate for those who have taken his beloved. Who have made him do terrible things. Who have taken his humanity. Now reap the whirlwind, scions of death, for comes the Prince of Darkness.","January 20, 2014","true","23.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkwolfs11/recommended/234080/","Darkwolfs11","ShagzySJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkwolfs11/","560 products in account","This game is almost flawless, it oozes quality, every single pixel has been precicely placed and every mechanic works with fluidity and precision. The combat is very satisfying and the camera is clever and sharp (forget the negative comments on the camera, it works perfectly). During boss fights, the way the camera positions itself really adds to both scale and intensity depending on the type of boss fight. In my opinion the boss fights in this are more exhilirating than god of war's, and also more varied and challenging. This game is genuinely challenging which is a very good thing, bosses can take time to kill as you will have to "learn" how to kill them, the puzzles are not obvious either and require actual brain power to complete! A breath of fresh air in my opinion as I was tired of pushing blocks onto switches etc.\n\nThe story is engrosing and enjoyable, I's helped along by brilliant voice acting by the likes of Sir Patrick Stuart and Robert Carlisle. The chapters are pretty long. Each chapter has between 2 and 7 levels within them. They each build up nicely and you are never in a place to fill time, it's all leading toward a short term or long term goal so I havent got bored. Upon completing each level you get a summery screen and the story is carried forward by narration. You are presented with a world map so you can see where you have been and where you are going next, which is helpful and also means you can choose to leave the game before taking on the next chapter. I've thought of this game almost being like reading a book, you can play a chapter, then put it down for a while and you feel youve made progres. Because places and scenery is always diferent you cant wait to get back into the game and see where it takes you, Just like a book.\n\nI'm not going to talk too much about graphics because if you do decide to make a purchase then they will speak for themselves. To say the art style is beautiful does'nt do it justice. It's jaw on floor time and easily gives Kratos a run for his money.\n\nThe soundtrack to Castlevania is also brilliant, it's eerie and peaceful at the right times and epic, dramatic and energetic at others. It adds to the game in all the right ways, making the castles and woods feel spooky and grim and battle/dramatic events exhilirating and atmospheric. The game does borrow heavily from other games, for example the music is very similar to that of Oblivion's, a bad thing?? Not at all in my eyes. It also borrows from god of war but again builds on it rather than doing waht Dante's Inferno did and just carbon copy the mechanics. I'm not going to go into detail about where they have borrowed because it will spoil some of the surprise, but I will say that it is not just copying, the developers have put their own mark on the gameplay and the quality is of such a caliber that it's a compliment to the inventors.\n\nTo sum up, as I have said in the title, this game is the real deal. It's a high budget and extremely high quality piece of software. The story is fantastic and you get the feeling you are playing a very special game that has taken a lot of time and care to create. I knew Kojima would'nt put his name to a sub-par game and I'm very glad I made a purchase. Full credit to Mercurysteam for making a genuinely awesome game and I hope we see many more games like this. It's not all about open world maps and multiplayer, other developers/publishers would do well to remember this.\n\n10/10 Epic...","February 21, 2014","true","16.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The boss battles are quite epic and the world design is just amazing to look at (Always makes me wonder, "In this world, who built all this stuff!?") *lol*\n\nThat ending...That ending is so great!

Cut-scenes based on drawing scetches, scenario of DLC leave only questions than giving answers, Patrick Stewart as Narrator was replaced. And most important final two chapters have a really pain in a*s difficulty, especially the final boss: he have all area attacks, they cannot be blocked or eluded with help of holy shield.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/234080/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","Another one of my personal favourites this generation! The reboot to the Castlevania series - this game originally did not start out as such - it was aptly titles "Lords of Shadow" before it got slapped on with the Castlevania name and sold as such, personally, I didn't mind the series being rebooted as the later 'Vania games were starting to get a little stale and this game refreshed my undying love for the franchise after the spectularly mediocre 'Harmony of Despair".\n\nThe game stars Gabriel Belmont, a man from "the Order" sent on a mission to find and kill that which is harming the world whom intently does so after the death of his wife. While on his journey, he is watched by a man by the name of Zobek (Narrator & NPC) as Gabriel makes his journey to fight the Lords of Shadow.\n\nVisually speaking, this game is a treat - the PC port itself was given a few touch ups from the console version and the difference is pretty noticeable - the game itself is still a spectacle. Not one area from the game is inherently repeated unless it's a backtracking section and the sights you see along the way change very drastically and occasionally - almost a bit too fast for my tastes since you're not likely to see the same stage more than twice, some even for a brief minute before the games moves you along. The character models have amazing textures to them, but the anatomy looks a bit silly. Gabriel himself looks like a tank (Gabriel)[hdgamewalls.com] and some characters look a bit off, but I'll gladly just pass it off as an art style as everything looks consistent and very well done. Just about everything in this game (even Gabriel's design) reminds me of Castlevania: Simon's Quest, and it even goes about through the same stage builds, from swamps, to the eventual Castle Halls, so this game has more in common with the older NES/SNES 'Vania titles than the more recent ones.\n\nOn to the gameplay! Easily one of the most fun titles I've played in recent history aswell. It has Direct attacks and Area Attacks, and as the game progresses you get to unlock more combinations and things to do, with some combos working better on certain enemies than others. (Personally, I was very fond of the HOLD/Direct combo - a move where the first input you hold down then tap up to 5x as Gabriel slams his weapon, very satisfying and damaging.) As you progress through the story, you'll unlock a variety of upgrades for Gabriel's weapon, and other handy thrown items aswell that are very reminscent of older Vania titles as well (such as Daggers, Holy Water, etc) that will be very useful as enemy types continue to vary through the game (IE - Daggers working better on Werewolves and Holy Water on Vampires). The gameplay is sadly not all that perfect though... Gabriel himself handles a bit clunky and some of his moves don't outright respond perfectly at times, which can lead to mishaps at times and some frustration - the very same goes for the game's multiple climbing sections, which I didn't really find all that fun or engaging personally. Some of the climbing sections have badly marked areas, some even don't tell you which areas you can jump to or from, or can climb to leading to even more mishaps, other than that, the climbing sections where mostly pretty linear so it just wasn't very much fun in the end and mostly served as padding to slow the game down. Without much spoilers, the bosses I think were the absolute best part about this game - the first two titans (battles that feel very much like Shadows of the Colossus) were awesome fights, and the Lords of Shadows themselves felt like intense duels that I occasionally went back to replay just for fun at higher difficulties.\n\nIn general, if you loved Castlevania in the past and you enjoy spectacle Action games, then you will probably enjoy this game, I say probably because it definately isn't for everyone. The static camera at first was a turn off for me, but I got used to it, it will undoubtedly varie to how much you enjoy the genre the game is based on. As it stands, it's still one of my better experiences this gen and I was happy it came to PC.","November 30, 2013","true","3.3"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","1"

It is, for the most part, a fun game. Unfortunately, problems lie in some of the wall climbing. If you've played Uncharted, think of that, except take what you know of that game and chuck it out the window. If you want to jump and grab onto another wall while you're already hanging on one, don't push the analog stick in the direction you want to jump. Instead, take your thumb off the joystick and wait until he automatically faces the direction himself, THEN press the jump button. This took me quite a while to get used to and also led to many frustrating deaths just simply due to the mechanics not being as fluid as they should be. Aside from those minor nitpicks, the game is very well optimized and runs at a silky smooth 60fps. The story is surprisingly pretty decent as it does have its own twists at times. There are different combos you can do with the whip, though once you get a few favorites, you might end up repeating those sets throughout the rest of the game.

And chosing skill chains to improve like Devil May Cry? How about giant mega-bosses ala Shadow of the Colossus? And what about climbing, swinging, jumping and scampering about like in Prince of Persia or the Uncharted series? How about a slightly overwritten origin story for the FIRST BELMONT EVER?!\n\nIf even a few of those concepts appeal to you, you're likely to really enjoy this game. A version of all those elements from other sources were pretty much lifted and used here, but the whole is really more than the sum of its pilfered parts. Those disparate elements and more modified from other games really come together and shine here in a fun beat-em-up that wil keep you entertained throughout, and likely keep you coming back to complete some of the wacky challenges it throws at you after you beat a stage.\n\nIt's easy to recommend, and I was surprisingly pleased by this little gem; so many new reboots fail to capture even some of the things that make their source great, but LoS does a fairly decent job in at least some of the boss fights, and by filling in some fun lore plot gaps in a tragic tale of bad decisions made for the right reasons.

Because in this case I'll be judging Lords of Shadow alone without using any other Castlevania game into comparison.\n\nI like it a lot.\n\nThe game tells the tale of a man who lost his wife like so many others but while the plot may be not be  original the game does have some "soul" attached to it.

It avoids this all too common modern trap of being single-minded by varying up the gameplay whenever it gets the chance; combat remains bread and butter of the game, but it's clear puzzles pull their own weight along with welcome snippets of lore for a complete package, all wrapped together with great graphics and amazing voice acting (MercurySteam decided not to pull a Bethesda and made good use of Patrick Stewart). Especially worth noting is the game's style which gives it its own visual identity through standout location and monster designs.\n\nThat's not to say the game is without its problems, of course. Minor pacing issues rear their ugly head as you meander through early chapters and return once more at the very end of the game by hitting the breaks with a pair of dragged out puzzles when you should instead be getting pumped for the upcoming finale. Fortunately, none of these are big enough to be an unavoidable issue. What is unavoidable though, is that absolutely hackneyed story ending that comes out of nowhere for absolutely no reason whatsoever AND is punctuated even further by the game's final cinematic which makes even less sense unless you play through the DLC as well which brings some clarity to events. Speaking of DLC, and because it continues the story, it's worth mentioning that it is decent, especially the final boss which may be an exercise in patience. Maybe.\n\nHigh production values and developers who clearly put their hearts into making the game are evident and it's most definitely worth playing despite some minor blemishes here and there. Sequel is highly anticipated.","February 21, 2014","true","19.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I can judge only having played this game, and it is one of the best slasher games on PC.\n\nWhat I look for in games is interesting story with memorable characters. The story in Castlevania starts in a bit cliched way, but then the tone slightly changes, and closer to the end there are a few interesting twists. The ending is great!\n\nGraphically the game is stunning even by modern standards. The level design and character models are very well done. The cutscenes (and there are lots of them) are also well directed.\n\nThe gameplay reminded God of War which in no way is bad. You climb, fight monsters and solve puzzles. And of course there are huge bosses! Every boss fight is an interesting puzzle itself. Everything is very well balanced.\n\nThe only minor flaw of the PC version is controls. I started playing on keyboard, but then preferred gamepad.\n\nAll in all, I give this game 10 out of 10. There are a lot of collectibles, trials, artwork. So I will definitely play this game a few more times to get everything!","February 27, 2014","true","22.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In fact, I think it's pretty great. It's a really polished and surprisingly pretty looking action game which takes the lore of the series and twists it into something new. Despite how drastic the shift in gameplay is from previous entries in the series, the story is definitely laid out to cater to Castlevania fans who know the series mythology.\n\nIt's not the absolute best action game out there, or the best narrative you're going to encounter (even though it is narrated entirely by Patrick Stewart and that is awesome), but it's worth more of your time than you might think actually. Don't come in expecting the most mind-blowing event of the year or anything - it's a solid action game with a solid presentation, and that's totally okay.","December 22, 2013","true","24.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Consider Arkham Asylum/City for your beat 'em up needs instead, or try Darksiders if you want to take the demon-fighting ridiculousness up to 11.\n\nMore so than anything, the game suffers from excessive scripting. I've never seen such absurd reliance on QTEs - simply activating certain cranks involves 5 timed button presses - but there are likewise a lot of camera takeovers to show off the (admittedly impressive) scenery when you wish you could be playing the game. Platforming segments consist mostly of following the highlighted ledges, with liberal use of invisible walls to screw up any off-center jumps you attempt. And as pretty as the backgrounds are, most levels consist of running through linear narrow canyons, and even your ability to jump 30 feet in the air won't let you clear knee high obstacles. Combat is no better, with the huge variety of moves failing to serve any real purpose in such a simple system.\n\nAs for the story, it's a dumpster fire. If you somehow didn't think much of Patrick Stewart as an actor, you'll be astonished to see how committed a performance he gives in narrating this trainwreck.","December 29, 2014","false","22.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

If your idea of fun is walking down hallways with an ALWAYS FACING FORWARD CAMERA you cannot control, and absurdly long and unintuitive fights then i guess this could be your thing.\n\nI usually play all my 3d fighters games (god of war/dmc/bayonetta/darksiders/kingdoms of amaulr/ect) on hard mode and usually enjoy the challenge it provides. And while the game provides challenges... it didn't feel fun. It was a series of short combo and dodging a very obvious attack. You can never actually do attack combo's long enough to do the cool combo's in the game before an enemy is about to strike (you cannot interrupt them from attacking you) so you're never actually ever able to do anything than a few short strikes and repeat. Fairly simple, but since enemies have SO much health it quickly loses an appeal and becomes a chore. After becoming bored with this, i put the game difficulty down to easy just so i could blaze through and still... it was more or less the same feeling, only now i didn't take dmg when i got hit.\n\nAs for the platforming /exploration, its garbage. There are some secrets in levels that you have to get upgrades down the line and come back to, but its not like typical backtracking in metroidvania type games, you have to pick the stage and run through the linear halls to simply get back to where that thing was. It doesn't feel like you're making intelligent choices on how to use your upgrades, its just remembering where the item was and walking down those same hallways again to use the item on the door. It's not much but really the aspect of exploring is non existent and it makes a huge impact on how you as a player view the world.\n\nI got through probably around 25% of the game and quit because i just wasn't having fun with this.  And as many things they do right (voice acting/ visuals / story /ect/ some bosses were kinda cool) the core gameplay fails to entertain and thus the whole experience falls flat.","March 28, 2015","false","8.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

Outside of combat, the control mapping might not make sense, since most games often have you use the light attack button to interact with objects.\n\nWhile some may be put off by the lack of proper keyboard controls, let's be honest: This is a genre designed to be played on a console.

First, i could NOT use my mouse, and second, the keyboard layout was terrible. So I spend some time remapping the keyboard layout. The new layout was better but caused my hands to cramp. AND i could not move my point of view. So after an hour i closed the game and went on with my life, dissapointed in a game that could have so mutch potention in being an great game.\n\nAfter an week, I was still thinking aboud the game and how I was going to make it work. So in the end, I went to the store, bought an Xbox ONE controller for 55 euro's (11 times the monney I dropped for this game) linked it with my pc and started playing again. It was an relief. The controls made sence, my hands didn't cramp and the point-of-view problem didn't seem that bad anymore. after i got my controller, 20 more hours were needed to complete the game and I enjoyed most of it to the max. Puzzles were good and solvable without having to use an walktrough all the time. and the story was good enough to keep me intrested all the time. Sadly, to fill time, battles are often way to long, taking up way to mutch time of the game. an boss battle should be 5-10 minutes in an good game, not 15-20 mintes of intensive button mashing in my opinion.\n\nLong story short:\nPros:\nAwesome story, lots of different enemys, good graphics, enough attack options.\n\nCons:\nController essential, battles can become to long an boring.\n\nSo if you are an fan of an good story, linked with good and refreshing puzzles and somhow long battles AND own an controller then this might be an good game for you to pick up.","April 20, 2015","true","20.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Many Castlevania die hard "fans" claim this to be not a real Castlevania game. Though I could somewhat see where they are coming from, this game is definitely different. A lot of lore isn't there, the game itself is awesome and it's one of if not the best 3D Castlevania games. The story is awesome, the voice acting was an amazing surprise, and the music as always in every Castlevania game is superb.\nIf i had to knock down this game its the controls. For the most part I had no problems with using a keyboard/mouse but there were instances were my attacks were delayed and it wasn't registering with what i was pushing. Also two of the boss fights are absolute B.S. and i doubt i would have ever beaten without using a controller but in terms of controls that was my only gripe.\nThe other problem is the game could feel repetitive for many, it is at its core, a hack and slash which many find repetitive. Though with addons such as shadow and light magic, different secondary weapons, a large amount of different combos and the various amount of enemies kept the game refreshing for me. Also it looks gorgeous. I'm very excited for Lords of Shadow 2 which will be coming out this month.","February 7, 2014","true","81.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dracula's Castle, Transylvania, Belmont, Whip, Vampires, Demons, Werewolves, even Zombies, all of those i can remember from those times when the SNES was king and i was playing some game i've never finished, a game called Castlevania: Dracula X, so at the end of 2013 i bought this game to recall those memories and found out what i was missing these years.\n\nTo start off, I always like to focus in 1 game at the time, 2 max, so i can collect the best experience from them in terms of playability, storyline, visual arts, music and voice talents, my previous to this one was Batman: Arkham City, if you know that game you know that is very fluent in terms of combat and how you explore the map, so anyways i finished that one and embarked into this one, which wasnt very good idea cuz the first thing i noticed was something that bothers most of the guys that did a review on this one, it was the unholy fixed camera, i felt prisoner of the view and sensing that i was missing secret areas and ♥♥♥♥, but you know what? somehow it kinda multiply my curiosity to search here and there for that hidden stuff, also i understand why the camera is fixed, it is to show you those breathtaking sights of the Castlevania world, i found myself stopping on my steps to take several snapshots and later watch them analize all those little details, no matter if you're in the bright forest or in the shadows of a ghotic castle, you're immersed in a beautifully designed piece of art.\n\nAbout the controls and combat system, like other games you start with basic techniques which soon have to be evolved by skill points, but it really depends on the player to be executed properly, for this i used my Xbox controller and felt most of the learned stuff works different on certain types of enemies, its not like you mash buttons like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to win, you have to develop strategy in order to really enjoy kicking ♥♥♥, altho i've mastered most of the combat moves, i felt the sprint move just refuses to work sometimes (must be cuz of the analog stick).. overall the controls are sweet and responsive, you do have jump control but abusing the upgraded wing jump will cause to fail even the simplest plataform navigation.\n\nAbout characters and story. Most of all knows the story of Dracula, some of us knew something about the Belmonts in Castlevania games, lots of people know the idea of a god and its nemesis satan, betrayal, now merge all those in the reimagined mythos of this canon, the more i knew about the tragic story of Gabriel Belmont the more i've wanted to finish the game, his hardest fight against the dark. I have a thing with antiheroes in games, they usually have the lost love cliché but here is portrayed in such desperate quest for truth that i was compelled to fight till the end to reveal IMO one of those "Luke, i am your father" twists, at the end i was like, how much pain can a soul endure? or in words from a previous castlevania: what is a man? a miserable little pile of secrets...\n\nAbout the sounds, they are really good but IMO is the weakest part, i mean i love the atmospheric vibe they project upon all the chapters of the game, from ominous darkness to the melancholic ones, but something i really remember from old SNES castlevania was its characteristic music, it would be nice to hear a rendition of Bloody Tears, that song is THE ♥♥♥♥. As to the voice talents, i wasnt quite satisfied either, i mean is good and all but Gabriel sounds irish sometimes when he should be rumanian, or Zobek whose face was asking for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Sean Connery but instead is Patrick Stewart, i mean he did a good work but his voice was this bald space captain in my head, anyways, i guess the rest was ok.\n\nFinal words, I recommend this game for sure, if you're fan of platforming, adventure, good stories, or Castlevania fan, talking about that last, i remember why i didnt finished that old Castlevania: Dracula X, it's cuz that game was mother♥♥♥♥ing hard as balls, and thinking over, being super hard was a crucial characteristic in this franchise, but to be honest this game was quite easy to complete even in the hardest diff (Paladin), except for the last boss, and i mean that ♥♥♥♥ing final battle... i lost count on how many restarts i had to do in order to defeat that cheap shot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mother ♥♥♥♥♥, if you get there you will hate his guts for all eternity, someday i will beat that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cheater again, but not tonight nor tomorrow, i curse him to hell and ♥♥♥♥ the guy who programed his devastating stupid area attacks, dont take me wrong, when i finished with that last boss i felt like i really did accomplish something in games, that kind of feeling that you get from deliver the final blow on the hardest final bosses and you find yourself with your heart at full throttle and your arms raised in victory saying YEAH ♥♥♥♥♥ I GOT YOU, DIE FOREVER YOU PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥! lol\n\nGood game, looking forward to the 2014 follow up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 1, 2014","true","76.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has proven me so so wrong.\n\nTo begin, this is the first Castlevania game I have ever played and I know it is a bit different than the originals, so this review is not going to relate it to any of the others in the long series.\n\nEven though I never played any of the other Castlevanias, the first thing I think of is dark, gothic, castle crashing. After hours upon hours into the game, I just GOT to a gothic castle that fits this description. The entire first quarter of the game has you traveling through forests, frozen wastelands, and even ancient city ruins. Some die hard fans of Castlevania would argue this just ruins the game nor makes it a true part of the "Castlevania" series. I think the exact opposite. The interesting story and dialogue mixed with action packed fights makes the strange and colorful selection of settings very welcomed.\n\nControl wise, I recommend playing with a controller, as that is how I am playing (Wired Afterglow 360) and I have had no problems what-so-ever. The fighting reminds me of every other "Button mashing" action game, including God Of War. You definitely need to master the abundance of button combos to make it further into the story, otherwise you find yourself with hard to finish fights.\n\nThe entire game has definitely beat the test of time, the addition of HD graphics and support of newer hardware make this game aesthetically pleasing to watch as is to play, and making it enjoyable to "catch up" when the sequel is fast approaching. The music is also very engaging, making each fight, boss or not, epic.\n\nReplayability is definitely there. After completing each mission in a chapter, it has a trial that you can attempt to complete while replaying the mission. For example, the first mission requires certain amount of people to survive by the time you beat the boss. Each mission will have it's own unique trial and some will greatly increase the difficulty of the level. Some items will also not be accessible until later in the story, which forces you to 'Come back later' when you get the necessary abilities to obtain them. Some will hate it, I myself enjoy the feature, as it gives me a reason to replay earlier missions to get better upgrades.\n\nThe game is well worth the $30 dollars and is a complete STEAL when on sale.\n\nTo the time of reviewing, I have just beaten chapter 7, only about halfway through the story, and it seems to only be getting better.

Dracula's Castle, Transylvania, Belmont, Whip, Vampires, Demons, Werewolves, even Zombies, all of those i can remember from those times when the SNES was king and i was playing some game i've never finished, a game called Castlevania: Dracula X, so at the end of 2013 i bought this game to recall those memories and found out what i was missing these years.\n\nTo start off, I always like to focus in 1 game at the time, 2 max, so i can collect the best experience from them in terms of playability, storyline, visual arts, music and voice talents, my previous to this one was Batman: Arkham City, if you know that game you know that is very fluent in terms of combat and how you explore the map, so anyways i finished that one and embarked into this one, which wasnt very good idea cuz the first thing i noticed was something that bothers most of the guys that did a review on this one, it was the unholy fixed camera, i felt prisoner of the view and sensing that i was missing secret areas and ♥♥♥♥, but you know what? somehow it kinda multiply my curiosity to search here and there for that hidden stuff, also i understand why the camera is fixed, it is to show you those breathtaking sights of the Castlevania world, i found myself stopping on my steps to take several snapshots and later watch them analize all those little details, no matter if you're in the bright forest or in the shadows of a ghotic castle, you're immersed in a beautifully designed piece of art.\n\nAbout the controls and combat system, like other games you start with basic techniques which soon have to be evolved by skill points, but it really depends on the player to be executed properly, for this i used my Xbox controller and felt most of the learned stuff works different on certain types of enemies, its not like you mash buttons like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to win, you have to develop strategy in order to really enjoy kicking ♥♥♥, altho i've mastered most of the combat moves, i felt the sprint move just refuses to work sometimes (must be cuz of the analog stick).. overall the controls are sweet and responsive, you do have jump control but abusing the upgraded wing jump will cause to fail even the simplest plataform navigation.\n\nAbout characters and story. Most of all knows the story of Dracula, some of us knew something about the Belmonts in Castlevania games, lots of people know the idea of a god and its nemesis satan, betrayal, now merge all those in the reimagined mythos of this canon, the more i knew about the tragic story of Gabriel Belmont the more i've wanted to finish the game, his hardest fight against the dark. I have a thing with antiheroes in games, they usually have the lost love cliché but here is portrayed in such desperate quest for truth that i was compelled to fight till the end to reveal IMO one of those "Luke, i am your father" twists, at the end i was like, how much pain can a soul endure? or in words from a previous castlevania: what is a man? a miserable little pile of secrets...\n\nAbout the sounds, they are really good but IMO is the weakest part, i mean i love the atmospheric vibe they project upon all the chapters of the game, from ominous darkness to the melancholic ones, but something i really remember from old SNES castlevania was its characteristic music, it would be nice to hear a rendition of Bloody Tears, that song is THE ♥♥♥♥. As to the voice talents, i wasnt quite satisfied either, i mean is good and all but Gabriel sounds irish sometimes when he should be rumanian, or Zobek whose face was asking for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Sean Connery but instead is Patrick Stewart, i mean he did a good work but his voice was this bald space captain in my head, anyways, i guess the rest was ok.\n\nFinal words, I recommend this game for sure, if you're fan of platforming, adventure, good stories, or Castlevania fan, talking about that last, i remember why i didnt finished that old Castlevania: Dracula X, it's cuz that game was mother♥♥♥♥ing hard as balls, and thinking over, being super hard was a crucial characteristic in this franchise, but to be honest this game was quite easy to complete even in the hardest diff (Paladin), except for the last boss, and i mean that ♥♥♥♥ing final battle... i lost count on how many restarts i had to do in order to defeat that cheap shot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mother ♥♥♥♥♥, if you get there you will hate his guts for all eternity, someday i will beat that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cheater again, but not tonight nor tomorrow, i curse him to hell and ♥♥♥♥ the guy who programed his devastating stupid area attacks, dont take me wrong, when i finished with that last boss i felt like i really did accomplish something in games, that kind of feeling that you get from deliver the final blow on the hardest final bosses and you find yourself with your heart at full throttle and your arms raised in victory saying YEAH ♥♥♥♥♥ I GOT YOU, DIE FOREVER YOU PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥! lol\n\nGood game, looking forward to the 2014 follow up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 1, 2014","true","76.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To get health, you need mana. To get mana, you have to defeat enemies in a specific way.  But if you could do that, you wouldn't need the health!  So instead of exploring the combos and moves, I spent the whole time hoarding mana so I might regain some health.  Honestly, if Mana regenerated on its own, this game would be a full grade rating better than it is.\nThe graphics are good; the combat's okay (too focused on parry and blocking, especially considering how many unblockable attacks the enemies have); the puzzles are the highlight; the climbing/platforming is okay, but not great.  The story is ponderous and overwrought, but that's par for the style.  The final battle in the game itself isn't bad.\nBut then I played the DLC.  The first piece was actually pretty good. A new feature, some new puzzles.  It ends with 'To Be Continued' which is annoying.\nThen I played the second DLC.  It manages to encompass every trope of the genre in the worst way possible.  I mean really, a platform jumping section where missing the jump means going back to the beginning?  And then it's a stealth section too (if the boss sees you, it's an instant death)?  And there's a minute-long sequence where you literally play peek-a-boo with the boss.  And the final battle - I spent at least two bloody hours playing it;  I almost gave up and cheated.  Who puts you in a final boss battle and doesn't let you fill up on health and magic first?  Again, exacerbated by the horrible system they have in place, I was tearing my hair out and cursing the game.  I literally deleted it within 15 seconds of exiting after the win.  I can't recommend this to anyone.  The main game, maybe if you're desperate for a God of War clone (with some Shadows of the Colossus thrown in).  But save yourself the headache and don't bother with the DLC.\n\nOh, and the game has little to nothing to do with Castlevania.  The protagonist is a Belmont.  He has a whip. There are vampires.  Middle-Ages Europre. That's the entirety of the similarities.","April 5, 2014","false","26.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mostlynice/recommended/234080/","mostlynice","Mostly Nice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mostlynice/","774 products in account","Castlevania Lord of Shadows Review\nReloaded, revitalized and repacked with sharp graphics, orchestral music, all-star cast plus a grim & dark fantasy storyline that will grip you on the edge of your seat.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with the games style format, it is played pretty much like Devil May Cry. The hair is definitely waptastic and sort of killed some of the vibe for me. However, much unlike DMC, Castlevania doesn’t focus so heavily on combos which gives you some room to breathe and whilst still visually stunning at 60FPS. Throw in some elements from God of War, add a dash of final fantasy (hair, hair, hair) plus a little Darksides and you have Castlevania Lord of Shadows. However… This game is completely its own.\n\nCastlevania Lord of Shadows is a perfect game for those who are long, long-time fans of the game as well as those new to the series. No need to do your homework as, by the second scene the story & objectives are clear whilst you’re taken through combat & gameplay by appropriately placed tutorials. Although even by hour 2 you’re still learning new things about the game and the tutorials can become a little annoying by this point, it’s merely a dent in the game’s overall campaign, featuring a sizeable number of chapters. You will continue to be surprised through each scene and the first 4-5 hours of the game make it hard to get up and use the bathroom. As your taken through dark forests, spellbinding coves & treacherous roads you way will be filled with a variety of enemies and ‘elite’ (harder) enemies that encourage and sometimes force you to really think about how to play this ‘hack n slash’. It’s worth mentioning at this point that if you don’t have a controller pad, you will likely want to reconfigure the controls for mouse & keyboard as the default option is not only awkward but down right painful sometimes. I spent about 2 hours of time trying the keyboard only configuration already laid out but after death number 785,966 I eventually caved. Note: Hard mode is actually hard & my antique thumbs heavily await paladin mode! Dying in Castlevanaia isn’t such a big deal, there’s no lengthy loading titles or a series of screens reminding you of your failure, instead; you see Gabriel illuminated in slow motion for a few seconds and are magically thrown to the ledge you fell off or entrance to the area you last stepped through, health fully restored. I really liked this about the game as it kept it consistent and didn’t deter me from reaching the end of the area and meant I could re-think my tactics / strategy multiple times without playing like a complete ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe combat system is fluent and easily learnable so that after a few hours of gameplay you will feel like a seasoned pro. There are 2 primary attacks, both using Gabriel’s ‘Combat Cross’(Like Blades of Chaos); 1 being a singular focused attack and the other being an area of effect based attack dealing significantly less damage. As you would expect you can purchase and upgrade new combos throughout the game as you earn experience points to spend. There are also throwing daggers which are nice to throw in the mix and if you remember you have them you will likely throw 5-10 in quick succession. As well as that there are a number of scenarios / enemies where you can interact with animations to break-up the furious clicking / button smashing. These are actually really cool and with impress you right throughout the game as you find new special abilities and interactions. Similar to The Wicther – You will either be a blocker or a dodger. The action block is very neat and boasts counter abilities to tear your enemies apart for being as foolish as to even dare try to strike you, however getting the timing of it can prove frustrating! Alas, it is not essential and you can use the same key + direction (WASD / Dpad) to roll cleanly out of the way. There is also the addition of both light and dark powers. You first get light powers then dark powers not long between each other somewhere early in chapter 2. Once you learn of the light power enemies will start to drop neutral energy that can be collected by holding a key/button near to the orbs to collect them. This will fill up your light meter and once light power is toggled, hitting enemies will restore your health. Neat! However, enemies will not drop neutral energy orbs while it is active so quickly slash and turn it off just in time for the killing blow! Similarly, but oppositely, dark energy is collected by enemies dropping neutral orbs but holding a different key/button to absorb them. This will then fill the dark energy bar that, once activated will significantly increase damage, however the same rules apply and killing an enemy with Gabriel’s dark power active will mean no neutral orbs will be dropped! That would be just too easy…\n\nThere’s an element of Darksiders in this game when moving between battles as you’re challenged with stunning areas to move between in which you will need to jump, swing, climb, grapple, rappel, abseil & trudge to reach the next scene. These are more fun than frustrating and provide a dungeon crawl feel to the game only heightening the story and fantasy intensity. Dead soldiers & fallen heroes will line the way and provide you with interesting story notes and secrets to be found as well as useful items. You can also crack open a lot of statues and ornaments to find throwing daggers and other items.\n\nI’ve read a lot of negative reviews about this game and the talk of no adjustable camera really seems to have spoilt it for a lot of people. Personally for me it really wouldn’t make much of a difference as the levels and stages are set out exquisitely, as you would expect from Konami, and it keeps the platformer feel to the series throwing you into scenes of the story as well as areas of the game.\n\nI could never really get into games that are set out in this sort of fashion as they just lacked a bit of a style for me and felt they belonged in an arcade. Castlevania however is its own and really has a lot of replay-ability with an unlockable difficulty to challenge yourself as well as a trials mode featuring as many chapters as the story mode. It’s a shame that this game is the finale but on the same note is a testament to the prestigious game series I first played 20 years ago. No expense has been spared and nothing over looked throughout the game, it is a bountiful experience with real mirth and character that will cement it in our history as a memorable & charming experience. Unquestionably, the game comes with my highest recommendation & at $30RRP is punching well below its weight and should have been a serious contender for game of the year.\n\nDo yourself and your friend a favour by forgetting about that next big game title, and buy 2 copies while saving yourself a bundle. You will not regret it and even on the easiest settings you will find many, many hours of riveting gameplay.\n10/10\n","February 14, 2014","true","32.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

I will be giving a brief, spoiler-free (as much as possible) rundown on the pro's and con's of the hit game. Note: The spoiler tag may or may not work in this review. It works in the review, but not on the bottom of the actual store page of the game. You've been warned.\n\nCharacters\n\nGabriel Belmont\nVoiced by Robert Carlyle.\nThe main protagonist of the game. He's dramatic and emotional, but has to be the most doubt-filled and least-interesting Castlevania character since Sonia Belmont from "Castlevania Legends". Seriously, this guy can't get any worse. WARNING!! SPOILERS!!\nHe goes from doubting God to having faith in kicking Satan's butt to "WOA IS MEH!!!" from start to finish. He also ends up turning into a vampire and calling himself "Dracul" or "Dracula" at the end.\nEND OF SPOILERS!! Great character appearance, wonderful voice actor, but horrible writing.\n\nZobek\nVoiced by Patrick Stewart.\nThe mysterious aid of Gabriel's from the Brotherhood of Light. He narrates the start of each level, and gives us an interesting view of events on the progress of the main character. WARNING!! SPOILERS!!\nTurns out to be one of the main villains of the game. Zobek is "Lords of Shadow"'s version of Death AKA The Grim Reaper from the main series. END OF SPOILERS!! Has great voice acting due, in no small part, to Patrick Stewart.\n\nThe Lords of Shadow\nMain villains of the game. Each one was based on random characters from past games. Each one is lord over a division of classic fantasy monsters, with their own story of origin. Despite the creative effort of Mercury Steam's writers, they ended up being a mostly-petty rehash. WARNING!! SPOILERS!!\nYou battle two of them, and the third is revealed at the end of the game.\nEND OF SPOILERS!!\nGreat boss fights, but shameful use of good characters.\n\nWARNING!! SPOILERS!!\n\nSatan\nVoiced by Jason Isaacs.\nThe main villain of the game and a first for the franchise. Though a small appearance at the end of the game, he turns out to give us a fairly interesting boss fight and twist of the plot along with getting a major role in the sequel. His appearance is, simply, a half-naked Ozzy Osbourne with a long black staff. And no, that wasn't a sexual joke. Decent voice acting and tough fight, but I felt like something was missing from him.\n\nGameplay\n\nSingleplayer\nA fast-paced slaughter of a variaty of creatures with a story that unfolded at a good speed. Has some tough challenges that you'll probably take a few days to do and wonderful graphics to keep you dazzled. Has a good array of combos and the franchise-favorite sub-weapons, some with an interesting spin on the classics. And, due to the DLC's, expands the story much more to set-up the events of the sequels. Sadly, no matter what I did, the game ends up feeling a bit too button-mashy.\n\nReplay value\n4.5/5\n\nConclusion\n\nPros\n+ Great voice acting.\n+ Good action in both cutscenes and gameplay.\n+ If you're a believer in The Lord, you'll love the little bits of Christianity scattered about.\n\nCons\n- If you hate religion, you'll love the ending.\n- Terrible plot-twists and repeatitive gameplay.\n- Unbelievable amount of nudity. Almost "Duke Nukem"-worthy (and that's a bad thing for Castlevania).\n\nGame Review Score: 5.9\nHonestly, you're better off buying "Castlevania: Judgement" on the Nintendo Wii. Even that game was more satisfying than this!\n\nSeries Review Score: 3.2\nAfter the release of "Lords of Shadow 2", it shows just how horrible of a job Mercury Steam did creating the trilogy. As a true Castlevania fan, I am very disappointed in them and Konami's allowance to create this!\n\nAfterword\nMy personal name for the game (which might upset some people) is "Rehashlevania: Lords of Ghetto - Idiot Edition". My friends also use this term.\n\nI'd love to see what IGA (the guy in charge of creating Castlevania games) thinks of "Lords of Shadow"!\n\nThank you for reading.\n- Oniell.","February 11, 2014","false","80.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/friedowl/recommended/234080/","friedowl","Fried Owl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/friedowl/","678 products in account","As a huge fan of combat RPGs like the God of War[en.wikipedia.org], Darksiders and Prince of Persia series' I had great expectations for Castlevania. All the reviews pointed out its favourable similarities to these games. Although Lords of Shadow has elements of those games it falls way short in a number of areas.\n\nThe Bad\n1. Very Linear Gameplay - It's actually about as linear as the God of War series where you have no camera control and you follow very tightly defined paths. However, GoW balanced that out by adding hidden areas filled with collectables. So you could explore nooks and crannies to find extras. Castlevania on the other hand is so linear it feels more like an interactive story book with 0 choice in outcome. The collectables are all on the main paths so there's no difficulty in finding them. Smashing objects reveals knives which you often have a full complement of already - making them useless.\n\n2. Confusing Story - All the games I mentioned above had rich and detailed stories mixing fascinating myths with new fantasy twists. On the one hand Castle was a mass of cliches (love, dead wife, revenge, etc, etc.) but on the other it was a baffling mess (what am I? who is the narrator that seems to know me? why would being able to resurrect the dead (necromancy) be a good thing?). Some of these questions get answered but far too late for my liking.\n\nI was left confused and emotionally detached from the characters and game for far too long. I didn't care about the protagonist or his quest or anyone in the game.\n\n4. Slow To Get Going - I oiriginally wrote this review after playing for 10hrs and was pretty unimpressed. Its gotten slightly better since playing another 3hrs as more of the story has begun to make sense and extra combat moves unloclk.\nBut the fact remains: a game shouldn't take 10hrs of faffing to start making sense and open up enough combat moves to make play fun.\n\n4. Main Character's Voice Acting - I can't tell if the voice actor is faking a Scottish accent or its so weak it feels wishy-washy. The dialogue, especially with his wife was horrendously wooden. After she is consumed by some darkness in the afterlife and pledging her love his best reaction is a muted: "I love you too". I've heard better acting from circus fleas.\n\nThe Good\n1. Combat & 'Vehicles' - the combat as with most combat RPGs is interesting although it takes a while to unlock the best moves. You do get to control a wider variety of beasts including Wargs, trolls and spiders. For much longer than most games - in fact they get as much use as vehicles in famous FPS games.\n\n2. Dark & Light Magic - You get Dark and Light magic in this game and you can switch between the two to get different moves and effects. Light will hewal you with every strike and dark will boiost your damage output. Add to that a set of extra moves for each too. It adds a whole new dimension to combat which is pretty refreshing.\nHowever, as mentioned previously it takes a while before you even get access to these extra abilities.\n\n3. Patrick Stewart - his voice acting as the narrator and Brother (NPC) is the only redeeming feature of the voice acting cast. Adding some much needed gravitas and emotion.\n\nConclusion\nBuy the game in a sale or at least play a demo to see if you'd like it.

The plot is fantastic and I played through to the end because I was so interested in where it was all going; the story literally grabs you and pulls you down, it's presented very well through the narration (patrick ♥♥♥♥ing stewart.)\n\nThe game play kind of sucks though. The camera is fix and it makes combat kind of wonky. Particularly with the keyboard and mouse it's a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. The combat itself isn't very difficult and doesn't give too much challenge which is nice if you're someone who would like to play just for the story, but because of the strange camera it does at times get kind of frustrating. I remember one particular area where the camera would switch between two entirely different angles (from top down kind of, to from the side) if you moved to a certain spot while fighting some difficult enemies.\n\nIt's not a piece of ♥♥♥♥, but it definitely was not done as well as it could have and it ♥♥♥♥s the game play to a fair extent.","September 20, 2014","true","122.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

In short, it... was... beautiful... I was completely taken aback by this game. It blew my expectations out of the water then proceeded to BLOW MY F*****G MIND!\n\nThis game is EPIC Beyond Belief! It is not only an AWESOME 3D Castlevania, but it’s an AWESOME game PERIOD! It also has one of, if not THE best stories in SERIES HISTORY. The story is AWESOME beyond description. It also has some of the BEST VOICE ACTING I HAVE EVER HEARD IN A VIDEO GAME EVER!\n\nIt’s not perfect though, not by any standard. It has a few minor issues. It’s an incredible game held back by a slight lack of polish. As such I can't give it a perfect score. It’s STILL one of the best games in the series. So I would give this game 8.9 out of 10.\n\nPROS\n\n- Beautiful detailed graphics and visuals. The game is a true piece of eye candy.\n\n- Incredible art design all around\n\n- Some of the best acting to be found in video games.\n\n- BEAUTIFUL and epic original music score\n\n- Epic and sweeping story unmatched in scope or writing within the series\n\n- Identifiable & believable characters\n\n- AWESOME and satisfying combat system\n\n- AWESOME boss battles\n\n- An ending that will tear are your heart open then make you crap your pants in amazement\n\n- Roughly 20 Hours of gameplay with loads of replayability\n\n- Unforgiving but Fair Difficulty\n\n- Linear Gameplay\n\n- PATRICK STEWART, MOTHER F****R!!!\n\n\n\nCONS\n\n- Linear gameplay\n\n- TONS of OBVIOUS invisible walls\n\n- Easy to miss environmental exploration cues\n\n- Fixed camera can interfere with control\n\n- Barrows a most of its gameplay elements from other games","February 13, 2014","true","7.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CKNIGHT33/recommended/234080/","CKNIGHT33","CKNIGHT33","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CKNIGHT33/","79 products in account","Castlevania: Symphony of the "meh"\n*Fair warning, there be some story spoilers.  I have tried to contain them, but spoilers ahoy!*\n\n\nOkay, so first thing first, this isn't a Castlevania game.  The developers have branded this as a reboot of the franchise, but they clearly were making something else and were then told they had to add Castlevania elements to it and call it a Castlevania game.  As far as I'm concerned, Mercury Steam just Michael Bay'd my childhood.  It's a poor God of War with elements of Shadows of the Colossus and DMC.  Very little of what you think of when you think of Castlevania is actually present.  You know things like: Dracula, gothic imagry, cryptic music, stylized baddies.  The gothic feeling of the originals (and especially Symphony of the Night) is completely missing.  There are some sequences in a castle with LoS (and honestly they are the best segments of the game), but that's only a small portion of the game and even that feels very bland and generic.  This game could have been set anywhere.  Gone is the "Romanian countryside" of the originals.  Instead we have a game world with generic looking trolls, goblins, and even annoying chupacabras.  With a few exceptions (notably the shambling skeletons and the zombies towards the end), the monsters just didn't feel like they belonged in a Castlevania game.\n\nWhere are the headless horsemen, the ghostly dancers, the fish men monsters, the medusa heads, etc?  On a side note: apparently the chupacabra is no longer a blood sucking devil living in the American Southwest.  Now it is an annoying critter that steals your *#$% and mocks you in an annoying voice...  Seriously, who came up with that horrible idea?  Then there were faeries.... Why.. were there faeries?    Why did Pan and the Goblins look like something out of "Pan's Labrynth"?\n\nThen there's the gameplay.  I played this with an xbox controller and the controls combined with the horrible camera angles made me want to strangle a chupacabra  like nobody's business.  Seriously, I felt like the designers were just f'ing with me.  Taking monsters off screen where my camera angle will not show them so that I'm swinging at nothing. Thanks.  Making controls point to awkward jumps just to watch my character jump in the wrong direction.  Again, thanks.  Then there were the horrible puzzles that involved my character jumping then punching a switch on the ground.  Whoever designed those sequences should be drug out into the street and tarred and feathered.  Seriously, my character always managed to land everywhere but where I wanted him to.\n\nOne of the few positives was the combat.  I enjoyed the exploration and the combat for the most part.  When the camera wasn't making life miserable, the moves list, combos, counters, et all were pretty entertaining.  However, the game spent too much time with the same monsters ad nauseum.  How many times did I need to ride a troll or a spider?  The novelty of those experiences ended shortly into the game.\n\nFor that matter, why change the iconic whip of the original Castlevania games?  What is with this weaponized cross that is both whip, pully, and stake? Then there are the bonus weapons.  The holy water was well done, but the daggers and dark crystal seemed useless.  Whenever I used a crystal, I would just watch nothing happen to a boss or the game would just cheat and respawn the monsters.\n\nThen there's the story.  Again, I played the early Castlevania games including 1,2,3, Super Castlevania 4, and Symphony of the Night.  This story had better execution but made no sense.  *potential spoiler* Not only did the developers poorly ape games like God of War, but they decided to ape the antihero tropes as well.  I prefer the Dracula of the orignal series: a clear cut monster / devil.  Not to mention the fact, that, if the game is going to feature Dracula going forward, why would I even want to play?  Dracula was always the villain.  He "stole men's souls". Remember?\n\nJust too many design decisions about this game made no sense in terms of "Castlevania".  I can hear the meetings of "wouldn't be cool if we did this..", but nobody stopped to ask "does that fit Castlevania?"\n\nThe graphics and the music were pretty (beautiful on PC with maxed settings), but it just didn't feel like Castlevania.   The voiceover work was serviceable.  The actress playing Laura was good, but the leads felt like they were merely cashing a check.  Gabriel was supposed to be undergoing this dark metamophasis the entire time, but I never saw it.  Not to mention the redemption ending made no sense considering the immediate departure the character takes.\n\nIf this game weren't a Castlevania game, I would give it a 6.5 / 10.  Maybe a 7, but no higher.  But, as a Castlevania game, Lords of Shadow doesn't even rate.  The developers squandered an opportunity.  If this is the direction the series is going, I am done.  This was a 30 hour insult.","January 11, 2014","false","30.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Let's list the cons:\n- Levels are linear, but still have hidden items that will require upgrades you don't yet have to collect them. Getting those hidden items will therefore require you to play through certain levels again wile enduring:\n- Bad combat. Basically God of War, except the enemies don't react a lot to getting hit, they're basically sponges for punishment. Most of the moveset is not that useful. In fact, about half your combat moves are only usable while magic is active, which you don't get a lot of. A lot of attack animations can't be block-canceled out of.\n- Unpassable chest-high-wall syndrome, or worse, invisible walls over knee-high objects. These make exploring feel bad, and you do want to explore for upgrades.\n- Tedious climbing. Gabriel moves rather slowly compared to, say, Lara, and as climbables are highlighted, requires no brainpower either. Unless they're obscured by the camera, of course. At least the environments you climb are pretty.\n- The Camera. It's not under your control, and will too often screw you out of seeing enemies while they're pummeling you, or disorient you when switching between views. It will also often be very zoomed out, making it hard to see enemy attack wind-up animations.\n- Patrick Stewart is woefully miscast, and sounds like he's phoning it in while reading absolute garbage prose.\n- No healing orb/item drops require you to first kill (a lot of) enemies to get magic orbs, then activate light magic, and then hit enemies in order to heal. In practice, this means that I don't use the dark magic often to hit harder, because I need more health.\n\nI enjoyed my time with other off-brand God of War titles like X-Men Origins: Wolverine or Dante's Inferno a whole lot more. I think Wolverine has a PC version too. Get that instead, unless you're really (REALLY) into the artstyle of this game.","January 24, 2015","false","12.9"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","0"

When it comes to bringing Castlevania to the PC platform, then this is probably the best way to open up the franchise to new people, especially when the sequel is arriving February 2014. If you’re a PC gamer who has never played Castlevania: Lords of Shadow or a hardcore fan that is looking to replay the game before the sequel hits, you should certainly pick up the PC version. It’s undoubtedly the “Ultimate” version, and with DmC being the only recent title to offer similar gameplay on the platform there isn’t much choice when it comes to these types of games. Sitting at a welcoming £19.99 on Steam (and cheaper in other places), there is plenty here for your money that would make even Dracula come out of the shadows for a taste.","December 26, 2013","true","22.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let me list those first just to give you an idea.\n\nWarning: It is fun and I got it for $10 and think it is worth about that. Despite the below criticisms, I still think it's pretty neat. Heck, I may even pick up the sequel on sale(I've heard they are fixing many complaints).\n\n\n1. It's about 40% too long. I would write a really positive review if this game had not very much overstayed its welcome. I played it for 18 hours and really think it was more like a 9-10 hour game.\n\n2. I frequently did not know where to go next or what to do. Call me dumb if you want, but I found myself bumbling around too much in this game.\n\n3. An early boss battle requires a boss to throw a rock at you. I spent over an hour in frustration repeatedly finding the spot to stand in for him to throw it. It sounds minor, but it was annoying almost to the point of me quitting.\n\n4. It's repetitive. It is fun, so it is a repetition of fun, but it can wear quite old sometimes.\n\n5. The two final chapters(which were originally DLC) have very substandard cinematics, which is distracting.\n\n6. The camera is a nightmare sometimes. And there are invisible walls everywhere. It's really weird for a modern game. Oh, you CAN NOT control the camera. Wow, really?\n\n\nNow the positives:\n\n1. Beautiful game.\n\n2. Chapters 10-12 were excellent. So good I wish they would have just gotten there a little more quickly.\n\n3. The combat is very satisfying and controls really well.\n\n4. The light platforming is fun, though painfully unchallenging.\n\n5. I found the story quite moving in parts and all the voice acting is top notch.\n\nAnyway, I do think you should pick up the game on a sale. However, I can not help but be partially disappointed. In summary, a neat game with flaws....flaws that are magnified by the fact the game is way too long.\n\nPurchase less than $15 for sure.","January 15, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raziel00/recommended/234080/","Raziel00","Charade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raziel00/","336 products in account","I had previously written a negative review of this game, but gave it a second chance... This review will reflect both the positives and negatives of this game\n\nLet me start with a warning; there are a few sections in this game that were poorly designed. You will commit mistakes that force you to repeat annoying, tiresome actions; be it QTEs that pop out of nowhere on the least appropriate times, or certain actions that are anything but obvious..among other things. Try to be a little patient; when the game isn't trolling you, it's actually pretty good.\n\nThis game is often described as a God of war-like game, a spectacle fighter with puzzles and platforming. That is somewhat accurate..but not entirely.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the "spectacle fighter" part of the game is a bit toned down, in the sense that the enemy behavior patterns push you to play in a more traditional way. It's not really about chaining crazy combos, but rather about dodging, blocking and hitting at the right times, almost as if you were in an old Castlevania game, but in a 3D area that allows more freedom and flow. The fact that the game doesn't have a combo count should be a dead giveaway that it's not "exactly" the kind of game you might be expecting.\n\nThis is both good and bad; on one hand, it's good for variety's sake; instead of playing something you already played in a different setting, you're experiencing something that has its own place, and that is enjoyable. The "bad" part is divided into two points; the most obvious is that it's bad if what you're looking for is indeed an insane combo-chain spectacle game. you should try DmC for that, a game that i also like a lot. the other, is that, unfortunately, the game's fixed camera angle gets in the way of your "strategic" gameplay and reactions times as well.. You can often get hit not because of your fault, but the camera.\n\nI also have one complaint with the controls. When you jump, you have very little control of your movements/direction..and that is fine i guess, it's understandable. However, what isn't, is that your attacks get tied to your jump direction, which heavily limits your aerial capabilities. This is extremely noticeble in the Forgotten One boss fight of the Resurrection DLC where the weak spots are very high and you can often hit nothing but air due to the game's stubborn jump mechanics.\n\nAside from that, we have a veeeery good soundtrack, awesome voice acting by TV stars Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle, ocasionally impressive visual design, ocasionally good puzzles and platforming.. i say ocasionally because the Music Box level is terrible! One of those sections i warned you about..\n\nBottom line; there are some moments where you'll tear your hair out screaming "WTF DEVS?! what were you thinking?". But when that isn't happening, you'll be having a great time, so i recommend it, specially because the sequel is shaping up to be one of 2014's best games.\n","December 13, 2013","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Virtually every level provides a new fantastic set piece supported by quality orchestral music and superbly voiced characters.\n\nWhere the game falls short however, is in the way it approaches wall climbing, which amounts to watching a heavily armored man crouching in seemingly impossible positions to navigate areas in what can feel like a forced inclusion of elements normally found in tomb raider or uncharted.\n\nIn addition to this, the storyline, although well voiced and with interesting scenes, is very light on detail and leaves large question marks regarding some of the overall plot or lore.\n\nAll this aside the game is still highly worth playing for any fan of hack and slash titles or castlevania in general.","October 10, 2014","true","41.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That is somewhat accurate..but not entirely.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the "spectacle fighter" part of the game is a bit toned down, in the sense that the enemy behavior patterns push you to play in a more traditional way. It's not really about chaining crazy combos, but rather about dodging, blocking and hitting at the right times, almost as if you were in an old Castlevania game, but in a 3D area that allows more freedom and flow. The fact that the game doesn't have a combo count should be a dead giveaway that it's not "exactly" the kind of game you might be expecting.\n\nThis is both good and bad; on one hand, it's good for variety's sake; instead of playing something you already played in a different setting, you're experiencing something that has its own place, and that is enjoyable. The "bad" part is divided into two points; the most obvious is that it's bad if what you're looking for is indeed an insane combo-chain spectacle game. you should try DmC for that, a game that i also like a lot. the other, is that, unfortunately, the game's fixed camera angle gets in the way of your "strategic" gameplay and reactions times as well.. You can often get hit not because of your fault, but the camera.\n\nI also have one complaint with the controls. When you jump, you have very little control of your movements/direction..and that is fine i guess, it's understandable. However, what isn't, is that your attacks get tied to your jump direction, which heavily limits your aerial capabilities. This is extremely noticeble in the Forgotten One boss fight of the Resurrection DLC where the weak spots are very high and you can often hit nothing but air due to the game's stubborn jump mechanics.\n\nAside from that, we have a veeeery good soundtrack, awesome voice acting by TV stars Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle, ocasionally impressive visual design, ocasionally good puzzles and platforming.. i say ocasionally because the Music Box level is terrible! One of those sections i warned you about..\n\nBottom line; there are some moments where you'll tear your hair out screaming "WTF DEVS?! what were you thinking?". But when that isn't happening, you'll be having a great time, so i recommend it, specially because the sequel is shaping up to be one of 2014's best games.\n","December 13, 2013","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I looked forward to purchasing this game for a long while, and I wish that I hadn't.  It doesn't feel anything like the old Castlevania; not that I'm against innovation or anything.  I can't make myself become interested in the story, and sometimes, I just do not feel like waiting for Patric Stewart to read through a wall of text on the screen.  I cannot stand the camera in this game.  I can't control it at all, and it's very annoying and disorienting to have the POV jump 180 degrees back and forth if I happen to go through whatever tunnel or doorway,  Also, b/c the camera doesn't stay behind my character's back, I have died a few times b/c I simply could not see what was in front of my character since it was all off screen, facing towards me.  Such a stupid design, and it carries over to navigating the guy along the wall edges.  Sometimes, I can't quite judge which direction they want me to aim the stick, so I'll jump to my death a few times, or trying to traverse wooden beams and spider webs, but the camera is at an odd angle (not 45, 90, 180) so I can't quite get him to walk straight without having to stop and catch my balance every 2 seconds.  I am really just not having any fun at all with this game, and partway through Chapter II, I had forgotten how many chapters there were until I went back to the main map.  I don't know if I need to sit through an entire game that is not fun at all, with an annoying camera, and the game seems like it may be about 40+ hours to complete.  I really hate to add yet another game to my "Not Playing" category, but this one looks to be well on its way.  Surely, there must be some mods or something that people are using that cause them to actually enjoy playing this mess.","February 3, 2015","false","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And there are MANY loading screens again probably b/c of the graphics.\n\nThe fighting and style reminds you of devil may cry but fails to deliver that great combat that feels JUST right.  Sure there are a ton of moves, but I found myself not even wanting to bother to study half of them.  The game feels like you could chain together some cool combos, but seems to punish you every time you attempt to string one.  I normally wouldn't say this about a game but a practice board or tutorial stage maybe like street fighter's would do this game well to get you used to the moves.\n\nSpeaking of tutorials half of this game feels like a tutorial (and not in the right way at all, punish you b/c you have no idea what they want you to do then after you fail correct you), 1/4 like quick time events, and 1/4 fun.\n\nThis beautiful game is confused as to what it wants to be just like the main character's storyline (yes I played it all the way to the end including the boards after the credits roll).\n\nYes this game does have some cool areas, fun puzzles, a few cool bosses, but it just doesn't live up to what Castlevania should be imo.\n\nAt most pick this game up on a sale, because at full price you're really just paying for the visual treat.\n\n\n","January 11","false","35.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/234080/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","Wow. I ended up enjoying this game. Quite a bit. I was so wishy washy when it went on sale awhile back that I was unsure I could convince myself to buy a game in a series I was entirely unfamiliar with. Sometimes good word of mouth goes a long way I suppose.\n\nThe combat is fast and fluid, and more importantly: varied. Even early on without a lot of the skills and combo modifiers unlocked yet, blocking, dodging, aerial attacks, grapples are all able to be utilized. Sometimes I feel I repeat myself a bit when it comes to combat systems but it is immensely important to me that they stay interesting throughout the course of the game. Nothing worse than having a game like Kingdom Hearts where the combat system can essentially boil down to a single button on your controller. This game will punish you if you don't vary up your attacks, try to get the enemies airborn, anything other than attack attack attack. Enemies having both blockable and unblockable attacks means you will have to learn to both block and dodge. It ends up becoming so addicting such that taking a hit to interrupt your combo and reset the meter ends up being rather demoralizing. The meter was a fantastic way of making every encounter interesting, since it meant even trash mobs would be approached with the goal of perfection in mind. On normal mode the majority of encounters were maybe a notch too easy, though at the end of the game the difficulty ramps up quite a bit. In the DLC chapters, you are asked to take on many sets of tough enemies without a checkpoint inbetween, and the final boss (both the story and the dlc) test whether you know when to attack, and when to pull back.\n\nThe puzzles are great from about the midpoint of the game on. Lots of variations to things you'd see in either a Zelda games, for instance. Many of them are creative and you never really see the same type of puzzle twice. Especially in late game and dlc, I found myself asking my brother for any ideas on 1 or 2 of them (but never the internet!...except once.)\n\nMy first main gripe of the game is the Uncharted style "platforming". This typically involves you moving from glowing ledge to glowing ledge in a straightforward fashion simply to move from one area to another. I understand  the usefulness of implementing that as a traversal mode, but it just felt just it was overabundant. There are a few instances where the world opens up a bit and you're free to do a little bit more climbing around, looking for secrets and whatnot (or retrieving your gear, which gets stolen from you 4 too many times in this game), and these are the best uses of being able to climb and hookshot around.\n\nMy second main gripe is the abundance of QTEs. There are a lot of them. A lot a lot. It's not the worst use of them I've seen, but enough to make it a bit annoying. Luckily, they are often reserved as "eye candy". What I mean by that is typically you'll have your normal fight with the normal mechanics, and then either the finishing blow  or stage-change will be executed with a QTE. I will admit that sometimes the eye candy looks nice, and it feels good to see Gabe rip apart whatever foe in whatever  way the developer felt adequate.\n\nWhich reminds me of my last point. The art style of this game really sunk its teeth into me. I can't point to exactly what or why, but I love how this game looks, outside of the full motion cutscenes that is (which seem to incur a drop in framerate and overall quality). For being not much more than generic medieval fantasy, I was never really bored with enemy designs or environments. I took a fair number of screenshots simply because I really found myself wanting to share how good it looks. The bosses had some very interesting designs and not a recolor or re-skin to be seen.\n\nThe story is pretty light for most all of the first ten chapters or so. For someone who knew and still knows nothing or very little of Castlevania anything, this was a good thing. However, the last handful of chapters, especially the final confrontation of the main story, is like an info-dump of PLOT followed by a post credits video of more revelations. The DLC then goes to bridge the game ending and ending scene with more plot. None of it is particularily bad it just seemed like quite the tonal shift.\n\nSo, a great game, with great core gameplay marred by some lazy qtes and "platforming". Maybe Castlevania purists wouldn't enjoy it as much but I don't really have the frame of reference to make a comment on that. On its own merits, its a great game worth playing.","December 19, 2013","true","27.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game has also a lot of variation in terms of gameplay like puzzles, hack and slash sections, platforming and even in one section you have to play a chess game with a demon girl. The only problems I found about this game are some small bugs, some camera issues (cause camera is fixed and sometimes gets in the way) and there are some levels that are weak in relation to other and feel out of place. Also some puzzles are hard to solve due to unresponsive controls because the camera gets in the way and your character is not controlled as it’s supposed to.

Great performances!\n\nActual Gameplay: Fun and Challenging\nThe game does a great job of easing you into the controls and makes sure to pop up a tutorial whenever a new gameplay element appears. As the game progresses the enemies get tougher and more numerous and the puzzles get more devious. If you enjoy puzzles, this game has oodles of them! The worst thing about this game i think (apart from the saw blade wall at the end *shudders*) is the fixed camera. It causes some awkwardness throughout the game. Other than that, I highly recommend this game. I just completed my second playthrough of it. I love this game and in my opinion it is worthy of the castlevania name.","December 1, 2014","true","26.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And English is not my main language, so bear with any mistakes I make. ^^\n\nThis game is pure awesomeness. Not even chocolate chip cookies were able to take me away from the pc while I was playing it... and that's a serious matter. Trust me.\n\nI've played other Castlevania titles and to be honest I feel that the aproach made in this game to the whole "evil monster slaying and save the world" is the most appropriate - a hack and slash style feels more right to the "evil monster slaying and save the world" thing than a platformer in which you turn to one side whip-whip-whip-whip, turn to the other whip-whip-whip-whip. Naturally, when the first Castlevania titles appeared, platforming and whip-whip was astonishing - it was another age :p - and I enjoyed all the Castlevania titles i played, but I feel that for the quest the main character has ahead of him an hack and slash style feels more adequate.\n\nMany people complain that this isn't like an old Castlevania. Of course not, it's a reboot - it's not meant to be like an old Castlevania. And for a reboot it is a good idea (if not mandatory) to try a different approach. And I believe it was amazingly well done.\n\nThe story is awesome (may take a few missions to understand what is going on, but I believe that was intended - it helps build intrigue), the soundtrack is awesome, the main character development is awesome (if you play the game and the dlc's you actually see the whole evolution the main character goes through, with a little surprise in the end... hehehehe), the gameplay is awesome - it has one small problem or other (to me, it was the time advanced moves take to work - certain moves take far too much time and the main character is defenseless while executing them, making those moves unviable in battle, in my opinion) but nothing to worry too much about; in fact, these details seem to have been corrected in the second game, from what I've read, though I haven't played it yet (BUT I WILL, MUAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!).\n\nRegarding the story: I actually am very gratefull to this reboot because, in my opinion, it helped create a whole, coherent story for the Castlevania universe - something the previous title's never cared much for, in my opinion. Every new title just felt like "oh, check it out, Dracula is back again! The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Well, let's kick his ♥♥♥... AGAIN."; this isn't the negative aspect - what's negative is that, in general, there isn't a coherent connection (story-wise) from one game to the other. An example: I played Order of Ecclesia, and in that game you don't play with a Belmont, since they had vanished. But 36 six years before the events in Aria of Sorrow - chronologically after the events of Order of Ecclesia - the Belmonts defeated Dracula permanently. ...where the hell were they at the time of Order of Ecclesia then?... It is stated that the villagers you find in OoE are descendants of the Belmonts, but that doesn't really convince me enough to believe that that was the reason why a Belmont showed up after. It doesn't feel right, at least to me. In Lords of Shadow the story is a whole, coherent block. You have the first game that shows the first Belmont and his quest, you have Mirror of Fate, that is good to make a connection (story-wise) to the second game, and finally you have the second game, which concludes the story. But it is a whole block, and it is coherent, which is something that the previous titles were not - they felt more like separate stories, vaguely related to each other. At least to me.\n\nIn short, this game is awesome. But all this is just my opinion, so...\n\nPeace!","July 8, 2014","true","266.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Just finished Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition and I must say "WOW". What an Awesome and brilliant game. This is one of the BEST Hack and Slash games that I have played. This is a very long game but it is every money for it. There are 14 very long chapters. 12 chapters in the actual main storyline and 2 extra chapters as a Resurrection – DLC.\n\nYou play as Gabriel and you follow his quest to revive his dead wife. As you progress throughout the games you will unlock new abilities and picking up new unique pieces of equipment but some of them come at high price.  There is also magical powers to use in combat and non combat situations. This can be upgraded as well during the game.  You will come across different monsters/creatures like trolls, ghouls, zombies, swordmaster, spiders and so on to Bosses and Titans. The Bosses and Titans are not very easy to kill and are very intense but once you figure out what to do, then it should be okay. There are also puzzles to solve in order to proceed which is very cool.\n\nOverall, I would rate this game 100 out of 10. Awesome and Brilliant game. Only if Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 was like this but it is not.\n\nSPOILERS here. If you ge stuck Youtube is your best friend sometimes for help.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reakor/recommended/234080/","Reakor","Reakor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reakor/","281 products in account","Finished the game and a part of its DLC's. Very mixed feelings for this game and let me explain why.\n\nAbout the plot, Lords of Shadow kind of reboots the lore i guess you could say. Theres practically no links between the old Belmonts, ( You control Gabriel Belmont). Our Belmont's quest is actually pretty simple, his waifu got murdered, so he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Afterwards we learn that some wierd magic caused the link to the heavens to get cut off so basically monsters and spirits invaded Transylvania, Europe. So Gabriel sets out on his quest to defeat the Lords of Shadows, who are very basic bosses, castlevania lore wise. Death, some queen and a werewolf. Not very important to the story. Thats about it. It also features an obvious plot twist.\n\nThe combat is probably the weakest part of the game. Its shallow. It doesnt allow for any combo creativity. Enemies take no hitstun and can constantly attack through your attacks. Fortunately the game features a cancelling mechanic so you can do frame perfect blocks and thats about it. Frame perfect blocks is basicly the "hardest" combat mechanic (and its very easy once you get used to it) that this game has to offer. Its got a few unlockable moves, very weak stuff, theres basically maybe 20 moves you can unlock, then theres some Dark and Light buffs you can use. Light gives you health regen and Dark gives you more moves and stronger attacks. Like i said i thought the combat is extremely shallow. I give it LITERALLY 3/10.\n\nThe soundtrack is kinda boring, very typical scores for such a game. battle-ish castle-ish kinda vibes. Very forgettable. Although i gotta admit that Gabriel does pretty funny sounds when he attacks. You can also very clearly hear how Gabriel's voice actor is some spanish guy they hired that slightly struggles in English. Don't get me wrong though it definitly has its charm.\n\nControls are pretty awkward, there's something inside my controller, it's hard to explain. You have to feel it, it just doesnt feel very "round" i guess you could say. It often feels like Gabriel's movement are "square grid" based. Don't know how they messed that up. Also there's alot of climbing you have to do all the time, that got pretty tiring after a while, he moves really slowly too.\n\nThere's too many stupid puzzles in the game, Sometimes they're really hard to figure out too, they take up whole chapters sometimes too and most of them are not very enjoyable to execute (they even give you the option to give you the puzzle answer right away, at the cost of the completion XP bonus). Most of the puzzles involve complicated maths or NASA tier scientists, i've spent maybe 30 minutes trying to solve some stupid puzzle. I got tired of them at the end i just started asking the game to give me the answer right away, i ain't got time for that.\n\nNow the best part of this Castlevania game is definitly the visuals. Stunning in 1080p and 60 fps. Port feels very optimized by the way. The game's art design is everything you'd expect from a Castlevania game, glorious victorian style castles, GREAT enemy design and presentation, they made very nice artworks for every enemy you encouter, some of them are breath-taking, very nice stuff. Very impressive details in the backgrounds, great visual effects. I got motivated to finish it just because of the great visuals in there. I really really loved them as a whole simply because i felt it really represented Castlevania well, it's everything i would expect from a 3D Castlevania game.\n\nThe level design is garbage, literally empty hallways at times. Obvious enemy spawn points,  tedious world mechanics (the hands in the swamp, that was awful). Alot of invisible walls, the game gives you a fake feeling of liberty but it really feels like an on-rail game, alot of times. I thought that kinda sucked too. The placement for items such as Upgrades or Text scrolls are very obvious and not very hard to find. There's a ton of upgrades to get though so i guess collecting them was kinda fun.\n\nI forgot to mention that even on Normal difficulty, the enemies will hit hard as hell. Better start learning how to do precise blocks as soon as possible or else its into the trash you'll go.\n\nSo it still does a good job at being a decent Castlevania game, but isnt anything fantastic. If you love the Castlevania franchise, then you will definitely enjoy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/234080/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","Lords of Shadow was to me a game made by people who seemed to have a good amount of care for the series but ultimately had too many badly executed ideas mixed in with inspired ones.\n\nPerformance an presentation :\nThe game actually ran more or less perfectly.  I had all settings on max on my 6850HD / 16gb / 3.2ghz * 6 system aside from AA on 8x instead of 16x.  The game maintained a steady 60fps even during most action scenes.  xbox360ce performed as expected and while controller binds can't be changed I felt like they all worked well.  I did not attempt to use KB+M controls.  Menus and saving and steam integration were pretty satisfactory (the game pauses when you open the steam overlay for instance) so it seems like the port was handled pretty well.\nThe environments of the game are really a mixed bag.  The opening third of the game is set in arbitrary country locales and ruins with vermin small and large, while the rest is very nicely designed and atmospheric.  Music is either generic gothic choir you've heard before, or occasionally very inspired remixes of classic CV songs with a completely different tone.  A browse of the concept art gallery shows a lot of amazingly imagined locales that don't always translate over well into a third-person action titles.  My take from this was like feeling the tantalizing cool breeze coming from somewhere in a stuffy room, refreshing and wonderful when you felt it but not lasting beyond brief moments or strong enough to make the complete package something special.\n\nStory :\nStory wise... its kind of hard to say.  The game's protagonist doesn't feel like he fits the story as narrated in the loading screens of every stage.  They say how tortured and tired and full of anger he is, but he just acts like a more toned-down stoic badass type stutting happily away in transitions and cinematics, barely showing the tortured soul he is supposed to be until the very end of the game.  He is toned-down from most stoic badasses in videogames though, and the lack of over-the-topness is appreciated,   The game's originating premise is actually genuinely interesting but then resolves in a much less epic or interesting conclusion, as gathering all the dark powers together doesn't make the protagonist any kind of interesting figure (for good or evil) but results in a last boss and villain who just happened to have orchestrated the whole thing but is more or less irrelevant to the story in any meaningful way.  The game starts our pretty badly with you fighting indigenous monsters and meeting throwaway characters in the opening third to being much more player-relevant with foes and faces in the middle third, then ending with a nicely atmospheric desolate finale chapter more devoid of life in the last third.  It makes the opening third of the game feel very throwaway and put there just to be gamey rather than planned.  The post-credits story cutscene feels like a typical movie sequel hook set farther in the future but leaves questions to be answered in the post-release DLC that ultimately feels like a cop-out rather than a meaningful progression from the game to its sequel hook.  Something that could have been solved had the original premise led to a more interesting conclusion than villain-out-of-nowhere.\n\nGameplay :\nThis is pretty much where the game doesn't shine.  The game doesn't really excel in any particular area and is bad enough in some to be bad.  Not atrocious, just bad.  Lets talk about a few.\n\nThe game holds your hand 95% of the time and then leaves you boggled for the other.  Every new area is camera-panned.  Ledges are highlighted with glows AND text telling you what to do in long text.    Enemy special attacks that allow for special contextual responses are zoomed, focused, and slow-mo'd... except when all of these aren't.  In those cases, you'll be left boggled by what exactly to do because the game wasn't designed in a way to SHOW, it was designed to TELL.  Hold R2 to grip!  Dodge that projectile!  But this one?  Nope you just get hit by the giant golem's hand that didn't really seem to touch you, and you fell off for some reason.  This is mitigated somewhat by gratuitous checkpoints, except at the end of the game where the game expects a sequence of actions performed across two paths with no checkpoint resets in between and doesn't inform you of the lost progress until you traverse one of the paths to find your progress wasn't kept.  The game isn't really hard because of this inconsistency, it just neither lets you feel clever or perceptive because it wasn't designed for you to think or try to solve it.  It was made to be spoonfed like applesauce, but then pours the applesauce on the table at a few points.\n\nCombat is very fluid but doesn't really reward or challenge the player too much except if you get hit.  The only way to heal is via hitting enemies while using a resource-limited super mode, by finding a healing shrine in the stage, or having it restored to 1/2 if you die and reload a checkpoint.  The only way to restore this resource is find a resource shrine or by hitting enemies without taking any damage yourself to build up a meter, much like in Devil May Cry games except this gives you Devil Trigger instead of points towards a reward at the end of a level.  The meter doesn't reward super mode unless it is completely full, and keeping it full is either completely easy or annoyingly difficult depending on the enemy.  Bosses?  Easy.  Groups of large mobs?  Not easy.  Small enemies?  OHKO them one by one with the grab attack, because its easier than fighting them normally and no small enemy is immune to the grab attack.\n\nBosses are of two kinds.  Multi-phase bosses with predictable patterns, and Shadow of the Colossus style bosses that are completely uninteresting to fight.  You can't restore health on these bosses except by game over, which leads to having to watch choreographed 'look out for this attack' slow mo moments or waiting for attacks to cycle until you can actually do anything sooner than if you were able to manage your health like in normal combat.  Platforming on these bosses is not interesting, and they aren't even real puzzle bosses like they can be in SotC.  There is no gimmick or thought or variation in how you have to defeat them.  Its a script you just learn and follow, and this isn't helped by the fact that the ledge platforming can be a modest amount unresponsive at times.  Only one of the three in the game is actually meaningful to the story purely in that it is a reference Death's skeletal monster forms in the rest of the series.  Developers need to learn why Shadow of the Colossus was fun and not just try to copy the game's scale with sequences like these that are in no way fun to play.\n\nThis is what I want to call a  'console-style game'.  The game is made for people who don't care to do much beyond pop the disc into the xbox and have the flashy cool gothic monster fighting show up on screen.  Irrelevant QTEs abound and show your character doing cool things rather than you doing them yourself.  Puzzles are all simple logic puzzles that don't require any thought and all of them give you the option to skip them.  Platforming and level progression are linear and there is no meaningful exploration, despite the illusion of it by divergent paths that converge again only a minute or so later in the stage.  Combat is quirky but more or less button mash friendly and half the enemy types are meaningless due to the grab move OHKO.  Constant checkpointing means you never get too stuck on any part of the game.  This is not to say that all of these are bad things, just that they contribute to the theme of modern console titles that don't often really give memorable or amazing experiences but thanks to a big budget have too much work put in them to be terrible.  It wasn't terrible for $5 or so I paid for it, but it wasn't really good either.","April 3, 2015","false","18.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The DLC additions included in this title are, however, not very good at all, and feel rushed and don't do a good job of tying the plotholes shut.  I feel sorry for people who paid for the DLC on consoles.  With any luck they'll retcon their decisions when the imminent sequel is published.\n\nGraphically, this game is drop-dead gorgeous, and breaks out of the claustrophobic issues that plagued the series' previous 3D forrays.  The scenery is very pretty.  The music is okay... the series has had much better works tied to it, generally from Michiru Yamane.  For the mood this game tries to convey, it works.  The occasional throwbacks to the classic themes are mildly offensive, however.\n\nMechanics-wise, Castlevania: LoS doesn't bring anything to the table you haven't seen done better elsewhere.  The platforming can be mildly to moderately infuriating, and the combat ranges from feeling good to having you bite your controller in frustration trying to grab a grenade from someone as required to progress instead of simply eviscerating them.  The navigation pointers are fairly insulting, and even if you disable hints, the game often displays them anyways.\n\nBut the storyline shines through, and has appeal whether you're versed in the Castlevania canon or not.  As a whole, the game holds itself together well enough to merit a playthrough if you enjoy hack 'n slashers --er, whipping 'n holy water lobbing, I guess.\n\nIf you aren't sure about it, I'd wait for a sale, but as a fan of the series, I was more than happy to drop the full $30 on it.  I owned this on the 360 and the PS3, and the PC version was the first one I managed to play through.  Playing it on PC, even with a 360 controller, makes all the difference in the world.

And I felt every last second of that.\nThere are games, that aren't really good but are still worth checking and spending time on to see all the good ideas, all the good things the game may have. And sometimes, even while knowing that overall the game is not good, you will enjoy a game like that. Lords of Shadow is not a game like that, simply because it gives *way* too little for what time and patience it asks in return.\nIt does have an interesting story, an interesting take on the famous series. It does look stylish and pretty, although artistically, not technologically (pretty low res textures and pre-renered movies, rather poor optimization, other small issues). But still - really pretty. It also has a *few* really cool fights, which are inventive, exciting and challenging enough, without feeling unfair or broken.\nSo, that're the good things. There are bad things, like overabundance of QTEs, with very outdated approach to the concept as well - they're used just for the sake of it, and in the unlikeliest moments. Like, say, opening some doors requires timed QTEs, not even God of War-like button mashing.\nYet those are also not *that* notable. And this is the main problem with the game - it's a bit of good, a bit of bad and about 80% of boredom. Majority of the game feels like padding, something inserted just for the sake of wasting more of the player's time. In fact, there's even a special enemy/creature in the game, who's sole purpose is to waste player's time and you meet that creature 4 times, even though you will be fed up with it the first time. There's almost never any payoff to anything. You might hear of a cool enemy/location several chapters of 3-5 levels before you finally get to it, and nothing really happens during those levels...\nAnd the ex-DLC levels, which give this edition "Ultimate" name, are absolutely horrible. Again, there are few nice ideas, but they're so not worth it. The story, which could've been a proper epilogue to the main story, setting up the sequel and ex-portable midquel, is a complete throwaway and degrades into farce in the last two levels, where Gabriel plays hide and seek with a powerful demon set on destroying the world.\nWith the same elements, a much MUCH better game could've been made. And, I'm sure, MercurySteam could've done that. Maybe, the sequel will be that much better game...\nP.S. It's worth noticing several visual similarities to a classic game called Blade of Darkness, which was developed by another spanish development company, which then dissolved and the majority of it's team created MercurySteam - the developers of this game.","January 12, 2014","false","19.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tankpig/recommended/234080/","tankpig","fart crap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tankpig/","444 products in account","First, I'll say I'm a rather big Castlevania fan. I'll go ahead and list the pros of this game:\n\nIt has a few nods here and there to the original games and their lore.\nIt's very visually and audibly appealing.\nThe combat, for the most part, is kind of fun.\nThe story isn't too bad, and the voice acting is surprisingly good as well.\nThe game has a great atmosphere.\n\nNow for the bad:\nThe 2nd biggest strike against this game, in my opinion, is the pacing. You'll progress a bit only to be stopped by a group of enemies. This gets more annoying as the game progresses, with the inclusion of more enemies and tougher enemies.\n\nSOME of the puzzles are tolerable. However, as the game goes on, you'll find they get more tedious and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The biggest puzzle I had an issue with is later on in the game, in the  Frankenstein lab  level. Here, there are two big problems. Firstly, you need to buy a special move with experience in order to solve a puzzle. While you'd definitely have the experience necessary for the move, the fact that the game expects you to do something that is considered optional in order to move on in the game is really counter-intuitive. Additionally, this move is a bit inaccurate and hard to control, leading to further aggravation solving a puzzle which by its nature is already rather aggravating.\n\nAnother thing about puzzles. Some of them are trial-and-error by nature. This alone is bad game design. It would be ok to have MAYBE one or two trial-and-error puzzles, but this game feels like it has too many of them. It ALMOST got it right, I will say that much, but it didn't get it right enough.\n\nWhile I mentioned that combat is fun, and it is, as you encounter more groups of obvious-filler enemies, you find that combat can be tedious and boring. It all boils down to mash the X and Y buttons. It's nice that the game gives you options in your combat with advanced moves, but it really tends to not make much of a difference. Going along with this, the shadow and light magic abilities you get don't tend to change up combat much, essentially making a gameplay mechanic useless.\n\nAnd the final, biggest strike against this game: "difficulty." Now I say that I haven't gotten a game over in this game sans one time. However, this game's idea of difficulty is to continually add fluff and padding with more enemies, more tedious puzzles, and the worst is when it combines these two. Often I found myself facing a puzzle and I just knew "Ugh, I'll have to face a group of enemies which will only hold off the oncoming aggravation."\n\nI really wanted to like this game, and for the most part I still do, however I think it needs a bit of a design touch-up. While I know games will lessen the hand-holding as you progress, which is natural for games to do, I think this game didn't hand-hold in the right places.\n\nOverall, I'd say play it and give it a shot, but I wouldn't pay 30 dollars for it. (At the time of writing, the game is priced at 29.99)","April 5, 2014","false","13.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chroniz/recommended/234080/","chroniz","chroniz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chroniz/","138 products in account","There is so much wasted potential in this game. The production values for this game are on the right track. Lords of Shadow both looks and sounds great, and it runs at 60fps perfectly fine. For some, the biggest issue is that the game doesn't have too much in common with the previous Castlevania titles and is only borrowing its gameplay elements from God of War, Prince of Persia (Sands of Time trilogy) and Shadow of the Colossus. I'm fine with, nothing wrong about loaning the best parts from the masters. However, the game's very tedious combat and repetive gameplay keeps me of enjoying the game.\n\nGabriel can improve his moveset with combos by buying them with experience points. It is just unfortunate that in actual combat, you can barely ever utilize most of the different moves properly. While you're performing in-air moves, you can be brought down instantly by critters that can only attack on the ground level. Even with strong attack moves and long attack sequences, your enemies may not falter at all, making you just vulnerable instead. There are also wide lashing moves that allow you to attack far-by enemies for crowd control, but as it barely staggers anyone, it won't find much use in the game. Rather than trying out different combos, the player usually ends up repeating a few staple attacks against majority of the enemies.\n\nSpeaking of combat, the game's control scheme could have used some streamlining. There are some very different moves that are used by just one key/button in the game. For example, the player uses L2 to block and dodge roll in the beginning. But soon enough, you'll find that you use the same button for certain attacks such as gauntlet mash and a quick dash move when you're using magic. All of this variety add needless complexity to the game that doesn't really improve it in the end.\n\nThese are just some of my complaints of the game. With some tweaking, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow would have been easily a great game, but these issues unfortunately make playing the game very tedious and unrewarding.","February 13, 2014","false","25.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Is it truly a Castlevania game? Debatable. From a pure gameplay standpoint, it's nothing special. It's difficult, but not notably so. Enemies are varied and fun to fight against. The game has lots of replay value, with secrets and challenges that range from "I got it by accident" to "tear your hair out while searching a million guides to try and get it".\n\nThis game really shines in the voice acting, visuals, and music. Not only does this game feature some really high-profile actors, but they give actual performances! No phoned-in line-readings that are all too common. Music is fantastic. The environments look great.\n\nAll in all, this might not hold up to classics like Symphony of the Night, but it's still a fantastic game in it's own right. If you go in trying to compare it to everything remotely like it, then yeah, it's not particularly interesting. But it has a certain unique charm, some combination of the classical aesthetic and modern gameplay/graphics that makes it unlike anything else I've seen.","February 15, 2015","true","108.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The Patrick Stewart narritive was the orginal selling point for me. When I started playing, it seemed REALLY hard (always start a game on medium). So, I turned down the settings to easy and just played it for the story. The game is built like a ARPG, for more than one play through. It's diversified for casual through hardcore gamers, there's a ton of moves you can do but you can make it through with just the base set, every stage has hidden items for explorers, and the voice actting is amazing so you really don't mind, still you can skip the cut scenes. This a game you can sit down and play for 8 hours straight, or you can casually just pick it up for 15 minuets a day. The konomi code doesn't seem to do anything, but you can just turn on the cheats if you really want to just listen to the story or get through the first playthough. This game is everything I could expect from a button que game, my only complaint is the fixed perspective cammera.

I bought it on sale but even sale price is too much for it. First off by all accounts it looked really good, big name voice actors, good graphics and lots of action.\nThis game is about a year old but it plays and feels like a much older game. It has lifted elements of games like God of war, Shadow of the colossus and Tomb raider but in the end it falls flat on its face trying to be all at once.\nThe gameplay is simple button bash car on rails, nothing new or exciting. The weapons feel underpowered and the mix of extra moves and magic are way too fussy imo. The fact that you cant control the camera is by far the biggest flaw with this game. Take into account that all the hidden stuff is always out of direct view and you cant use the camera to look for it. It gets real old real fast, it also makes the combat a joke as the camera auto corrects to fixed points as your trying to fight.\nAll in all this game is a mix and match of old dated game dynamics that should be left in the past. I can't recommend this game to anyone at any price.","April 20, 2014","false","5.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

I am not against a game that is linear, but this game is linear to the point of impotence.  It directs the flow of gameplay so closely that you don't even get control of the camera.  It gives you platforming puzzles, but you're not allowed to jump in any direction but forward.  Also, any sequence where you are given free reign in a level, it does nothing to direct you towards your objectives.  You feel as if you are acting in a film, but weren't given a script.  The combat system has some decent ideas, but it doesn't let you stretch your legs enough to make you feel accomplished.  If you're seriously interested in the story, just watch it on Youtube.

I really think that this reboot (officially an "alternate story telling") of the series was VERY well done as far as story line goes. Spot on in fact. The storyline and cutscenes is what really brought me into the game. Character design was really amazing. The art style was great and even had a bit more modern design to some of the beasts (Pan). Level design was amazing, stunning visuals (for what they could be seeing as this is a port from xbox, had they utilized PC graphics for what they really can do you would have had graphics that are untouchable, which is why PC is better in every way to console gaming but thats a whole different beast entirely). The musical scores in this game are absolutely amazing, very good use of strings and brass. The voice acting is also phenominal. This game gives you a wide variety of combos you can do, the trade off is that this was designed for controller play not keyboard and mouse. As such, they can only fit but so many commands on a tiny controller. Although I understand why they set it up like they did i really had a hard time with it through the entire game.\n\nMy biggest issues where with the camera angles, the combat system (not bad but could be improved), the exploration system, and the very linear arcade-like gameplay (though i know that the original Castlevania for the NES was linear in nature it still didn't have that arcade feel as this did considering the times we are in and what they COULD have done with it).\n\nFirstly the fixed camera. This really was a downer and the worst thing in the game. It was passable at times, others it would make you want to slap the developers for even thinking this was a good idea.\n\nSecondly the combat system. The only real problem i found was that the enemies half the time wouldn't flinch hardly at all when you lash them violently with your weapons. (Though they do flinch a little when you use your most powerful attacks). I did think that all the enemies could have reacted to your onslaught differently. Given that there are undead and zombies that would not be able to feel pain, I could see why they wouldn't flinch when hit. It was still enjoyable! Could definitely use improvement though.\n\nThirdly the exploration system. I believe that this was done in conjunction to the fixed camera. The fixed camera makes it hard to judge which direction you need to hold to get to ledges across the way. There really wasn't much exploration to do. most of the time they set you on one or perhaps two very linear paths. . Also the way you climb and movent on surfaces was very clunky at times. Such as, you are on a ledge and you want to jump to the edge behind you. Instead of facing your stick in the direction you want to jump you simply let go of the directions entirely and your character is automatically set as a linear action to jump toward that ledge when the jump action is performed. This really takes the sense of freedom out of the game making you feel like you don't have much a choice on where to go, you are more or less just on it for the ride then really choosing you own path.  (These gripes really are linked to the cameras and the arcade-like gameplay they used)\n\nLastly the arcade-like linear style gameplay. I believe the developers wanted to go with the original NES arcade-style linear gameplay  that given the times and technology was suitable. If that is what they wanted to portray then they succeeded. I think it was very lazy on their part to go with this style of gameplay given the technology and capabilities these days. It limits you to things like fixed camera angles and subpar systems as we have seen in games like star wars the force unleashed. I feel like if they had left out the level ending screen that tells you how many enemies you killed and what items you missed, it would have really given a story driven feel to the game rather then yay you beat a level HERE'S WHAT YOU WON! type feel. All in all i really felt like i was along for the ride rather than making choices, choosing my path, and exploring the areas to really feel emersed into the game. Personally I don't like games that have this feel, it's not my style of gaming.\n\nAll this into account the game is actually really really awesome if you can get passed all the things I brought up. The story line is really what hooked me enough to overlook all the cons. The music was really amazing and did a great job really giving you the feelings of the peril and sheer terror for the doom and hell spawn you are facing. The visuals (given that its a port) where beautiful, the lighting effects really impressed me. Voice acting was phenominal to the point where no one was really annoying (you know what im talking about when you really want to punch the character in the face and tell them to stop talking). I highly recommend treating this game as a reboot rather than part of the main Castlevania story.\n\n*all of this is based on my personal opinion so please keep that in mind*","June 4, 2014","true","41.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Combat system is primitive thats all, push X to win, i found much of combat upgrades useless. Levels are pretty short. Game has unnecessary features for corridor slasher. To be fair original NES Castlevanias was pretty much corridor, so someone might say "DUDE ITS BACK TO BASICS!" but no, in 2010-13 it looks not so well, it should be more like Darksiders or Dark Souls(actually Dark Souls gameplay type will be perfect for modern Castlevania). Stupid shadow of collosus boss battles(I just dont like it, deal with it). Also game has camera lock - awful. So If you are huge Castlevania fan like i am you can boldly skip this title, if you want some mid-level corridor slasher so you can buy it i guess. To be fair again, the music is neat, graphics not bad and views and designs are awesome.","August 29, 2013","false","19.0"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","13"

I, as a nintendo fan, hated when castlevania got effectively ousted from nintendo consoles. But its great to see the series stays strong as ever. I can say as many good things about the game as i want, but we'd be here all day.  The only bad part is the controls. They feel delayed, and kind of awkward at times. Almost like the people prgramming them got 95% of the way through and then said "F**k it, the games gonna be at least 60$ on release, and castlevania is an older franchise. lets just say we finished progamming the damned controls." But, If you have a wired xbox360 controller, the controlls are smooth and easy to handle. I'm also going to point out that the first boss is very easy to beat with a hit-and-run tactic, and, full judgeing my knowlege on the franchise, this probably goes for the other bosses as well.  I say its worth the buy because you get the base game and the DLC.","August 13, 2014","true","29.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The scenery/cinematography is gorgeous and the backdrops really make the world feel alive. The varied environments are easily the highlight of the game.\n\n+Certain levels have puzzles, it provides a nice change of pace, the puzzles can also be skipped at the cost of missing out on experience but the option exists for those that prefer more combat.\n\n+This game is brimming with content, 51 levels, 30 different types of enemies, 15 bosses, over 3 hours of cinematics. This game easily provides 20 hours or more of gameplay\n\n+ After completing a level a bonus objective (trial) is unlocked for that specific level i.e complete level in a certain amount of time, complete puzzle in a certain amount of moves etc. These are completely optional and provide an extra level of challenge. Most of them are fun to complete.\n\n+ The combat is similar to God of War with less refinement. You have a strong single attack and a weaker area of effect attack. Combining the two in different ways results in different combinations. You also have 4 different items at your disposal. The block and dodge button are mapped to the same button which is frustrating but doesn't take much practice to get use to. You also have light, dark and a combo meter. Using light magic heals you whenever you hit an enemy while dark magic increases your damage. If you fill your combo meter without getting hit enemies drop magic orbs after every hit to refill your magic. I like the system because it rewards you for playing well. There is a balance between all three systems and mastery of the combat system is rewarding. As you defeat enemies and progress in the game you acquire new items and experience allowing you to unlock more combos and moves. What really sells the combat for me is the whip has a great feel and weight to it.\n\n+ The boss battles are fantastic. Certain boss battles are heavily inspired from Shadow of the Colossus where you have to fight giant titans climbing on top of them finding their weak points. These boss battles are more platforming than fighting but taking one down feels just as satisfying. The other boss battles are smaller in scale and require memorizing enemy patterns to defeat them. After every battle you are rewarded with a cut scene of you gruesomely killing them in some horrific fashion.\n\n+ Great soundtrack\n\n\nThe Average:\n\n\nThe camera is fixed and changes as you progress through the level, sometimes the camera will make a sudden change causing you to be disoriented. Even in a linear level you can still get dioriented because the camera angle positions itself strangely.\n\nThe story is read to you by Patrick Stewart and can feel very heavy handed at times. You don't so much experience the story so much as it being read to you after every level.\n\nThe bad news is quick time events are in the game, the good news is it is handled much better than most games. Rather than having to press a specific button at exactly the right time, instead you are given an on screen indictor where you can press any button to progress. Timing is still involved but it is much easier to focus on the action and less stressful.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The levels although gorgeous to look at are also very restrictive in what you can do. The levels are designed in such a way to guide you to the next area/objective. There is no real sense of exploration which is a shame given how good the levels look. The game is pretty regimented in where you can jump, platforming feels automatic most of the time and you will run into invisible walls.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are a diehard Castlevania fan and have played most of the games, more than likely you will be disappointed with this game as it moves away from the traditional formula. This game borrows different design ideas heavily from different games but doesn't refine those elements nearly as well. This is a solid third person action adventure game and doesn't require any previous knowledge of Castlevania games.\n","March 1, 2015","true","32.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Is it truly a Castlevania game? Debatable. From a pure gameplay standpoint, it's nothing special. It's difficult, but not notably so. Enemies are varied and fun to fight against. The game has lots of replay value, with secrets and challenges that range from "I got it by accident" to "tear your hair out while searching a million guides to try and get it".\n\nThis game really shines in the voice acting, visuals, and music. Not only does this game feature some really high-profile actors, but they give actual performances! No phoned-in line-readings that are all too common. Music is fantastic. The environments look great.\n\nAll in all, this might not hold up to classics like Symphony of the Night, but it's still a fantastic game in it's own right. If you go in trying to compare it to everything remotely like it, then yeah, it's not particularly interesting.

The game is so appealing to the eye that it makes you feel that you want to be in that beautiful environment.\n\nMusic: Actually I didn't pay much attention to the music, or should I say I haven't noticed any great melodies as other Castlevania games always have.\n\nGameplay: Although slashing the enemies and doing all kinds of stuff feel satisfying, the game can be very frustrating. Most of your attacks will not even slow down your enemy, and you do need to block and doge a lot. The "synchronized block" requires trial and error, but unfortunately you do not have much hit points. Therefore there's not much chance for new players to try out and get used to the enemies' attack patterns. Also there are too many quick time events, which are boring and annoying, and most of them are unnecessary. Generally speaking, I do not think the gameplay meets my expectations. Oh yes, this game has a fixed camera, which I believe should not be found in an action game published just last year. I know it's a PC remake of an old game, but KONAMI should make more improvements.\n\nGenerally speaking, the game is quite enjoyable (after you get used to the combat), but it does need a lot of polish.

I played the original 2D classics and GBA/NDS sidescrollers and had a ton of fun with those games. I enjoyed the 3D Castlevania on the N64 and Lament of Innocence/Curse of Darkness on PS2. There hasn't been a stand out game that I absolutely detested and LoS is no exception.\n\nThis reboot series does a really great job in many regards. The graphics are superb and the combat is complex with combos/parries/dodging etc. I've already beaten the game when it first came out on PS3 and the transfer to PC is great. The game never has looked better nor has the game ran as smoothly at 60fps. You'll definitely need a controller though as only n00bz only play on keyboard. The soundtrack isn't as epic as the second game in this series and sometimes sounds a lot like God of War.\n\nSpeaking of God of War, this game borrows heavily from other franchises such as GoW, Shadow of the Colossus and Prince of Persia. This creates a sort of identity crisis for LoS and you'll either accept it or loathe the fact it tries to do so much variety without exceling in any particular area. The camera is probably one of the biggest complaints I read about since you don't have any control over it. It can be distracting but for the most part I don't find it a hindrince as the camera is pulled back far enough for you to see all the action. Attacks are properly tracked as well as enemy tracking when you perform moves.\n\nDepending on your playstyle you might clock around 15 hours of gameplay (not including DLCs) which is a meaty adventure for this type of game. I can't recommend this game enough. It's different in a good way and if you have an open mind you might just feel the same way.","May 5","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Which is a pity!\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics, atmosphere, challenging bosses, and fantastic voice acting.  It was awsome to hear the guy who plays Rumple from OUAT as Gabriel and Patrick Stewart as the main narrator, both did a great job.  This game gives that "Castlevania" feeling from those voices.  I also liked the fact, unlike other Cvania games:  this one is linear which gave me that old school nes feeling, not the metroid style SOTN.  I like both styles but it was nice to see this style again.  For a linear game, it's a good 20 hours.\n\nCons:\nThis game fails in many ways, which is why I do NOT recommend this title if it's more than $10 (I paid 10$ for it at the Summer Sale).  First off, just like with any other Cvania game I've played that was 3D, such as the one for the N64, you have NO control over camera angles!  I do not know how many games Konmai has to to make to get this right!  Sometimes the camera will do something stupid...sometimes you'll miss something...or even get hit by an enemy or boss.  The DLC content of the Forgotten One does this A LOT.\n\nControl:  Overall the control is "OK" Gabe is responsive pretty well except for quick relexes at times.  Control overall wasn't bad but it wasn't great either even with a 360 controller.\n\nGameplay:  The gameplay is SOILD and is fast pace and the boss battle's were awesome except for mr RANDOM FORGOTTEN ONE.   What kills the pace, is that this game has a lot of quick time events.  This game is loaded with lots of them!  And if you screw up a QTE you usually will take damage and have to whittle down the boss to the same point and try again.  Fortunealty, the game is forgiveable on check points and you don't have to entirely have to start over.  I do not mind QTE'S for boss fights or key events but this game really spammed the crap out of them.  One boss alone had over FIVE QTE in one sequence.  That's over kill.\n\nSpeaking over kill, this Cvania had a lot of puzzles....TOO many puzzles.  Most of the puzzles made sense and it was nice they offered the option to skip them (with no reward), but still just too many which killed the pace of this game.  Cvania isn't known for its puzzles.  It's known for its gothic and chain whipping action.\n\nLast but not least, Gabe has alot of moves but doesn't have many defensive moves to avoid attacks in the air or while he is in mid air.  Perhaps he should take a lesson from Dante from DMC?\n\nI plan to play the sequal when it drops down to a reasonable price.  Bottom line if you like castlevania and can deal with these issues then it's worth $30.  If these issues are over bearing, wait til it goes on sale, and you'll get your moneys worth!\n\n4.5/10","June 8, 2014","false","29.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

The fact that you have to use a macro or other weird tricks to defeat this boss by using PC hardware on a PC game is a no-go.

Not. One. Bit. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is the first 3D foray of the series in a long time and considering its track record in the third dimension you'd expect Konami to have learned their lesson. So they delegated the task to a Spanish studio called Mercury Steam. They produced a meaty and decent action game, but not a Castlevania game.\n\nCastlevania has a considerable pedigree when it comes to control, gameplay, action and pacing. You're a brutal vampire hunter out to slay the evil Dracula and his minions. You'd have to find your own way, overcomes dozens of different foes and occasionally master more than one character. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow has none of that. The game is strictly linear, the enemies are monotomous and sometimes overly cheap, and you're generally limited to just your one guy: Gabriel Belmont.\n\nGabriel is sent to save the world from entropy after the heads of your order messed up their retirement plan and now the world is going to hell. The plot and the characters are oddly similar to Darksiders 2, a game in itself that borrows heavily from other games. Castlevania's combat is borrowed largely from God of War and the platforming was taken straight from God of War as well with additional slowdown and tediousness. Gabriel controls like a tank and climbing along walls takes an eternity. And this game contains a lot of climbing. Adding everything up amounts to a very slow and cumbersome experience that is a carefully distilled insult to the pedigree of Castlevania. That is after you get through the tutorial, that insits on getting in your face at every blasted second. When you're finally let go, the game still posts prompts to let you know you're going the wrong or that you can do something here. It is just a beltsander that grinds away any sense of accomplishment you might have gotten.\n\nEverything about the game is just sluggish. Besides the movement, the story telling is ham-fisted and the voice acting if off key. Even the great Patrick Steward couldn't absolve this charade. It becomes downright painful when the game keeps sending you through maze after climb after puzzle just to keep you busy. At this point Kratos would have lost all his motivation, let alone Simon Belmont; who would have just turned around left when he saw that the eponymous castle doesn't appear until two-thirds in. Add to this a whole load of ripped-off content directly from Shadow of the Colossus and so many quickltime events it would make the guys at TellTale Games rethink their design.\n\nAll in all, I cannot in good conscience reccomend this game. It is terribly paced and the gameplay is slow and boring. The music is hardly inspiring to keep playing and the overall design is almost insulting to the player. It doesn't remotely do the name of Castlevania justice.","March 7, 2015","false","20.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/234080/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Castlevania Lords Of Shadow had a strong start with its beautiful graphics, tight controls and combat, massive bosses and the illusion of playing in open levels (and in a way, they are open). But after about 6 acts (6-7 hours into the game I think) it starts to become tiresome, because, except for some small puzzle solving, you'll be slaying hordes of enemies, God Of War style. And even the graphics, combat and impressive boss fights aren't enough to help this game then. By then you're about halfway through the game (it will take about 18 hours to complete if I had to take a guess) and you basically have been doing the same thing over and over again. And, unlike many other games that keep you occupied in a fun way to hide this fact, Lords Of Shadow just rubs it in your face. Playing this game feels like a chore and that's not what a game should be about. Now, I do have to say that Lords Of Shadow 2 looks truly impressive and I hope it will improve upon many of the flaws this game introduces. One I'm looking forward to is the fact that it's set in the modern world and another one is that it's all set in a big open world.\nIf you want to understand the story, play this one first.

Pretty much the same combat style and if you enjoy Devil May Cry, you may probably love this one too.\n\nBut in my opinion Darksiders (both 1 and 2) are better. I quite like this game at the beginning but soon got bored. First of all the loading chapter/episode makes the whole story isolated, I dislike the re-introducing of story every 30 mintes it's frustrating but I guess this is the way the story develops, since it does not have many CG tells you what's going on. Secondly the camera needs to be fixed. I have difficulty all the time finding necessary stuffs simply because within the fixed angel of camera, there is no way to see around clearly, so I ended up wandering just to find some dead body and wasted so many times- I mean where are the fun???\n\nBut there's also merits of the game. The graphic is good scenes are beautiful, and considering my process I would say this game could last 15+ hours for the main story which is good. You can actually mount your enemy and make use of them. The lycan helps you smash giant rocks and spiders help you make a net like build up a  bridge. Boss combat is tight regardless hints should be given. This game could have been a lot better.\n\nWell I would give this game a 6/10. worth a try, buy only for a discount price.","April 3, 2015","false","4.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The game itself has a decent story and various different characters, all of which feel fleshed out.\n\nUnfortunately, the game itself suffers from horrendous execution. It seems most of the budget was spent on graphics and art and the gameplay suffers accordingly. There are far too many cookie-cutter enemies, and the combat is unrefined. Weak enemies can ignore your CC skills and every hit you suffer staggers you and interrupts your combos and focus (a mechanic that allows you to regain magic through proficient combat), making the grab attack the most efficient way to kill hordes of throwaway baddies and reducing combat to a chore rather than entertainment. They're often thrown in as a way to keep the exploration exciting, which makes no sense, given that the world is very beautiful and combat takes away from the experience, rather than adding to it.\n\nMore competent enemies are still easily dealt with since the game is quite generous with items, which are very effective against them. Even in these fights, peon-class monsters are thrown in and all they do is slow the combat down as you grab/kill them individually.\n\nThe boss fights range from being excellent (Cornell, Brauner and Olrox come to mind) to breathtaking (but unfortunately easy i.e. the Titans) to downright stupid (and this one's more of a personal peeve). For instance, the Butcher boss is very easy to beat. Beat on him enough and he puts on a pot as a helmet. Just before fighting him, you rang a bell to summon Ghouls into a room. Since your attacks don't hurt him, you assume that you can use his helmet somehow to summon the Ghouls, resulting in a gruesome death for this ugly beast as his pets literally bite the hand that feeds them.\n\nNo such luck. You have to (get this) jump and attack. That's right. Jump and attack to smash the helmet.\n\nYOU HAVE A WHIP! IT LETS YOU CROSS MOUNTAINS! WHY THE HELL WOULD JUMPING MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE TO YOUR RANGE? /rant\n\nAnother (and the worst part, in my opinion) problem is that the programmers violated one of the Great Gaming Commandments.\n\nTHOU SHALT NEVER MAKE A 3D GAME WITH PLATFORMING AND A FIXED CAMERA.\n\nYeah. I shouldn't have to explain this, but I will.\n\nThe game has many parts where you have to climb stuff. And it doesn't let you look around. For the most part, it's fine but good luck beating the game without screwing up your double jumps.\n\nThe icing on the mechanic cake is the fact that the camera/controls don't always line up, resulting in controls and directions being swapped for the sake of a cinematic view. It is infuriating to platform when up suddenly becomes right because OOOOOHHHH LOOK AT HOW ARTSY THIS IS! LOOK HOW EPIC IT IS! WHY DID YOU FALL?. Once again, the bad mechanics take away from the atmosphere and instead of being enraptured, you're left wondering when it ends. A crime against the art department, since they did their job fantastically.\n\nFinally, there are a multitude of puzzles, which also allow you to forgo the reward in exchange for the answer. Clearly this was added with consoles in mind, since PC gamers can simply shift-tab and search the answer. Even so, the puzzles aren't too complex, and actually add to the game since there's no bad programming to get in the way. It's just you, the puzzle and your brain.\n\nSo while this game is beautiful and atmospheric, I cannot recommend it since it forgets that it's a game. Gameplay/game mechanics are vastly more important than story and art. If I wanted to watch something with great graphics and music, I'd watch a movie or listen to my favorite bands. I buy games to play a GAME, not an interactive movie.\n\nTL:DR Nice to look at, rots you from the inside like your ex.","May 7, 2015","false","14.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Pros?\n\nDecent voice acting.  Belmont was nice to listen to, and Patrick Stewart did a passable job.  The graphics are pretty enough, if you care about that sort of thing.  The sheer number of combat options even early was daunting, but sure to be a bonus for them that like it.  The storyline seemed like it was going to be interesting.  Really, this game would have been a great visual novel.\n\nSadly, that's about it.  None of the pros were exquisite or amazing, not enough to keep me slogging through.\n\nCons.\n\nGood lord, the hand holding.  I've never felt so babied since I was an actual literal child.  I kept waiting for the game to just fire my controller out of the jack and start playing itself.  The tooltips and popups are just so eager to help out that they seriously overstay their welcome.\n\nCombat.  It falls into a category I really hate, which is 'fluid-ish'.  Sure you've got a bevy of crazy combat moves, but you're never going to have any time to pull any of the cool stuff off before you get your lights punched out.  Dodging was pretty useful, but blocking meant stopping everything and standing totally still or Belmont wouldn't actually block until after you got socked in the jaw.  You can't make a combo heavy game and then make all the cool stuff either take forever to pull off or tie it into standing still for a bit.\n\nWhile I'm on combat, does every boss have to be a big set-piece half-battle half-puzzle thing?  I've got a bag of cool tricks but when it comes time to beat down something awesome it's all climbing and button mashing?\n\nRelated to that, quick time events?  Why bother?  Just show me a video of me doing something awesome, because I can tell you, the third time I have to repeat a boss fight because I missed a click is decidedly not awesome.  You clearly want to be a movie, so just go ahead and be a movie.\n\nThis game is linear.  Crazy linear.  The only reason to go off the beaten path is to find the gem or item hidden 3 steps down that path.  This is supposed to be Castlevania, I should be able to run around and explore willy nilly.  This game didn't even look explore up in the dictionary before running roughshod over its corpse.\n\nI appreciate the desire to implement the "Go back to old areas to find power ups" thing, because that's totally Castlevania.  The wrong way to do that would be to chop every area up into its own chapter, forcing you to pick and choose which chapter you want to repeat in the hopes you finally have the powerset needed to access the items you missed (and know you missed because the game helpfully tells you everything you missed in every chapter).  Returning to an area should be a choice, and should feel organic.  I should be back there because being back there makes sense, not because I'm gruellingly farming powerups.\n\nPost level trials.  I get it, trials are nice.  But hey, if I complete the trial the first time through the level, credit me?  Repeating a level just to do the exact same thing I literally just did is stupid.\n\nThere's probably more, but at this point I'm just beating a dead horse.  This game needed to be more like Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and less like Final Fantasy ♥♥♥♥ing 13.\n\n","October 8, 2014","false","6.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

They've generally had a perfect blend of skill, action and adventure elements. This game, however, completely tosses any semblence of balance out of the window in favour of going all-out action. Whcih isn't a bad thing as long as you get the action part down right. Which they didn't.\n\nThe enemies are solely designed to be annoying little obstacles (And annoying they can be) in your path and the bosses are designed purely to frustrate. The witch in the tower and her little bird minions has got to be the single most infuriating section of gaming I've ever played. Little niggles like this don't make games fun to play, they make them annoying! Generally the only way you'll get hurt is through your combos and given the heavy emphasis the combat style places on them it bascially re-inforces a major flaw in the game and rams it down your throat every single battle.\n\nOne of the things this game runs heavily for too is a sense of epic scale; huge bosses, vast worlds and the like. Unfortunately you won't be seeing any of them thanks to the camera angles which seem placed in such a way so as to obscure as much as possible of what it is you're focused on.\n\nSo much of this game could have been brilliant and with it's pedigree it was a game that was actually harder to screw up than to get right. But they managed it. And then some. It's rare for a game to make me, not only rage-quit it but to rage-uninstall the damn thing.\n\nIf your absolutely hell-bent on punishing yourself (or another) than please wait until a steam sale and pick this crap up for less than pocket change, other than that, I can't recommend you avoid this derivative, flashy, hollow trash enough......","September 28, 2014","false","11.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The story is bland and unoriginal, except for a few interesting concepts, which despite beign rather promising, are newer truly given a real look at during the story. Most of the personalities of the characters feel like they were added into the game at the very last minute.\n\nThe gameplay is "ok" in and of it itself, just rather unoriginal and repetitive. The thing that ruins the gameplay for me though, is the cinematic camera. All of the camera angles are design to be good looking, rather than to provide the best possible point of view for gameplay. The problem with this is that very often enemies will be off screen, where you can't see them, and then suddenly attack at you, without giving the player a proper chance to react. Also a lot of the enemies often sorta gang up on you, and will just knock you to the ground and hit you again, before you can get up and do anything. Stuff like this just makes the game feel tedious and cheap.\n\nAs I mentioned in the beginnig, the art design is really good and the game looks beatifull in a lot of scenes, but in my opinnion, no amount of pleasing aesthetics can salvage  badly designed gameplay.\nAlso inorder to look at the concept art for the game, you have to collect experience points to buy them. This is acceptable in itself, but if you buy the art once it doesn't seem to stay accessable, meaning that you are going to have to buy it again. I'm only mentioning this, because in my oppinion the art was the best part of the game, so why not just let me enjoy it without the hassle?\n\nOh, I would also like to mention that this game makes a "hilarious" reference to the 'the cake is lie' meme, even though there is nothing in that specific scene that would be in any way related to cakes or portals.

I forced myself through the first of those, started in on the second and decided that the game was not worth my time.\n\nWhat I experienced in the first chapter was the laziest possible recapitulation of a Hideki Kamiya-style brawler, complete with boss/level designs cribbed at total random from classic, non-Castlevania adventure/beat-em-up games. In terms of plot, the whole leaky boat is held together by a slap-happy, Epic Fantasy Mad Libs of one-dimensional characters, plowing through an plot that, even for a franchise game, makes the word "idiotic" seem either charitable or grossly insufficient, depending on how much warmed-over Judeo-Christian fan fiction is being forced through the pipe at the time.\n\nThe first bits of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow's second chapter promised no major changes to that formula, so I decided to walk away. A number of other Steam reviewers point that out as a common mistake and, acknowledging the possibility that I may have made that common mistake (i.e. that there may, in fact, be a great game hidden somewhere deep within in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow), I feel perfectly comfortable walking away after only a few wasted hours, based on the first chapter.\n\n(Also, as a bit of a post-script, I will say that if you're a Castlevania fan, you already know this, but I feel compelled to write it here anyway: the damage that Koji Igarashi did to this once-great 8-bit/16-bit franchise over however-many successive generations of his erotic kawaii "Metroid-vania" drop farming games will obviously take generations to be undone, as the corporate rights-holders struggle to unravel the mystery of why the franchise no longer performs as it once did.

It has a mildly interesting story told by Patrick Stewart, which is neat and the combat is fun (seems to be directly stolen from Devil May Cry, or at best 'inspired' by God of War). What's the problem then? For starters? Fixed camera angles... That was pretty much abolished from video games about a decade ago due to it being the worst possible control scheme but Castlevania has seen fit to bring it back. Second, repetitive. Combat is fun... The first 50x times you do it, but you have done it 200x by about 4 hours into the game and it has lost all of it's luster. Also, it is insultingly easy, even on the hardest settings. I am not the kind of guy to complain about stuff being too easy, usually. I think if it is fun, it doesn't matter. This is so easy, it loses fun factor. Also, it is very linear. Finally, too much 'story', not enough gameplay. Every level is short and has 10x cutscenes in it, then we listen to Picard narate for another 3-5 mins before the next level. If the story was compelling enough that wouldn't matter, but it isn't a hollywood movie in story quality so they could have made up for that in gameplay or involving the player in the story more. I should add that this really isn't designed for people who are big fans of old school Castlevania games. Not even sure why they bothered to call it that. It is a generic demon slaughter action game where they name stuff related to Castlevania, if the main char's last name wasn't Belmont, no one would have noticed. Also, it being designed in short levels rather then one sprawling map feels very not-Castlevania. Pretty mild critism though.\n\nAgain, the game isn't terrible. I might give it a 7/10, if I was feeling generous. If it was free to play it would be like a 9/10, but as for spending money... I wouldn't bother spending money on it unless you really have nothing else to play and don't care about the cost.","January 2","false","2.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The new 3D Castlevania games I have always skipped thinking that they'd be not as good as the old 2D times. With this one being my 1st 3D Castlevania, I have to agree with my thoughts - they 3D Castlevania really is no good game.\n\nOkay, sound, animations and graphics are really excellently done. But when I look at the rest of the game I only can say that they've made a rush job.\n\nJust look at the controls. You MUST use a X-BOX controller because the controls with mouse & keyboard are simply unplayable. And I am no controller player.\n\nThen the 'manual'. Well, that's lacking big-time. Finishing off a monster, press R1 the game tells me. And next..? Not a single hint on what to do >:( And it's very frustrating to have a boss monster at it's last health and not knowing how to finish it off, OR when I finally find out, just be that split-second too late to press that one (which one?) button.","March 27, 2014","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I had read that the game was pretty long and now I know why. Knowledge I could have lived without.\n\nBest thing about this game was Patrick Stuart's voice over.

It's a hack and slash that wants to be like Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden. Not only that, it does a better job of being Pan's Labyrinth meets God of War/Prince of Persia rather than having much to do with Castlevania. The goblins and werewolves are the most generic looking I've seen in a while, and while some of the art/cinematography look really nice, the combat/bosses/environmental interaction/orchestral soundtrack are all so textbook and "been there; done that". It's barely anything like the Retrovanias pre-1997, and it's barely anything like the Metroidvanias from SotN onwards. It's definitely more like the 3D Castlevanias on N64 and PS2, and is basically as good as Lament of Innocence, except that game at least had Yamane as the composer.","May 10","false","2.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackxblack/recommended/234080/","jackxblack","JackxBlack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackxblack/","149 products in account","TL;DR : Do I recommend this game or not? Well, both. I'll keep it at No though, simply because it didn't encourage me to play the sequel. This is the problematic part with Steam Reviews (or yes/no opinions of a medium in general). 5/10 - a God of War wannabe that's unnecessarily stretched out, has shallow gameplay and leaves with one question: What?\n\nLet's be honest. It's a slasher (or at least how I call those games), God of War/Devil May Cry type of game. Story doesn't matter, it's all about putting great combos, keeping the score high and taking no damage by doing flashy plays. The problem with it it only does one half of it well - the player mechanics - and it doesn't do it perfectly neither. The base attacks feel smooth, very similar to those of God of War. What it did better, was having more combos that are actually usefull in anyway. What it didn't do good enough, compared to let's say latest Devil May Cry, was combos.\n\nWait what?\n\nThe problem with this combo system is that you use them just for the sake of using them. Thank lord they work and are effective, in contrary to GoW where you just keep mashing SQUARE because everything else sucks, but those combos are still seperate entities - you can't combine them together to create, if you are good enough, an infinite chain of different attacks fitting the opponent you're facing to prevent any damage from being taken while devastating everyone around. Here you perform one combo, have it's effect, proceed to the other one, have a different effect. No connection or transition at all. It's not bad, but it's far from perfect. It can be fun, but it could be much more fun.\n\nSo that's OK-ish. There are some good parts of the gameplay. I was honestly impressed by the quality of animations. They were very detailed and smooth. Also all the supernatural monsters felt very natural, so that's a big plus. This was even better in the cutscenes - big shoutout to their animation/cinematic team, great job. Also, some of the fights felt reeeeeaaaaly epic. There is a couple of fights with enourmous enemies, that even though are one big quick time events, felt glorious and epic.\n\nGoing back to combat though - the second part it, that's unfortunately the bad part, are opponents (except of the giants mentioned before). They are shallow and annoying and most of them is just a filler. They have very little depth, to most counterplay is the same, there is nothing that you would not expect. It goes sadly for both generic mobs and bosses - let's say one of the major bosses could be simplified to counter > 3 attacks > counter > 3 attacks > dodge > 3 attacks. Repeat n times. There were also generic monsters introduced in the final, let's say hub, of the game, that were just walking in your direction just to be mowed with area attacks. They did NOTHING. Very disappointing.\n\nThere's one more thing that absolutely NEEDS to be mentioned, when talking about Castlevania's gameplay - static camera. This is one of those games where camera has a fixed angle and sometimes slightly follow player's movement. Why on earth someone ever though that was a good idea?! And why on earth someone executed this so badly?! In this game, there were multiple round arenas, with camera placed at the "bottom" part of it and following player's movement upward. That means, that if you are pushed, or just manouver to the furthest part of it, YOU CAN'T SEE ♥♥♥♥. This is extremely frustrating. It also doesn't help that transition from one camera placement to the other is always confusing - do I keep the same direction on the stick for my character to move forward, or do I change it? Why the ♥♥♥♥ does it change when I'm enterring a narrow ledge and need to be precise with my movement? There were also locations, that were split into seperate paths creating a loop. You could choose if you want to go left or right. Both paths were meeting at their end, but also you needed to cover them both, overall, to let's say gather both keys. That often led to a situation where you follow one path comfortably just to cover the other by RUNNING INTO THE CAMERA, NOT SEEING ANYTHING IN FRONT OF THE CHARACTER. WHAT. THE. HELL. Many times camera was the reason I was about to quit the game. It's THAT bad.\n\nThere's also another part of gameplay, that's simply insignificant - the exploration/climbing parts. Basically, it's just a way to prolong the game and show you some views. I'm not going to talk about it much since there's nothing to talk about - it cannot be failed, there's nothing creative about it, it just is. One thing I'm going to say is that it's very inconsistent which can be frustrating - there are some ledges that you can jump over, and there are some that you can't. So you can sometimes create a shortcut and jump to the lower level of the location, but sometimes you can't. Similarly you sometimes cannot fall into abyss, because an invisible wall protects you, but sometimes you can.\n\nBut what is the game actually about, what about the world it is in? Well, it does look good. Even after a couple of years, the game looks pretty good (in 2K and max settings) for it's age. It also runs well - I had no technical issues and kept stable 144FPS, without a single drop (not counting prerendered videos). The story, however... I don't know. Is it even there? One could say it's missing such key elements, that it cannot be called a story. There's no introduction to the lore, to the protagonist, what the mission is, there's no conclusion neither. You are thrown into an arena for some riddiculus reason that you do not fully understand and you are told: "Kill monsters! There are also some Lords of Shadows, somewhere.". The main character is as much developed as a plank in a fence and carries just as much emotions. It's actually funny that they tried to develop Gabriel (that's his name) during LOADING SCREEN TEXT. So you find out that your character is troubled, or mad, or depressed, by listening to some dude reading loading screen fluff, not by the character's actions, expression or speech. Very poor, totally not bought. The story also concludes (no spoilers, don't worry) in an absolutely riddiculus way. The "twist" that's at the end is completely absurd even though it was teased, and it's also followed by another "twist" right after, during the same cutscene, that's even worse. At that point you basically lose all hope and play the game to be over with it. Doesn't matter what my motivations are, I'll just kill the dude and hope that's it. But wait! It's NOT!\n\nI'm not going to say what's happening, but if you play this game, and if by the final boss you think the story cannot get any worse, you are wrong my friend.\n","May 10","false","22.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The boss fights are irritating - you must constanly climb something and guess which key should be pressed to jump onto the next part of the boss or from where should you jump to reach it. All while the boss swats you down just to start the whole boring climb sequence anew. Add to that a forced perspective that often leaves you guessing where are you actually running or what wall or stone you are stuck at and boss fights become really anoying. Generally this game is an exercise in irritation - you see beutifull environments, great music, interesting story and you want to see what is next but the annoying combat mechanics just will not allow you to.

The boss fights are irritating - you must constanly climb something and guess which key should be pressed to jump onto the next part of the boss or from where should you jump to reach it. All while the boss swats you down just to start the whole boring climb sequence anew. Add to that a forced perspective that often leaves you guessing where are you actually running or what wall or stone you are stuck at and boss fights become really anoying. Generally this game is an exercise in irritation - you see beutifull environments, great music, interesting story and you want to see what is next but the annoying combat mechanics just will not allow you to. Unless you are ready to invest a heap of time memorising boss climb sequences and timings of enemy attack algorithms.","January 7, 2014","false","5.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The gameplay itself is unintuitive, and feels like a slower, less fluid version of every other GOW clone. The bland enemies' untelegraphed attacks with the emotionless character's clunky and delayed blocking and evading was frustrating.

At the moment, I would best describe the gameplay as a combination of linear railroading and pixel-♥♥♥♥♥ing.  The game feels the obligation to prompt the player with tips and instructions frequently, such as pressing or holding the right trigger button to activate what I would call "interactive story element manipulation", and then leaves you hanging in almost, but not all, situations without either informing you what to do once you've hit or held the right trigger, or even so much as telling you there is something else you are supposed to be doing. If this was consistent, it may not have been an issue.  It could be assumed that such an action was the execution of a new element of interaction or gameplay.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Just often enough to make sure that you have hopes of it each time, the game will give you another instruction on how to proceed.  This leaves you waiting each time there is a new form of interaction for an instruction just long enough that in each of the 85% of cases where there is no further instruction coming to punish you severely for your inaction.\n\nIf there was  a return policy on steam for games with limited time committed to them, then I would return it this moment, but as such is not the case, I am still not sure that I will continue playing this game in the future.  A shame, for a series with such a great pedagree and an amazing voice cast to leave me disappointed and frustrated after playing.","January 5, 2014","false","7.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The storyline seems like it was put together on a drunk night and weed was involed.  The diaglog makes no sense and every cliche was used.  You never really get stronger, but everything else does.  The game tries to slow you down with meaningless puzzles and deaths.  Why is there so much jumping when you can't control the point of view.  There is no minimap not that you need one the stages are so short it is funny.  If you are going to play a Castlevania game: play the DS ones because this one shouldn't be consider a castlevania game.  It should be consider we use the weapon from castlevania and we are gonna to call it that.  This game is a great lesson for future game designers on what to not do, so I guess that is a plus.\n\nPlease do not play this game for fun... play it as a study in bad video game design.","January 2, 2014","false","24.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Galrath/recommended/234080/","Galrath","Pantheon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Galrath/","942 products in account","I'm not that much of a Castlevania buff. I've played some games and enjoyed them and I do like God of War and Devil May Cry, so I thought this one would do quite well.\nTried the demo, found it a bit underwhelming and thought I'll get the game on a sale some day...and so I did, but the feeling from the demo continued...\n\nThe levels are extremely linear. You can find some (more or less) hidden paths, but usually it's a one-way street with glowing indicators on what to do where. The game really likes to tell you what to do.\n\nThe fighting feels fine and is fun, especially if you manage to get the block right. It's pretty much God of War- or Devil May Cry-esque, which isn't a bad thing, if you like that kind of fighting, but it doesn't feel as good as in the aforementioned games.\nAlso QTEs. Not that much, usually as some sort of "cinematic finisher", which is fine, but gets old rather fast.\nFrom time to time we also have to tame some big beasts to be able to continue and those big beasts always spawn exactly where you need them. Mess it up? The next one spawns. Mess that up, too? The next one spawns. And that continues for all eternity until you manage to ride the thing and destroy the obstacle in your way and then you just strangle it.\nI liked riding and controlling those monsters, but they're nothing more than some simple tools with a simple purpose: destroy obstacle and die.\nAnd the boss fights! The first one is a titan, half-stuck in ice. What do you do to destroy him? Hit him repeatedly until it dies? No, you climb it, reach a nice glowing weak point and hit it, then venture to the next one and so on. And the boss is too dumb to defend himself. You're crawling up one of his arms and instead of hitting you with his other hand...he shakes his arm, trying to shake you off. It does make sense from a gameplay perspective, but I still found it quite silly.\nThen we have the next boss: another titan! That one is allowed to walk though, which he doesn't do much. It just stands around, stomps with one foot and tries to throw a boulder at you, which you have to hurl back to...be able to climb the titan and destroy his glowing weak points. It's basically the same fight again.\nIs that supposed to be fun? I can't comment on the other boss fights, so we might have some ACTUAL fighting to do, but making the first two major boss fights basically the same exact tedious chore isn't a good decision in my opinion.\n\nLet's mention the camera. You have no control over it. Not even a bit. Which you also have on God of War and DMC (I think), but it's still annoying, especially if you're fighting stuff outside the screen. It also hinders you to be able to enjoy the nice looking levels, because the game tells you where to look.\nI don't mind fixed perspectives in horror games, where it adds to the atmosphere, but when you're fighting hordes of monsters I'd like to actually see them.\n\nTraversing the levels is also nothing too fancy. There is some platforming involved, but most of the time you're climbing along ledges and swing around with your cool whip. Again and again.\nYour character also seems to die rather easy from falling. "You're not supposed to drop down from THERE, now you will die from a 5m fall!" And a bit farther you can drop down without suddenly dying...\nYou don't die from the impact, btw, but from the actual fall, while in mid-air.\n\nCan't comment much on the story. So far it looks like a revenge story with a bit of saving the world.\nThe voice acting is ok. Patrick Stewart lends his voice to one of the characters and while I do like his voice, I find it to be not fitting, out of place.\n\nI've tried to like it. I've started playing, stopped, played through Dark Souls 2 AND Watch_Dogs and thought I'd give it another go. I did and I still couldn't enjoy myself playing it and stopped for good this time. Maybe.\n\nIf you're looking for a Castlevania: this isn't really one. But if you're looking for something more like God of War or Devil May Cry, then you might enjoy it, even though I don't.","June 13, 2014","false","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Let me explain: each playable level/board you encounter will be magnificently designed, visually, that is. You, however, will only be able to interact with a very small range of the area, the remaining area (which will be most of it) will be simply 'prop', liken to theatre.

Granted, there's less allowance for exploration and much more focus on combat and action, but if you're a fan of God of War, then this is THE game for you. There's about 40-55 hours of gameplay on the first run of the game, depending on how pedantic you are about finding all the collectibles that can possibly be found on your  first  run of the game, and yes, this means a MINIMUM of two runs if you want to achieve full completion of any of the levels, given that upgrading your Combat Cross allows you to access new areas of old levels, each level's 'trial' is only unlocked after you beat the level after the first time and the highest difficulty mode is only accessible after you beat the game.\n\nBuuuuuuut to save myself the trouble of writing a full spoiler-free review in paragraph form and to save readers the trouble of reading a full review in paragraph form, here you go:\n\nTL;DR Pros:\nBeautiful graphics and artwork\nVaried combat style, plenty of combos to learn (have fun trying to remember them all and accidentally using the wrong one because you pressed a random button one too many times). You can mash buttons if you want but the game actively encourages you to vary your attacks and combo use, and even if you button mash, the light and shadow magic systems add a nice new layer to the combat anyway\nTwists in the story (some were, imo, obvious but some weren't, and those that weren't are the ones I'm focusing on here)\nLevel design was generally really complex and engaging\nCharacter development is highly interesting and there will be feels\nLarge variety of enemies to always keep you on your toes\n110% completion rate available and plenty of collectible items and things to do to entertain completionists and perfectionists for hours (minimum of two runs to get 110% completion on the game, people!)\nPuzzles are actually challenging if you're trying to complete the trials ('solve this puzzle in a certain number of moves' type stuff)\nThe controls were easy and logical (on a ontroller anyway, I use an Xbox controller) and my inner neat freak (who doesn't mainfest externally very often) was pleased\nTL;DR Cons:\nIf you're not a completionist, then you'll be missing a lot of  weapon upgrades and such if you don't go back to replay levels, and most non-completionists I know aren't big on replaying levels they've already beaten\nQuite a few of the bosses in this game are heavily inspired by other games' bosses, so don't expect the most original boss fights.

Granted, there's less allowance for exploration and much more focus on combat and action, but if you're a fan of God of War, then this is THE game for you. There's about 40-55 hours of gameplay on the first run of the game, depending on how pedantic you are about finding all the collectibles that can possibly be found on your  first  run of the game, and yes, this means a MINIMUM of two runs if you want to achieve full completion of any of the levels, given that upgrading your Combat Cross allows you to access new areas of old levels, each level's 'trial' is only unlocked after you beat the level after the first time and the highest difficulty mode is only accessible after you beat the game.\n\nBuuuuuuut to save myself the trouble of writing a full spoiler-free review in paragraph form and to save readers the trouble of reading a full review in paragraph form, here you go:\n\nTL;DR Pros:\nBeautiful graphics and artwork\nVaried combat style, plenty of combos to learn (have fun trying to remember them all and accidentally using the wrong one because you pressed a random button one too many times). You can mash buttons if you want but the game actively encourages you to vary your attacks and combo use, and even if you button mash, the light and shadow magic systems add a nice new layer to the combat anyway\nTwists in the story (some were, imo, obvious but some weren't, and those that weren't are the ones I'm focusing on here)\nLevel design was generally really complex and engaging\nCharacter development is highly interesting and there will be feels\nLarge variety of enemies to always keep you on your toes\n110% completion rate available and plenty of collectible items and things to do to entertain completionists and perfectionists for hours (minimum of two runs to get 110% completion on the game, people!)\nPuzzles are actually challenging if you're trying to complete the trials ('solve this puzzle in a certain number of moves' type stuff)\nThe controls were easy and logical (on a ontroller anyway, I use an Xbox controller) and my inner neat freak (who doesn't mainfest externally very often) was pleased\nTL;DR Cons:\nIf you're not a completionist, then you'll be missing a lot of  weapon upgrades and such if you don't go back to replay levels, and most non-completionists I know aren't big on replaying levels they've already beaten\nQuite a few of the bosses in this game are heavily inspired by other games' bosses, so don't expect the most original boss fights. Additionally, some of them were very repetitive, though some I found very entertaining, albeit difficult\nThe fixed camera angles were annoying and I personally hated that\nSome of the trials in this game are SMEGGING IMPOSSIBLE.

The achievement carries over through the DLC, which is a problem you'll see in a second. I'm going to break this review down into story, gameplay, art/graphics, and DLC. Let's get started.\n\nThe story is average, nothing as bad as Metal Gear Rising. The dialog isn't like listening to a dying child. This is more obvious later on in the game because there's M. Night Shyamalan twist at the VERY end for the ending boss and it is terrible. It literally throws a twist that isn't even neccessary at the player that only complicate the story. Yeah, don't expect a masterpiece.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty okay. There's a dodge system and block system. The enemies are varied and fun to kill. The puzzles are actually PUZZLES, something that many games forget to do. Plus, the bosses are really good. It's your standard hack 'n' slash game with puzzles. BUT!!! There's a fixed camera. This is probably the biggest issue with the game because I've had a few situations where i was attacked by something that was off camera. Not TOO much though, but keep reading.\n\nWHen it comes to the art and level design, this game gets a A+. Everything about the world is amazing to the eyes and every enemy looks like care and time was put into it. Hell, the necromancer area looks like a Zdzislaw Beksinski painting! But alas... Here comes the big dissapointment.\n\nSort of like Metal Gear Rising, if you just beat the game you try out the DLC. Now, since this is the PC version, there was no wait between the DLC and the actual game, so you jump right in and discover it is horrifyingly bad. The two DLCs that come with Lords of Shadow aren't even worth buying because they end as they start. Sorry, I mean the first ends as it starts because the second DLC is ♥♥♥♥ing impossible. It throws a group of enemies at you that are frustratingly difficult to fight because the game didn't give you any healing items or relic power. Remember that fixed camera angle? The issue is ten fold for the second DLC. And when you finally beat them, you fight a boss that is too difficult for this game. The controls jsut don't cut it.\n\nAll in all this game is a good $20 game, if you don't bother with the DLC. I finished it on hard.","January 18, 2014","true","17.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Just mash some random button when they tell you too.\n\nThe world is super linear with rare oppertunity to go left or right.  The camer is fixed which can make a lot of the wall climbing / jumping puzzles a bit more difficult than they should be.  The fighting is very generic as well.\n\nThis game also uses a check-point save system.  This is a reason I do not think Ill finish this game.  Currently my check point is saved right before a boss fight (and yes you get to watch a bunch of cinematics every single attempt).  The problem is that it saved my character when he was at  very low health.  So now I get to fight a boss in a very small space with his helping minions with very low health to start with.  After about 8 tries I gave up.  It wasn't even close.\n\nUnless you know you love these kinds of games, I would suggest that you stay away from the title.","November 3, 2013","false","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Somebody at Konami thought it would be a good idea to port a boss-fighting trick from controller to keyboard. You're supposed to rotate 360 degrees, which is easily enough done with an analog stick, but sucks with the keyboard. And the camera shows an angle that the designers consider helpful, but you may not. Meaning you run north into a new room, which is shown from another angle, and suddenly running north takes you back out of the room. It gets more frustrating when the camera keeps facing a boss, even though you need to jump and hit a switch on the floor on the other side of the room. The whole setup makes some fights a matter of luck, not skill. Thanks, but we have card games and dice-rolling RPGs for that.\nWhich is a pity, because the rest is good. Nice graphics, great voice acting, a nice enough story of Good vs. Evil, and some battles (normal + bosses) are actually fun. But dreading the next boss fight because of shtty controls/camera doesn't make me want to go forward, it makes me uninstall the game.","January 18, 2015","false","24.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Trial and error is key here. It's a classic hack and slash type of gameplay with a plethora of unlockable skills, maybe a bit too much if you ask me. The game has a fixed camera, which doesn't work too well with some combat scenarios and especially platforming, which there is a lot of. You'll find yourself confused and annoyed by invisible walls and sudden changes of the camera placements, messing up your momentum and sense of direction at crucial moments. The game has a fair use of quick time events as well, but even though you'll run into them frequently, they don't feel over the top.\n\nLike previously said there is a LOT of different skills to employ, but you can get through the game with pretty much only the standard attacks, some of the combo skills feel like they are too clunky to be worth the effort to pull off in order to look more cool. Some skills are required to reach certain collectibles which opens up for a lot of backtracking, which in turn can be very time consuming since you can't just get the collectible and then quit the level as far as I know, you have to complete the level again from beginning to end.\n\nThe aesthetics in this game is simply gorgeous. There are some truly impressive vistas in this game and you'll be visiting a lot of different kinds of areas, ranging from swamps to castles to hellscapes. The menu is noteworthy as well, giving off the appearance as an open living book of sorts. Very nicely done.\n\nAs for the story... Meh... You are Gabriel Belmot, the good guy, and your mission is to defeat some bad guys, because they are bad. The story is mostly delivered in the form of premission narration by none other than Patrick Stewart. But not even he can convincingly deliver the poorly written lines that at times can feel amateurish and cringe-worthy. Our hero doesn't really have a personality and rarely talks which makes it feel a bit disconnected. It would have been nice with some more fleshed out characters and more character integration as a whole.\n\nAll in all, a good game well worth the money.\n\n7/10","July 11, 2014","true","30.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

From the whipping and advancing further from the classic games, to the maze like enviromnents of the PSX and GBA games, Castlevania will always hold a special place in my heart as a gamer.\n\nCastlevania Lords of Shadows was a game I had high hopes for. The trailers shown off at e3 the first time I saw them showed some collective promise. Unfortunately, the game itself did not surpass my expectations. While the game had many good points, it also had it's fair share of bad points; which unfortunately ruined the experience for me.\n\nGameplay:\nLords of Shadows gameplay is a beat'em up simplest terms. You basically go through the level that you start in, advance through the level by fighting many different variants of monsters, and then get to the end of the stage. You play as Gabriel Belmont, who uses a combat cross whip, and many different subweapons in order to do this. While you engage the enemies, you have to be mindful of the other enemies, and various other hazards (such as fire, other creatures, or cliffs) in order to move on.\nThe gameplay is decent. Unlike the other more classic games which required stratgey and cunning to defeat, this game requires you to be skilled with fast paced combat. You have to use your whip to lay on hits on enemies, dodge and block enemy attacks as they come, and continue to lay on your hits to defeat your foes. The sub-weapons that you get are basically there to help you if your in pinch, as they tend to do more damage than your whip per shot.\nAlong the way, you'll gain magic items and powers which will give Gabriel new attacks and new abilities as you advance throughout the game (such as the light and dark magic). Most of these items are limited use, and difficult to replienish often, so it's usually a good idea to conserve such items.\nIn a sense, the game is not about stratgey with planning your attacks and ways around things, but rather the difficulty is in trying to dispose of the enemies that you encounter as you advance; while conserving as little resources as possible.\nSome stages do different things. For example, in the second level, you are on a horse the entire time, and have very limited movement. These stages break the monomity a bit, and give you something different to focus on as the game goes on. The game does this other times as well, such as the many mini games encoutnered on the way.\nThe boss battles range from normal fights with cinematic things needed to be done to defeat them, to an entire movie for a fight. The normal fights basically involve you beating up the boss until his HP drops to a certain point, and then doing a sequence of buttons afterwards to finish him off. Sometimes though, the fight is all of that.\nAs you continue, you gain experience points as you slay enemies. These XP are basically used to purchase different techinques and spells that can help you advance through the game. They don't come in often, but the techinques do help.\n\nThe problem with the gameplay is...this is not Castlevania.\nCastlevania has always been a game about stratgey in advancing. The difficulty of the game didn't come from the enemies themselves, but from the placement of where those enemies were in. The enemies in Lords of Shadow have no placement or spots in the game that the are placed in which makes it difficult. They are basically copied and pasted in different locations which you can easily move through as long as you are skilled in combat. Original Castlevania; and hell, even the RPG ones had enemies placed in specific spots that made them harder to attack and go after. There were no attempts to place enemies in spots which made them for annoying; and even dangerous to go after or provoke. It was hack and slash, hack and slash, hack and slash.\nThe boss battles also bugged me. In order to win the boss battle, you have to do the cinematic thing, or else the boss gains HP back, and you have to start over from a certain point. That also erked me, because now it's not a matter of how skilled you are at fighting. If you can't do it how the game wants you to, you never advance.\n\nBut...if I was judging the game as it was, I would say the gameplay is alright. Just not what I wanted.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are great; much better than the PS2 ones (I would certainly hope). The enviromnents that you will trudge through are beautiful to look at, and have much color in them, especially in the early parts of the game. Even more so is the enviromnent reflecting the current situation. As you play the game, the further you get towards Gabriel becoming Dracula, the darker the lands around you will become. The graphics are great, and beautifully represent the symbolism that the game represents.\n\nSound: Okay...the soundtrack is...it alright. Most of the game has orchestral compositions to reflect the game as a whole. The problem I have is while these pieces all sound great, none of them stand out. None of them I can recall as pieces I would want to hear. Castlevania had many music pieces that stood out: Vampire Killer, Wicked Child, Bloody Tears, Dance of the Moon. This game had none.\n\nStory: The story is good; that much I will agree. It's far more deeper than the other Castlevania stories, and has alot of things going for it. There are so many hints of what is going on showed throughout the story, and many of them are not touched on until the very end. I mean some are obvious, but others are not. All of the classic games either had no story, or the story was already apparent from the start. You Belmont. Dracula bad. Kill. What more is needed? The RPG ones did make more of an attempt at a story, but I find the story there to be executed poorly at times, while in here it was executed much better. So if your a glutton for story, you might like this.\n\nOverall: The game by itself is good, but I feel unworthy of the name Castlevania. There are very few elements of Castlevania brought over into this new canon of the series, and the gameplay does not live up to it's name. Where as in the old games where stratgey and cunning were on the same level as the combat, this game is sacrifices stratgey and focuses more on combat...which essentially means it is no longer Castlevania.\nI feel this game should have been it's own series by itself. The game had very few elements of the original story even here. By placing the words: Castlevania in it, it immediately then had a legacy to live up to, which it did not in my eyes. The game is still a good game in it's own regards; and if you are not like me and like to see different things in a series, then this is for you. But if your a die hard fan who was hoping for a challenging fighting experience that required both stratgey and cunning, then I would recommend you steer away from this.","August 15, 2014","false","23.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Once you let go of that idea, you can start appreciating it for what it is: a beautifully crafted corridor beat 'em up with an interesting story and setting.\n\nOh and, I played a lot of games with puzzles and Lords of Shadow has some very creative ones (I especially liked the music box).\n\nIt's a shoddy Castlevania, but it's a rather nice game.\n\n-----ORIGINAL REVIEW-----\nGeneral info about me: my favorite Castlevania is Aria of Sorrow and I'm very familiar with so-called spectacle fighters.\nDisclaimer: I'm not too far into the game and I might change my opinion if I ever decide to go back to it, since, right now, I have no desire of playing this again.\n\nThe best thing about the game is the world itself. Years ago I grew tired of fantasy games and movies as they're basically devoid of any real imagination (oh look! Elves!) and in Lords of Shadow the bestiairy and the lore don't seem really that influenced by Tolkien-ish drivel. That, to me, is a huge plus.\n\nThe level design is basically a really pretty unending corridor (awful invisible walls) with a few arenas and some ledge-grabbing tomb raider-esque nonsense. Don't get me wrong, I love exploration in a game (and the occasional ledge-grabbing), but here, because of its linearity, it isn't enjoyable.\n\nI have to say I don't have problems with linear games as they are better suited to tell a story, but there's a difference between linearity and what this game does. The sensation you're stuck in a corridor is accentuated by the fact that you have no control over the camera. With a better camera, the same exact game would have seemed a lot different, more open.\n\nAlso, these design decision don't make sense in a Castlevania. The defining caracteristic of a metroidvania is to have a somewhat open world with inaccessible parts that can be unlocked by getting new skills or tools/weapons.\nOne example is that some ledges are too high for you to jump on, and once you get the double jump you can explore all these areas you had to skip. This works really really well for a 2D Castlevania with a map.\n\nThe problem is that in this game you don't have an open world, it's just a string of levels. So, unless you replay the level (from start to finish!) you won't come across the same obstacle multiple times... what's the problem with that? Well, once you get the skill that allows you to overcome said obstacle you probably won't remember where it was or even that there was an obstacle to being with (although there's some kind of log that is supposed to help you).\nThe odd thing is also that whenever you replay a level, you've also to go through the different cutscenes, as if you were travelling in time instead of revisiting the region.\n\nThis, to me, is the biggest fault this game has.\n\nIt's as if for it to be a Castlevania game they had to add mechanics that people expect in a Castlevania, but didn't know what to do with them.\n\nRegarding the second most important aspect of the game, combat, I think it's okay and rather liked the two types of energy you can collect as it added a rather nice tactical element to the fights.\n\nThe main problem I have with it is the parry mechanic. It feels wonky and imprecise and sometimes enemies hit you for no reason (note: I usually play these games on maximum difficulty). Every single other game with a similar fighting style do it better than Lords of Shadow: Batman Arkham series, DmC, Deadpool, etc. and even triple Z games like Conan on the Xbox 360... But it also might be that I just don't get it. So take this with a grain of salt.\n\nRegarding the quality of the PC port: it's good except for the awfully compressed video. I haven't tried playing with a keyboard, though.","February 10, 2014","true","20.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a lot of twists to it. The graphics are solid, as is the voice acting. I would highly, highly, highly, recommend using a controller to play this game. You can play it with a keyboard, but the controls are just too awkward in my opinion. This is also a very long game, I finished the main game somewhere around 18-20 hours. I haven't played through all the DLC but the first one I've played is very promising. It also encourages you to go back and replay areas with newly acquired equipment to become more powerful.\n\nThey do a really great job with the big boss fights. It's not a case of they just give them more hitpoints. I thought they couldn't possibly top the second to last boss battle of the game, and they really did with the final fight.\n\nOne of my chief complaints is when you enter the quick time events with the later bosses it doesn't always tell you what button or combination to press. The solution in most of those cases was to move the thumbstick in a circle. Still this is very frustrating when you die or just fail over and over. Fortunately, it often just restarts right at the begining of the QTE. Still its frustrating knowing the only reason I am not progressing is due to the fact I have to keep guessing at things. There aren't really any graphical options with this game either.\n\n\nI honestly cannot wait for Castlevania 2.","January 1, 2014","true","26.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Plus, if one were to play the follow up to this game, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate, then they would be in for a treat there as well since that game, along with the ending to this game, set up the finale for the franchise that will take place in Lords of Shadow 2 (technically the third game to the re-boot of Castlevania).  The end is nigh and what an outstanding story this game has told so far!  In the past, some players have complained about this game not being enough like a Castlevania game and, to be fair, where game mechanics are concerned I can sometimes see that argument as valid, but a powerful story with constant nods to its humble beginnings is where this game pays the most homage to its predecessors.  The imminent release of Lords of Shadows 2 will see the re-boot story told in full and I just know that, at the end of that game, I will be asking myself, "Does it really have to end?", mostly thanks to the wonderful experience I've already had with this game.  I now have great faith in the future of Mercury Steam, the developers of these games, and I will be watching for whatever they work on from here on out.","January 2, 2014","true","41.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Keyboard controls feel a little wonky? Sure... But plug in a contoller and go to town. This is a great reboot of the Castlevania series. The graphics feel a little outdated on PC, but are still great. Further, there is no arbitrary screen cap, runs crossfire and eyefinity natively (which is more than I can say for some recent AAA titles, I am looking at you Ghosts.) The soundtrack is beautiful and the voice acting is top notch; boasting the talents of Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle. Patrick Stewarts voice makes you want to listen through each and every story preceding the levels, even though you could read it yourself in half the time and get to playing. There are few issues when using keyboard, as this game (and all in the genre) are made with a gamepad in mind. This is a mere temporary annoyance if you have a gamepad handy, you can also remap the keyboard to something that makes more sense to you. I wholly recommend this game to Castlevania fans as well as action adventure aficionados (God of War, Dantes Inferno, et al) Now, back to playing this game and wasting the day away.","January 1, 2014","true","30.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The storyline in this game is LONG, and takes some patience/time to get through it all (The more of one you have the less of the other you need).  If you like playing games that make the protagonist look like a badass and that make you feel like a badass while playing it there is that element to the game as well.  There are enough different enemies in the game that you won't get too bored of fighting them, but only tired of them toward the end of their involvement in the game.  Don't compare this too the previous Castlevania games as it is not a 2d sidescroller and really re-imagines the combat and looks of the world of Castlevania.","December 31, 2013","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Textures look like they got a bit of polish over the ps3 version and the game runs at a buttery smooth 60fps. The cut scenes still run at 30fps with noticeable artifacts from compression, but that's not a deal breaker at all. The gameplay is where it counts and this version certainly wins out over any of the console versions. The soundtrack is one of the most atmospheric in any Castevania game. It's all new music, however, if you're a fan of Castevania, you'll notice all kinds of little nods to the classic Castlevania music in numerous tracks throughout the game. Best of all, it's priced right and includes all of the dlc. Definitely recommended for anyone interested in action/adventure games.","January 23, 2014","true","18.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The combat is repitive, the puzzles are mostly too easy, the camera can not be controlled, there is no free saving, the world is not contiguous, the levels are mostly linear with very little to discover, the story does nothing special and you have to play through once to unlock the hardest difficulty.\nBut 'Castlevania: Lords of Shadow' also has some beautiful landscapes and impressive cutscenes espcecially the epilogue.\n\nIf you are a fan of the genre it will probably be worth playing through once. Otherwise I would advice you to play something else.","March 16, 2014","false","27.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The achievement carries over through the DLC, which is a problem you'll see in a second. I'm going to break this review down into story, gameplay, art/graphics, and DLC. Let's get started.\n\nThe story is average, nothing as bad as Metal Gear Rising. The dialog isn't like listening to a dying child. This is more obvious later on in the game because there's M. Night Shyamalan twist at the VERY end for the ending boss and it is terrible. It literally throws a twist that isn't even neccessary at the player that only complicate the story. Yeah, don't expect a masterpiece.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty okay. There's a dodge system and block system. The enemies are varied and fun to kill. The puzzles are actually PUZZLES, something that many games forget to do. Plus, the bosses are really good. It's your standard hack 'n' slash game with puzzles. BUT!!! There's a fixed camera. This is probably the biggest issue with the game because I've had a few situations where i was attacked by something that was off camera. Not TOO much though, but keep reading.\n\nWHen it comes to the art and level design, this game gets a A+. Everything about the world is amazing to the eyes and every enemy looks like care and time was put into it. Hell, the necromancer area looks like a Zdzislaw Beksinski painting! But alas... Here comes the big dissapointment.\n\nSort of like Metal Gear Rising, if you just beat the game you try out the DLC. Now, since this is the PC version, there was no wait between the DLC and the actual game, so you jump right in and discover it is horrifyingly bad. The two DLCs that come with Lords of Shadow aren't even worth buying because they end as they start. Sorry, I mean the first ends as it starts because the second DLC is ♥♥♥♥ing impossible. It throws a group of enemies at you that are frustratingly difficult to fight because the game didn't give you any healing items or relic power. Remember that fixed camera angle? The issue is ten fold for the second DLC. And when you finally beat them, you fight a boss that is too difficult for this game. The controls jsut don't cut it.\n\nAll in all this game is a good $20 game, if you don't bother with the DLC. I finished it on hard.","January 18, 2014","true","17.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not for everyone but if you're a fan of Castlevania then this is certainly one to get sunk into when awaiting the next installment.","November 5, 2013","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In care you're wondering, there is no higher rating than that.\n\nOk, to be serious Lords of Shadow is an extremely well done adventure-brawler in the vein of God of War or Devil May Cry.  We don't see too many of these on PC and this is either the best or second best I've ever played on the platform (depending on how I also feel about DmC's brilliance on a given day).\n\nThe aesthetics, in total, are what make this a gem to play.  All of the settings have wonderful art design that give them all a terrific sense of "place".  The music is amazing and even the sound effects are satisfyingly punchy. To top it all off you have Mr. Stewart putting his heart into some really cheesy narrative and lending it far more gravitas than it rationally should have as a result.\n\nThere are few downsides, the biggest is that the difficulty is relatively uneven, with some unwelcome spikes here and there.  Also, in appropriate Metroidvania style you need to backtrack with later abilities if you want to get all the upgrades - except there's no open world here; so that means replaying discrete, linear levels from start to finish just to collect one item mid-way through.","October 27, 2013","true","22.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As with most games of this type, there is a great mixture of different action gameplay scenarios as well with startling power up moves and power up items.  The graphics are just dazzling especially details and backgrounds, as expected from the top names from Konami.  The real gem though is for anyone who has been into ANY Castlevania game because it really builds upon the folklore and stories of the Belmonts and digs deep into their heritage.

I tried the demo a very long time ago, I remembered it being a nice demo. I wanted a game to play the 2 weeks before the release of GTA V, and this seemed like a good nice (and not too long) game.\n\nThe game began wonderfully. It was even above my expectations. Splendid levels, combo system, and learning curve. Every level you would earn a new powerup or unlock new combos, meet new enemies and new combat strategies.\n\nThis was almost exactly until mid-game, where the game itself became boring, repetitive, and where you would find the biggest flaws, which IMHO are:\n\n- fixed camera not always showing the right angle, making you fall exactly where you should not.\n- attacks from bigger enemies strike you BEFORE the claw/hand/weapon hits you, making it not difficult but rather frustrating, since the enemy kills you BEFORE you can actually see it moving\n\nThe scenery was rather beautiful in general, I am almost at the end but I really can't bother playing the game any further. I am not enjoying it that much anymore, it started as a great substitute for God of War (which we don't have on PC) but it turned out to be a very normal hack n slash with averall good elements but nothing really worth it.\n\nBuy it only if it is on offer, and if you really like the genre. The game is long though, much longer than many other games, which unfortunately in the case of Castlevania is not really an advantage....\n\n65/100","April 8, 2015","false","23.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoMordecai/recommended/234080/","GoMordecai","GoMordecai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoMordecai/","153 products in account","Before I begin I'd like to say that I haven't played the previous Castlevania games; this being my first venture into the world of Castlevania. I'm aware that this game takes a different approach to the originals, however I am reviewing this as a standalone.\nThe world setting is an interesting one, but the overall plot is predictable to say the least. There's some interesting characters visually, however characterisation is little. An ensemble voice cast consisting of Robert Carlyle, Natascha McElhone, (hello to) Jason Isaacs, and even the dramatics of Patrick Stewart, known for his Shakespearean background, struggle with the creaky dialogue.\nTo get the cons out of the way, the biggest irk in this game, and as mentioned in many other reviews, is the fixed camera angles. Much like Resident Evil, camera angle cuts are jarring and often leave you moving back on yourself. The camera angles can be most frustrating during platforming sequences, cutting from wide shots to extreme long shots, forcing you to search the screen for Gabriel. Often you will be taken on a cut scene showing you the enviroment for the sole purpose of allowing you to see it, because the fixed camera won't allow you to take in the hard work gone into the creation of world. There are collectibles in the game, however the fixed camera deters from adventure and exploration making levels feel terribly linear. The fixed camera is not without its perks, I found that, especially in battle with The Forgotten One, that a change of angle can signify what attack is about to come, but much like the adventuring this takes away from personal achievement.\nAnother thing I'd like to point out is the DLC. It has some exciting sequences, and allows for another playable character, but it almost felt like a different team worked on it. The 2D animation for cut scenes, however nice to watch, stands out from the artistic style of the rest of the game. I personally like the animation, but would have preferred for one or the other. Also, I'm not sure if it's just me but the difficulty curve for the DLC in comparison to the rest of the game seemed rather steep; ghouls appeared to do significantly more damage and the battle with The Forgotten One became a bit of a grind and somewhat frustrating.\nStrangely, after all these faults, I am giving this game a positive review and after getting past the frustrating camera I found the game to be a fun hack-n-slash. It's influences are obvious, taking aspects from God of War, Devil May Cry, and the platforming of Prince of Persia. The variation of combos make combat with smaller enemies exciting and very rarely does it become monotonous. Aside from the Titans, boss fights can be fun, but allow little time to use combos. There is a nice variety of enemies that each have different weaknesses and different methods of fighting. My only fault, and this is my personal preference, is the button prompts during cut scenes that occur during fights, mainly in boss fights. These will be fine for people who enjoy the God of War series and don't mind button prompts, but for me it takes away from personal achievement.\nIf you enjoy hack-n-slash games like God of War, then you'll probably enjoy this game. It has a fun variety of combos and enemies, and although exploration is little the world and mythology in which the game is based is an interesting one. For the full price I wouldn't recommend this game, but if you can pick it up on sale - I think I picked it up for £5 in a Steam sale - then give it a try. I've had nearly 34hrs out of the game, most of them enjoyable, and it's been worth every penny. The game has clear issues, but if you can get to grips with them or have played and enjoyed past hack-n-slash games of the PS2 era then I highly recommend it.","May 11","true","33.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/recommended/234080/","goldenagegmr","GAGMR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/","425 products in account","Went into the game with an open mind because it's on sale but it's not really that great.  It does get better as you progress but progression feels sluggish & most things about it are just disappointing.\n\nPROS\n-Great Graphics\n-Action Style Combat\n-Patrick Stewart\n\nCONS\n-Fixed camera angles\n-Auto-targeting system\n-Too many tutorials\n-Repetitive Combat\n-Incredibly Linear\n-Too Many QTE's\n-Bad Story\n-Boring Characters\n-Too Many Cutscenes\n-Too much Patrick Stewart (Never thought I'd say that)\n\nSTORY\n\nYou're wife's dead & you're emo.  Patrick Stalwart shows up & says, "We can bring your wife back by making you into a god!"  So you go around killing things until it happens, I assume.  It all was so dull & boring that's all I could get from it.  Something about ancient spirits of "The Order" are using your wife's soul to communicate with you?  I dunno...\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nYou Mash X when there's a single target & Y when there's multiple targets while dodging or jumping over attacks.  You can block but you might as well just dodge.  You get the power to absorb magic orbs & add "Light Magic" to your attacks which only serves to give you lifesteal & "Dark Magic" which, you guessed it, increases your damage.  Also, why don't the magic orbs just absorb when I get close?  Why do I have to hold a button down to absorb them?  That adds absolutely nothing to the gameplay & just leaves you open during combat.\n\nAnother thing about combat, every time you're hit you get interupted while enemies rarely do themselves.  So, while you're attacking an enemy he'll walk through your attacks only to blindside you upside your head or throw a weapon at you, breaking your combo.\n\nThen there are segments of the game where you'll have to fight a large enemy to progress because you have to mount them & use their abilities to make it through the level.  Basically, they're living keys.  You ride them, use them to make progress then kill them because they're useless now.  You can use them during combat but you get reduced rewards for every enemy slain using a mount so it's not really worth it.\n\nThe camera is so god awful during gameplay.  Enemies will attack you off camera by leaping at you or throwing bombs & the auto targeting is so bad that you'll constantly miss when you throw knives & attack nothing half the time because you don't know where you're aiming or if you're locked on when you start attacking.  Blocking is mapped to the same button as dodging so yea, good luck with that.  When you're not moving you block, when you're moving you dodge & it can get cumbersome to suddenly stop moving during combat just to block an attack.  Timed blocks give you a parry that lets you attack freely. Don't even get me started on the QTE's which only serve to break up the already boring combat & make it even more boring.  Whenever you grab an enemy it's a QTE that forces you to wait one whole second before pressing the kill button.  Why?  I don't know.  They could have easily just let you press the button to kill whenever you wanted but no... You gotta wait for the game to tell you when you can kill it which only serves to break the flow of combat.\n\nThen the way the areas are designed are just straight lines with small off paths that lead to either an upgrade or to something that could have been put on the main path like a Regeneration Fountain.  There are several paths that intertwine & the only difference is an item being hidden on one path.  Why?  What is the point of making the paths lead to the exact same place if the only difference is one has an upgrade?  That's blatantly punishing players who choose the path without the upgrade forcing them to replay the level just to find it.  It's padding at it's absolute worst.\n\nTo make matters worse every level has or is a tutorial.  Level 1?  Combat tutorial.  Level 2? Jumping tutorial.  Level 3?  New item tutorial.  Level 4? Boss tutorial.  Level 5?  Magic tutorial.  Level 6?  Poison effect tutorial.  ENOUGH WITH THE TUTORIALS!  Well into chapter 2 I'm still seeing tutorial\n\nThen there are the cutscenes.  Why oh why are there so many cutscenes?  Even during the finishing blow of the first boss I was interupted so Mr. Portrick Stewbird could swoop in & finish it off for me.  KS'd by Potluck Standard!  What exactly did making him instead of me, the player, take out the first boss of the game add to the game?  NOTHING!  It made me, the player, feel like a wimpy emo panzy (which the main character kind of is) so Mr. Prenub Studmuffin could seize all the glory for himself!  I guess because they were paying big money for a big name voice actor they had to ruin the game's first boss fight in order to get their money's worth.\n\nAnd the puzzles are even worse, especially in the beginning but if the early stages are any indication of puzzles in late game then I bet they're not any better.  The first real puzzle you come across involves finding 5 rocks with pictures on them.  Then you put those pictures in the order you found them, which is shown on screen as you solve it.  Yes, a puzzle that gives you the solution on screen while you are doing it.  HOW IN THE HELL IS THAT A PUZZLE?\n\nThe next puzzle?  A rotating bridge!  To your dead wife's corpse!  That's got a swinging axe getting closer to her corpse & if you take too long she gets cut in half.  Questions.  Why do I care about a corpse?  Why is the corpse in the middle of a rotating bridge death trap?  Why is this a vision test to prove my worth to a goat man?  Because ♥♥♥♥ YOU! That's why!\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThen there's the graphics.  Yes, the game is pretty but there is a downside to this & I'm not talking about how horrible the rest of the game is as a result.  The game is so detailed that it's hard to make out all the, well.. Details.  No, seriously.  It all blends together like a pristine painting that was made by some of the best artists they could probably find, but the end result is... What am I looking at exactly?  With the fixed camera angles it's nearly impossible to tell what your looking at half of the time.  If there was a 3rd person mode that let you actually see the details up close you could probably tell what you were looking at, but because it's so far out of view & unfocused it just becomes a bland mess.\n\nAnd that's the worst part about the game.  The camera.  They made an action based hack & slash game with gorgeos graphics & 3D platforming segments only to ♥♥♥♥ it up by giving it a fixed camera perspective.  This just takes you away from all the action, all the great graphics & away from being immersed in a fantasy gothic horror style environment.  You want to see that segment of grass up close? Too bad!  You want to see the detail of the enemies they paid artists tons of money to work on for hours?  Tough nuts!  You want to be in the middle of the action & see the blood splatter on your face as you fight?  Not gonna happen!\n\nOVERALL\n\nThis game is incredibly mediocre.  In fact, the first two hours I spent playing it about half or more of that was in cutscenes & replaying levels to find an item I missed. And every time I replayed a level all I could think was, "What is the point of this?  Why is this in the game?  Why is that in the game?  This isn't fun.  It adds nothing to the game.  This only serves to extend the level to make it seem longer than it actually is!" It's padding & not the good sort of padding.\n\nI'm not sure where the "Very Positive" rating is coming from because this game doesn't do anything spectacular at all.  It rips things from other games (which isn't a bad thing) but it grinds them down into their most generic format & puts them together in a way that is just "Meh..."  If you pick up this game, don't expect anything amazing or ground breaking.  Hell, don't even expect it to be a Castlevania game because it's not.  It's just some game that happens to have Castlevania's name on it.","April 29","false","4.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The only thing this game shares with another games from the franchise (let's jus skip the psx game) is the last name of the protagonist (Belmont, again, let's just skip Alucard and stuff for the review's sake).\n\nOf course the game was placed in a 3D world so the game was supposed to be bit different, but don't be fooled: this is not metroidvania, or anything even close to Castlevania. This is a tpp slasher which did a bad job at being what it was meant to be. If I were to pick Darksiders, DMC or Castlevania I would just send this game straight to trash.\n\nThere are some upsides to this game: regular mini-boss fights, art-style, fast-paced action. But let's go straight to the downsides, shall we:\n\nThe hero's got hardly any identity, it's just some Gabriel Belmont who is so sad about losing his wife that he's got to save the world and nothing is going to stop him. This is extremely cliche, but let's go further - maybe the gameplay is so awesome it's going to make you forget that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?\n\nNo way, it's just another slasher, but you can only use a few weapons, there's no advanced switching techniques, the whip feels really... soft. Unless you're using heavy attacks but even then the ps2 jrpg 3d graphics make it feel like you're just so weak you should turn your back on this whole quest. Combos are extremely weak, and honestly there's hardly any point in switching to anything but attack spam. The game doesn't really punish you for losing and doesn't force you to get better at the game so why bother?\n\nThe plot is completely chaotic and I don't mean lack of plot like in Dark Souls. This game just tells you some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and then follows with completely random areas and bosses, why? Only fighting Lords of Shadow makes any sense, but then again meh...\n\nCamera is one of the things I hate the most in this steaming pile of goat excrement. It focuses random thing, often makes jumps impossible or hard. I think this would be much better on the controller so maybe it's a warning: don't play on a hecking keyboard holy ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI know it sounds like it's a 3/10 game, but I would give it 5 or 6 even. It sucks, it really sucks at being a castlevania game and a slasher game as well. It's trying to be similiar to DMC or Darksiders but just doesn't meet the challenge. It's not worth the money as you can get something so much better than this. Just... don't bother. Maybe they will release another 2D game, this time for PC as well.","December 30, 2013","false","7.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Which is extremely clunky, even with a controller. Every few minutes, between button smashing(you get to mash two different buttons!

If you expect God of War for PC!!\nHaving played all GoW's on the PS, I had high expectations for this one, and I was let down many times:\n\n* The gameplay feels quirky. Many actions (block, roll, "power" hit) are mapped to the same button, so most of the time you end up doing things you didn't want to do.\n\n* The more powerful moves/skills are hard to use because most of them require excessive amounts of time to "charge up" and are therefore not really suitable for multiple enemies or boss fights. Also, tossing enemies in the air and overall airborne combat isn't as powerful as I would have liked it to be.\n\n* There are frustrating moments in the game, most of which are due to the unfair/bad placing of checkpoints.\n\nAs I worked my way through the game, forcing myself to finish it, there were a lot of parts I hated that had trail-n-error elements and the mentioned badly placed checkpoints, making it an overall frustrating experience.\n\nBUT, there where also parts I enjoyed a lot, especially the puzzles (which where often hard, but never unfair) and the last 3 Chapters as a whole. The story is average, except for the ending (after the ending), which has a nice twist to it.\n\nTechnically, the game itself is pretty nice. It sounds good and looks terrific (except for the rendered cut-scenes and the in-game close-up shots).\n\nIn conclusion, just because I ended up enjoying the last part of the game, I would not recommend it to a friend.","February 19, 2014","false","25.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I´ve just finished chapter 1. Wanted to like that game but there is a fixed camera which automatically adjusts itself. During combat the hardest fight you have is with the camera. It´s constantly changing the view means you always have to re-orientate yourself and readjust what you want to do or need to do (aim, block jump move direction). Sometimes the camera doesn´t even show you important parts of the enemy or your playing character and you can´t do anything against it yourself manually. Only do some uncontrolled movement until the camera gives you a useful view. That makes combat really annoying and time consuming.\n\nI´ve played both Darksiders and DMC, no complaints here.\n\nI will play on with the lowest  difficulty to see if at least the nice atmosphere and the nice artwork is worth my playing time.\n\nUpdate after 2/3 of the playthrough.

Why this looks like a classic medieval fantasy instead of gothic horror-themed game?\nAnd this game is boring. Fighting is boring, and that's a surprise for me, because I love brawlers. You are constantly served with new mechanics and moves. YOU HAD TWO ♥♥♥♥ING ATTACKS IN CASTLEVANIA. This is the case when constant upgrades is just plainly boring.\nAnd I would have forgiven this game if it had some gothic environment - why couldn't forest be foggy and dark instead of generic "beautiful" forest with huge tree in the middle straight out of the Ocarina of Time?","June 20, 2015","false","3.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Looking back now i probably wouldn't buy it again.\n\nFirst the good parts:* This game has a realy nice aesthetic to it and its story telling is immersive. You can feel the struggle of you hero while he spirals down into darkness.* The world is a dark and grimm place like you would expect from a world cut off to the heavens.* You can autosolve all puzzles (but you wont get exp)* Puzzles are mostly fun\nNow the bad: The camera is fixed. Its just a cheap way to hide secrets, since most of the time you dont see the entrence of the area where you need to go. This also leads to abysmal fights since enemies are often offscreen or infront of the camera.\nThe combat system: The whole comabt system ist balanced around not getting hit and using your two powers. One can heal you and the other one lets you deal bonus damage. But in order to use them you need to hit enemies to fill your combo bar. When full your hits produce little orbs which you can absorb into either of your power bars to fuel them. If you get hit you have to restart filling the combobar.\nNow what happens if you have low HP and low healingbar? Well you are quit ♥♥♥♥ed. Minibosses just love when they can onehit you and play their little 20 sec cutscene again and again. Best way to heal yourself? Here fight 5 enemies.\nThe whole system is flawed at its core:\nyou need to hit enemies in order to fill your powerbars\n\nEntering in one of the power modes wont let you collect powerorbs. Gitting hit still cancels the combo\n\nSo in order to heal you need to fight, but you dont want to fight since you are low on Hp\n\nThe Damage Power is mostly useless. You want the orbs for your healing power but you cant  collect them if you deal bonus damage.\nWhile timed blocking quickly fills your combo bar, many enemies have fast unblockable attacks and attack in groups, so if you block one you get hit by another one.\nAnd one of the worst things is, that late in the game you get wings which let you double jump. While this is nice to dodge stuff and usefull for a lot off puzzles they have one major flaw. If you are in healing mode and double jump then you perform a special attack draing half of your max healing power pool and blind all enemies. But bosses for example dont get blinded and most of the time you desperatly need this healing.\nTo many unskippable cutscenes. You died? Here have this 20 sec animation of this creep again and then let him kill you\nThere are little deamons which steal your gear from time to time just to annoy you. But you cant even kill them to get some sort of satisfaction.\nA lot of charaktes are think you have the memory of a fish and need to repeat their objective for you every 10 sec. Not a surprise that you feel more reliefed than sad when they have a tragic death.\nto many quick time events\nWhile i beat this game on hard diffculty i did not enjoy it most of the time and just wanted to progress in the story and get it over with","November 22, 2015","false","23.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I´ve just finished chapter 1. Wanted to like that game but there is a fixed camera which automatically adjusts itself. During combat the hardest fight you have is with the camera. It´s constantly changing the view means you always have to re-orientate yourself and readjust what you want to do or need to do (aim, block jump move direction). Sometimes the camera doesn´t even show you important parts of the enemy or your playing character and you can´t do anything against it yourself manually. Only do some uncontrolled movement until the camera gives you a useful view. That makes combat really annoying and time consuming.\n\nI´ve played both Darksiders and DMC, no complaints here.\n\nI will play on with the lowest  difficulty to see if at least the nice atmosphere and the nice artwork is worth my playing time.\n\nUpdate after 2/3 of the playthrough. Even more fascinated by the wondereful and detailed artwork and the audio specially the part from Patrick Stewart. But - Quit playing - because the game mechanics and excessive quick time events drove me insane. And you have to have a gamepad or controller. There certain actions where you have to do fast movements with the left analog stick (360 circle, zigzag). This is impossible to do with WASD on the keyboard.

Controls are inconsistant. Ok I climbed up this ledge and now i have to bash through a window by jumping off the wall, so push jump right? No, you push X? Stuff like that happens too much.\nCombat is cheap. Enemies will attack you mid attack with unblockable attacks randomly. Compared to games like devil may cry and god of war, the developrs tried but fell short to come up with a solid combat system. And why do I have to stop, run away from an enemy and hold down joystick buttons to absorb their enegry all the time? It just ruins the flow of combat.\nThe ups are that the game still looks nice, production values are high, and the story is delivered well, even though it can be melodramatic.\nAnd now that its 2014 lets all agree that clock type rotation puzzles are unfun and should be given to children as a punishment.","February 12, 2014","false","14.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

This game is not nearly as good.\n\nWhile this game does have some strong points, it is ultimately plagued by gameplay that I feel is very uninspired, repetitive, and heavily scripted. That is ultimately why I do not recommend this game. I wanted to like this game as I am a fan of the old-school castlevania games myself (which are quite superior)\n\nPros:\n- Graphics that look good even now. . . .6 years after it has been released. They are especially good if you install the helix mod and sweetfx mod.\n- The game has some nice music, but the game needs to use it more often.\n- Combat, overall, is quite nice. If you are a god of war or DMC fan, you will enjoy it. However, I didn't like it that much as I heavliy prefer Dark Souls styled combat to this game. Level Design and Camera also makes combat worse as I will explain in a moment.\n- The game is prettly lengthy at 20+ hours.\n\n\n- Story so far is. . . . .a mixed bag for me. It doesn't complement the other elements of the game as it is a little confusing and dis-jointed. It is interesting, but it isn't flushed out enough to really take a from that I can like.\n\nCons:\n\n- Camera: This game is the perfect example of why giving players the ability to control the camera is so important. Even if the camera is always positioned perfectly in platforming and combat (which it isn't all of the time as I am often fighting enemies off-screen) the game encourages the player to explore the level and find secrets. However, it is hard to do and painful with a camera that can't be controlled.\n- The level design of this game is uninspired and repetitive. First, there's a flat area where you fight monsters. Then, there's a platforming section that feels heavily scripted with the ledge-jumping and gripping mechanics that the game has. Then, more fighting in flat areas where the environment doesn't change how the fighting happens. To be fair, the game introduces a little bit of variety through giving the player new abilities, weapons, and creatures to fight a lot of the time, but that doesn't change the fact that the environments do not add any depth to the gameplay. Castlevania 4, on the other hand, had many areas where the environment greatly affected how you fought enemies, and platforming was fun and not scripted in that game. Combat and Platforming complemented each other and made the game extremely fun and varied. However, Castlevania: Lord of Shadows has bland combat and bland platforming sprinkled throughout the game. If it weren't for the good combat mechanics, I'd feel like this game would be terrible.\n- A lot of boss battles are just glorified Quick-Time events. I HATE quick-time events in a game. There are also times when I fight bosses where I have no idea what I'm suppose to do because the game doesn't properly communicate anything to me, and these boss fights aren't like the "Legend of Zelda" bosses where you have fun figuring out how to fight the bosses. You might be hanging on the side of a boss when the boss just knocks you off of him without the game giving any clear indication of how to prevent that form happening. Remember that these fights feel heavily scripted, and creativity just doesn't help when you are restricted in the scripted-style climbing that the game requires of you. To be fair, though, the bosses in the game look awesome, and it's cool climbing up their gigantic form.\n- The game plays terribly with keyboard and mouse. A controller is REQUIRED.\n\nOverall, I do not recommend this game. The game doesn't really have anything redeeming quality that makes it stand out and worth purchasing, and the combat and story are only decent. There isn't really anything that really "carries" this game and makes it better than others. It would be an good game if it didn't have the major issues that turned me off. Even if the 6 year-old graphics are impressive, visuals do NOT make a game.\n\nBut even if the game is only mediocre, I'll still finish the game. I'm interseted to see where the game goes from here, and I want to make this review "complete."","April 27","false","6.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

However, depending on whether the game is lagging, what screen size you're using, or whether the moon is in the 5th house of Scorpio, it doesn't work. The reaction time for the QTE is so slow, and there is no margin for error at all as the area is hair thin, you're stuffed.\n\nLook up on YouTube 'Swamp Troll battle'. Notice people are using the keyboard - I think it's because this port doesn't accept the pad so readily.\n\nOh, and each time you miss, the enemies regenerate 1/4 health and you don't.

Most of these moments are from the last half of the game. I'll let that statement stand as commentary on the game's length and pacing, both of which isn't all that great.\n\nSHORT VERSION:\nBasically, it's a no-go, unless you're a really BIG fan of 'God of War clone'-type games. It's super linear (with unecessary "backtracking" of whole levels at once for one or two item upgrades at a time), the music is unmemorable, and the gameplay is painfully mediocre, and the game as a whole drags itself out for way longer than it needed to.\n\nLONG VERSION:\nThe gameplay is basically what you'd expect from a 'God of War clone'-type game. You jump a bit around, do some slow-ish climbing, and hack'n'slash a whole bunch of enemies. It doesn't bring much new stuff to the table, although there's an interesting mechanic with Light and Dark magic, making you choose between attacks that heal or deal more damage, but unfortunately the mechanic isn't really made use of to its fullest until the very end of the game. Some of the boss fights are interesting, even a bit fun, but as with the regular enemy fights, they get dragged out too long half the time and just feel like a chore in the end.\n\nThe maps and locations look pretty at times, but the locked camera angles makes it a less enjoyable trip, because it is often hard to tell what you can interact with or move around on and what's blocked by a jarringly sudden invisible wall.\n\nFinally, storywise, it's a bit of a mess, while the story is generally interesting, the final cutscene doesn't make any sense unless you play the DLC afterwards (luckily you get that for free in this version of the game), and while Patrick Stewart's narration between levels is really good, the disconnect between Gabriel's described personality in the narration and how he acts in-game and in cutscenes is a bit weird. The story builds up to a lot but it falls really flat because the story's way longer than it should be; the first half of the game just feels unecessary.\n\nSO YEAH.","February 10, 2014","false","20.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","5"

But it's just not good. The presentation and lore is great, but the gameplay is PAINFULLY mediocre. I'm talking mind numbingly boring.  I'm torn between putting the game away for a time when I find myself without internet or a job (having time to kill) or just YouTubing the cutscenes and moving on to the sequel.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing visuals. It's almost at the level of Trine 2, which was a 2D game.\n-Interesting lore. Avenging love lost. Gothic theme. Dracula's origin story. I'm not versed in Castlevanie lore but this seems like a fine reboot of it.\n-All-Star voice acting. Enough said.\n-Journal offers bits of lore via beastiary entries and equipment descriptions, etc.\n-*Seemingly* long. My playtime shows the time it took to clear chapter 1. From the map screen, it seems like there's at least 9 chapters.\n-Out of absolutely nowhere, a little fairy appeared and showed me her boobs. This pleased me greatly.\n\nCons:\n-Lacking soundscaping. The level of audio detail does not match the visual detail. For example, a big titan crushing it's fist into solid ice has no crunch to it, just a weak *whomp*.\n-Linear level design. Every level is a corridor. No, seriously. It's like Crash Bandicoot. I'm not kidding you. You have branching "Y" paths that later rejoin to the same area. Just like in Crash Bandicoot.\n-Simple combat. It's skill based character action, but it lacks nuance. It's not bad, but it's a total bore.\n-Simple platforming. Think Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, but dumbed down for 6 year olds.\n-Clunky controls. The game never stops showing what button you need to press to do what. The problem is that it does it for good reason. You aren't taught the basic scheme of the game via repetition. Buttons do unique things at every turn that you would have too much difficulty figuring out on your own. Climb on a big boss's arm. Hit the gem with "B". It's stupid that the game's still showing me tutorials, yet I'm grateful because I probably would have been lost as to what the game needs me to do. I didn't know I'm climbing to the gem to hit it. Ugh...\n\nIt's just a stupidly bland game. Most of all, it doesn't feel at all like Castlevania 1. You know what does feel like Castlevania 1? Dark Souls. Go play that instead.","March 19","false","1.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Then there are titan fights and I found them no fun at all - they're nice to look at but gameplay-wise just a reaction game, not a real boss fight. I was aware that this game was closer to God of War than to previous Castlevania games, but I hoped that at least the scenary and lots of different enemy types would give me a Castlevania feel.

You spend more time fighting the controls than the enemy. There is no animation canceling, or inviniciblity frames. The game also punishes for not being able to follow their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls, and has no use of combos. The only move you ever need is X,X,X as it mini-stuns while Y doesn't do anything but hit in an AoE but lack mini-stuns. Every enemy in the game stuns on hitting you, including the 3ft tall flying imp demons who attack every 2 seconds, and appear on average in groups of 4. At one part you fight 20 of them at once.\nThe Shadow Magic is also terribly useless with no visible difference in damage at all. Not even 20% difference. The combo meter also takes about 50 hits in a row to activate so you can began healing but you can't get hit at all, and most encouters end in ~10-15 hits.\n\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME EVER.","February 8, 2014","false","3.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

This game is terrible, beyond bad, its just absolute garbage.  This is one of those games with the most annoying gameplay elements in gaming histroy.  lets review the awful elements of this game which sadly make up the core of the game.\n\n1.  the story, dear god its all words on pages, in 2013 their all TLDR and if they dont care enough to animate it then why bother putting it in, noone cares, we want a game not a book.\n\n2.  It takes longer to restart after dying than to actually die.  This is a huge mistake in game design there are like 3-4 menus or a total of 5 steps everytime you die.  Why bother restarting the cursor is set to NO on do you want to restart, its like the devs are telling us dont bother playing this game it sucks.\n\n3.  EVERY boss fight ends in a QTE thing.  Whats worse is your not hitting button combos to challenge your skill, you watch two white circles come together and spam a random button, thats it.  If you hate QTE this has to be the worst implementation of QTE ever in a game.\n\n4.  In the first 5 minutes of the game is this water part you go in the water hands come up you die, who thought that was a good idea?  Whats after that MORE WATER with hands coming up killing you.  If you thought this was some hardcore platforming action, sadly your dead wrong.\n\n5.  cutscenes, they must be like almost EVERY 5 seconds, walk a couple seconds, CUTSCENE OUT OF EFFEN NOWHERE!  constantly over and over, just let me play the game stop interrupting.  the story cut scenes go on and on and on, theres no story there its all nothing, NOTHING, ever heard anyone talk about the awesome story in this game?  Of  course not because there isnt one, when a cut scene comes on just roll over and go to sleep and wake up when its done.  its like that old Metal gear crap with the 45 minute cut scenes, have mercy!\n\n\n6.  This game has a fixed camera system.  Remember how popular myst was back in what the 80s?  Well this game does the same thing, fixed camera, ugh.  what is next in castlevania a browser based text version of the game now with more seeds?\n\n\nThis is a multimillion dollar game but its crap its not a pretty looking bargain bin game at best.  Whats worst is people in the gaming industry sit around whining all over about how they want the mainstream market.  NEWSFLASH with crap like this it aint going to happen, do they think everytime people die they want to sit through five menus?  Or every 5 seconds they need a cut scene showing the character walk into a room you just walked into?  This game is a classic example of how these whiny companies get mad and go out of business wondering why noone buys their games.  From junk play control to forced pausing of the game everytime a tutorial is on screen its terrible, its not a game if I cant play it and every ten seconds the game stops for some tutorial or longwinded story or brief cutscene.  Its thanks to games like this that the entire game industry suffers, when they suffer we suffer ending up with more junk games from the same people who know nothing about game development.  Any ten year old can and has coded games that isnt hard, making them fun and playable is an art, something this game doesnt do.  /rant\n\nRating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00","November 6, 2013","false","1.5"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

Each fight is riddled with epic bland-ness throughout.\n\nYou are given the opportunity, and are reminded of this opportunity, at the end of each level, where you can spend your experience points for new combos and upgrades to combos which (For the time I played the game for) were unnecessary.\n\nThe voice acting is absolutely amazing if you enjoy things below average! - The NPCs quite frequently enjoy stating the obvious every minute or so, occasionally even during combat to remind you that you're not there to fight werewolves, you're there to search for hidden purple glowing shards.\nThe shards of which are near impossible to find due the incredible work of the camera angle hating you and your life.\n\nThe music... It's so forgettable that I forgot what I was going to say about it.\n\nThe story... Due to how much actually happens I will give you a snippet of the first 20 minutes of story;\n\nYou play as a man gone insane due to losing his wife, to overcome your insanity your mind conjures up mythical beasts to kill.\nPeople fear you due to collateral damage you leave behind in your wake.\nYour weapon may only be a cross, but people can see that you are also cross, cross with life!\n\nWhile on the run from the peaceful settlement you just ravaged, a talking glowing pony comes to your aid, the pony says "Lol, hop on, i'll take you to that place you want to be"\nDue to Gabriel being a complete psychopath he doesn't even question it - He hops straight on the back of this majestic beast and rides off, taking out several werewolves riding other, larger werewolves (Naturally).\n\nAbout half way to the destination that the pony said he would take you to, the pony stops and says "Lol j/k. only taking you halfway, toodle pip!" and it vanishes.\n\nEventually getting to your destination you meet a goatman, which Gabriel doesn't question because Goatmen are obviously common place in a psychopaths mind.\nThe Goatman gives him an opportunity to see his dead wife again, Gabriel jumps for joy and thinks he is strong enough to speak with the dead.\nAnyway, after saving his dead wife from a cieling pendulum axe he kills her, so she's now twice dead.\n\n\n\nNow on to the ratings!\n\nIf Dracula is 'Excellent' and\nThe creature from the Black Lagoon  is 'Meh, it's alright'\n\nI would give this game a 'Bloodrayne'","October 12, 2015","false","4.0"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","13","1","8","4","0"

It started with promise, as a fun third-person action-platformer. At first, it was fun with the normal levels, and the bosses were bad. Then the boss fights got better, and quite different each.\n\nHowever, the experience was rough: the levels were hyper-linear; it is not possible to control the camera in any way; and some of the controls are plain bad (try double-tapping a direction with the left stick for running...). I won't talk about the story: it is dark and grim for being dark and grim, but its better to forget the story entirely - the game becomes much better that way (at least in my opinion).\n\nAnd then came the final boss, the Forgotten One. It started with a timed instant-death platforming section, followed by a slow battle with the boss. Then came an even more difficult instant-death platforming section, followed by even more of the _same_ slow battle with the boss. It was infuriating. My playthrough lasted around 37 hours; this final boss was around 7 hours of it. On the 2nd difficulty (of 4).\n\nAlltogether, this is a game, that is very close to be a fun, good game, but ultimately falls flat. I would not recommend playing it, there are much better candidates (better story, controls, less infuriating bosses, etc.). However, I would state, not much is needed to be good, so if you are prepared for the bad parts, it might be for you.","October 19, 2014","false","37.8"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

It's the design that's so bad.\n\nThe developers seem to not know the difference between "difficult", "fun", and "wasting the player's time".  Every section of the game seems to be designed around the fact that the developers were trying to make things more fun or more difficult, but instead just end up wasting the player's time.  In each section, there are tasks designed to probably make you have fun but instead they waste your time.\n\nYou see how that works?  That previous paragraph had very little content, but it took you a longer time to read it than if I had just said "this game wastes your time".  That pretty much sums this game up.\n\nHere's an example:\nYou enter a new setpiece.  The game shows you a cutscene panning around the setpiece to give you a look at the pretty graphics.  Then you have to run down the path that the cutscene just showed you, to the end where there's a cliff you jump down to block you from backtracking.  Now you fight some goblins.\nOk, what was the point of the whole cutscene and path I had to walk down?  Solely to waste my time before the combat.\n\nThere's also numerous sections with Prince of Persia style platforming and wall climbing.  However, there's never any danger of dying.  If you do fall, you start back instantly right before the fall - no Sands of Time necessary.  Another mechanic meant to waste your time.\n\nThen there's the combat which seems to be the meat of this game.  You get experience and use it to unlock new abilities... But they all seem so useless.  Like, I'm never going to remember to hold the right trigger in the air and input this combo.  And if I did, what good would it do me?  "Look, I'm swinging my whip in a different fashion!  Good thing I spent that 3000 xp to get this ability."\n\nOh yeah, and YOU DO NOT HAVE DIRECT CONTROL OF THE CAMERA!\n\nThen there's the story... Ugh.\n\nIf I had to make an analogy, I'd say the developers took everything good aboud God of War, Shadow of the Colossus, Prince of Persia, Devil May Cry, and Castlevania... and then they threw them out and made a game from the leftovers in an attempt to cash in on a franchise that hasn't had a hit entry since 1997 (the 2D castlevania games on portables were fantastic but I wouldn't call them hits).\n\nSo, to reiterrate:  I've played better Castlevania games on N64.  And I'm not kidding.  The version of Castlevania 64 where you played as a werewolf was so super rad compared to this!\n","November 27, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","5","21","0","0"

It was recommended by a friend because I liked Darksiders 2 so much. The gameplay is similar but although I tried to find the game enjoyable, it was not. This starts with the whiny main character Gabriel who mourns over his loss of his wife. He acts more or less selfish and I was tempted to shout at him like: Get over your loss and act as a grown man!  Gabriel is part of an "templar" order to fight evil and to help the poor and weak, but the during the few moments you see any civilian he does not act like a hero. For me he sees the civilians just like nuissances.\nFrom time to time a comrade of the same order (who is also the narrator (spoken by Patrick Stewart) of the episode beginnings) appears and helps Gabriel out. Why couldn't I play this guy who acts more like a hero?\nFor some extras you could visit the former areas if you got the equipment to reach the chests. But you have to fight through the same monsters again to reach the locations which is quite boring for me so I totally skipped this later on. This could be important for the higher difficulty levels, but due to the very very weak story with no enjoyable "sidestories" it must be a major pain. The same is valid for the challenges you can get for every level by completing a task (like: kill 20 monsters with grenades), but you find out about the task by pure luck or after you played a level when the challenge will be mentioned on the summary screen.\nThe fighting is quite okay and with the 4 special items (like daggers, butterflies,...) quite versatile.\n\nSo if you like fighting a la Devil May Cry, Darksiders,... without any good story and without a likable hero with some puzzles, the game is for you. If you look for a good story, charismatic characters you have to play something else.","October 27, 2014","false","25.8"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

I played a few hours of one on the ps2, but that about sums up my Castlevania experience.\n\nPros: Beautiful game.  Absolutely gorgeous.  Voice acting done well, I don't know any names, but I've heard people mention Patrick Stewart.\n\nCons: Everything else.  This game was just...not that entertaining.  The combat felt repetative, easily cheesed (grab small enemy, quick time event to smash small enemy, wash and repeat 50 more times).  The bosses were challenging, not because they were well designed, but because of the awkward combat system.  Oh, and did I mention the boss that looks like a giant statue that you climb up and strike repeatedly at weak points...does that remind you of any other game *cough*shadowofthecollosus*cough*.\n\nI'm a huge fan of SoTC, but this ripoff was just blatent, and frankly with the system they made for it.  Then imagine my surprise when the boss after that one was...ANOTHER GIANT STATUE THAT YOU CLIMBED AND STABBED WEAK POINTS!  They didn't even have the courtesy to make this one a different shape.\n\nAll in all, a quite sad game.  The concept was there, it really was.  It was poorly executed however.

The game offers a wide range of combat choices from the healing light magic, hellfire shadow magic and the various other relics used to fights the lords of shadow and their minions. As you defeat the lords of shadow you gain there powers. This amounts to the alacritical cyclone boots, the flying seraph shoulders and a gauntlet for fist fighting.

If there are tricky jumps or hard platforming sections, it´s because the controls aren't working as they suppose to not because of good level design. There are puzzles but they are easier than the ones found in the Uncharted series.\n\nThe combat, though fuctional and responsive, is nothing to write home about. It´s very unispired and derivative. If you played Devil May Cry, God of War or Ninja Gaiden Sigma, you´ve already played this. The only intresting mechanic that differenciate this game from the much superior games it´s trying to ape is the light/dark magic mechanic. Having said that, the combat is fun. It's clear that this game doesn't want to be a Castlevania because there are sections that mimic Shadow of the Collossus but with more Quick Time Events and less Awe.\n\nThe story is... well. You won't pay attention to that because you'll be distracted by Patrick Stewart's vibrating voice. It's not even forgettable because you cannot forget something you didn't understand. The worst part of this is that the main story takes about 14 hours to finish. By the end I was forcing myself to beat this crap so I could finnaly move on.\n\nIt's as if Konami was trying to blend Hack n' Slashes, with Shadow of the Collossus and Patrick Stewart. What we got is a game with insipid gameplay, narcoleptic story, terrible platforming controls, and Patrick Stewart.\n\nI wasted my time playing this....\n\n\n","December 30, 2014","false","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Castlevania: Lords of Shadows is a beautiful game with a lot of fine 3d modelling and great texturing all over, unfortunately that alone doesn't yet make a great game.\n\nIn this product, outdated game design meets up with all the wrong kind of innovations of the new era. Whole product has a smell of artificially prolonged lenght all over it and quick time events will drive you aboslutely insane. Combat, which you do most of the time in the game is tedious, boring and unresponsive (not to mention unaccurate). Most of the time level design makes no sense and otherwise well done backgrounds lose their appeal when only thing you do is climb a wall after another just to meet up with a wall that can't be climbed until certain enemy is defeated.\n\nGame's camera does it's best to be an additional enemy among the unimaginative and cliche-filled enemy charter. Voice acting is one of the worse I have ever heard and competes for the last place with Finnish children's animation dubbing. Music works quite well, but same can't be said for the rest of the sounds that work just as an addional (and bland) effects instead of adding to gameplay or experience.\n\nPlease save your money for something more worth while.\n","April 27, 2014","false","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was different than first anticipated, as you basically play a lot of small levels, which are completely linear, from 2-10min/level. At first, that was disappointing, but with time it builds on you, there are skills to buy from Exp, items and secrets to find which boost your weapons, HP or Mana, each level has a special win condition (and they are extremely hard) for completionists, and the graphics and the setting and athmosphere is just great, quite dark and desperate.\nThe free DLC however was a frustration... 5x as hard as the main game, both in puzzles and in battles, and the final end boss almost ruined the whole game for me... I could not beat him in the normal setting even after hours of trying... so I only got my easy achievement despite finishing all other levels on Normal...

I was skeptical what with it being Castlevania, but this game proved me wrong. This is definately one of my favorite action adventure games of all time. The protagonist Gabriel Belmont voiced by the illustrious Robert Carlye (AKA Mr Gold, OUaT) has set out to destroy the Lords of Shadow in order to ressurect his wife Marie with the help of a warrior of the order named Zobek (Patrick Stewart). The game offers a wide range of combat choices from the healing light magic, hellfire shadow magic and the various other relics used to fights the lords of shadow and their minions. As you defeat the lords of shadow you gain there powers. This amounts to the alacritical cyclone boots, the flying seraph shoulders and a gauntlet for fist fighting. The games play style feels simaler to devil may cry and games of the like in certain ways. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who loves a good action adventure that won't be handed to you like many of the action adventures now-a-days.","July 6, 2014","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why? To make this review count. Im really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at people who made this game, not because its bad, but because they ruined it. Its like hitting your self with a frying pan, or more like painting a beautiful painting, and then smacking it with dog poop.\n\nWhy game is GOOD?\n> Great story that ties somehow all castlevania games together ( one bad thing about it: its dull at the beginning, yet keeps getting better over time)\n> Great enemy and in general graphical desing ( Landscapes, monsters, everything looks great, exept for the final boss... he looks unfinished and pathetic, but maybe thats the point?)\n> The combat system is original, takes a lot of time to master the focus meter and usage of magic but over all its fun ( nvm useless combos that you wont even bother to learn after you have the good ones)\n> I need to point out how smart they animated the whip attacks in 3D. Looks REALLY REALLY impressing\n> Actually has this "castlevania" feel (for most of the part\n\nNow what kills the game?\n\n> Fixed on player camera - Tell me! Why the ♥♥♥♥ lock the camera on angles that are for most parts nonsense? When you play a 3D game you NEED to control the camera. You NEED to see where you are jumping etc. I cant count all the times i jumped into my doom, because the camera didnt even show me a platform somewhere else. Althou the camera works sort of OK in combat, there is no reason to fix it on landscapes, when you are trying to make a tricky jump. Also, whats the point of making awsome landscapes, if the player cant even see them! Because the camera thinks otherwise. ♥♥♥♥ the camera. And dont tell me "its a fixed camera game". NO, fixing a camera in a 3D platformer on the player is just evil and wrong. Take a lesson from darksiders devs. camera should be controlable via the mouse or pad\n\n> Hit detection - This is a thing that should be fixed before the game release. First off there are times where Gabriel takes damage in the same moment as the enemy attack animation starts. What does this mean? It looks wrong and makes some attacks unblockable and undodge able. Even if you have uber reflexes, the game expects you to be a prophet. Other times the animation shows clearly that you should have been hit, but the game thinks otherwise. Yeaah sometimes a huge sword just flies throu your body without making even a scratch. wtf. This is either a problem of the hitbox, or hit timer. Im just going to call it broken hit detection.\n\n> QTE - You might say that there are too mane QTE in the game, but i actually like them + they are not sooo anoying, dont worry :)\n\n>neccesery backtracking - dont get me wrong, backtracking is a good thing if you want to find all the secrets and stuff, but its a sin if you HAVE to backtrack orelse you dont get any power ups, without those power ups you will have a very hard and unfair challenge. Also backtracking is good for exploration games, where there is a open world. I have nothing against invisible walls, but if you cant explore the world, why force the player to backtrack levels? This is just a cruel way to make the playtime longer\n\nAnd thats all, believe it or not but if not for these 2 issues that ruin the whole experience. I would call this a 10/10 game, because castlevania! It even recyles some of classic enemies, and there are some eastereggs so to call.\n\nTL;DR\nI recommend this game from my heart, its great\n\nBUT BEWARE:\n>locked camera\n>broken hit detection","January 18, 2015","false","60.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's graphics are excellent for what the XBOX 360 can offer, and the level design and theme are synonymous with the original game in the style of platform fun, except it entails 3D design.\n\nThe sequal Castlevania 2 Lords of Shadow pales in comparison; it fails on every level to deliver a true respresentation of what Castlevania was meant to be. Yes, Lords of Shadow 2 (which I played in the XBOX 360) has vampires and blood, but foretells the story in a way which would be comparible to Twilight instead of sticking to the roots of how the story was designed. It truly is a heartbreaking thing for me to see, as it might be a trend within the gaming community to destroy such beautiful games, and their beautiful storylines and art.\n\nIn short, buy Lords of Shadow, and if you get the chance, ♥♥♥♥ on Lords of Shadow 2 and set it on fire.","January 5, 2015","true","27.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From what I had seen online, the series seemed to have degraded into a number of identity-confused games (are we jumping puzzles, or are we adventure, or are we 3D, or are we side-scrolling?) featuring a number of feminine-looking male heroes.\n\nEventually I gave in while the game was on sale, and after it sat in my library for a few more months, I started playing.\n\nIt turns out to be a really good game.\n\nGameplay is fixed-camera third-person combat and exploration with an experience points system and unlockable skills and combos. The camera angles were typically well placed, though the environments hint at more exploration than what is really available.\n\nThe graphics are good, with rich visuals that are a real treat for fantasy fans. I particularly liked the castle of the vampires (which is not the final destination of the game, but is the "Castlevania" of the series) and the Land of the Dead, which was appropriately eerie.\n\nThis game truly shines in creating a great experience for the player. The voice acting is very good (if any of the actors and actresses are phoning in their performances in for an easy paycheck, they're too much the professionals to let it show), and the story is intriguing (though it was a little hard to follow at first).\n\nCombat is a lot of fun; the combination of interesting enemies, dynamic music, great dodges, combos, and quick-time events are woven together to create cinematic battles where the player controls the action. The first time I fought the Swamp Troll, and later when I went up against a massive golem (referred to as a Titan in this series), I knew this game was something special.\n\nOn a negative note, I will say that the environments for the boss battles are very boring; with a few exceptions, you always fight a boss in an open, arena-like space. I would have liked more "swinging on my chain whip to avoid attacks" and boss battles fought over chasms and so forth.\n\nLastly; the music in this game is AMAZING. It's possibly the best music in a video game (and many movies) that I have ever heard.\n\nI am not sure if this game FEELS like a Castlevania game. I was a big fan of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo games, and "Lords of Shadow" has a unique vibe. It's not a sequel or translation of the old stuff, but a total reinvention; this is a good thing though. If it was trying to be the original games and recycling the music and everything, it could not have shined as it does.","November 30, 2014","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sniperbr0/recommended/234080/","sniperbr0","Ganso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sniperbr0/","415 products in account","This is a game I was expecting to be much better than it actually was. It is a linear game with repetitive combat and a lot of filler levels.\n\nThe story is basically kill all three Lords of Shadow, so the protagonist`s wife can be resurrected. The plot reveals itself to be a little bit more complex than that. Based on what I know about Lords of Shadow 2, I was expecting a great ending, but I was disappointed.\n\nWhat keeps the game going is that it gets so boring and repetitive that just when you are about to give up, you either get a new ability or a great boss fight, so it brings the excitement up again. The combat features several sets of combos that you can purchase with in-game experience, but most of them are useless, you end up using your special powers which you obtain as you defeat bosses much more often.\n\nI can say that one of the few things I liked about this game is that the boss fights are how they are supposed to be: challenging.\n\nLast, but not least, there are some good puzzles in this game, and they are also very challenging. There is even a Vampire Chess game. The game would be better if the filler levels could be exchanged for more puzzles like the few ones present.\n\nI recommend skipping this game and looking for a better Castlevania.","December 25, 2014","false","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If they can't be bothered to make a quality port from a console game they do not deserve your money.  Games that have split second button sequences must have perfect controls, NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\nThis doesn't make the game unplayable, just certain parts are much more frustrating because changing the difficultly level does nothing to fix these problems.

From what I had seen online, the series seemed to have degraded into a number of identity-confused games (are we jumping puzzles, or are we adventure, or are we 3D, or are we side-scrolling?) featuring a number of feminine-looking male heroes.\n\nEventually I gave in while the game was on sale, and after it sat in my library for a few more months, I started playing.\n\nIt turns out to be a really good game.\n\nGameplay is fixed-camera third-person combat and exploration with an experience points system and unlockable skills and combos. The camera angles were typically well placed, though the environments hint at more exploration than what is really available.\n\nThe graphics are good, with rich visuals that are a real treat for fantasy fans. I particularly liked the castle of the vampires (which is not the final destination of the game, but is the "Castlevania" of the series) and the Land of the Dead, which was appropriately eerie.\n\nThis game truly shines in creating a great experience for the player. The voice acting is very good (if any of the actors and actresses are phoning in their performances in for an easy paycheck, they're too much the professionals to let it show), and the story is intriguing (though it was a little hard to follow at first).\n\nCombat is a lot of fun; the combination of interesting enemies, dynamic music, great dodges, combos, and quick-time events are woven together to create cinematic battles where the player controls the action. The first time I fought the Swamp Troll, and later when I went up against a massive golem (referred to as a Titan in this series), I knew this game was something special.\n\nOn a negative note, I will say that the environments for the boss battles are very boring; with a few exceptions, you always fight a boss in an open, arena-like space. I would have liked more "swinging on my chain whip to avoid attacks" and boss battles fought over chasms and so forth.\n\nLastly; the music in this game is AMAZING. It's possibly the best music in a video game (and many movies) that I have ever heard.\n\nI am not sure if this game FEELS like a Castlevania game. I was a big fan of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo games, and "Lords of Shadow" has a unique vibe. It's not a sequel or translation of the old stuff, but a total reinvention; this is a good thing though. If it was trying to be the original games and recycling the music and everything, it could not have shined as it does.","November 30, 2014","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

MANY. HEADACHES. because it is faster paced than the main game using an engine designed for the pace of the main game. It's been an annoyance in other games but this particular DLC has made me decide to hate whatever nebulous programmer first decided that double-tap running is a good thing.\n\n\nokay, after all that venting, let me get back on track- if you like castlevania, and you like God of war, the main game is a pretty solid game. it's kind of like the devs thought, "you know, there hasn't really been a good 3D castlevania...I wonder what we could really do about whip mechanics in a 3D game, though...oh yeah, God of War!"\n\nbut still, stay away from the DLC. it's just. awful.","June 13, 2014","true","38.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well for me this game was one of those. I've never played a Castlevania game but after reading the reviews about this series reboot, I thought this was a great time to start.\n\nIf you enjoy games like Darksiders, God of war and the Legacy of Kain games, this might interest you. It's not Dark souls or Diablo 3 but I had a feeling while playing this that it's got a similair aura about it, maybe it's the atmosphere or the backdrops but it's a nice dark atmospheric game.\n\nGraphically, very impressive. The character models and textures are brilliant. Sometimes the areas can get so busy to the eye that you arent even focusing on how pretty the game looks. There were moments I stopped just to look and take a screenshot, something I don't often do unless a game area looks awe inspiring and there are many moments of that here.\n\nSound wise, sometimes I like to turn of music to appreciate the ambient noise, the developers have worked very hard in this respect. The quality of music however, it reeeeaaally suits the gameplay!\n\nGameplay is frantic! Sometimes you can get by with button mashing but with certain encounters there is a certain skill to play this. If I could say one thing about the gameplay it's " Easy to pick up, tough to master". I felt like the game threw a lot of moves and combo's at me to learn but I realised after a while that they are just there to spice it up a bit, give the player the power to choose HOW they want to play. You're going to find that you'll buy all the combo's but just use the ones you want to play how you want, this to me is a brilliant design! It's not Batman combat, close but I'd say a little more challenging but not so much as Dark souls.\n\nThe story keeps you going and wanting to find out what happens next, when the game finishes, it's very nicely set up for the sequels with a  nice twist or two at the end.\n\nIf I could sum it up in one word, EPIC.","December 14, 2014","true","38.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The amount of combat, platforming, and puzzles make the game very fun. The game itself is very reminscent of the original Castlevania games. Some puzzles seem forced/tediously long and some encounters are just unneeded (the Chupacabras that steal your items and you must go find them to progress).\n\nEach mission has its own challenge, usually involving a test of endurance or other skill (complete puzzle in X moves), which gives each mission an added replay, with replays also required for obtaining life/mana gems and larger inventory quantities. Each mission is a separate level, so its easy to go back and forth, and completion is only required for story progression.\n\nOne serious problem with this game is the number of QTEs you are exposed to. Grapple attacks have a QTE element, which penalize you for failure. Boss fights are replete with QTEs. Also I was confused how the QTE worked at first, as the concentric circles was not clear at the start.\n\nRegardless of the QTEs, I had a lot of fun playing this game.\n\nPros:\n- Great soundtrack.\n- Fantastic levels\n- Great story, a bit cliche, but still epic.\n- Satisfying combat. Very DMC-esque.\n- Some funpuzzles (one of the DLC ones is fill in the blank with a chessboard).\n\nCons:\n- Chupacabras encounters.\n- Some really simple puzzles that appear just to slow your progress.\n- Terrible amount of QTEs involved (QTE for opening gates? Really?)\n- Short. I was able to complete the main story line (sans DLC) in about 18-19 hours. There is a lot of room for some replay, so this could double potentially.","December 14, 2014","true","27.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of the usual Metroidvania style gameplay, which is wonderful by the way, we have something that feels a lot like God of War, Devil May Cry, sprinkled with some area traversal and platforming from Uncharted. Overall, this is a damn solid game with a ton of value, because it will take at least 15 hours to complete! Good combat, lovely visuals, epic story, awesome light/dark magic mechanics, cool boss fights, and a HUGE variety of locales!\n\nI'll talk about the flaws present in this game, because it's not all a Castlevania game can be. There's a ton of useless combos that are difficult to remember, as the game seems to encourage button mashing most of the time, but I did my best to do a variety of attacks. Some enemies are challenging, while some are just difficult beyond belief, while the bosses remain pitiful and easy most of the time, except the final boss and perhaps two other bosses. Some enemies or bosses do a good job discouraging button mashing, but it's not always the case.\n\nThe music is good, but it didn't feel anything like Symphony of the Night or other Castlevania games. It made the game feel more like a generic melodramatic fantasy adventure at the few beginning chapters, until later when it steadily felt more and more like a Castlevania game. Nothing much else to complain about the audio, the voice acting is good, and Patrick Stewart as Zobek is just AWESOME. Until near the very end, which I won't spoil.\n\nThe visuals are mostly stellar, with detailed textures, but I found a lot of strangely low res textures, but overall the environments are simply spectacular! Although you will often find yourself doing Uncharted style area traversal, with platforming that is sometimes impossible to fail, they serve to let you take in the eyecandy around you most of the time. Also, the lighting isn't the best, because a huge majority of the time the main character or enemies won't even cast shadows!\n\nOverall, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a strange beast. Some might view it as a write off or not that good of a game, because it appears to copy other games and ideas, but I'd like to view it more as paying homage to those concepts while steering the franchise in a different direction. In the end, this is a damn solid game that runs great on PC!","December 7, 2014","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visually the game is amazing with great graphics and scenic design, the one thing that stands out to me is the unforgettable soundtrack. We first get introduced to Gabriel Belmont, a member of a bortherhood of light. He has been put on a holy task to defeat the darklords of this world but he also has his own quest of revenge on his poor lovers death Marie. You will encounter many vile creatures through out the game such as vampires, werewolves, skeletons and much more.  Also I wont spoil it but there is some pretty amazing bosses sections\n\nI very much enjoyed this game and one of my all time favourites. I give it  9/10 rating.

The story is epic and generally interesting (though I did fight myself skipping some of the Patrick Stewart-narrated chapter section intros near the end). The environments are similarly epic in scale and visuals and are reminiscent of the God of War titles at times. Theres plenty of gothic monster fighting goodness in here so if you're in the mood to kill some werewolves, trolls, vampires, etc, this'll scratch that itch.\n\nBUT - and its a big one, that almost made this a "No" - theres a couple aspects that could easily drive people to rage quit: the game tutorials (and sometimes, lack thereof), control consistency, and the fact the game seems to "insist upon itself", which all kinda tie into each other frequently.\n\nThe easy one first - the placement of tutorials in this game is utterly bizarre. While I was playing through the game I found myself saying two things over, and over, and over again - "Yea, I get it, I know what I have to do. STOP SHOWING ME THE SAME TUTORIAL TEXT / CINEMATIC /  EACH TIME I FAIL" and "WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?" If one or the other was ever-present throughout the game, I'd understand it. Maybe not like it, but I'd understand it. The over-abundance of tutorials in one location and complete lack of them in others was weird bit, and seemed like the designers couldn't decide on a direction / amount of handholding to give players.\n\nAlong similar lines, controls seem to be a bit bizarre and inconsistent at times, and often for no reason. For example, you basically have to use RT / Right Trigger (if you use controller of course, wasn't brave enough to try K/M) for EVERY puzzle, wall-climbing section, interaction, etc. and the necessity of the player having to [Hold] RT vs just [Press] RT is never consistent, and sometimes, Holding the trigger will make interactions mysteriously fail for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe "Insisting upon itself" bit is a little more hard to define. The game just seems to really want to make you spend alot of time with it - simple menu interactions seem to take a bit longer than necessary. For example, everytime you get a health/magic upgrade, you gotta watch the same. damn. self congratulatory little 15-20s cinematic as little icons spin and combine, and WOOPDEDOO YOU GET MORE HEALTH. LIKE THE OTHER 4 TIMES. Similarly, as you enter new cool looking areas always get camera cinematics that seem to scream "SEE? LOOK HOW MUCH TIME WE SPENT ON THIS AREA? ISN'T IT COOL?" Then theres the boss fights. GET READY FOR QUICK TIME EVENTS. Once you deal your killing blows, you go into a QTE and instead of spending time looking at how cool the cinematics are (which they are generally and one of the few places where I WANT to sit back and see how cool it is), you'll spend you're time waiting for that damned little timed white circle that indicates a QTE to pop up, so you don't have to redo the last part of the fight.\n\nSo while this is a "Yes", its absolutely a "soft Yes" - take those negatives into consideration since by the end of the game, you'll be ready for it to be over as a result; i'd say it was still worth the ride even with the headaches, but mileage may vary.","December 8, 2013","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, it frees up more buttons for moves and combos. Graphically it's superb, i'm on my second playthrough and it hasn't lost its sparkle, even after two years.\n\nThis game is far superior to its sequel, mainly due to the variety in its environments and enemies.

Now I will be the first to admit I am not good at this kind of game, but I did find this game very enjoyable.\n\nThe best part for me would just be the story. I picked up the game because it looked interesting and really played it because two of the voice actors, but the game delivered the story nicely (until the dlc's but that's a different story there).\n\nNow while the game was fun and enjoyable it did have moments where playing it was a pain or just frustrating. The camera being fixed can easily screw you up or just cause you to end up jumping the wrong direction when it suddenly switches on you... For me though the largest problem was some of the combat design moving to mouse and keyboard that just didn't work well. This is during the stone titan fight and the witch crow  where you have to swing their attack back at them. I spent over an hour getting used to it on the titan where i had to hit asdw (in that order) as fast as I could and it felt rigged to fail for those of us who prefer mouse and keyboard over all other controls.\n\nThose are my largest complements. I've not finished the dlcs yet mainly for getting stuck on them (my own fault not the games) and I will admit I wish it was done in the same over all style the rest of the game was. The graphics were wonderful and it felt as if I would watching a movie during the cut-scenes and it flowed nicely back into the game where as the dlcs' method is just distracting.\n\nAnyway, I do recommend this game game for the story and all but those two boss fights (all the other fights were wonderful and really fun) it is a hack and slash so some combat is repetitive. Over all the game was fun and enjoyable. If you don't want to be frustrated with it, get an xbox 360 control and use that instead of mouse and keyboard and it will run great. There is no  fix for the camera though, but once you're used to it, it's a little less frustrating.","August 23, 2014","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In SotC you have to find out how to weaken the giant beast, find the weak point, hurt it, then find another. Here you just dodge an attack or two, do some quicktime events, follow a linear path up the beast and hurt the blatently obvious weak spot. And worst of all, CUTSCENES DURING THE BOSS BATTLE, LITERALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT THERE WAS A CUTSCENE THEN YOU CONTINUE. The fact this game got high scores, was generally well recieved, and was given a sequel is deplorable. This perpetuates bad game design as being good enough if you make enough money.

It's strongest point was that it had a really solid fighting system, along with abilities that were  progressively unlocked.

My only real complaint as far as unlocks go was that some one in particular came late in the game, but overall they unlocked at a good rate. This i\n\nThe story itself was pretty good. It's nothing new, but it's nor inherently bad it just pretty predictable; especially the so called plot twist that can be spotted coming a mile away. But, the characters themselves were interesting and the voice actors were top notch.\n\nMy biggest gripe would be the camera angles. At times it felt like I was constantly battling the game to get a decent viewing angle. This is further compounded by some of the hidden items being out of view, mostly due to the fact that the camera was often at a static angle and until you stepped into the right spot you wouldn't be able to see it.\n\nDespite any complaints or misgivings I may have mentioned, overall Castlevania Lords of Shadow was a lot of fun to play and a great game overall.

The cutscenes are great. Everything else? I hated almost everything else. The combat is a akin to God of War, except it leans more toward the Devil May Cry school of having to hit enemies a ridiculous number of times to kill them. Little skirmishes bored me to tears. The only time anything relevant happened was at the beginning of a level, when you got a fancy-looking cutscene. This game would've made a better CGI movie that a game. Also, people wanting that "Metroidvania" gameplay element may as well look elsewhere. There were...I believe six power-ups that I had to replay levels for because you couldn't get them the first time you visit. The entire metagame of finding these items is nothing more than the developers hiding the items as well as they possibly could. The equipment upgrades feel minor until the last one, a point long past the time I wanted to quit playing. Also, the game violates its own lore multiple times. I won't spoil how, but if you have a brain, it should be obvious if you read the vampire entries in your codex and then play the DLC (included). I only paid $10.79, but I wish someone had paid me to play this. The game was torturous. I do not recommend it at all. However, everyone seems to love it except people who liked the original games because it's not like the original games. I think it just sucks as a game in general.","December 22, 2013","false","45.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of the usual Metroidvania style gameplay, which is wonderful by the way, we have something that feels a lot like God of War, Devil May Cry, sprinkled with some area traversal and platforming from Uncharted. Overall, this is a damn solid game with a ton of value, because it will take at least 15 hours to complete! Good combat, lovely visuals, epic story, awesome light/dark magic mechanics, cool boss fights, and a HUGE variety of locales!\n\nI'll talk about the flaws present in this game, because it's not all a Castlevania game can be. There's a ton of useless combos that are difficult to remember, as the game seems to encourage button mashing most of the time, but I did my best to do a variety of attacks. Some enemies are challenging, while some are just difficult beyond belief, while the bosses remain pitiful and easy most of the time, except the final boss and perhaps two other bosses. Some enemies or bosses do a good job discouraging button mashing, but it's not always the case.\n\nThe music is good, but it didn't feel anything like Symphony of the Night or other Castlevania games. It made the game feel more like a generic melodramatic fantasy adventure at the few beginning chapters, until later when it steadily felt more and more like a Castlevania game. Nothing much else to complain about the audio, the voice acting is good, and Patrick Stewart as Zobek is just AWESOME. Until near the very end, which I won't spoil.\n\nThe visuals are mostly stellar, with detailed textures, but I found a lot of strangely low res textures, but overall the environments are simply spectacular! Although you will often find yourself doing Uncharted style area traversal, with platforming that is sometimes impossible to fail, they serve to let you take in the eyecandy around you most of the time. Also, the lighting isn't the best, because a huge majority of the time the main character or enemies won't even cast shadows!\n\nOverall, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a strange beast. Some might view it as a write off or not that good of a game, because it appears to copy other games and ideas, but I'd like to view it more as paying homage to those concepts while steering the franchise in a different direction. In the end, this is a damn solid game that runs great on PC!","December 7, 2014","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why? To make this review count. Im really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at people who made this game, not because its bad, but because they ruined it. Its like hitting your self with a frying pan, or more like painting a beautiful painting, and then smacking it with dog poop.\n\nWhy game is GOOD?\n> Great story that ties somehow all castlevania games together ( one bad thing about it: its dull at the beginning, yet keeps getting better over time)\n> Great enemy and in general graphical desing ( Landscapes, monsters, everything looks great, exept for the final boss... he looks unfinished and pathetic, but maybe thats the point?)\n> The combat system is original, takes a lot of time to master the focus meter and usage of magic but over all its fun ( nvm useless combos that you wont even bother to learn after you have the good ones)\n> I need to point out how smart they animated the whip attacks in 3D. Looks REALLY REALLY impressing\n> Actually has this "castlevania" feel (for most of the part\n\nNow what kills the game?\n\n> Fixed on player camera - Tell me! Why the ♥♥♥♥ lock the camera on angles that are for most parts nonsense? When you play a 3D game you NEED to control the camera. You NEED to see where you are jumping etc. I cant count all the times i jumped into my doom, because the camera didnt even show me a platform somewhere else. Althou the camera works sort of OK in combat, there is no reason to fix it on landscapes, when you are trying to make a tricky jump. Also, whats the point of making awsome landscapes, if the player cant even see them! Because the camera thinks otherwise. ♥♥♥♥ the camera. And dont tell me "its a fixed camera game". NO, fixing a camera in a 3D platformer on the player is just evil and wrong. Take a lesson from darksiders devs. camera should be controlable via the mouse or pad\n\n> Hit detection - This is a thing that should be fixed before the game release. First off there are times where Gabriel takes damage in the same moment as the enemy attack animation starts. What does this mean? It looks wrong and makes some attacks unblockable and undodge able. Even if you have uber reflexes, the game expects you to be a prophet. Other times the animation shows clearly that you should have been hit, but the game thinks otherwise. Yeaah sometimes a huge sword just flies throu your body without making even a scratch. wtf. This is either a problem of the hitbox, or hit timer. Im just going to call it broken hit detection.\n\n> QTE - You might say that there are too mane QTE in the game, but i actually like them + they are not sooo anoying, dont worry :)\n\n>neccesery backtracking - dont get me wrong, backtracking is a good thing if you want to find all the secrets and stuff, but its a sin if you HAVE to backtrack orelse you dont get any power ups, without those power ups you will have a very hard and unfair challenge. Also backtracking is good for exploration games, where there is a open world. I have nothing against invisible walls, but if you cant explore the world, why force the player to backtrack levels? This is just a cruel way to make the playtime longer\n\nAnd thats all, believe it or not but if not for these 2 issues that ruin the whole experience. I would call this a 10/10 game, because castlevania! It even recyles some of classic enemies, and there are some eastereggs so to call.\n\nTL;DR\nI recommend this game from my heart, its great\n\nBUT BEWARE:\n>locked camera\n>broken hit detection","January 18, 2015","false","60.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zathorix/recommended/234080/","zathorix","Zathorix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zathorix/","129 products in account","This game was recommended to me by my brother, so I decided to pick it up on sale. The reviews were mixed, but I like the genre, and for the price, it seemed like a fine deal at the time.\n\nThere are several ways a game can be bad. Some games are buggy, some look horrible, some have a terrible story... Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is none of these, although I haven't gotten far enough into it to really comment on the story. This game plays like it was made by someone who has heard of video games, maybe even seen bits of a God of War let's play, but never actually played one.\n\nCastlevania: LoS is barely a game at times. The actual gameplay mostly consists of the combat - which is fun for while, but ultimately lacks depth - and some platforming. That's pretty much it. Between combat encounters and platforming 'puzzles', the game often wrenches control away from you in order to focus the camera on the environment and the setpieces, or on a monster entering the scene. And, in case you felt just a tad too much in control, the game makes sure that you'll never go two minutes without a *ding* sound to indicate a tutorial message. Apparently, the game feels the need to point out you need to hold RT to examine that dead knight's body every ♥♥♥♥ing time. It feels like the game has very low expectations of the average gamer's attention span.\n\nThe combat system, as I mentioned before, makes a good impression in the demo, but that brief taste is really all there is to it. You have a chain weapon, blatantly ripped off from God of War by the way, which has a short range attack - X - and a higher range, sweeping attack - Y. Oooh, a two button attack system! That means there will be combos involved, right? Indeed, it does. It doesn't, however, mean that the combo system is any good. Which it isn't. The combos work, and they do their job, but in my experience, mashing X and Y works just as well. You can also block enemy attacks, but you'll never do that because the same button is bound to the dodge function. All in all, the combat is fun in itself, but ultimately lacks the depth you'd expect in a game where combat is really the only exciting thing you can do.\n\nThe platforming is as basic as it gets. You shuffle along ledges, jump from cliff to cliff, occasionally climb up or down walls when there's a conveniently placed gripping point for your hookshot available. Nothing remotely groundbreaking here.\n\nFinally, I'll blatantly rehash what pretty much every review under the sun has already stated about this game: LoS lacks focus. It takes bits and pieces from other games and stitches them together in this Frankenstein's Monster of a video game, but never really adds anything of its own. It's a bit God of War, a bit Darksiders, a bit Shadow of the Colossus with the bossfights, and a whole ♥♥♥♥load of nothing.\n\nIf you're still teetering on the edge of making a purchasing decision, research a bit. Read some other reviews, watch some gameplay footage, look through my Steam profile to see which games I actually do like, and come back to it later.\n\nAlso, if you just really badly want a spectacle fighter, get DmC: Devil May Cry, a highly underrated game with a very satisfying combat system. Alternatively, Metal Gear Rising gets high praise as well. There aren't a lot of spectacle fighters on PC, but I think that will change in the near future.","February 23, 2014","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I will be the first to admit I am not good at this kind of game, but I did find this game very enjoyable.\n\nThe best part for me would just be the story. I picked up the game because it looked interesting and really played it because two of the voice actors, but the game delivered the story nicely (until the dlc's but that's a different story there).\n\nNow while the game was fun and enjoyable it did have moments where playing it was a pain or just frustrating. The camera being fixed can easily screw you up or just cause you to end up jumping the wrong direction when it suddenly switches on you... For me though the largest problem was some of the combat design moving to mouse and keyboard that just didn't work well. This is during the stone titan fight and the witch crow  where you have to swing their attack back at them. I spent over an hour getting used to it on the titan where i had to hit asdw (in that order) as fast as I could and it felt rigged to fail for those of us who prefer mouse and keyboard over all other controls.\n\nThose are my largest complements. I've not finished the dlcs yet mainly for getting stuck on them (my own fault not the games) and I will admit I wish it was done in the same over all style the rest of the game was. The graphics were wonderful and it felt as if I would watching a movie during the cut-scenes and it flowed nicely back into the game where as the dlcs' method is just distracting.\n\nAnyway, I do recommend this game game for the story and all but those two boss fights (all the other fights were wonderful and really fun) it is a hack and slash so some combat is repetitive. Over all the game was fun and enjoyable. If you don't want to be frustrated with it, get an xbox 360 control and use that instead of mouse and keyboard and it will run great.

I think I precisely liked it for the fixed camera: it's the first time I actually played a game with a controller, and not having to worry about the camera sure did help me in being comfortable with the controls.\n\nthe story is... a bit cliche, but overall good. I liked it. What would you expect for a video game story, anyway?\n\nthe gameplay is just fantastic, even if you are not used to play with a controller, trust me, get one!! it feels like the only way to play this. it just feels natural, good.\n\nthe lenght, well, around 25 hours according to steam. too short for full price (there's no way I'll  pay more than 1E/hour for almost any game), but since I got it on sale...

Quicktime events and button mashing are not good game design and the Shadow of the Colossus enemies lack all of the creativity and wonderment of SotC. LoS is literally button mashing, quicktime events, and terrible puzzles. Putting a stone in a glowing statue and then rotating it slightly is not a puzzle it is a task. In SotC you have to find out how to weaken the giant beast, find the weak point, hurt it, then find another. Here you just dodge an attack or two, do some quicktime events, follow a linear path up the beast and hurt the blatently obvious weak spot. And worst of all, CUTSCENES DURING THE BOSS BATTLE, LITERALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT THERE WAS A CUTSCENE THEN YOU CONTINUE. The fact this game got high scores, was generally well recieved, and was given a sequel is deplorable. This perpetuates bad game design as being good enough if you make enough money. I can't get into the story with this level of terrible gameplay, if the story is so good make it a movie or a book, don't give me this garbage.","August 27, 2014","false","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's strongest point was that it had a really solid fighting system, along with abilities that were  progressively unlocked. The fighting always felt really satisfying and switching between various abilities to keep your momentum going is a lot of fun.  My only real complaint as far as unlocks go was that some one in particular came late in the game, but overall they unlocked at a good rate. This i\n\nThe story itself was pretty good. It's nothing new, but it's nor inherently bad it just pretty predictable; especially the so called plot twist that can be spotted coming a mile away. But, the characters themselves were interesting and the voice actors were top notch.\n\nMy biggest gripe would be the camera angles. At times it felt like I was constantly battling the game to get a decent viewing angle. This is further compounded by some of the hidden items being out of view, mostly due to the fact that the camera was often at a static angle and until you stepped into the right spot you wouldn't be able to see it.\n\nDespite any complaints or misgivings I may have mentioned, overall Castlevania Lords of Shadow was a lot of fun to play and a great game overall. I would definitely recommend CLoS to any fans of Hack n Slash genre or God of War type fighting.","August 28, 2014","true","38.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storyline was quite immersive, thanks largely in part to the incredible voice acting.  The gameplay was generally quite varied as you develop new skills and discover equipment upgrades.  It did get a little overwhelming with all the combat moves, and to be honest most of them see little use other than in solving some of the puzzles, but at least there are some options.  I haven't played any Castelvania games since Nintendo had the license but I will definitely pick up others from here on in.\n\nI will add a note in regards to the DLC.  While the first of the two adds some intriguing gameplay with some more puzzles and an opportunity to play as an alternate character in some scenes, the second is just plain terrible.  It was nothing but movement based mechanics with little options for any of the combat challenges presented in the core game.  The last boss battle is incredibly frustrating and based entirely on angling your attacks rather than choosing the right attack for the job or timing your blocks (none of the attacks can be blocked) and counterstriking.  In addition, the substitution of 2d comic scenes rather than cutscenes felt incredibly lazy, though the voice acting was retained.  Having said all that it certainly wasn't enough to take away from the overall game enjoyment and with the Ultimate Edition you aren't really paying any extra for it.","November 5, 2015","true","32.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good because it is entertaining. Bad because I didn't have the endurance for that length from this kind of game and just wanted to have the pay off of the game being over.) (80+ Hours on Pokemon is one thing, 20+ hours on this game was a little much for me.)\n- A little glitchy (my game would freeze during some of the Baba Yaga cut scenes, and there were a few platforming glitches or lever issues)\n- I hate the Titan fights, but there are only a few of them\n- Easy game for a casual gamer to get into (I'm a very casual gamer.)\n- QUALITY voice acting from the main cast\n- Very different from your average Castlevania (You spend most of your time OUT of a castle, you don't have as many monsters, and the format of the game reminds me of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time for some reason)\n- Fun puzzles (except for that dumb blood cup one)\n- Interesting Character Design (Like, I LOVE the concept art in the game)\n- Gabriel is a cutie.\n- Graphics are pretty great too. Landscapes are gorgeous. People have a little of that uncanny valley going on. (Especially Marie. Those dead eyes...)\n- Really great soundtrack.\n- Fighting system is pretty easy to get a grip on. Combos aren't that hard to remember or figure out either.\n- RELICS. (I really liked the Relics along with Gabriel's super fancy cross whip thing.)\n\nOverall, I really liked this game.

I love 2d castlevania and have played the ♥♥♥♥ off and completed maybe half a dozen of the more recent ones.\n\nLords of Shadow, whilst gorgeous, nicely voice acted, and fairly atmospheric (if you don't mind yourself some rather cheesy cliché) misses out on most of what makes 2d castlevania so great.\n\nA fixed ingame camera becomes the method by which secrets are hidden, often they're deliberately placed in the foreground so they'll be in plain sight of the main character, but hidden to the player.\n\nClimbing puzzles are far too frequent, totally linear, and therefore boring, combat is totally repetitive, and length is padded to a tedious degree with constant sidequests and pointless distractions. "Retreive 3 keys from 3 guardians before you can progress" Then there are characters that steal all your equipment and spells every 2-3 chapters, hampering your progress and forcing you to play hide and seek with them for 5-10 minutes when all you want to do is get a move on.\n\nUsually Castlevania games are all about using your abilities to explore branching paths. Here though, whilst it looks like there are many paths to explore, it's just an illusion. Ledges, paths and side tracks are all just part of the scenery and can't be accessed, even when you have abilities that should allow it. (You couldn't even run off a cliff if you tried to for most of the game as every edge has an invisible wall preventing you from going that way.) and the few areas you might discover early on are fenced off by arbitrary obstacles, not allowing you to pass until you've beaten chapter X and unlocked the Y ability. In classic Castlevania those areas will lead to whole new sections and secrets, in Lords of Shadow, all it leads to are 1 of three pickups that will increase your life, light or dark magic by a miniscule amount.\n\nBig whoop.\n\nBut it for some nice graphics and if it's super cheap.

I've been a fan for many years. I never thought they could even come close to what was done in Symphony of the Night. Which I still think is probably the best game in the Castlevania Saga.\n\nThis game was just a enjoyable experience to play from the visuals to the combat and most of all the story telling. The Voice acting is very well done and some of the best i've heard in a long time. The gothic feel and art design are some of the best i've seen. Very few games have made me stop and check out the scenery. I take very few screen shots of games and I found myself stopping taking the time to take quite a few. The Music is just awesome it added so much to the game and is one of the reasons why I like Symphony of the Night so much. This game knocks it out of the park with atomosphere and the music that just elevates it to another level.\n\nI really enjoyed the combat and the game does a great job of equally making the progression of your powers and difficulty flow together. Plus you can increase it to be quite difficult if you choose to do so.\n\nI see alot of people were complaining about the camera angles and how you can't control it. I did find it a little difficult at times but I felt it added kind of atmosphere to the game. Alot of the power ups are hidden throughtout the game and I think  the angles made me want to explore every nook and cranny of the levels to find them. I can understand how it could be frustrating at times. Overall I don't think it takes away too much from the game itself.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone of enjoys a game with great visuals, great story line, awesome music and just an overall enjoyable experience. I can't wait for the Sequel and to see what happens in Lords of Shadow II.\n\n","February 14, 2014","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The quality is good, the graphics are good too, but the gameplay and story, ♥♥♥♥ there is something wrong there.\n\nThe battles are similar to assassin creed. In fact, almost exactly the same except that in assassin creed, you always hit your opponents close because you had a dagger and your fists. In this game, you got a freaking cross whip that hit from far, so it's not that great contrary to logic. You often try to shoot your whip in the direction of your opponent only to see it hit just right next to it. I don't know if its the not terrybly good angle the camera is pointed at all the time or what, but its especially terrible when you jump and try to hit anything. So you basically don't jump unless you sent something in the air with a combo. Laaaame.\n\nThe interface is faaaaar from intuitive so you often hit critical point in the game where you basically have to hit the buttons just right or you die and have to try it again 15 millions times before you get it right. And that is on normal difficulty. I don't want to know what hard difficulty and 'paladin insane' difficulty have to offer. So expect a lot of replay of the same scene and monsters over and over and over until you are sick of it or you like to repeat to perfection the same crap (which some people apparently do).\n\nThere are a couple of puzzle in the game, which brings some originality to it and lots of platforming puzzle, like in the swamp where you have to advance only when the bubbles stop showing. Those are nice. The problems is that all the weak mobs seems to hit you even when you block for some reason (or dodge). They don't hit hard but after the 10th hit, your hp is very low and the freaking healing fountains are only located in the stage when you are already at full health! This is especially ♥♥♥♥♥♥ just before hitting a boss and you're in the red with your hp. Then you have to do the boss over and over and over because he one shot you with your low hp. Quite a big waste of time.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, you got the ♥♥♥♥ing autosave checkpoint feature. At first, it looks great saving for you so you don't have to think about it, but the problem is that each freaking time i had to redo part of a stage, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ autosave recorded me when i'm at my lowest hp, so i have to redo the scene with even worse health than the first time! That's no fun. It was fun in the nintendo 8 bit day when they couldn't do long games so they cranked up the difficulty to 11 so that it looked like it was a long game because we had to redo most part 1 million time before passing them, but today it aint that good. I got millions other game to play now, so i ain't spending all my time on 1 game because the difficulty is rediculus!\n\nThe story is practically the same exact ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t love story 'cry' 'cry' somber hero lost his wife to evil and must now battle eeeeevil to take revenge. Crap where did i see that story before.... mmmm almost all castlevania before it and quite a bit of other games! Laaaaaamo! I prefer the first casltevania on nintendo 8 bit that didn't really care about the story and made no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about it. You kill monster and thats all! Here they try to make a deep story but it fails badly. It's also funny how the hero is supposed to be somber tough guy when he is so gorgeous he looks like he's coming out of a freaking top model show. All his 'brotherhood' use normal steel armor, but not him! Super hot gorgeous leather clad red painted must have cost an estate armor! And he was raised by monks? And he got married? Hmmmm Hmmm. please tell me more of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story that makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense whatsoevar! You know i like a good story as long as it has some sense and logic in it even if its high in magic, technology science fiction or even god occurrence, but this one tries hard but the logic goes out the windows in a bad way. So the story looks like crap the more you learn about it. Maybe at the end its worth it, but i'm not sure ill be able to even get there so what the hell?\n\nAs you progress and kill things, you get experience and with it you can buy new skills. This looks like a good thing, but because of the weird angle of the camera and the fact that you miss your hit quite often, it means that in the end, you use the press 'A' 'A' 'A' button simple combo almost 99.99999999% of the time, without jumping for nice combo maker either. Even against bosses. That means all those nice looking skills in the game, they ain't worth ♥♥♥♥ compared to your most basic and simple whip hit. WOW! These guys have gone to all the trouble to make a freaking complicated fight system that can look awesome, but then hitting the 'A' button is better than everything else all the time. What could go wrong there!\n\nVery disapointing game. I'm glad i got it for 7$ because honestly it ain't worth more even if it has AAA quality studio behind it. The gameplay and fighting ain't that fun. The story is dull and full of holes.","February 14, 2014","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, for those of you who have played Dante's Inferno (which was only on console I believe), this game is superior in every way.\n\nGraphics: Massive, haunting landscapes with excellent ambient effects such as rain and frost on the screen. I don't think the graphics could have been much better given the time and what the creators were aiming for.\n\nSound: Adrenaline-driving Gothic-style soundtrack that picks up at exactly the right moments. Useful sound cues when an offscreen enemy has been spawned. Also, Patrick Stewart as the voice of Sean Connery/Ramirez (from Highlander) man. The weapons sound effects are substantial and pair well with the force feedback on an Xbox 360 controller.\n\nControls/Gameplay: Flowing controls and somewhat simple combat/combo system which is conducive to button mashing. However, enemies usually dodge on the second or third strike so button-mashing is of limited utility.\n\nPros: This is truly a stellar game, with immersive graphics and sound with an engrossing storyline somewhat in the vein of Dante's Inferno (both the literary work and the console game). Significant replay value for completionists.\n\nCons: Not too many. If anything, the combo system could have used slightly more complexity to add more depth to the combat, but this may not have been feasible after everything was mapped out on the XBox controller (yes, you should definitely use one to play this game).\n","September 2, 2015","true","68.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(This plays a bit more like Onimusha.)\n\nThis title has solid graphics, good sound, and good controls. The difficulty curve scales nicely - Knight difficulty requires running some engagements perfectly in order to advance. Whip combat is pretty decent. There's a system of "runes" that allow you to heal or do greater damage. Giant monsters can be tamed and ridden. If this is sounding a lot like God of War, unfortunately, it's several steps wide of the mark - but this IS very much like the feel of Onimusha.

You'll probably have a vague idea but it is fun to see how it actually plays out. It's worth sticking through and if you find yourself a little weary at first...well you're a Castlevania fan, deal with it and push on. If you're about halfway through and still don't like it then it may not be for you.\n\nThe combat is decent, and you'll learn a lot of new moves as you go along.

Boss battles are enjoyable and some will make you think a tiny bit. There are some frustrating bits though.\n\nPuzzles are fun, but entirely skippable if you hate them.\n\nOverall I'd recommend the game! However the DLC...not so much.

Seriously, the DLC chapters aren't great.  Bottom line: If you like God of War-like action games with a healthy amount of QTEs, this is a game for you.  If you're a fan of Super Castlevania or Symphony of the Night and you're looking to relive those experiences, this game will only disapoint you.","March 7, 2014","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And most of all great story telling by Patric Stewart.\nPersonally I could only compare this plot to the Legacy of Kain series which has quite similar world and great plot also.\n+Puzzles\nIn first chapter I was afraid that there won't be puzzles at, when I stumbled across first one I was not impress.\nBut during whole game puzzles become more complex, harder and more interesting, with great vampire chess at first place, this is also big advantage of this game.\nThere is less puzzles than in PoP or LoK, but they are harder and more sophisticated. From possible cons this become one of the major pros of this game.\n+Combat\nFirst thing which I may not like in this game. There is a lot of Combos, but these are not very effective(visually and practically).\nattacks with magic are ok, but they are limited and keybord input lag which I and lot of PC players had didn't help with performing them.\nPop and LoK combat system ware much simpler but I personally prefer one from Darksiders series which was almost perfect.\n+Graphic, level design and overall visual experience\nGenerally graphics  are beautiful, it of course can't be compared to PC's FPS shooters, but it please the eye. Level designs are great and varied, similar to those in LoK but both games had resemble\ndark fantasy universes.\n+Music, voice.\nI fall in love into "Belmont's Journey theme". But whole soundtrack is absolutely amassing and epic. It fits this game perfectly.\nVoice acting is also definitely pros of this game.\n\nSome major cons, as I wrote above combat system could be better. Levels between beginning and end of many chapters are just boring because most of the actual story is at the ends of the chapters.\n\nAs a conclusion well this is just epic game. All action-adventure games and slashers fans should go for it.\nPC port could be better thou. I used to playing this kind of games on keybord, but input lag was...annoying, especially in 2nd DLC boss(If you know what I mean :))\n","March 8, 2014","true","32.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems generic in its combat approach, and the boss fights really are too much like Shadow of the Colossus (though not as long or as elaborate).  It looks pretty, sounds quite nice, and has stellar voice acting; but the gameplay is lacking and the story is lackluster.","March 8, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chapter 2 can be a little long and the camera can be problematic at times but these are minor issues in the overall picture.  The game really picks up after chapter 4 and keeps going strong to the fantastic ending.  Fans of the Castlevania series should give this a shot.","March 8, 2014","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me Castlevania Curse of Darkness is one of my favorite games ever. I tried giving this game multiple shots on Xbox and Pc and i just dont like it. It's tedious. The camera angles suck. The combat isn't all that great. Enemies attack right through your hardest hits. It doesnt allow you to feel powerful at all. Your best bet is just sitting there waiting to get a perfectly timed counter. Cool at first but it gets boring quick. I can't recommend this game as i just dont think it's all that enjoyable","March 9, 2014","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
