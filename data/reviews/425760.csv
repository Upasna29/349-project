If you like brain teasers mixed with some platforming, this one is well made. You slide the level around to allow a robot to reach the end destination while collecting as many points along the way and getting there as fast as possible to increase your score. You don't control the robot, you press play and robot begins walking, you can have the robot do things like shoot obstructions, jump, or stop walking until you tell him to again, depending on the rules for that row/tile.\n\nYou can slide the level around after you start the timer to get to the end, making the challenge getting a better score and no so much just surviving to the end room\n\nChill ambient tunes that match the game's aesthetic\n\nAs I said, if you enjoy brain teasers its a good buy, if you're a broke ♥♥♥ gamer, maybe wait for a sale","February 25","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
