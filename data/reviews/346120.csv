Every weapon is unique in its own way and some of their effects are actually fun to use. They can even be used right away during battle after unlocking.\n\nThere are different variety of game modes you can try out (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Zombies, and more) and a bunch of maps that provide a real effect on the battle (Ice on the ground, traps, water). If you create a server you can even mess around with the options for a better experience.\n\nYou can talk to players via typing.\n\nGameplay runs smoothly most of the time on my laptop with settings set to low and windowed.\n\nDownloading and installing is quick and easy.\n\n----------------\n\nRight now the server list is sparce. You have to either wait awile for a server to be open or create your own and wait for more players to join. So you can't just jump right in with other players sometimes.\n\nThere was some lag that shows in a way that aiming and movement gets difficult.\n\nYou can be spawned-killed easily if you don't move away after invincibility wears off. Even when switching loadouts or weapons.\n\n----------------\n\nMovement is easy, yet difficult to master.\n\nThe game can be customized to suit what you want on your screen, like the crosshairs, the color of your character, and  even the sound of landing a hit on your opponent. Think there are others I haven't tried out yet.\n\nThere is a map editor. Haven't touched it so I don't know much about it.\n\n----------------\n\nRecommend it if you like the multiplayer experience and/or want to kill some boredom.","February 24, 2015","true","3.8"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","62","67","9","0"

"BORING Man"....how boring can this be?  I saw the trailer and was interested in putting that name to the test.  And my result?....\n\n\nThis...is one BORING game...you hear me?   This is a BORING game for BORING people.\n\n\n\n..........This game redefines "Boring".  It's a stickman combat game that anybody can pick up and play with a minimalistic hands-on tutorial.  There is a small "Boring" lore to keep you interested...all focusing on our hero Boring Man in his legacy to end The Man.\n\nAs for how this game plays?   Imagine playing TF2, except only having one class......now imagine that one class being customizeable with grenades and ALL weapons in the entire game in a way that you essentially make your own class.  The customization here gives you a massive freedom of choice and a chance to experiment after death as you can change your load-out after ever death if you so choose.\n\n\nPros:\nNew boring weapons after every level up (When you get them all, you are eligible for golden weapons.  Great for customization)\nNice boring main menu theme\nMultiple boring modes including survival, zombie survival, CTF, CP, parkour, and deathmatch.\nBoring taunts like barfing, smoking, drinking, etc.\nOptional boring bosses.\nRumor has it, this can run on almost any ancient, dinosaur-model boring PC.\nBoring Customization that lets you make whatever boring playstyle you prefer.\nBoringly Free.\n\n\nCons:\nA port-forward achievement is kind of.....off-putting (We're on Steam.  Simply joining through Steam would be a better option)\nCould use more servers.\n\n\n\nThis game is minimalistic, yet has so much.   This game is a case of having more with less.  Truly this game is one of the better free games on Steam.   One Manga Day could learn a thing or two from Spasman's Boring Man.  Truth be told, Boring Man is up there with Jigoku Kisetsukan (Another free Steam title).\n\n\nNow, it's not EPIC, but is great for any boring day.  Pick up Boring Man today, you boring players!!!\n\n8.75/10...such a boring score!","August 8, 2015","true","66.6"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","87","48","55","36","9"

It's "true free2p".\nThe only thing you can buy - in order to support a certain awesome dev - are cosmetics.\nThe gameplay is a great pile of explosions, giggles, blood, tranquilizer, bullets and awesome hats.\nThere also are lots of fun references and the lighthearted in-your-face nature of this thing is sure to keep you playing for quite a while. You can unlock LOADS of weapons and create your own Taser-Katana loadout, m'ladies will love this!\nBut then you see this fabulous laser gun you haven't unlocked yet - just encourage the fella holding it to drop it for you!\nThere is lots fun to be had for free!

Now THAT intrigued me. So, what do I think about it?\n\nWhat I like:Easy to learn, I remember getting to the top of the Tab list even though I'm lower than level 10\nSimplicity, it's a 2D online stickman platforming shooter, that pretty much summarises everything\nNO BUY TO WIN, thats right, for a F2P game, it's all about skill, money won't get you any gears, they only give you cool visual effects\nLevel ups and unlockables, you'll level up really fast and each level will grant you a new weapon randomly, I got my favorite weapon from the first few rolls so, it won't take long to find a weapon you will get attached to\nLoadouts, customise your own playstyle. Like going in slashing everything? Suicide bombing (sensitive topic :P)? Camp and snipe? Or a cool combo of grapling hooking to the back of your enemies and backstab/shoot them at the back of their head? This games got you covered.\nWhat I dislike:Not much strategizing, it's mostly just run and gun\nLaggy, as expected of an online game :\\nNo friend system, I wanna make friends >:(\nFinal Thoughts:It's a really fun F2P game with solid gameplay and a great time waster\nI give this game a high\n9/10I don't really see anything wrong with it, it's really good considering IT DOESN'T COST YOU A CENT, really worth playing in my opinion","February 28","true","9.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

This game is probably best to pass the time. I lke the game, the only things I think the developer should change is instead of press "E" on a ladder, just press "W" instead, and also when you press "W" to jump, it seems as if it lags a bit, like the time in between pressing "W" and actually jumping, so I hope the developer changes it so that you jump when you press "W" instantly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HyperLuke/recommended/346120/","HyperLuke","HyperLuke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HyperLuke/","38 products in account","Boring Man is a game which takes the mechanics of an FPS, removes a dimension (and regenerating health), puts in loads of crazy weapons, and everyone is a stick-man. This game is anything but tactical. It plays a lot like quake with fast paced movement, and rocket jumping. Most of the weapons were fun to use, encouraged new play styles, and had fun little quirks about them. Such as how when you crouch with the  machine gun, it turns it from a suppressor, into a great guarding weapon. All the modes were unique and interesting. You've got Death-match, Team death-match, CTF, survival, zombies, Take over, and weapons deal, which is like COD gun game. The modes again, felt very fun to play and CTF had its own interesting mechanic where there is a generator in each of the bases, this powers the defensive turret, ammo dispenser, and tele-porters, which make games very interesting. However there are some downsides, the game is very glitchy, having internet problems here and there, shots not registring, and more. The game could also be great with a single-player campaign, survival mode alone didn't feel like enough.\n\nOverall, Boring Man is an incredibly fun online 2D shooter, if your a fan of FPS games but want a change, Boring Man has a lot to offer. 8.5/10","May 18","true","85.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It’s the first time you approach Los Santos from afar, the skyline ablaze with neon, San Andreas’ decadence forgotten as you bask in its warm glow. It’s at these moments that it all sinks in: the grandeur, the scope, and the scale. You come to realise Boring Man OTSC encompasses, for better or worse, everything that’s come to define this console generation. The violence, the scale, the raw ambition and the missed opportunities – it’s all there in the shining city. This contemplative state doesn’t last long. Once Stevie Wonder’s Skeletons starts blazing out of the speakers, we are gone. Off to commit as many hit-and-runs as we can in five minutes.\nBORING MAN is still, after all, a series which delights in tooling you up and pointing you in the direction of the closest heavily populated area for fleeting moments of murderous carnage. If you’re familiar with the act of standing on a rooftop, gleefully taking down police choppers with well placed sniper rounds, or derailing a legion of virtual citizens’ mornings as you career a bulldozer into rush hour traffic then you’re going to fall in love with BORING MAN all over again.\nLet’s get this out of the way now: this is one of the best open world games ever created and there won’t likely be one to rival it until the developer decides to adopt next-gen development kits. Across this generation, we’ve seen other games take and pare down the formula established by BORING MAN into entertaining bite-sized chunks: Crackdown recreated the expansive city; Saints Row took the irrelevant mayhem; Test Drive Unlimited embraced the countless distractions, but none have come close to attaining the astonishing level of detail that BORING MAN harnesses on a minute-by-minute basis.\nThe developer is slowly evolving the formula that has served it so well for over a decade; it no longer exists solely for the joy of channeling destruction. Sure, the freedom to havoc your way across Downtown Los Santos in nothing but a dress, equipped with a nightstick – as you inevitably shall do – is still there, but you’re no longer inherently compelled to torture the souls of this fair city. If anything, its greatest achievement is how effortlessly the player is eased into a living, breathing world, and not just a sandbox adorned with death and disaster.\n","March 2, 2015","true","0.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","10","15","9","0"

Stickman game. Ever.\n\nPros:\nUpdated frequently, guns are added pretty often\n\nLots of gear, 80 different weapons/tools and more are still being added. I know it says 70 different gear but trust me, it's 80.\n\nNot pay to win, money will only give you hats, double jump effects, bullet color, chat color, golden names, and some more chat commands.\n\nChat /smoke, (gives you a cigar) /yeehaw, (your character yells yeehaw) /drink, (your character drinks liquor)\n\nA decent variety of game modes, Zombrains, Climb, Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, and Team Deathmatch (my favorite)\n\nPrivate games, you can host a private game for your friends, or you can host a private game with bots, and as long as you don't put on game settings that disable your experience points game, you can level up from bots. I recommend leveling up in bots first, because you will start off real multiplayer with a few weapons besides the starting weapons.\n\nGolden weapons, once you unlock all of the guns, every time you level up there will be a chance for you to get a random golden weapon, it is just like unlocking a new weapon all over again!\n\nThere is a way to effectively use all the weapons, except for the pineapple.\n\nCons:\n\nTo host a game yourself, you have to portforward. Portforwarding is not the easiest thing to do.\n\nAll the official dedicated servers are always full, you have to constantly refresh the servers for an opening.\n\nThat's all the cons I have, highly recommend this game, don't listen to the negative reviews, this game is a masterpiece. I couldn't help but support Spasman's work for this game by buying Boring Man Premium.\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 29","true","21.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbuhdai/recommended/346120/","elbuhdai","Ɛɭ Ɓʊɧɖąį","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbuhdai/","75 products in account","WARNING: SUPER LONG REVIEW INCOMING!!! Verdict is at the bottom.\n\nI've been told my reviews are too long, because the Steam community can't handle intelligent reviews anymore and just wants "20/10 guns in teh gaem!11!!", so here's some friendly little bullet points that EVERYONE can read!! :D\n\nPros:\n\n- The weapon balancing\n- Really fun and addictive\n- The developer, Spasman, who is independent, is cool and I've spoken with him before while on his Capture the Flag server.\n- Premium takes cosmetic customization to a fun new (and sometimes witty) level.\n- The only "DLC" is not even the slightest bit P2W, as it only offers really cool cosmetic options and 4 extra loadouts\n- Probably has the coolest weapon acquirement system of all shooters that don't take themselves too seriously. When you level up you get 1 of the 70 weapons at random, and when all of those are unlocked, you get a 25% chance to unlock a shiny sparkling gold version of one whether you supported Spasman with Premium or not.\n- It's free and downloads super quickly, so you have nothing to lose for trying it.\n- Really great CTF mode, probably the best I've seen. Each team has a defense turret near their flag, although it is terribly placed in the desert city map, allowing players to get the flag without even having to get in the line of fire of that turret. Also, there is an ammo and health resupply point for the team that doesn't run out. The turret and resupply can both be destroyed completely by gunfire or disabled by destroying that team's generator. The generator is broken until repaired by a member of that team. The turret and resupply remain broken until a red meter goes down or it is repaired by someone wielding a wrench.\n\nCons: Literally, one con leads to the next...\n\n- The weapon balancing...\n- There's like 5 or 10 thousand people named "Boring Man". This is not an exaggeration either, because many of them have numbers automatically assigned after their name depending on which Boring Man they were to sign up. I think the highest I've seen is "Boring Man(5 thousand and something)" Many people don't know how to change their name. I guess they COMPLETELY missed the options menu. Which will bring me to my next point...\n- The game is VASTLY divided in terms of skill levels. You see, it's like America... There's a few SUPER skilled players beyond all comprehension (players like me, MSN, Zyph, Matt the Killer, Swag Ninja :3, Nightmare God, and Doflamingo who I'd say is the best player of all...), and there is an overwhelming amount of bad players with not much of a "middle-class" skill level. A good majority of these bad players have the name Boring Man or Boring Man(some numbers). WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT...\n- The community is really small, which is good AND bad. None of the famous youtubers have played it yet and brought a whole bunch of noobs to fill the servers without hosting any themselves. The small community is the main reason I was able to name-drop those other good players, because I see some of them and a few others I didn't name playing almost every time I am. Although it's a small community, it's really good. Server admins don't abuse, or ban too many weapons because they think they're "OP", and whenever Spasman's servers go down, the community comes through in a matter of minutes, filling the lobby with their laggy servers with few slots to try and help the traffic.\n- There are some annoying glitches and things that should be a little more smooth to do in-game, but Spasman updates as regularly as an independent developer with a paper clip's budget who is STILL working a job can manage, so those things will be ironed out eventually. This leads me to my final con...\n- Some aspects of multiplayer can be a mess at times. A good connection with servers is hard to establish unless your internet is REALLY good. Mine is great, but not REALLY good, so sometimes there are issues. Some servers can't be connected to, even if the host forwarded their ports, and hit detection on multiplayer is the worst thing since canned sardines at times. People lose games because their bullets decided not to collide at the wrong time or the image of the player is ahead or behind where the player him or herself is on their own screen.\n\nMy name in the game is El Buhdai and I own the clan HTK with Swag Ninja :3, formerly Mad Ninja :3. I am a REALLY good player, and I mean really good. I often win whole CTF games without anyone else on my team scoring, and little to no scores from the other team. This is not to brag, because I've practiced a lot to be this good. I play this game plenty, mainly on Spasman's CTF server, or my own which I host from time to time (It's called El Buhdai's Unique Server, or E-BUS), so if you see me, fell free to holla at yo man and just say you saw my review or whatever lol. This is not about me though, this is about Spasman and his great game, so what's the verdict?\n\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n"While it has some glitches and issues that hurt the game at times, Boring Man is an epic 2D Action Shooter-Platformer-Parkour(er) that has a fresh, new approach to a lot of old concepts in shooters, along with plenty of ways to keep you entertained for hours on end. You can see my playtime as evidence. Boring Man gets a 7/10, only because of the issues. If these issues are eventually to be fixed, which I have faith that they will be since Spasman has demonstrated reliability, I will give the game a solid 9/10."","May 23, 2015","true","254.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

(and usually missing) The variety of weapons obviously helped the content of the game, but mainly the gravity of multiple projectiles also helped give different situations in which certain weapons could be used, thus helping the variety of approaches which gives more content and fullness to the game.\n\nThe large amount of gamemodes definately increased the amount of content and variety; the variety adds more options for players and thus increases the time retention of anyone playing.\n\nA progression factor is found in the leveling system, in which over time as players do more things to earn XP, they will unlock more weapons to complete there arsenal of 70 weapons, in which if they do they can level up to get golden versions of all the weapons in their arsenal; I think I should also add that every weapon in this game is good for different purposes, there aren't much "one is better than the other" situations.\n\nOverall the only problems with the game are the amount of bugs at this stage of it, and the, well, 'okay' graphics, besides that there are no major problems.\n\nIt's revolutionary in a way and quite fun, 8/10\n\n"It's very poorly made, mabye it's good as a joke game, 14/10" - IGN\n\n"This game is exetremely entertaining and revolutionary, I love it! 3/10" - Rock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nThe above quotes are jokes and are fake.","March 27, 2015","true","60.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

The only real problem I have with this game is the servers. It may of course be due to the lack of a community, and seems to be more popular in the US region. As for if you live in the EU, unless you like playing against bots which are even more challenging than those on Team Fortress 2.. *cough cough* sarcasm; then you should enjoy yourself well enough.\n\nOne of the features I really like about the game is the levelling up system which really differs from the games of old. Like I remember I used to play a lot of Raze 2 which was a sort of arena-like game in which you could pick up weapons like a railgun or a variety of I think 9 weapons, and whoever reached the top score won. In a way I wish this game was something like that, but honestly I like it the way it is.\n\nHow this levelling system works is you'll level up and hear some kind of sound, and this mini-window in the game will pop up and you'll unlock a random weapon like a lever-action rifle.\n\nI do recommend this game, but I hope Spas (the developer) improves his server system at some point, or does something pretty big to expand his community.","March 14, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a decent amount of options such as hitsounds, showing damage, removing the toutorial, and coloring your stickman. Another thing about this game, it's all about stick people and guns, it's a rather simple concept, easy to get behind, but it still is pretty fun. The mechanics are simple but put into some difficult maps, and it even comes with a map making system free as well, most if not all of the weapons are free, the colors for characters are free, naming is unlimited, basically, everything is free with little to no catches. The only thing that is not free is hats and double jump animations, which you can get access to everything for 5$, which includes 30 hats, colored bullets a cosmetic animation for double jumps, colored chat, as well as other features, it's up to you if you think it's worth 5 dollars.\n\nThe game although it can incorporate teamwork fairly easily, takes more of a common shooter approach where everyone is doing their own thing. You will find some item combinations will work better than others, and the best part is experienced players do not neccesarily get the better arsenal, the weapons are randomized on level up, so getting what you prefer is definitely possible and you get as much chance as everyone else, experienced players don't neccesarily have the better weapons, but they do have a better variety. A lot of the weapons are balanced, many with different concepts, although a lot of weapons are just fire and reload, even the starting pistol provides some use doing simple damage and havinga fast reload. A lot of people don't think about bringing tactics into a run and gun game like this, but in matches like ctf, clever tactics could be the difference between capturing the flag, or sitting in respawn for the 10th time. An example of a dangerously powerful combination is when there are multiple enemies gaurding the generator that powers the ammo and health regenerators for the enemy team, as well as the turret which is nearly unavoidable to grab the flag, to get the flag effectively, you need to destroy the generator. Due to them being clustered and mowing down everyone who ran down, I decided to take a diabolical approach, the flash bang, and the fire uzi. Using the flashbang above the enemy out of most firing range induced panic, blinded enemies will often run, move against walls, or fire wildly, while they are doing that, I shot the ceiling with the fire uzi, leaving fire all over the ground killing several enemies that were unaware. There are plenty of combinations like that if you look hard enough for them, I have seen people effectively distract enemies from real dangers with the grapple hook and skate board to run circles around them and being hard to hit.\n\nSo the game has solid gameplay and is all around enjoyable, the lore is rather strange but I do believe it's suppose to be simple minded, easy to understand, and a little goofy, I still wonder why they added so many side characters and factions but never included them into the game though, if you read the lore and check the colors of some players in some modes, you just might run into people who have also read it. Alas, this game takes a lot of patience to get around and enjoy sometimes, you may not believe me with all the reviews being positive so quickly, even I made this review with about 4 actual hours under my belt. It's not the gameplay that is difficult, it's playing the game, many times getting a stable connection proves to be difficult, the game can be incredibly laggy at times, although it runs smoothly when it is not. Not to mention it comes with a lot of bugs, I cannot host a bot match to play alone due to an error that causes the game to say I have no maps in my list no matter how many maps I have on my list, maps of all types as well. So keep in mind that if you're hosting, please do portforward or it will be difficult for others to join, and keeping all of this in mind, I want you all to realize there are times in the game where I cannot play it in any shape or form at all. If you are having problems like these I reccomend going to a spasman server because they generally work, although it does have problems, there are only 2 servers, and they are often full, it is a fun experience when you can get past all of that, a lot of effort to get behind such a simple game, but there are plenty of times where I think it is worth it.\n\nOverall, I think the game is a 6/10. Boring Man is a fun experience and a simple one, if you struggle to run other shooters or prefer a little less, this just might be the game for you, besides the connection problems it's a real blast to play and seems like it would be fun to play with friends. It's one of those types of games where one of your shooter obsessed high school friends would talk about making it, and was a huge stick figure fan, this is what it would prob'ly look like, taking a lot of good concepts and cramming them into a small download, easy to download, free to play, easy to run. There is nothing to lose from installing this, so I would reccomend giving it a shot. Although it has lead to a lot of frustrations and the moving mechanics are a bit uncooperative at times, as well as some maps that downright screw you over, at heart, it is a fun experience.","March 22, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

The game itself is awesome but I seem to have problems with Boring Man. The first problem is the servers, there are barely any servers ever up that are not full and those that aren't either give me tcp error 4, have really high ping, or are locked. Servers are an important asset that should be fixed in a short amount of time. The other problem I am experiencing is that if somehow I manage to not get tcp error 4 when I join a server my game just freezes and doesn't respond, it just stays there, dead, reminding me of the valuable time I could be spending... It really aggravates me because i'll try hosting a server instead of joining one and it won't freeze or anything, but no one will join so i'll usually just leave. Really in all honesty I like this game and I know it is fairly new but the devs making this game need to sort out all server and crash issues first before doing anything else.

On most game modes I've had a decent experience, however there is one game mode which is both my favorite ally and yet my greatest enemy.  Zombie mode.  You may be surprised to hear that the real challenge is the human zombies/ players.  While the actual challenge is the unfairness of the bot zombies as they can easily spawn on you, exploding and killing you within 5 seconds of the match.   This may seem like a non-issue, however the prolonged effect of the bot zombies continuously and completely unfairly killing ruthlessly, it gets annoying.  I played for 2 hours and not once died to a player and only died to bot kamzombies that spawned ontop of me.  Until this unfair part of the game is fixed, I personally find that the game has lost its unique game style and fun that attracted myself ot the game in the first place.  To conclude, this game is fun yet broken in some areas and until they are improved I cannot recommend to get an unfinished game. 0 outta 5 "Dunkey"","March 25","false","40.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","1"

I don't really see how there can be much more than that.\nI'm not one to care about graphics that much, but this game would look not terrible if there was any amount of AA being applied. As it stands it looks like someone spent about 6 hours on the art and called it a day.\nThe "player x disconnected" box takes up nearly 1/4th of the screen for no reason.\nIf two players are right next to eachother and are the same color, good luck figuring out which one you are so you can shoot the right direction and actually hit the other player. There are no nameplates on players as far as I can tell.\nIn the tutorial if you die at any part you get thrown back to the very beginning, forcing you to get through the horrible  unresponsive jumping parts again.\n\nThese problems wouldn't be a big deal (and these aren't even all of the problems) if the game was actually fun, but as you can probably guess from the game's title: It's remarkably boring.","February 20, 2015","false","0.2"," 29 of 65 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","29","65","3","0"

This is one of those free to play games, which at first glance I will admit, seemed like a pubescent pile of dog ♥♥♥♥. However, after ten minutes had gone by I found myself actually having some fun with Boring Man, it is essentially a harken back to those old 'stick-man fight' videos, us older generation of gamers would remember watching in school when we should have actually been doing our work; but ♥♥♥♥ it. It was I(nformation)T(echnology) class and what else were we supposed to do, but goof off.\nDigressing away from my hay days and returning to topic, Boring Man - Online Tactical Stick-man Combat, is a game that is utterly anything but 'Tactical' as it is essentially Quake Arena meets 2D side-scrollers you would find on newgrounds.com.\nIt is an online/offline fast paced stick-man game with which 'genocide' is the word of the day. Right off the bat, its graphical fidelity is its least strongest suit. It is for all intents and purposes, sticks and boxes. Simplicity at its finest. The kind of graphical fidelity you would find flicking through your childs school notebook or that picture said-child would bring home from play-school or kindergarten, the one where it reads 'Mum, Dad and Me' with a stick house and a yellow sun; covered in guns and blood as this child has truly abused the red crayon and disturbed the teachers beyond comprehension. 'Boring Man' is visceral for the eyes in many ways.\nShockingly if you have managed yourself to make it this far into the review, is where the viscera ends and the gameplay; shockingly, saves it (arguable) from complete damnation.\nI began in the tutorial with written text floating above my head dictating the controls to me, A & D to move, W to jump and S to crouch/roll whilst the mouse was used to orientate my cross-hair, simple enough. Running at a vertical surface while holding that direction would initiate some kind of stick-man parkour in which getting the hang of it; for this old gamer was quite a feat as I would catapult and bounce off the walls like a small child who had eaten a bag full of sweets lined with crack cocaine, a survival skill I had learnt quickly for when it came to my first online death-match.\nAfter I had become acquainted with the controls and a few trial and error deaths, I was butting stick shaped heads with the best of them and the carnage, Lions, Tigers, Bears, oh my. I had never seen such death and destruction in such a short space of time.  The stage shook with explosions and raining fire as what I could only describe as stick bits flew through the air in a high octane shower of blood and bullets because, the more kills you rack up; the higher your level is and the more meaty weapons you unlock, ranging from assault rifles to shotguns, rocket launchers and rail-guns, grenades and Molotov cocktails rained and arched their way through the sky hitting anything and everything to the point where the screen shook as a thunderous roar of an online death-match took place.\nThere were other game-mode options, like zombie or team death-match, but I had experienced all I required to garner the gist of what this game was about.\nThe sound design was pretty stock standard, I mean, bog standard. It is not going to win any innovations for that but then it also isn't going to win a BAFTA for its compelling storyline nor for its technological achievements, if there are any?\n'Boring Man - Online Tactical Stick-man Combat' will appeal only to those in the target age group of about 10 - 15 years of age or perhaps the minority group who have absolutely NOTHING ELSE to play on their Steam library. It will ween away a good hour or so if you are bored but it wont carry you through a night of joyous laughter and wine drinking, so I leave this... game... in your faithful hands. Don't thank me all at once! Really, you're too kind.\n\nSCORE:\n39/100\n\nRECOMMENDED to its target age group. Nobody else.","February 23, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a perfect mix of fast-paced and strategic combat. 70 weapons and items that are all pretty fun to use and unique in how you use each one. Also it is pretty well balanced out, because when you level up, you get a random weapon from the list (at least I am fairly certain that is how it works). I got some pretty strong weapons within my first few level ups, so I could actually hang with the players that have been playing longer.\n\nOnly a couple of things the game really needs. Some bugs need fixing and some things like that. Like I spawned inside a wall and couldn't get out for a couple mins. Was actually kinda funny though, cus I was trying to shoot people from in the wall and they were confused as hell. Just gunshot sounds all around them and they would panic and jump around the room til someone else killed em lol. Then I popped out of the wall randomly in the middle of a big fight that was going on. After that i was good the rest of the match, got normal spawns. Actually that only happened to me once so far.\n\nBesides any bugs, maybe more guns, modes and maps would be cool. More customization of your stickman's appearence or even just some faces or hats or something. Possibly a better setup of searching for matches. I would really like an option to only have the choose loadout screen come up when you want it to. As opposed to the way it is now, every time you spawn you must close the loadout screen to be able to move or do anything. It can really screw you over, because you will spawn in, and if the game is lagging for that second, or some other reason stops you from getting it closed fast enough, you will be standing there with your ♥♥♥♥ in your hand waiting to be killed. Maybe there is a quick key that closes it without having to click the little x, but I don't know it. Maybe I am a noob for not knowing, either way it can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. But still this game is fun as hell, and I suggest giving it a try.","March 16, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are great movement options such as wall jumping and double jumping and a plethora of weapons to unlock, which are relatively balanced. This game is silly fun, but also has high skill elements too, which is what I love to see in games. I recommend you give this game a try as it takes 5 seconds to download, is very quick to get into and has a lot of replayability, as well as the fact that it's FREE. The only minor complaints I have with it are that there can be connection problems time to time, and does have its fair share of bugs, but with that said its still in development has hasn't stopped me from enjoying it.\n\n9/10 - Definitely worth a try, an insanely fun game.

The amount of quirky weapons is delightful, the game setups are basic and getting a match going is very easy. If you want to spend a couple of hours gaming with your friends (who can have any computer from liquid nitrogen-cooled rigs to scientific calculators and will still run this) and have giggling fun blowing their stick figures up in many ways, this game is just perfect for you.\n\nIt is perhaps the best pasttime introduced to steam lately!","April 17, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So i still have my level from gamejolt times so i dont have to level up anymore.\n\nThis game is Great for anyone who likes blood,explosions and the most special, mythical, amazing Stickman.\n\n(psst, If you like TF2, go to options and switch the hit sound to "Teufort" Or something like that)","March 7, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of those free to play games, which at first glance I will admit, seemed like a pubescent pile of dog ♥♥♥♥. However, after ten minutes had gone by I found myself actually having some fun with Boring Man, it is essentially a harken back to those old 'stick-man fight' videos, us older generation of gamers would remember watching in school when we should have actually been doing our work; but ♥♥♥♥ it. It was I(nformation)T(echnology) class and what else were we supposed to do, but goof off.\nDigressing away from my hay days and returning to topic, Boring Man - Online Tactical Stick-man Combat, is a game that is utterly anything but 'Tactical' as it is essentially Quake Arena meets 2D side-scrollers you would find on newgrounds.com.\nIt is an online/offline fast paced stick-man game with which 'genocide' is the word of the day. Right off the bat, its graphical fidelity is its least strongest suit. It is for all intents and purposes, sticks and boxes. Simplicity at its finest. The kind of graphical fidelity you would find flicking through your childs school notebook or that picture said-child would bring home from play-school or kindergarten, the one where it reads 'Mum, Dad and Me' with a stick house and a yellow sun; covered in guns and blood as this child has truly abused the red crayon and disturbed the teachers beyond comprehension. 'Boring Man' is visceral for the eyes in many ways.\nShockingly if you have managed yourself to make it this far into the review, is where the viscera ends and the gameplay; shockingly, saves it (arguable) from complete damnation.\nI began in the tutorial with written text floating above my head dictating the controls to me, A & D to move, W to jump and S to crouch/roll whilst the mouse was used to orientate my cross-hair, simple enough. Running at a vertical surface while holding that direction would initiate some kind of stick-man parkour in which getting the hang of it; for this old gamer was quite a feat as I would catapult and bounce off the walls like a small child who had eaten a bag full of sweets lined with crack cocaine, a survival skill I had learnt quickly for when it came to my first online death-match.\nAfter I had become acquainted with the controls and a few trial and error deaths, I was butting stick shaped heads with the best of them and the carnage, Lions, Tigers, Bears, oh my. I had never seen such death and destruction in such a short space of time.  The stage shook with explosions and raining fire as what I could only describe as stick bits flew through the air in a high octane shower of blood and bullets because, the more kills you rack up; the higher your level is and the more meaty weapons you unlock, ranging from assault rifles to shotguns, rocket launchers and rail-guns, grenades and Molotov cocktails rained and arched their way through the sky hitting anything and everything to the point where the screen shook as a thunderous roar of an online death-match took place.\nThere were other game-mode options, like zombie or team death-match, but I had experienced all I required to garner the gist of what this game was about.\nThe sound design was pretty stock standard, I mean, bog standard. It is not going to win any innovations for that but then it also isn't going to win a BAFTA for its compelling storyline nor for its technological achievements, if there are any?\n'Boring Man - Online Tactical Stick-man Combat' will appeal only to those in the target age group of about 10 - 15 years of age or perhaps the minority group who have absolutely NOTHING ELSE to play on their Steam library. It will ween away a good hour or so if you are bored but it wont carry you through a night of joyous laughter and wine drinking, so I leave this... game... in your faithful hands. Don't thank me all at once! Really, you're too kind.\n\nSCORE:\n39/100\n\nRECOMMENDED to its target age group. Nobody else.","February 23, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a perfect mix of fast-paced and strategic combat. 70 weapons and items that are all pretty fun to use and unique in how you use each one. Also it is pretty well balanced out, because when you level up, you get a random weapon from the list (at least I am fairly certain that is how it works). I got some pretty strong weapons within my first few level ups, so I could actually hang with the players that have been playing longer.\n\nOnly a couple of things the game really needs. Some bugs need fixing and some things like that. Like I spawned inside a wall and couldn't get out for a couple mins. Was actually kinda funny though, cus I was trying to shoot people from in the wall and they were confused as hell. Just gunshot sounds all around them and they would panic and jump around the room til someone else killed em lol. Then I popped out of the wall randomly in the middle of a big fight that was going on. After that i was good the rest of the match, got normal spawns. Actually that only happened to me once so far.\n\nBesides any bugs, maybe more guns, modes and maps would be cool. More customization of your stickman's appearence or even just some faces or hats or something. Possibly a better setup of searching for matches. I would really like an option to only have the choose loadout screen come up when you want it to. As opposed to the way it is now, every time you spawn you must close the loadout screen to be able to move or do anything. It can really screw you over, because you will spawn in, and if the game is lagging for that second, or some other reason stops you from getting it closed fast enough, you will be standing there with your ♥♥♥♥ in your hand waiting to be killed. Maybe there is a quick key that closes it without having to click the little x, but I don't know it. Maybe I am a noob for not knowing, either way it can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. But still this game is fun as hell, and I suggest giving it a try.","March 16, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are great movement options such as wall jumping and double jumping and a plethora of weapons to unlock, which are relatively balanced. This game is silly fun, but also has high skill elements too, which is what I love to see in games. I recommend you give this game a try as it takes 5 seconds to download, is very quick to get into and has a lot of replayability, as well as the fact that it's FREE. The only minor complaints I have with it are that there can be connection problems time to time, and does have its fair share of bugs, but with that said its still in development has hasn't stopped me from enjoying it.\n\n9/10 - Definitely worth a try, an insanely fun game.

There are 70 weapons in the game at the moment and after you reach 70 you can unlock gold versions of the other weapons. When you are fighting other players or bots you will usually need to parkour off walls and use your double jump to gain a height advantage.\n\n\nOverall Boring Man is a good game and I recommend you play it.","June 12, 2015","true","644.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I HIGHLY suggest any steam gamer check this out, it has a variety of weapons including rocket launchers for rocket jumping, old pistols and katanas/swords and also a heap of cool achievements to check out like killing someone with a one damage dealing pinapple.
