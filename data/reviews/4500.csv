"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Section9/recommended/4500/","Section9","Section-Nine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Section9/","254 products in account","Many moons ago in 2003 I stumbled upon a trailer for a game called S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Oblivion Lost https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbGlgbw9J18 Needless to say after watching that I quickly became obsessed with this game. Searching high and low for every bit of info I could get my eyes on, The GSC forums became my 2nd home while I awaited its arrival.\n\nI remember at the time I was playing Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, With it I fell in love with non-linear open world 1st/3rd person games with RPG elements and how much I could get immersed in virtual worlds. I am all for fantasy settings don't get me wrong, but there is nothing more terrifying than reality. (With a spin of fiction of course, alternate reality if you will) The abandoned urban/industrial locations in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. were more my cup of tea. That in itself made me very excited to play it. I couldn't wait to get lost in its world.\n\nWhile I waited though I researched about the Nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in April 1986, it was mixed emotions for me. I was sad/amazed/intrigued. Sad for all of those people who lost their lives because of this. Nothing but respect for the liquidators and anyone involved in the initial cleanup. Those people are heroes and deserve nothing less. Amazed that this game had some real history in its background story. Even if it is incredibly embellished (mutants, anomalies, artifacts etc etc.), you have to admit it makes for an interesting premise to a story. Finally, Intrigued on what these game developers had in store for the players to experience, without making a mockery of those who had lost their lives in this tragedy. The game also borrows elements from "Roadside Picnic" by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky and the 1979  Andrei Tarkovsky film "Stalker". If you haven't heard or checked them out yet, they are most definitely worth it. Masterpieces in their own right.\n\nWell turns out it was a long wait lol, game finally arrived in March 2007. It was no longer Oblivion Lost, it was now called Shadow of Chernobyl. Which was a welcomed change imo, what was not a welcomed change was the amount of content/features that were removed from the game. Vehicles, locations/maps made smaller and simpler, monsters/mutants, superior lighting from old alpha builds among many other things had been removed it was rather disappointing to say the least. The survival aspect of the game took a huge hit, leaving many in the community confused as to what happened during development. GSC Game World regardless of all the missing features still delivered a good game and it was well received by critics as well.\n\nThe game at release had performance issues and bugs that required some patching. Once that happened it was clear that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl was a game ahead of its time. In a league all its own and a true gem in the PC gaming world. The atmosphere takes front row seat in this game it is almost like another character in the game. Such believable atmosphere it is downright amazing, it keeps you on the edge of your chair as you play.\n\nPros:\n- Incredible atmosphere!\n- Impressive use of lighting and shadows,\n- Cloud shadows that shift as day/night cycles progress.\n- None stylized (photo based) textures (adds to the realism), Replicating the rust and decay feel.\n- Great cut-scenes that hold up even by today's standards.\n- Plenty of side quests\n- Exploring is encouraged to find secret stashes scattered throughout the world to find loot, weapons, ammo, suits and artifacts. Artifacts can be placed on your belt to grant the player abilities like resistance to radiation, increase weight limit etc. Some interesting combinations that can be made with the multitude of artifacts available in the game.\n- The games AI can be quite challenging because they adapt/react/flank/take cover depending on your approach. This adds to the games replayability immensely, if its one thing I have learned playing this game is that when it comes to killing the AI is that no playthrough is ever the same. Never. They are very unpredictable lets put it that way.\n- Trading system with merchants and other friendly AI characters\n- "The Zone" is alive even when you are not in the same vicinity, AI will be fighting mutants and/or other factions (Bandits, Duty, Freedom, Loners, Military, Mercs, Ecologists & Monolith) All fight among themselves.\n\nBesides all the bells and whistles the story is incredibly engaging and keeps you interested throughout. Without too many spoilers (I am sure most people reading this have already played this but still) You play as "Marked One" an amnesiac trying to retrace his steps, he is then set on a mission to the heart of "The Zone" (term used to refer to the 30 kilometer Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, established after the accident.) to find a target and their whereabouts. Game also has multiple endings depending on the choices made by the player, 7 in total.\n\nCons:\n- Lots of "fetch" side quests (Surprise? lol)\n- AI that can sometimes see you from "miles" away (vanilla)\n- Some quest giving characters can die. (vanilla)\n\nJust a heads up. Nothing game breaking but worth noting. Just like all games, it is not perfect. :)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe mod scene for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games is very much alive.\n\nWhen your done with vanilla (though not necessary, I would recommend the community fixes of ZRP goes well in a first playthrough to have the best bug-free experience with the game). Shadow of Chernobyl has some amazing mods worth playing, especially if you are looking for new storyline or another playthrough with better visuals, more weapons, new side quests, improved enemy AI, realistic weapon damage & accuracy etc. Some I can recommend are:\n\n- ZRP (Zone Reclamation Project) (community fixes keeps vanilla intact) ZRP[www.metacognix.com]\n- Priboi Story\n- L.U.R.K.\n- OGSE (Old Good Stalker Evolution)\n- AMK v1.4\n- Secret Trails 2\n- ABC Inferno (if you are a masochist)\n- Narodnaya Solyanka variants (my favorite Narodnaya Soljanka DMX 1.3.2 dkz02)\n- Autumn Aurora\n- STALKER Soup\n- Oblivion Lost\n- AMK: Autumn Edition\n- Lost Alpha (standalone)\n\nSome of these mods add in the cut content (mutants, weapons, vehicles etc.)\n\nThe list goes on really, just my humble recommendations on the ones I have tried.\n\nClear Sky and Call of Pripyat are awesome games as well, worth checking out at least once. They also have great mods which I will not mention in this review. But I will say that there is something about Shadow of Chernobyl's allure and atmosphere that didn't carry over as well to the other two games. Out of all three games, Shadow of Chernobyl is by far still my favorite.\n\nI don't claim to know everything about these games, because honestly I don't. I still discover new things about them every time I play them. They are gifts that just keep on giving. Thank goodness for Eastern European  game developers!\n\n5 stars ( ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ) out of 5","September 17, 2015","true","593.7"," 407 of 422 people (96%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","96","407","422","33","20"

No matter what happens, I am still able to come back to it thanks to the amount of quality mods, challenges, and the whole random element to the games that keeps the games fresh. The story is also very good considering how open it is for people to make their own stories within the STALKER universe be it the shape in a mod or even fan fiction. The gameplay is almost always intense because enemies can easily kill you if you're playing the proper difficulty which I will get to at the end. The graphics aren't amazing except for the lighting which, for some reason, has the ability to compete with most modern games.\n\nThe only reasons why I took off one point is because there are plenty of bugs and the multiplayer just seems like a useless feature shoved in at the last minute. The bugs for the most part can be fixed with a community patch known as the Zone Reclamation Project or ZRP. In my opinion, ZRP isn't even necessary because it is very possible to get through the game without it. Whatever you do, do NOT listen to people who suggest playing with mods like Complete or anything that isn't ZRP. As for multiplayer, there isn't really much to deal with multiplayer other than to simply not play it. The singleplayer experience is simply the best part about this game.\n\nI feel I should also say that this game is not for everyone as it can be pretty difficult at times. However, being a person who has gotten around five people into the series by gifting the game to them, I feel that anyone interested should pickup this game and just try it.\n\nTo have the best experience, you should play on Master difficulty as this is the way the game was meant to be played. Every other difficulty will ruin your immersion and will end up with you becoming overpowered right at the beginning of the game. If you are going to play through the whole STALKER Series, start with Shadow of Chernobyl, then Clear Sky, and then end with Call of Pripyat.\n\nAnd of course as said above, don't use mods on your first playthrough unless it is ZRP.","November 26, 2013","true","128.0"," 351 of 369 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","351","369","0","17"

Takes the game from good to great! STALKER is my favorite gaming style! (I got the file patch from gamefront. Its 703.1MB and an exe.\nhttp://www.gamefront.com/files/16359911/STALKER_Complete_2009_# )\n\nSneak around and attempt to take out any force with stealth attacks. The more silent you are, the more deadly you become. When you kill an enemy, pick their body up and hide it. Enemies see only whats in their vision, and while an enemy is in-sight they appear on your mini-map. If you don't crouch, they will hear you even easier! Turn on night vision and pull out your silenced weapon to become the ultimate STALKER! (still challenging!)\n\nEach NPC has a unique name, and they will remember if they like you. They can die from enemies too, though. The killed NPCs are replaced with half as many fresh new NPCs, most of the time, which helps the game still feel alive, and progresses. If you shoot your friend once, they will forgive you. If you shoot them twice, then its war...\n\nThere are different groups/factions. Military, Bandits, Loners, Duty, Freedom, etc. Everything is at war. If you pis-off the Military, they will attack your base. If you don't ball-up, they will all die. Game changing! Although, you can save anytime you want. Which makes winning a serious battle, actually possible. Making you the most badass in the zone! Although, no one truly knows how cool you are, due to saves! ;D  (I wish there was a video replay, where it shows you how [through saving] your character is elite.)\n\nMutated animals run around constantly. Sometimes you can take a souvenier from them. The types of mutated creatures become really sneaky and different than you can imagine. They will solo attack armed soldier squads too. Sometimes wiping them out. You get no rewards for helping NPC communities survive, but it is rewarding to know you just saved a friendly base.\n\nBetter equipment comes much faster from helping NPCs with a task. But you will probably gain access to much of the same guns much later on, from fallen enemies, except armor never drops from enemies. Bullets fall with gravity. You can watch a bullet fall towards a distant target. If you choose to use a sniper weapon, you will have to adjust your manual aim to compensate for this new thing called gravity. Also, the distance between you and your target feels real!\n\nWhat else... there are... artifacts, which give bonuses. They are supposed to be found in anomalies, which are dangerous ghost like traps. If you hear your radiation meter going off, throw a metal bolt by pressing 6, to see if you are about to get zapped by stepping on a trap. Also, if you hear radiation, you are probably getting pummeled with radiation poisoning. Might want to step back. Suit up to get less exposure! (This seems bigger in the game Pripyat.)\n\nLastly, the atmosphere is really in depth. Everyone speaks with a Russian accent, and when the wind blows the bushes wave. Day/Night cycles and eating let you feel like you are really camping in the zone. Its cold and a loner's friend.","October 15, 2014","true","52.4"," 414 of 455 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","414","455","8","50"

Running through Chernobyl killing mutants. I mean there's more to it than that but everything, from the look to the amount of Kalashnikov porn lives and breathes Russian and to a greater extent Ukrainian culture.\n\nThe premise of SoC is that you are a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. A treasure seeker and one day you awake with amnesia with a single objective reading in your PDA. "Kill STRELOK". With no further purpose in mind you set off north to the power plant where mutants and other stalkers reside. What I love about the plot is it has this inherant mystery to it. You gradually uncover more clues about Strelok and his group, and about the Zone of Exclusion as a whole. Compared to the two other S.T.A.L.K.E.R games, this one sets the stage as both a horror game and as a mystery game.\n\nAdding to that SoC has very challenging complex gameplay. The AI is very good and GSC intended the firefights to feel similar to multiplayer matches in games like Counter Strike. The AI waits for you, it ambushes you and ramboing in only seeks to get you killed. You have to be smart about your engagements.\n\nOne thing to note about this game and the other two is that there are mods that fix most of the bugs and improve the overall gameplay. The two I recommend are STALKER Complete 2009 and LURK.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11213973","November 25, 2013","true","68.0"," 313 of 363 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","313","363","0","16"

I was won over by this, it has so much going for it. A FPS sandbox game set in the Zone, a secret scientific facility with mysterious environmental anomalies in the ruins of Chernobyl. You are a Stalker, one of the many rogues who make a living by scavenging the ruins and seeking valuable rocks.\n\nThe environment is challenging, the array of weapons and other items is huge, great missions, great gameplay (stealth, economy, range and style of movement), plenty of mystery. I like that the gameplay continues while you rummage through your inventory.

I won't go into further details of the game, as I the mysteriousness of The Zone, and how to survive there are the most endearing features of the game.\nIt took me a long, long time to fall in love with S.T.A.L.K.E.R. I first booted this game up on release day, and my good 'ol Athlon64X2 choked on it. Performance won't be a problem in this day and age, but the X-ray engine's poor optimization was killer back in '07, and the fact that the patches would erase your save game only added insult to injury (again, this won't affect the gamers of today). After I had finally tweaked the game into a playable state, I found an intriguing title with a fantastic premise, and a living, breathing world overflowing with atmosphere. However, exploring The Zone wasn't the beautiful experience that it should have been. The place was crawling with bugs, glitches and anomalies (and not just kind you are supposed to be exploring there!) The shooting physics were far from consistent, the translations were poor, and the game would still crawl along at a snail's pace. There is still much to love about the game, but playing through on vanilla left me feeling that the title just didn't live up to all that it could have been.\nThat all changed with I discovered the heavy modding scene for the series. I recommend reading up on the various fan overhauls for Stalker, and installing one before you even first step foot in The Zone. There are many to choose from, such as Complete 2009, Misery, or my personal favorite, Lurk. After playing through the game with fan enhancements, I found myself beyond taken by this title's bleak wonders. I would go as far as saying that Stalker with the Lurk mod is my favorite first person shooter experience of all time. I found myself so infatuated by the Zone and her mysteries, that I read  and enjoyed the book ('Roadside Picnic,' Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, 1971) and  watched and adored the film ('Stalker', by Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979). I also researched the fascinating tragedy of the real life Chernobyl disaster of 1986.\nIn conclusion, if you are a patient gamer who fancies a real challenge and getting lost in a bleak world in a devastated Ukrane, I simply can't recommend a modded version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R enough.\nGet out of here, Stalker.\n\n100 Rads out of Ten","November 25, 2013","true","48.4"," 114 of 121 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","114","121","0","0"

It perfectly captures the overwhelming mood of a decrepit world without getting repetitive or monotonous.\n\nIt captivates you, inundates you with a constant wave of ambience and atmosphere, creating an illusion of desolation. The realistic gameplay and sound effects coupled with the brilliant soundtrack and periodic spine tingling bellows from mutated monster(lings) in the distance helps forge this.\n\nSo despite being armed to the teeth with lead, gunpowder, rations and a generous light source it does what most (survival) horror games fail to do. It’s a preview of emptiness and loneliness. It makes you hesitate.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/4500/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","I’m not here to suggest you into buying it. After browsing many reviews both there and on the Metacritic, I see STALKER as a moving train. You’re either hopped on it, or not.\n\nSTALKER is not your usual big entertaining AAA-title, like Crysis or Call of Duty. It is more like living Monument. For my point of view, it is even bigger than Halo franchise.  Maybe bigger than Moby ♥♥♥♥ (the Whale). And with strong Russian accent. I’m not saying that only Russian-speakers can understand this scenery, but you really have to have somewhat specific system of values and behavioural pattern, to get in tune with that game. And what pattern it could be?\n\nLet me tell you where this game takes roots. It will be much better, than usual pro/contra stuff.\n\nOkay, first, there was a book. It was written by Strugatsky brothers and called “Roadside Picnic”. In there was painted our world after a brief impact with extraterrestrial civilization. Those aliens wasn't contacted with people, they just used our planet as a campsite, and then disappeared in the space, while left some garbage at their leisure. The book’s story tells about some scientist who is researching that impact by studying strange alien artifacts, which can be recovered from abnormal zones aliens left behind. Due to its completely alien nature, the most of those “campsite” zones are extremely dangerous. Just like an oil puddle for ants.\n\nAfter filming that scenario, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, it turns out that the most natural and the most alive-looking character is not a day-dreaming scientist, wishing to make the world a better place. No, the main character of the movie was a simple guy, who dwelled the Zone by his instincts, intuition and luck, just for make a living for another day. The Stalker.\n\nNo, that’s not the end of the history lesson. After that movie, Chernobyl catastrophe happened. It was really far from the resemblance with the “Roadside Picnic” events, but, after all impersonal cruelty that striked the territory around Chernobyl area, a big circle of the deadland was created, which fitted to the anomaly zone by its size and tragic background.\n\nAnd after that tragedy, there was a Soviet Union crush, which created so-called “roaming 90’s”. Ex-Soviet people, left in the dark age with squashed moral principles, which kept them together all soviet years, started a struggle of survival on the ruins of former life. It was then when bandits were ruled every activity, promising some outcome, preferably the fastest and dirtiest way possible.\n\nFinally, in the new millennia the governments of the former Union finally take some power back in their hands, so there was a time of peace in the 00’s in the Ukraine. Some talented people gather there and created a very powerful (yet not too stable) engine, and they blended Strugatsky, Tarkovsky, roaming 90’s under the shadow of Chernobyl zone…\n\nSo, here you are: a simple man, who tries to get by and live another day, yet must adapt and survive in the hostile terrain. You hunt vile creatures, explore and getting used to the location, where every 10 straight steps leading you to another death trap. You collect some strange artifacts, survive encounters with bandits and hostile military forces, you helping some random and generic friendly stalkers (and even getting some help in return). And after some time, you feel yourself like at home there…\n\nJust like a soldier in his beloved trenches. Or a hunter in the wilderness, alone among wolves and bears. That’s a pattern of behaviour I was talking before. You’re not a hero in the shining armor, saving the world there. You just a survivalist, who’s getting stronger the harder fate trying to bend him. Without hope in government, in global order and justice, in helping hand from the Heaven… just to live another day.\n\nI know what not everybody could be like this. But Stalker game is giving so alive, so thrilling modus operandi that I know many people who played only in this videogame in the whole life.\n\nInexpressible in words, an unforgettable experience. Suspence. To kill or to be killed?\n\nOkay, enough with pathos. As a game, STALKER obviously has flaws. Frequent engine crushes, questionable game features like constant respawn of enemies, narrow ravine between locations…\n\nBut all this pales, when I remember how many time (even before Steam) I’ve spent there.\nSo that game takes a mark 10/10 from me, for being like no other. A quintessence of part of my life.","September 22, 2015","true","101.7"," 86 of 95 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","86","95","8","11"

In this universe, the chernobyl incident created an ever expanding zone which produces deadly anomalies and horrifying creatures whose prey consist of you.\n\nYou play as a STALKER, which basically is just a person who traverses the zone, who has suffered from some sort of amnesia. You only have one clear goal which is noted on your PDA: Kill Strelok.\nWho strelok is or why you need to kill him is unknown, but you pursue this goal in hopes of finding out why you are trying kill him and what happened to you.\n\nThe game starts you in a small village with a simple goal of assisting nearby mecenaries in raiding a bandit camp, in hopes of retrieving a prisoner and a thumbdrive.\n\nIt sets the tone of the game very well. You can choose to experience the more stealthy lethal approach or the loud and proud route by talking to the head merc and choosing either option.\n\nYou get a quick feel for the tense gunplay (which I significantly recommend playing on max difficulty, it increases lethality for both sides during fights) and how the AI acts.\n\nThe game in essence is great.

It is  filled with merciless human scum, religious fanatics that wouldn't care less if a nonbeliever is to die, and vicious mutants. No matter where you go, the choices you make in fighting to survive can impact you.\n\n\nWhat the game did right:\n\nThere are diverse NPCs that roam around the game. Their interactions with other friends/neutral characters and enemies are almost unscripted, thus making gameplay unique.\n\nThe atmopshere of  S.T.A.L.K.E.R is unforgettable and is the most memoriable. The weather and "day and night" system constantly changes which can either make you relaxed or downright terrified. For example, enjoy being with other friendly/neutral characters by hanging around with them near a fire or be trembling in fear within a dark underground system. You can't relax for a couple of seconds when bypassing enemy lines or breaching a room that could be filled with a hostile mutant.\n\nCombat in this game will never bore you, and can be just as brutal. As a result, you can't just rush in with guns blazing if sufficient support is nonexistant as a shotgun to the face is lethal, even on easy difficulty.\n\nThere's plenty of weapons in this game, Expand your average arsenal to a powerful gauss rifle or a grenade launcher. Show no mercy and obliterate your foes to mere chunks of flesh. Upgraded weapons are also present which are usually different from their ordinary cousins.\n\nThe concept of artifacts and anomalies are intriguing. Equip some and you can sprint iinfinitely (if you are light enough) or regenerate health. Treasure hunters will love this, no doubt about it.\n\nMain tasks can be delayed to complete other smaller tasks to obtain money or simply explore the landscape.\n\nUnlike most games, how and where you move can impact your survival. Sneaking through bushes can allow you to remain concealed but creates sounds.\n\nEven if limited, the community of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has been dedicated to modding, thus you can seek to replace your weapon skins or expand your experience with the Zone.\n\n\n\nI did love this game but many issues, like technical problems, didn't make me favor this game overall.\n\n\n\n\nWhat the game should have fixed/improved on:\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is plagued with bugs and glitches. This really hampers on how enjoyable the game is. Some objectives aren't possible to complete or can confuse and frustrate players. For me, the worst bug I encountered was being forced to fight hostile loners in the Duty base and after killing them, I had a mix of Duty members who were friends and enemies.\n\nThis game also stutters quite often, which isn't present in Clear Sky.\n\nSome good weapons are (almost) impossible to obtain, because they were cut from the game, are only avaliable at certain places/vendors, or must be taken by killing certain NPCs.\n\nAdding to the aforementioned problem, weapons and armor degrade over time, especially unique equipment. You can repair armor with the right artifacts and specific anomaly but weapons have to be replaced. Moreover, this game has a "weapon jam" system thus one has to eventually give in and buy a new firearm or can get lucky by salvaging a pristine weapon off a dead enemy.\n\nThe weight limit can become very annoying. Often times, the limit in carrying weapons is 3 and it's painful to go back to a stash that has more suitable weapons when you cannot win a fight if the right firearms are not present.\n\nDespite claiming to be a RPG game, players have very little choice in implementing free will in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. In other words, you're forced to play as the same character without making any decisions that can change the storyline.\n\nStealth in this game is fairly broken. Enemies may still notice you, even if one is to quietly move around or sneak behind a target, while other times an NPC can be killed but other AI controlled characters will not notice it.\n\nCertain NPCs can be made into friends by helping them when wounded or doing certain tasks but there's barely any difference when they were originally neutral to you. It's a shame that you can't recruit them to fight alongside your presence.\n\nIn many cases, how NPCs spawn (or where you enter a map) is often stupid. One time, I exited out fo the underground and a group of bandits greeted me by killing me instantly and I couldn't do anything. Other times, killed foes are out of the map boundaries which makes looting their corpses impossible.\n\nFurthermore, even though some enemies are supposed to ignore the player and fight each other, they may actually team up and attempt to kill you, such as when mutants are fighting mercenaries.\n\nThe minor tasks in this game have a time limit (one day of game time). This is a problem because some jobs take a lot of time to complete (such as eliminating ALL members of an opposing force without help or going to the other side of the map). Moreover, you have to claim a reward quickly otherwise, you will be penalized and your reputation may go down (though, because of the huge glitches, it probably won't matter that much as it constantly changes).\n\nShamefully, you cannot fast travel. Some argue it should not be implemented in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but the Zone is huge and to make a simple trip can take a long time, due to the dangers that are present in a pathway.\n\nFinally, the plot is just ok. It has good suspense but it's pretty slow (depending on how fast you want to pass through the game) and the exploration can be distracting.\n\n\nOther:\n\nMultiplayer is still around, but there's only a few servers that have just a handful of players. For me, they all have a ping of more than 200.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe game is overpriced, considering the bugs that the game suffers from. It should have priced at either $10 or $15. If it wasn't for that, I would highly recommend this game.\n\nYou can try to mod this game but beyond changing the skins of textures, you are more likely to face crashes than success.\n\nIn the end, it's a good game if you can get pass through the cons that I mentioned.","January 5, 2015","true","135.0"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","55","62","0","5"

You start as a guy who lost his memory and all you have is a STALKER tatoo on your forearm and a PDA with the task "KILL THE STRELOK".The game offers a great fps experience with some rpg elements combined with a great variety of weapons,suits and medium sized maps filled with mutanats, anomalies and dangerous underground laboratories that host mutated experiments and documents that clear things out for people in the Zone.\nThe Zone is the closed area around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant where this game takes place. The Zone is split in different places controlled by factions that you can ignore,attack or help but beware, once you attack 1 npc from that faction you're going to be at war with them and they will attack you on sight.(except The Monolith faction, they are enemies to all)\nDuring gameplay the user will encounter strange glowing balls in the fields or near anomalies, these are called artefacts and can be used to boost your resists.\nBy following the quest line you will find out the true meaning of your forearm tatoo,the reason of The Zone and how The Zone was created. It may seem logical to do all the main quests but it becomes tricky at a certain point and people seem to ignore this part and just move forward.This leads to the 5 false endings  but if the user pays attention he is rewarded with extra gameplay, 2 more endings and THE TRUTH behind all of this.Yes the game has 7 endings, the 2 real endings and 5 false endings based on decisions throughout the game ( check Google for decisions ).\n\nPeople usually ignore this game when they see Release Date: 20 Mar 2007, good,their mistake.Personally I recommend new players to play this game vanilla and get the real taste of being a STALKER after that you can patch it and have fun, enjoy better textures and explore every corner of The Zone.\n\nPros\n-all from above\n\nCons\n-some bugs\n-can fall out of game map in certain areas\n-too easy to get money,med kits,bandages etc.\n-in cleared areas mutants/npcs respawn probably killing some of your "friends"\n-no way to repair weapons/suits (except mods ) etc.\n\nBUT this is no problem for a true STAKLER.\nNow GET OUT OF HERE STALKER and play the game.","December 3, 2013","true","170.1"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","39","41","0","0"

However, the world that they dev. team have created is one of the most genuinely sinister and oppressive that I have ever experienced in a game. The creatures are disturbing and dangerous, and the lighting (particularly in the darkness) effectively creates a creeping, relentless tension. The moment in the tunnels when you look back and see the silhouette of the Controller emerge for the first time (seasoned players will know what I mean) is one of the most unnerving experiences I can recall having.\n\nLike all the games in the series, Stalker doesn't coddle its players. Starting the game is quite brutal as it can take a new player some time to come to grips to the realism of the gunplay and the initially unforgiving difficulty of the enemies. The bullet physics are realistic in that your weapons aren't perfectly accurate, nor are they entirely reliable, and misfires can be common with weapons of a low condition, so you must use your brain and know your weapons and their limitations before initiating a firefight. In saying that, the game rewards the player by lightening the load as you progress and get better weapons and armour, and by the mid-point the difficulty can lessen considerably.\n\nThe sound is here and there in terms of quality, with the voice acting being average and flat a lot of the time, however, the atmospheric sound, weapon sounds, and THAT droning voice towards the end (seasoned players will understand), really plant a disturbing and terrifying chill in your spine the whole way through. Voice acting aside, the sound in these games are one of my favourite parts.\n\nStalker: SoC is a game I keep coming back to replay again and again, not in the least because of the quality of the mods out there. In saying that, the world that the devs have created and the emotions that that world inspires in me remains with me for long after every play session, and I think that, once one gets past the initial hurdles that the game places in front of you, this is one of the best post-apocalyptic games I've ever played. I feel that, whereas classics like Bioshock (for a random example) are fantastic games that appeal to everyone, cult classics are fantastic games that are an acquired taste. This is very much, in my mind, the absolute definition of cult classic. I highly recommend it (with a good mod like COMPLETE if you wish to smooth the creases out) to anyone looking for a deep, memorable and unsettling FPS experience.","September 26, 2014","true","27.6"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","35","37","0","1"

And it isn't.\n\nTension: I constantly find myself with my face glued to the screen, focusing on capturing a bandits' base, or clearing a military site from all inhabitants. The general suspence of the story and action gives a good vibe and leaves you wanting more.\n\nFood mechanics: Usually games have an out of place or annoying way to tell you that you are litterally dying of malnutrition. Beeping, etc. There would normally be a huge bar or meter that takes up 50% of your hud and just sits there ticking away, dangling over your head.\nWhile SoC likes to just display a tiny window telling you to eat. And when you eat, it goes away. Simple.\n\nScare Factor: I originally disliked the scare factor and claimed it wasn't scary at all, but\nthat was before I got into the underground levels. My seat has the urination of 7+ underground levels soaked into it.\n\nFirst impression: First time I played this game I just looked at the begining cutscene, uninterested, unhyped.\nI didn't even pay attention to it, I just critisized and gawked at the old graphics and continued on my marry little way.\nBut I never analyzed it for what it was, and now that I have I give it a good rating.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nCons:\n\nQuestionable physics engine, Props, corpses and objects will slide and bump around sometimes, breaking immersion and generaly being buggy.\n\nSilly and dumb AI. Usually I'll find bandits or military personel, mutants, friendlies, etc. Staring at walls, shooting ceilings, crouching for no good reason. Sometimes I'll see them killing themselves or other friends really for no actual reason, either. Other times they'll be shouting and screaming while crouched in a corner. The AI really act strange during combat, even not in combat as well.\n\nEnemies, including mutants, will sometimes be in the middle of attacking me and suddenly not care, strolling in the other direction like nothing happened, in their normal voices and walking as if in a passive enviroment. Even during heated gunfights with other npcs, there will always be at least one guy strolling around like there arent grenades and bullets flying past his head.\n\nOne time. I started killing a few bandits near a fire, and as I offed them, the remaining 4 started shouting combat lines, shooting at me, flinching from gunfire, all behaving normally during a gunfight, as they should. Suddenly, they hostler their guns, turn around, and sit near the fire, singing, laughing, playing instruments, drinking vodka, eating sausages, talking to eachother and joking.\nWhile I had just killed their entire squad in front of them\n\nI proceeded to jump in front of them and they continued and even made eye contact with me, I shot one of them in the foot, ran in circles around them and they still never moved an inch. I got fed up and threw a grenade at one of them. They still continued to act idly as they shouted their grenade lines, still sitting down, exploded and died.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nThis is where the Review ends, my conclusion as that this is an overall great game, a strong\n\n9.3/10\n\n\nTL;DR section: Dis game is güd, now go buy it with money.","April 20, 2015","true","4.8"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","92","36","39","15","1"

Why is this my favorite game of all time? The answer is quite easy. It has everything I expect from a top notch shooter. It has unique compelling gameplay, the most immersive atmosphere I ever experienced in a videogame, it´s open world and it has addictive RPG elements. Even factions and a really great story. The reason this game flawed was that it had so many bugs. FREAKIN MANY. After years of patching and fanpatches it finally become stable and accessible for casuals. I don´t recommend to play it without thecommunity fixes which are called "Zone Reclamation Project" since I´m not sure if you would like purest vanilla of da stalker. Let´s go into the details and sort it out for you.\n\n\nGraphics, Technical Aspects:\n\nThe original Stalker was really great looking but it already had its weaknesses. While textures and dynamic lighting were fantastic, the lighting in specific is even better than in some modenr games due to it being 100% real time but the animations and graphical bugs were bad though. Shadows were sometimes really ugly and unrealistic but it was rarer. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky though had some sick high shadow resolutions and realistic lighting! Beautiful landscapes setting the mood perfectly in all of the Stalker games. Back to SoC. Textures were really High Res for it´s time and everything else was top notch too. Animations were mostly robotic but they didn´t give you eye cancer. Guns were looking good and the skybox was incredible. The game was oozing with atmosphere and east european charm. It felt immersive and realistic. The complete mod even made the game looking sweet for today´s standards, adding bump mapping and steep parallax at buildings and streets. They worked and made the game even more immersive and realistic. With Complete Mod 2012 it looks polished and very good but it also overhauls the game balancing too much and make it too easy for the game´s survival aspect. There was also the single core focused engine and the sun shadow bug. The game loses it´s beautiful lighting if you turn off Sun Shadow since it´s turning off the sun. Dumb. It still looks amazing though. I don´t know if the Complete Mod fixed this graphic bug for everyone. It´s a shame that the engine creates this bug with newer graphic cards and drivers.\n\n\nWorld, Atmosphere, AI, Gameplay and Locations:\n\nLike said, the landscapes were breathtaking and are still beautiful today if updated with the Complete Mod and even more so with Autumn Aurora 2.1. The atmosphere is already explained: It´s stunning and immersive, it won´t let you go away. It grabs you and whispers you in your ear: "I know you love me, I saw you fapping. Marry me!" Nuff said. The combination between the world, the free roaming AI, gripping atmosphere and RPG elements (which I will discuss later on in my review) are going hand in hand, creating one of the best gaming experiences I ever had. It builds Nostalgia like a chinese construction worker builds a skyscraper even if the game balancing was quite unbalanced at some points and had some quest breaking bugs. Side quests only though. Devs made sure the main missions work. Autumn Aurora though has a endgame bug where a save goies corrupt. So be aware with Autumn Aurora and save alot.\nI have to tell you about the AI though. It was the problem many had with this game. It was bugged, unpredictable and just plain bad. Just quicksave often. Yes this game is so oldschool it still has the good old quicksave function and due to tough fights it´s necessary. I don´t know why it died. It´s a useful feature even for today´s times. Consoles.... And in this game it´s an elementary function to avoid frustration and anger. ^^´. Finished 3 dudes without having a scratch? Quicksave. Or don´t do it and make it extra hard for yourself. The locations are self explained. Eastern European places like industrial complexes and open places with borders, huge dumps of metallic garbage, discarded train stations, underground research labs with secret experiments, etc....and of course the highlights. PRIPYAT AND THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT. Atmosphere overdose. Especially at night with all the terrifying mutants around you.\nEven though the AI can be stupid as ♥♥♥♥ sometimes, as long as they don´t wallhack and annoy the crap out of you with their deadly accuracy and one hit headshot deaths, they are sometimes even very smart, taking cover, throwing grenades, luring you out of covers and sometimes even silently flanking you. It´s a very strange AI. Definitely better than this linear CoD campaign AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and a lot, A LOT more thrilling and challenging than in most games. Different enemy types from different factions, fighting each other and you of course. Establishing a great universe. The gunplay needs an overhaul with Autumn Aurora or Arsenal Overhaul though as it´s issue with more inaccurate weapons were that the bullets sprayed too randomly to have fake sprays in and out of ADS to simulate the weapon weathering as guns have health, as does armor,etc. It takes too long talking about every gameplay aspect here, watch a youtube vid. Because there are so many hella lot of aspects. I just told you the only big issue with gunplay, the rest is fine but can be improved with recommended mods really. It´s fun with vanilla already, but with mods it´s absolutely epic and godlike. Check out this as an example, not a recommendation as there are better ones outthere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqTwHNR2qMQ\nIf you intend to mod make sure to inform yourself properly and backup your files.  Modding is worth it but can be difficult sometimes and generally wonky too if done not properly. Depends from mod to mod.\n\n\nHorror, Survival, RPG Elements and Dialogues:\n\nThe atmosphere brings up a more unknown part of the game. Horror. At some parts this game freaked me out, even though after I played several horror games very often. Mutants like the bloodsuckers which can make themselves invisible, are giving you the creeps. A strong paranoia is common in quiet parts. Cry of fearish. Combined with the RPG elements it makes a great survival game too. You have an inventory you need to manage. Different ammunition types with different effects, many guns and a lot of different calibers, suppressors, scopes, modifications, PDA with quests and even an ingame encyclopedia. What I want to say is that this game has a lot of content and the game length is easily 20 hrs if you mod... it grow infinite. The dialogue in the game is good at most times and often even funny but you have to read, ok? There are voiced ones but mostly you have to read. So have patience or skip but then miss out on the most of the story. You can miss SO MUCH by skipping. And yes the dialogue isn´t much, loads of reading and it can be ome bad writing, but it non the less grips and entertains everytime.\n\nEndings:\n\nThere are several endings. The bad ending with the wishgranter and the true endings. In order to save your ♥♥♥ from getting the bad ending or the bad true ending follow these steps:\nDo your side missions. Not the small quests, only major sidequests. Before going to the brainscorcher, meet with the guide in order to get to meet the doctor. The true true ending can only be achieved by not agreeing with a certain nature to join their program. The rest would be spoiling.\n\n\nClear Sky and Call of Pripyat:\n\nShadow of Chernobyl is the best part for beginners and rookie stalkers to begin with. Don´t go into the other two since Call of Pripyat has a totally different story and Clear Sky needs some knowledge as it´s an prequel that connects storywise to Shadow of Chernobyl in its own way.\n\n\nConclusion:\nLow priced highly moddable masterpiece with quite the flaws that still shines brighter than a shooting star at the ukrainian nightsky. Grab if you feel like loving and entering the genius art and world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.","December 6, 2013","true","46.7"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","5"

However, unlike most games of the genre, this one's story is something that brings a little extra novelty to the game (the game is based off of the 1972 classic, Roadside Picnic.[www.amazon.com]) Along with this, there was also a movie, which is aptly named Stalker, which was released in 1979. You can read more about that here.[www.imdb.com] The story revolves around the Chernobyl nuclear diasaster in 1986. In the story, the radiation spread much quicker, the effects being much more devastating. Now, radiation storms and rocks, all under the name "anomalies", were scattered across the landscape.\n\nTo get more into the actual game, the gunplay is actually somewhat satisfying. The game is a first person shooter, with elements of an inventory, as well as enemies dropping rare weapons, or better weapons, as well as food, bandages, etc. Akin to games such as DayZ or Arma, the shooting mechanics are meant to be more realistic in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. You bleed at various severities depending on where and how much you have been hit, and you must use bandages to stop the bleeding and heal yourself (food is another option to regain health). Your gun can (and will) jam, and ammo is scarce (even scarcer with some friendly mods). The AI is probably the most lacking of all the gameplay aspects, as their grenade lobbing and intense corner camping can lead to some awkward firefights (the quicksave button is nice). The game revolves around this faction, known as Stalkers. These are freelance men, almost like prospectors, to find valuables deep within the Zone (the area in and around the Chernobyl factory.) Being a Stalker is a dangerous job, which can turn many to a darker side. The Russian Army has become a shell of its former self, now a greedy army looking for power. Factions such as the Duty attempt to rally against this army. Like any good post-apoc game, there are of course low level mercaneries too, there to spoil the fun and become some nice target practice. There are of course more factions, but why spoil them all here? You can read all about them in the ingame PDA.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. holds a place dear in my heart. Many have played it, and it is definitely an inspiration for many popular games today. The definition of a cult classic, this game (as well as the series) is something to be cherished.","October 25, 2014","true","16.5"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","26","29","2","0"

Alot of veterans would say "atmosphere this, atmosphere that, atmosphere everywhere!" Yes, that is the case. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s atmosphere is the selling point of the game with dynamic A-LIFE(AI) going on about the map/level things are dynamic, life goes on every hour and minute, your buddies, friends, fellow faction member can die at any given and they will not stand around in a spot like most games, Various quest and task can fail if ignored or levels can be and will be more harder if everything is well.\n\nThe first instances the game treats you as another soul not knowing what to do in the game, Do not worry You will die and die until you realize you can be doing things much more faster and efficient. The AI in this game is different from others, They can be Amazing and shoot their sawn offs across the horizons or bug out and get stuck in various forms of hilarity but that does not hinder them from being difficult.\n\nThe zone is a dangerous place, pockets of radiation lingering, uneven ground, chemical spills or "Anomalies" that produces different kinds of hazards and also produces rare things called "Artifacts" that gives off various stat changes like take less bleeding, absorbing radiation with some having negative effects to counteract the positives.\n\nNew players will have a gripe on how hard the game is or have no clue on what to do from the realism and gunplay as you will need to try to get another tier before leaving rookie village. ALOT of people will suggest to install mods like complete mod to even out the game and make it more decent but I will ask you to refrain from doing that as it ruins the fun and gameplay of stalker while yes people have opinions on it and the base game itself I will not judge you but I will say that if you did install complete mod there is two snorks profusely laughing and shaking their heads from the doing you have made while a bandit spinning in a whirligig is laughing and saying "AH, SHYA MI WAM ARATI NIDALENIJINI" before exploding.\n\n\nMod talkI must say that it does take some brain to actually edit stuff and play around with configs and actually test you if you know how to use a keyboard besides eating paste and drinking mountain dew as you call in airstrikes for your yearly rehash game. Almost anything can be done in stalker, don't like the vanilla UI or making it more minimal? edit the HUD files. Want your guy to hide his weapon when healing? Edit the .ltx. Do you want another game that looks totally different from stalker altogether? Go crazy and feel the magic.\n\nWhile the average player would not really touch this second and disregard it as they just want to play their games as touching this section of your game will be absolutely life changing, You will not look at stalker the same way as before your first playthrough. some may suggest Autumn Aurora 2 for Shadow of Chernobyl if they absolutely refuse to play vanilla/ZRP(Zone Reclamation Project) for their first being AA2 is an upgrade on graphics and gunplay, there are many mods such as Doom's Mod Merge, or Zone of Alienation even STALKERSOUP that added kitchen sinks.\n\nThere are hundreds of untranslated mod for stalker in ap-pro or any other stalker sites that could be categorize as bad, decent, decently bad or amazing. 99% of the time spent for stalker is modding[puu.sh] your game to have mods on top of mods and making it work, As after you're done it will be amazing and fun, catered to your liking.\nif anything I will absolutely say S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is PC gaming at its finest, this is what is all about, modding to the extent new content is still being made after years and various iterations and improvements the community has given to the series, Really wonderful and talented people.\n\n\nHelpful stuffSo you want to buy stalker? if possible, get the GoG[www.gog.com] version or you already got the game? redeem a non DRM version for free here[www.gog.com]\n\nCan someone explain what all of this in the HUD mean?[a.pomf.cat]\n\nGame Modification\nhttp://www.moddb.com/games/stalker\n\nZone Reclamation Project\nhttp://www.metacognix.com/stlkrsoc/index.html\n\nZone Survival Guide\nhttp://zsg.dk/\n\nGuide by Spartan and dusty_thoreau\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121125400\n\nSet your game difficulty on masters for immersion and actual difficulty. Remove crosshairs, you do not need it. (optional) disable map radar via hud edits, you do not need it but some people would like to see where they are or dead bodies(map tells the story more than anything)\n\nGood hunting, stalker enjoy the zone and have a great time.\n(wew, shameless plug here, I do encourage people to be self reliant, get into stalker modding, and help others if they have game problems)","December 25, 2015","true","266.8"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","26","29","2","6"

STALKER is a bleak, nightmareish vision brought to life even more so with the huge collection of community made mods available.\n\nThis was the first game in the trilogy of games the other two being Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky (a prequal). Both of which are also incredible, CoP more so.\n\nWhen you leave the Cordon for the first time after speaking to Wolf, walking up that path towards the road, turning and seeing your brothers slowly disappear into the distance, hearing the wind howl around the barrel of your creaky old shotgun, suddenly hearing some sort of demonic cry far away to the east and a chill creeps down your back. The sun is low in the musty sky - but just up ahead there is an old abandoned mill to explore, just make use of the fading light.\n\nFor me this game creates an atmosphere I've never felt before (or since, other STALKER titles not including) of a world gone to hell - the Zone, a huge area of land around the defunct Chernobyl reactor, now infested with nightmareish creatures deformed by radiation, different collections of (human) mostly factions wanting to kill you on sight and rob your last tin of tuna. Secret underground labs where horrific experiments happened before everything went to hell. Deserted farm buildings where blood hungry things lurk in the dark. STALKER is all about tension and fear, but also survival.\n\nThere are mods you can get that improve just about every aspect of the original game, textures, weapons, music, audio, bugs ironed out, even previously unnavailble areas.\n\nI love STALKER, it's tremendously satisfying to survive in the Zone, it's terrifying, compelling and full of detail (if you also read all of lore/diary entries that Marked One enters into your PDA throughout the game.\n\nFor anybody that likes FPS/open world survival shooters with strong RPG elements, for anybody that loves to become really immersed in their chosen universe, there is nothing quite like STALKER.\n\nJust don't forget your anti rads, and take care of Nimble - he's worth it.","December 21, 2014","true","12.5"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

A little rough around the edges and glitchy, but still a great game.  The game is over 7 years old, so it is a little dated as well.\n\nThe game takes place in "The Zone", referring to the uninhabitable area surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear power station.  You start the game as a man with amnesia.  Throughout the game, you try to piece together who you are.\n\nWithin The Zone, there are anomalies, bandits, mutants, and treasure.  You have a lot of choice in the game.   You can use something loud like an AK-47 or you can try and be stealthy.\n\nThe only real problem I have with this game (besides the glitches and other bugs) is that it is very difficult at the start.  You start with a pistol and some food, so it is difficult to kill the bandits/soldiers who have much better weapons than you at the start of the game.\n\nOverall, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a flawed yet fun open-world FPS.","October 26, 2014","true","8.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

SOC is quite rough, but well worth playing through.\n\nSOC is a fairly non-linear FPS with light RPG elements. RPG elements are mostly in the form of an inventory system and NPCs to converse with. Character progression is purely in the form of equipment, as you progress through the game you will find better weapons, outfits and artifacts (radioactive items that grant small defensive bonuses). There are plenty of side quests, mostly taking the form of repetitive fetch quests, but sometimes more complex.\n\nWhat really sets the STALKER series apart from most games is the amazing atmosphere. The game has an extremely bleak and depressing atmosphere. The game is set in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, and contains many real world locations that the developers painstakingly researched.\n\nSOC has an extremely active modding community, I would highly recommend skipping the highly publicised "Complete" mod and instead playing with ZRP for your first playthrough. After a first playthrough with ZRP it might be worth trying out the Oblivion Lost or AMK mods, which make quite drastic changes to the gameplay.","April 16","true","131.5"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

I have heard there are many great mods, but my first playthrough was without any.\n\nThis game really was a joy to play. From the awesome world and the terrifying encounters,  to the unintentionally hilarious vodka overdoses and the cheeki breeki-ing, I really ♥♥♥♥ing liked it. The game has been compared to Fallout and other RPG post-apocalyptic survival games, but I like to classify it as it's own type of game. A game where the unknown frightens you and you are left fighting for survival where it seems everything is out to get you. The specifics of what I liked and disliked are recorded in the following paragraphs.\nTHINGS I LIKED:\n1.First of all, this game has something really special, and equally hard to describe. To put it simply, the world seems to be alive in a way I haven't felt in many other games. Let me paint a picture: You come back to an outpost after a hard day of fighting bizzare mutations and equally bizzare bandits and sit down the fire by a complete stranger playing the guitar. As night falls, you enjoy a diet sausage and a bottle of vodka around the open fire in silence, treasuring these moments of peace. This is what I really love about this game. That is about the only way I can describe it. The feel of the world is Just sublme.\n2. The core gameplay feels very solid. Guns kill suprisingly quickly and gunfights feel very tense, as if you are actually fighting for your life.\n3. The story is presented in a unique and fascinating way.  You must learn about your world and what is happening through the PDAs of dead stalkers and dialogue with living ones. The story is subtle and leaves a lot up to speculation, in a way similar to Dark Souls, which I absolutely love.\n4. Lastly, the game runs like a pro. Kind of a big deal if your computer is utter ♥♥♥♥, like mine.\nThat's what I liked, now here are the things that I kind of disliked (nit-picking ahead)\nDISLIKES:\n1. There are a few bugs, which can be expected from a game of this age, although I have read that the majority of them can be fixed with various mods.\n2. Guns in the beginning are extremely inaccurate. This isn't necissarilly a con, but expect to be missing about 90% of your shots from anywhere over 20 meters until you find something that isn't a Kalashnikov variant.\n3. The graphics aren't great. I say this, but the dull graphics kind of add to the game's gloomy mood. Again, if they aren't for you, there are a plethora of mods.\n4. I like to pretend that the multiplayer doesn't exist.\n\nCONSENSUS: I love this game. It is one of the most unique experiences that I have been a part of in a while. Whilethere are a few problems, I plan on playing through again with one of the many overhaul mods, which I heard can provied an even better experience. Will definately be checking out Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky.\n\nNOTE: Helps if you speak Russian. Not a must, but adds to the immersion and authenticity.","January 23, 2015","true","18.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the best games of it's kind.\n\nTHE LONG REVIEW:\nShadow of Chernobyl has been in my Steam library (and backlog) for quite some time - haven't really had a chance to sit down and play the game, but after longing for something post-apocalyptic until Fallout 4, I'd thought that I would give this game a go. It's safe to say that Shadow of Chernobyl has become an instant favourite, and has immersed me within it's interesting world.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple, if you've played an FPS then you should come to expect the usual, but what makes SoC interesting is it's environments and it's desolate world. Even though I love Fallout, there were some parts that didn't really capture the feeling of lost-hope or desolation, SoC on the other hand nails it completely. It's an interesting blend between world building and exploration that makes me want to know everything about what's going on, there's not really a "solid" story so your left to your own devices to investigate (at your own pace of course).\n\nSoC has a great way of getting you to become distracted by the strange things, and this curiosity makes the game great to play. The gameplay, however, is slightly hindered by it's save system. It can become a hassle because you have to make sure you have at least more than one saves (or your screwed). Depending on where or when you save can mean life or a quick death, which can be a gamble when it might or might not help you out in the end.\n\nThough combat is great, it can often unforgiving as there are moments where you might pelt someone with a load of bullets followed by a swift death. Again, depending on where you saved it might be the difference between having to redo a section or redo an entire quest. Luckily later on in the game you are given access to more formidable weapons making the combat much easier and quicker to complete.\n\nThere were moments where I was invested into the gameplay, and then there were other moments where I felt like I needed a break from it. It also doesn't help that the game lacks a fast travel system, but it does add to the immersion (which is always a plus in my book). I'm sure with the help of mods there will be a way to fix some of these issues, and I'm most certain I'll be using them on a second playthrough.\n\nShadow of Chernobyl is a first person shooter at heart, but it's a unique one none the less. There are so many survival elements and atmospheric set pieces that draw you into the game. It's not game of the year material, but it's certaintly one of the best survival games out there.\n\nAlso as a compromise to Fallout's Galaxy News Radio I'd reccomend listening to Apocalypse Please by Muse (or any of their songs). I just happend to be listening to them while playing SoC and something just resonated. Enjoy!\n\nMADE FOR: Hardcore fans of the post apocalyptic genre\n\nNOT MADE FOR: Players that want an easy survival game (STALKER can be extremely unforgiving at times).\n\nSTALKER: SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL\n8.5/10","June 29, 2015","true","17.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

No, I think not. This game is literally ground-breaking even compared to the games of today, 2015.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl has some of the best AI that you could ask for, only the players interaction and the pathfinding is scripted. All encounters with the enemy are purely random depending on which side is luckiest or which side the player chose to join or fight.\n\nThe story is kind of vague but the cutscenes are amazing. There are 7 different endings, 2 depending on choices and 5 depending on stats. The story, though vague, is Really good.\n\nThe story starts after a second nuclear disaster of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, you wake up in a small village with no memory of what has happened or who you are, except you have been given a task on your PDA to "Kill Strelok" or "Стрелок" which is Russian for Gunslinger. from there, it's pretty much freeroam with a few main-objectives which leads to a conclusion. The game is as long as you want it to be, depending on which missions you partake in and how much gear you need (or THINK you need) for the next objective.\n\nI played this game with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. COMPLETE 2009 mod.\nAll in all, this is a really awesome experience. My rating would be 9/10 (with above mod)\nThe only thing that could make it better, would be a deeper story... Well, not deeper, but better explained. But that's why I'm going to play the prequel now!\n\n-For the right ending, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat takes place after Strelok destroys the C-Consciousness.\nI won't really call this a spoiler, more of a guideline.\n\nChronological Order:\n1: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

I have learned in my limited amount of playing that complacency equals death, there is no relaxing, there is no zoning out there is only concentration.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game, sound engineering, tonality of the setting and the ambience really give off that feeling that you aren't in a playground, you are in a world where one wrong corner and one stray bullet can stop you dead.\n\nThe best way the developers could get that message across to the player is when you first step out of sids bunker, there's a random series of beeps, the wind blows and sometimes a cat wails in what is probably its last moments.\n\nThe wind blows emptily through the tree's in the distance you can hear the droning about the zone being a deathtrap and a first time player can feel extremely out of their depth, confused and lost. That feeling of dread and confusion will stick to you throughout the game, that feeling is your survival instincts, a gut feeling you never really understood until now.\n\nThe first thing many players including myself learn is that you aren't  a walking death machine, you are frail and the zone let's you know that with a swift death, a death you will repeatedly see until the game crushes your precogniscent mindset on how you play shooters. You will reach a point where you will be angry and the game feels too hard and unfair but deep down, you know it was your own error that killed you so many times.\n\nLearn the mantra: "The zone gives with one hand and can take with the other."\n\nNext comes your rebirth, you become cautious of everything, every noise, every voice, bang, scream, growl and even your own footsteps. You learn the cordon like the back of your hand, you study where the dogs go and how the boars attack, you watch the military patrol, you'll probably get brave and after earning enough seeking artifacts you'll bribe the guard to let you through the railway bridge. You memorize every stash you find, you break every box, you loot everything and you drag yourself, heavy footed to the newbie village, down into sids bunker and you unload your winnings.\n\nThen, your second lesson begins; you aren't a mule, you cannot carry every gun in the eventuality you will need it, you don't need 30 cans of meat or 50 medkits, you will never need to carry every AK47 you find. Yes I know i've played fallout and yes it kills me to leave stacks of guns on the roadside. But you need to train that out of yourself, if not, you will die and lose it all and it's that crushing choice between leaving a nice heavy suit at the bottom of a ladder or suffer a grim death at the jaws of a pack of dogs that will be your making.\n\nLearn the mantra: "Greed Kills"\n\nThe third lesson is one that takes time to practice and patience. The zone does not work to your advantage, you are a guest in the zone and everything there is designed to kill, you will become aware that even the air itself can kill you. One thing that terrified me was anomalies, I initially thought after studying the cordon that anomalies were a semi-visible entity that could be easily avoided, how wrong was I when I walked straight into an electro anomaly, and a burner, and vortex anomalies. The third lesson took time and plenty of error to get right, bolts are key in passing through new areas safely pay attention to the beeping you hear that's your only way of knowing they're nearby, that and always staying mindful of the other noises around you.\n\nLearn the mantra: "My ears precede my eyes"\n\nThe forth lesson in one that you should have been practising since day one in the zone and that's foreplanning; ensuring you have the ample equipment for the job. The landscape of each mission can vary massivley so preplan your travel. Read about the areas online, ask the stalkers about the surrounding areas, learn all you can, because even with that knowledge you can still be taken by suprise.\n\nLearn the mantra: "the enemy of my enemy will also kill me...unless I know they both will already"\n\nThe fifth and final lesson is discipline, knowing your environs is all well and good but understanding that the previous four lessons are not merely one time tips but a collective of constants is key. Repeating the same processes over and over becomes almost habit the act of stop, look, listen, wait becomes second nature, this is when you begin to fully understand the game you play with the zone. The game isn't to win and kill everything, it isn't even to be the best, it's about being the one who knows when to pick their moments, the right equipment, the right time of day, the right moment to move from building to building.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl isn't your average game, it's a lesson in life in a way, it's a mantra in itself that if you give up, you'll only feel sour about doing so, if you fail repeatedly then the way you're doing it is wrong and most of all if you relax for just one second you could get your face inverted by a bandit with a sawnoff.","May 8, 2015","true","44.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

We write the year 2012 and You have to go into the destroyed environment which is called "the zone" to complete your last task - find and kill Strelok. "The zone" is dangerous - radioactivity, mutants, mercenary and the army will make your life hard.\n\nStalker is (in my opinion) a mixture of (singleplayer) RPG and\n(Horror-)Ego-Shooter.

SoC is a fantastic game, undoubtedly the most atmospheric game I've ever played, the level of immersion is absurd. You play as a Stalker, seeking wealth from the sale of artefacts found in the surrounding area of Chernobyl, however, the "Zone" is not a friendly place and danger throughout the game is constant.\n\nThe gameplay is great, although a little rough at first sight, you need to play at a more measured pace, as I said, the Zone is dangerous, there are many enemies, from bandits and mercenaries, through military and enemy factions of stalkers, plus mutants and environment traps known as anomalies which can kill you instantly. The AI is very good and challenging, which uses efficient combat tactics. There are a wide variety of items, artefacts, weapons and ammunition necessary for progression. The game is graphically outdated but there are mods that greatly improve the look, the setting in the game is a strong point, combined with great sound effects which contribute a lot to the immersion factor, tension is inevitable in some places as enemies camps and underground laboratories.\n\nThe plot is solid, despite being basically a shooter, there are RPG elements such as multiple endings which depend on your posture during the game, there are factions that you can be friendly, enemy or neutral, depending on your attitudes and choices. The game has a great replay value.\n\nOne negative point are the side missions, they are shallow and poorly drawn up, become repetitive with time, which discouraged me to continue making them. The base game is known to have some bugs, by recommendations I played with the Complete 2009 mod, which fixes those bugs, improves graphics, AI, sounds, among other things.\n\nAt the end, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a unique game, I couldn't recommend it more.\n\n9/10","February 20, 2014","true","21.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

The game takes place in an alternate reality, with the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone being the setting. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is a 30 square Kilometer area surrounding the Cernobyl Nuclear Power Plant which suffered a catastrophic explosion and subsequent meltdown in the 1980's. This "Zone" in the game is home to mutant creatures such as Dogs, Boars, Birds, and Humanoid Creatures, as well as S.T.A.L.K.E.R's who are treasure and artifact hunters, guides, and mercenaries paid to work in and around the Zone. The game takes place over 20 years after the initial disaster, when a second disaster occurs creating pockets of radioactivity and producing anomalies. This is where the main character comes in. You play in First Person as an amnesiac S.T.A.L.K.E.R, nicknamed The Marked One. You are rescued by one of the locals and in exchange you perform tasks and go on missions, while trying to figure out who you are and why you lost your memory.\n\nAs far as First Person Shooters go, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the more fun ones; However, there are a few bugs. Enemy soldiers respawn way to quickly in some areas, NPC's even Quest NPC's are mortal and will stay dead if killed, making some NPC's difficult to contact or keep alive for long, on the harder difficulty settings. The Game AI is very adaptable, making the NPC's react differently depending on the tactics you choose to use. The environment is also errie, and when played at night, in the dark with headphones really makes you feel immersed in the game. The story is interesting, though told a piece at a time through missions and meeting new contacts. I recommend playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky first since it is technically a prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl, though S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl stands strong on it's own even for a 7-year-old game  and is worth the price to play.","September 29, 2015","true","1.9"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","4"

It causes a lot of bugs, glitches and crashes. The game can be modified in various ways by adding graphical improvements and additions increasing the atmosphere of the game. The modifications themselves are very nice but could damage our game and exactly our saves. The graphics are not bad but you can feel the game is already very old. Soundtrack is very good especially when we meet stalkers by the fire when they are playing on guitar. Russian dubbing gives incredible climate for the game. The game offers us two modes for single player and multiplayer. History tells us about a stalker who does forgot what had happened to him and he discovers that in your PDA has a note "Kill Strielok".\nIn the game we will visit the large parts of the Zone. We will visit places such as Kordon, laboratories at Jantar filled with mutants and zombies, Pripyat a beautiful and also frightening place and also stunningly nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. The game offers us a wide arsenal of weapons starting with the usual guns ending with Gauss rifle. During an game player is forced to frequent management equipment because it is a not enough to carry everything.\n\nI recommend you also certain modifications called  Autumn Aurora 2.1  a really great mod completely changes the look of the game, adds new models of weapons, suits and improved animations. Also adds to the game emissions, new monsters, the ability to sleep and damage to suits and weapons but also their repair.","June 30, 2015","true","41.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

This is the first, Shadow of Chernobyl, and it's a very enjoyable experience.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, I'll move on to the important stuff.\n\nWhen you fire up a STALKER game for the first time, one of two things will happen; either it will load without incident, or the game will crash. It's a fact of life; the sun shines, it's currenty 8:00 AM as I write this, and STALKER games like to crash for no particular reason. Disabling the Steam overlay in-game and fiddling with the graphics options, or disabling whatever mods you may have active seems to fix most problems, but sometimes you'll get a bug that, no matter what you do, will not go away. In that case, it's time to hit the Internet and hope that someone has a fix, which, more often than not, they do.\n\nWhen you do get the game to work, start it on a higher difficulty than normal. Sounds stupid, but there's a reason for that. STALKER does a lot of weird things to the guns on lower difficulties, including making a certain amount of shots (both your's and the enemy's) fade completely out of existence before hitting the target. If you're wondering why your gun isn't hitting anything even thought you've got the crosshairs on your scope lined up right on the target's head, that's why. Also, everything on the low difficulties is a bullet sponge. You are too, but only until the end, where the enemies kill you by so much as staring in your general direction. You still die fast on the higher difficulties, but now the enemies will, too. Just remember to save often to prevent crashes from erasing the last hour of progress.\n\nIf you've gathered one things from that last paragraph, it's probably that the game is pretty hard. It is, although it's also fair. You die after a few hits, but so do most enemies that aren't armored or bigger than you. In addition, every human enemy can be instantly killed by shooting them in the head with any weapon in the game (although you will need armor piercing ammo to do the same for the guys in the late-game). If you can deal with the iron sights and semi-automatic fire rate on your assault rifle, you can get through the game without much issue, although it's still a good idea to invest in better guns and optics; the iron sights on all guns tend to be a little bit hard to find. By that, I mean that the sights are off, and the bullets like to go everywhere. On the starting Makarov handgun, for example, the sights resemble a brick set between two other, differently colored bricks (although, to be fair, this is how Makarov sights look in real life). The bullets also go a little higher than you would expect. The rifles have the same problems, but they can be fixed by grabbing a scope and slapping the two together. And hey, you can take the scope off when it's time to upgrade your equipment, so you're not stuck buying another one!\n\nSpeaking of equipment, there's weapon degradation in STALKER. The good news is that, unlike the other games, you can sell your stuff no matter how broken it is. The bad news is that there's no way to fix the stuff you like. So, if you found that Desert Eagle chambered for 9x39 rounds, you might want to be careful how you use it, because that gun absolutely wrecks everything and there's only one in the entire game.\n\nOh yes, there's also load times. They're not that bad, but there's a lot of them. Whenever you go into a new area, it takes a few seconds to load, so get used to that.\n\nThe good news is, that's pretty much the extent of the bad. Now, let's talk about the good.\n\nSTALKER has managed to blend elements of RPG games and FPS games in a good way. It's still a FPS game, mind you, and it doesn't have experience points or any way of leveling up, but it does have a healthy amount of inventory management. During my playthrough of this game, I spent more time messing about with my guns and ammo than I did in Resident Evil 4. Be warned that bringing up your inventory does not pause the game; you can still move while rearranging things, and enemies can still attack you. If you want to pause, hit the ESC key.\n\nThe Zone is an excellent setting full of whimsy and terror. I spent just as much time frolicking over hills while drinking enough vodka to give a troubled Soviet general alcohol poisoning as I did crawling through decrepit buildings with my flashlight on, hoping a Bloodsucker wasn't waiting around the next corner, ready to tear my throat out. It really captures what it feels like living in modern-day Russia, except Russia in real life has more mutants than in STALKER.\n\nThe guns are a bit finicky, but the shooting feels fun and rewarding. The recoil is harsher than in most games, which is all the more reason why you should use semi auto.\n\nDisregarding the crashes, the game runs pretty well. I only saw it start to sputter in a few cases, and it actually didn't crash on me that much. I believe I had an issue where it crashed whenever I tried to start a new game, and after that, it crashed two or three more times, but both of those were fixed by just firing the game up again. It wasn't as bad as New Vegas, that's for sure.\n\nSo, should you buy STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl? That depends. If you're a fan of open-world games like New Vegas, then you will enjoy this game. I highly recommend it.\n\n","September 30, 2014","true","32.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

When i wrote the reviews for the stalker series i based them off the Complete Mod.  Well, now i'm going to do one based off the vanilla experience.  In case anyone reads this VERY soon after publishing this, if you read the other stalker reviews before i've edited them, disregard them because they will be based on the Complete Mod.\n\nSo, where do i begin?  Oh yeah, the bugs.  For any new gamers playing this game....it's buggy as hell.  Thank God for mods.  This was the last of the 3 stalker games i played on vanilla because i heard so many bad things about the vanilla experience.  Let me just say this.....i REALLY wish i had played the vanilla game first before the mods, because you truly get a glimpse of just how difficult and demanding of focus this game is/demands.\n\nIt took me 5 years after release to buy this game because i kept seeing the letters R, P, and G.  Those 3 letters are a turn off to me because when i think of RPGs i think of relentless inventory management, grinding of situations to level up, and MILLIONS of side quests that make for a overlong experience thats full of filler....and more filler.  These 3 games managed to be FPS's with RPG ELEMENTS.  As i've learned while playing many of these types of games....this is what i like.  I like RPG elements.  Just not RPGs.  There is no filler here.  Sure, you have side quests to do, some of which pertain to the story, some don't.  Usually they take a matter of 5-10 minutes, so doing the numerous side quests doesn't feel like a drag.  And as far as the inventory management is concerned, you can only hold 50kg of weight, so you might have to drop something to make room for another.  However, this notion has a little bonus that i personally enjoy.....YOU ARE EXPOSED while accessing your inventory.  Nothing quite like checking to see how much ammo or money you have in the middle of a field when out of nowhere a bloodsucker comes and starts clawing at your face.....love it.\n\nNow, on to more pressing matters.  First of all, story.  While i didn't do alot of research regarding the Chernobyl Nuclear meltdown in 1986, i did have knowledge of it happening.  What this game (and franchise for that matter) did, was open my eyes to the destructive wonder the zone has created.  An environment such as this is presented with this haunting, grimm, terrifying beauty.  It's hard stating that because of the real lives lost and the vacancy of a city of 50,000 people, but a real world event presented in a video game has managed to propel me to researching the city of Pripyat and the events of the meltdown.  Never before has a video game world captivated me so much.  Groups of people known as Stalkers travel to the zone for mysterious artifacts that provide a fortune.  Yet, even in a time of destruction humans cant seem to unite, and instead branch off into different factions.  Ever wonder why our world if this way?  Check out the story of Metro Last Light.....you'll see a glimmer of hope.  Anyway, you venture through the zone gearing up to battle other stalkers and mutants to reach the heart of the zone...The Nuclear Power Plant.  Wont spoil anymore.\n\nThe sound design is some of the best i've ever heard in any game. Never before had i played a game that made me jump out of my seat.  When you're walking through a corridor in an eroded lab with virtually no light and no ammo with a gun thats 10 bullets away from breaking in half, and the only sound you hear is either the growl of a controller or a pipe creaking, you're ready to take 2 steps back.  Such is life in the underground labs.\n\nThe artifacts provide an RPG element to the table that is the equivelent to supernatural powers.  They provide you with powers such as protection from anomalies, claw attacks, or added bullet protection.\n\nLast but not least, the gameplay.  Now, my personal tastes of a sandbox game with no filler aside, this game has a decent length time.  A completionist run can be accomplished in about 25-30 hours, which i personally believe is a perfect length.  There is some inventory management, but with the realtime aspect, you wont be spending much time sifting through.  Your guns erode with use, meaning the accuracy is affected with extensive use and they can even jam.  Always make sure you carry a couple guns with you at all times.  Your armor also diminishes after taking some punches, which again, cause the protection to lessen.  As you lose armor, bullets and anomalies will do more damage to you.  Thankfully, with all the artifacts spread across the zone, money isn't an issue, so buying a new armor suit shouldn't be a problem.  But the biggest thing for new players reading this to know is, once you get about 3/4 the way through the game, there's no turning back.  You might not know when that moment is exactly, so be sure you're equipped for ANY situation.  This game is quite difficult, but there's a bit of a difficulty spike in the last 1/4 of the game.\n\nIt's one of those games that's oldschool, in the regard that it doesn't hold your hand.  Gamers are spoiled today by having everything spoon fed to them.  This game?  Not al all.  There is basically no tutorial and a steep learning curve.  If you ask me, it works well because it trains you to be on your toes.....and you need to be to finish this beast on the hardest skill level (which is where you should play it).  It's gritty, it's relentless, and it may cause some rage in the many deaths you may have, but somehow manages to be so rewarding at the same time.  Fantastic game, with even more potential if not for annoying bugs and a better optimized engine.\n\n8.8/10","November 26, 2015","true","230.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

And bugs can be fixed with mods, and mods is another reason why I have so many hours on this game. The mods released for this game can completely change the experience and make it feel like you're playing the game for the first time again, and mods like ZoA, AMK, and LURK can extend the replayability to ridiculous levels, into the range of multiple thousand hours.\n\nIf you haven't played this yet, you are missing out on one of the greatest experiences in the shooter genre. Buy it, get the ZRP patches, turn the difficulty to Master, turn off your crosshair, and prepare to be immersed in one of the most interesting game universes out there.

Other reviews will use the term "ahead of its time" and in many ways they are right, but the term I wish to emphasize is "Masterpiece".\n\nI don't know how I came across this game, I think my bestie told me to check it out sometime back in 2006/7; after finally acquiring it, putting a few hours in, I realized that I have been feeling something I hadn't felt since my Freshman year roommate presented me with Fallout 2 back in 2000. (Yes I've played Bethesda's Fallout games, yes they are enjoyable, well-made and recommended, but the bottom line is that I compare FO3/FO4 to Stalker, and Stalker did it better, end of argument).\n\nI have played it a total of 7 times since 2007, meticulously finishing all the unique side quests and story-lines, and on a number of occasions, playing one of the overhaul project mods that add tons of content and fix the vanilla issues I remember suffering through playing back in 2007. Yes, I suffered from the stupid decision to release the game before it was completed, but it is so good I went ahead and played it any ways! There were many frustration moments back then, and I learned valuable lessons about Hard Saves and questing management, so if you haven't played the game, I envy you, because you will get to enjoy this Masterpiece after it has ages splendidly.\n\nI'll start with the Cons:\n-You shouldn't play the Vanilla, not when excellent overhaul mod projects exist. The game has been patched by the original development team but there are still some bugs that can be really annoying.\n-This game will test your limits, both in patience and resilience, mirroring in a way the plight of the protagonist. There will be moments when you jump scared, and others when you jump screaming in rage.\n-This is an FPS game, so shooting is mostly how you solve your problems. The trick to thinking outside the box is how to circumvent your problem so you won't have to shoot in the first place (or shoot a lot less)! Don't expect much from the dialogue resolution options nor expect high levels of stealth options in missions, but sneaking around can both be useful and rewarding!\n\nPros:\n-Immersive, beautiful and haunting. It's not a huge world, which allows you to truly bond with each location as many locations will be revisited so many times as you quest and adventure on.\n-Strong story-line, lore and voice casting. Just the right amount of Sci-Fi-Realism fusion.\n-A user-friendly interface and control system that doesn't concern itself with console 'peasants' (Sorry Bethesda, but your UI needs serious remodeling, it's the main reason I stopped playing your games)\n-Great gun action, great thriller moments, heart-pounding narrow-escapes. Gun handling feels authentic, combat is exhilarating.\n-The game ages like fine wine, with texture mods and 1080p support you won't believe this is an 8 years old game coming from the Ukraine.\n\nI'm tired, and hungry, go play the game if you haven't, you'd be a fool not to!","February 2","true","37.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I played on stalker difficulty with complete mode 2009, i don't do hard mode on first play troughs. Even so, it was quite challenging at the end, as I entered Chernobyl complete unprepared, with zero med kits in the bag and all the wrong artifacts. That was not a walk in the park. All in all, it took me almost 40 hours with many side quests, and now I think of those 40 hours as some of the best in my 12-13 years of gaming history. The atmosphere is  unique, running trough the post apocaliptic abandoned and creepy Pripiat, followed by a dozen mutated dogs and some other ugly as ♥♥♥♥ monsters while shot by snipers and trapped by anomalies is quite strangely awesome.

It is a game that has that rough about to explode feeling that some of the more unpolished games tend to give off. The animation is a little off, the difficulty tends to jump all over the place, the text is often complete gibberish thanks to a shoddy Russian to English translation and the game is generally very unoptimized. Yet it's a fun game. Despite all it's flaws Shadow of Chernobyl manages to hit some of the right keys that makes it a great gaming experience.\n\nShadow of Chernobyl is an open-ended first person shooter taking place in and around the highly radioactive Chernobyl area. Now, this isn't the real world birth defect causing radiation, it's the more fun and cherry cartoon radiation that in this world causes mutated monster animals and a variety of spatial anomalies.\n\nAs you travel the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. you will encounter various factions fighting it out in the "zone" as they call it, all with hilariously translated dialog. You do missions, find secrets and fight the wilderness and the people in at as you make your way towards ground zero of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster to discover the truths about what has happened here.\n\nShadow of Chernobyl is a game that should receive a mediocre review anywhere based on it's rather massive technical problems but it somehow manages to overcome it's difficulties thanks to some solid basic gameplay and a strong modding community.

I first tried STALKER when it came out half a gaming century ago, but my rig sucked. I was pleased to see, that it runs like a charm on my relatively modern machine.\n\nFirst of all: The game is old. Do not expect up to date visuals, do not expect to find a modern UI. Expect to move your hand a lot over the keyboard, because those hotkeys are scattered like they were in the day. Expect to push your mouse over buttons in menus.\n\nYou should also refrain from expecting a fast paced shooter. STALKER will kick your ♥♥♥. Do not expect to land a head shot with a pistol over long distances. STALKER features some pseudo realistic mechanics, which are not 1:1 real physics but give you a rough feeling about what it means to fire an old worn out gun during a rainy day at a moving target.\n\nWhen I first launched the game and started moving around, I got a little dizzy, because the head bobbing is a little more than I can digest. It's an old but famous game, so naturally I looked for mods. The first hit brought me to a mod package, that tries to fix some bugs and combat annoyances, while trying to retain as much of the vanilla state as possible. Have a look at the "Zone Reclamation Project".\n\nThe difficulty is good. I play on "Veteran", the second hardest of four settings. I expected to die a lot, being punished for being careless and exactly that happens. One dog, one soldier, one mutant no problem, but as soon as I rush in and overlook one of them, the surround me and I'm dead.\n\nI like how this game can do without pseudo RPG crap. While there is an inventory system and everything has multiple stats, there is no EXP, no skill tree and no character stat farming. Jobs (quests, missions) give you money and equipment and allow you to progress in the story.\n\nLet's see if this turns out to be more than run around and shoot bad guys. The scenario is promising.","September 27, 2014","true","4.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The atmosphere is fantastic and unlike any other game out there. it was in development for years and even though they didn't manage to include everything they wanted, what they did is still incredible. this is no Console shooter or port, if you want a simple run and gun don't buy it and play for 20 minutes and complain when unlike Crysis you can't kill everything in 10 seconds with your hi tech gun and invincible **** suit.\n\n\nFirst of all, don't play it without downloading the Complete mod for free first. This updates the textures, sounds, AI, fixes a load of bugs and errors and makes the game what it wanted to be. It doesn't change anything, just cleans it all up.\n\nThis game isn't like other FPS because it is actually hard. You don't start off with an amazing gun and squad and intel, you have a coat and a pistol and aside from that you are on your own. The Zone is an easy place to die even without having a host of powerful mutants and heavily armed humans roaming around. This game doesn't hold your hand like Western shooters do, or load you up with amazing gear under the guise of being some Spec Ops soldier. The atmosphere is incredible, part's of it are creepy as hell and scary and not like the Doom3 teen equivalent of having a monster jump out when you press the door button or a loud bang etc. It is hard to get into because it is so unforgiving, and the first few maps and missions you are constantly trying to find a decent weapon that doesnt force you to retreat when outnumbered etc. If you want a linear shooter like HL2 or CoD with no freeplay, dialogue or exploration and lots of cutscenes then look elsewhere. There are plenty of games liek that around. if you want a slow hard atmospheric adventure then give it a try, turn out all the lights and play it till the sun comes up; call in sick and keep on playing.\n10/10","December 6, 2013","true","22.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There's no way to properly express how fantastic it is. But I'll try I suppose.\n\nThe game takes place in Chernobyl, as the title suggests, though this Chernobyl is a much more mysterious one. After scientists went and messed around in Chernobyl after the disaster, weird crap started happening. Blowouts, anomalies, artifacts, and nasty warped mutants craving human flesh. The game is a mix between the real life place Chernobyl, obviously, mixed in with world and plot elements from the novel Roadside Picnic (which is my favorite book ever) and the film based on the book, Stalker (which is a great film too). I will never know why they picked that book, Chernobyl, and mutants in one game but one can only think it must've been some divine force that made it happen. The game is a lot like a realistic, Slavic, and overall more terrifying version of Fallout. Not saying that Fallout is bad though.\n\nGameplay is top-notch, the shooting is pretty great and going and finding artifacts can be really tricky. Depending on your alliances, you'll go up against either bandits, different factions, loners, or everyone. The fights are intense and may require many reloads before you figure out how to stump your enemies. This is not an easy game at all, even on the easier difficulties. It's hard as balls and will mess you up hard, you can't go without quicksaving. I'm not good at videogames, so it was a struggle to finish this one, but it was worth it.\n\nI can't go talking about a game without talking about it's faults though, no matter how much I adore it. The AI is weird in this one... it goes from Vash the Stampede level of accuracy to the level of skill you'd expect from a drunk man. The graphics aren't exactly triple-A material either but the atmosphere and the overall visual design makes up for it.\n\nSTALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is an interesting and unique title; there really isn't anything like it. It has its bugs and technical isssues, yes, but that won't stop me from loving truly awesome, scary, intense game. In the words of Number 6™, "There's nothing quite like Russian post-apocalyptic fiction, comrade!"\n\n\nEDIT: I made a video review if you want to check it out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKv8Mhr1IuI","July 7, 2015","true","35.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Some will love it, some will hate it. I keep deleting what I'm saying, so I'll just bullet point pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n-Brilliant setting: Chernobyl has been a place I have wanted to visit for a long time. It is essentially a place on earth that has been frozen in time, and the ability to explore it can be extremely immersive at times. Pripyat in particular offers amazing urban combat, allowing you to snipe from windows in high apartment buildings or taking the fight to the irradiated alleyways of the city.\n\n-White-knuckle tension: SoC has the ability to literally keep you on the edge of your seat at times, especially underground areas where light is dim and monsters lurk in the shadows. You will have to memorize enemy movements and behavior to get through certain areas in one piece. Blowouts/emissions will keep you on your toes as well, which are massive releases of radiation that will require you to make your way to shelter as quickly as you can, or die.\n\n-Active modding community: The devs of this game made sure to make the game files accessible from a modding perspective. I'm currently playing through using a mod called "Autumn Aurora" which improves almost all aspects of the game, and ENB, to make the shadows darker and lighting more contrasted. Many other mods exist that enhance the difficulty, add areas, and create entirely new experiences.\n\n-Beautiful visuals: First off, I agree that the game has not aged in the best way, but some aspects of the visuals still look better that some AAA games today, especially the lighting system. Visual mods go a long way in improving the textures, flora and fauna as well. The setting, while bleak and rainy most of the time, will occasionally show off on a sunny day, creating beauty in a dangerous world where death lurks around every corner.\n\n-Fantastic gunplay: SoC is unforgiving at times, but in the majority of cases, it will be due to your own error. To counter this, the game offers great shooting mechanics, including ricochets, bullet trajectory, and penetration. A wide (but not too wide) selection of weaponry allows each gun to have a specific feel and personality, which makes choosing which to pick up and which to drop very important.\n\n-Challenge and difficulty: PLAY ON MASTER. I cannot stress this enough. Difficulty and overcoming it is what makes the STALKER series so great. It makes victory that much more rewarding. Play smart and carefully, and Master difficulty is beatable on a first playthrough.\n\n-Sound: The sound design in SoC is unique and fits the setting like a glove. The beeps of your PDA, the wind rustling in the trees, your geiger counter warning you of nearby radiation, and enemies spewing insults to you in Russian during firefights all add to a wonderful (and terrifying) sense of immersion.\n\nCONS\nStory: The STALKER franchise does not rely on it's narrative to tell the story, which to some, may seem like a terrible mistake. It depends on what you look for in games. I believe that the setting tells it's own story, but you may disagree. I love a good story, but in SoC's case I believe that certain gameplay elements make up for the weak storyline. I should also mention that my game is in Russian, which makes comprehension quite difficult for myself, a native English speaker.\n\nAnimations: Reload and NPC animations can be a bit strange looking at times. It's entirely possible that the game was created without motion capture due to a lack of resources, which can take you out of the experience at some points. Several mods, however, attempt to improve these faults. A very promising mod called "Gunslinger" is being released soon for STALKER: Call of Pripyat, which vastly improves all animations. Worth taking a look.\n\nLinearity: While the game does offer quite a large area in total to explore, it can sometimes feel linear. Radiation pockets and anomalies keep you mostly on the roads or in towns, cutting quite a bit of forest out from exploring. However, the forests in the real Chernobyl are some of the most irradiated in the world, so it does make sense. Take that as you will.\n\nThat's all I can really think of. If you see this game on sale, make sure to grab it while it's cheap. It truly is a wonderful experience overall.\n\n9.5/10\n\nCHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE ♥♥♥♥ BLYAT","June 1, 2015","true","28.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It also is filled with NPC's who hate the player character and tell you to go away and will likely shoot at you if you take too long.\n\nIt's also pretty good. It's post-apocalypse and almost a survival horror game where you have to worry constantly about lurking threats that will most certainly kill you if you are not careful. Also it has a pretty decent story, though one you can easily ignore due to the massive amounts of side-quests there are.\n\nIn short... it's kinda like a Russian Fallout, though set in Ukraine. It's quite similar to Metro 2033 in its atmosphere, though this game is an FPSRPG rather than just a straight shooter like that game is.

If you love the Fallout and Metro series and want both games come together. This will be their love child.\n\nYou will lose yourself in hours and hours of gameplay. I highly recommend reading up on the controls or watching LP's first before getting this as it is in a sense 'hard' i am not going to tell you how 'hard' it is. But trust me when i tell you, it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nLastly there are two highly recommend mods that goes with this game. one is "complete" and the other is "lost alpha" you can play the game, or if you feel nostalgic you can play the game by itself in it's original condition of course. (You can only have ONE mod by the way)\n\nThe only tiny concern is make sure your PC specs are capable of performing well with this game. You might have to run it on 'low' settings to prevent the typical lags, crashes, and freezes within the game.\n\n"Complete" is an overhaul plain and simple. Just bewarn if your PC begins to lag and freeze alot. the easiest solution is to run the game on 'low' graphical settings.\n\n"Lost Alpha" it is a standalone modification based upon the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. It will offer old features seen within the game series, While offering never before scene features within the game that in the modders opinion is a 'must needed'.\n\nI highly recommend this game for the post-apocalyptic gamer.

Its strength mostly comes from the design of the world. You will see abandoned industrial districts, large radioactive wastelands and dark underground complexes with enemies, possibly around each corner. When travelling around the world you will encounter all kinds of characters: Neutral Stalkers, just like you, who are travelling the Zone looking for artifacts and trying to survive, Bandits who ambush you, trying to kill and loot you, or members of many different factions, which can be friendly or hostile, depending on your actions.\nThe world itself is very open and unscripted. Pretty much anything can happen, depending on who or what you will encounter. I want to tell a funny story about that:\nI once took a sidequest which told me to kill a random target (These kind of quests are quite common and sometimes very challenging). Having a look on my map I saw that my target was very far away, so on my way there I did few different things. When I finally reached the sector, I saw a man in the distance being attacked and ripped apart by a horde of mutant dogs. In the second of his death I got the message that my quest was completed and returned for my undeserved reward.\n\nThe technical side of the game still has potential to be much better though, and that is where the mods kick in. Playing this completely vanilla is possible, but it is quite hard and will take some time to get used to it. I am not really one of those hardcoreplayers who are of the opinion that the first playthrough MUST be vanilla. You could go straight to the Stalker Complete Mod, which does a lot of things. It mainly is a graphical enhancement, which makes the already immersive environment look even better. Weapon animations are also a lot smoother and remove a lot of chunkiness of the gunplay. It also tweaks a few things around AI that makes stealth-oriented approaches atleast possible, which in some parts is a great addition.\nSome say this makes the game too easy, but if you really think that after some playtime, I could recommend the Realistic Weapon Addon for the Complete mod to you, which basicly makes guns more lethal to both the enemies and the player. It improves the gunfights a lot and makes killing something quite satisfying, but still keeping it hard enough, because the player is vulnerable aswell.","May 24, 2014","true","122.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The graphics overall are like graphics were just a few years ago, but mods have been made to update the graphics if you wish to change them. Glitches do tend to appear throughout the game, sometimes far between, or all the time from what I have heard, but I usually never see many glitches that destory my gaming experience while I play, because I usually tend to look over bugs. The combat is great, making you have to take cover and shoot from behind unless you want to be shot to pieces by enemies. Story is a-bit linear, but still very in-depth the further you get in the game. Side quests and the like aren't anything spectacular though, I usually never do any unless I need some quick cash.

A World Alive With Potentially Horrifying Situations.Genre: FPS RPG Post-Apocalyptic Horror Open World.\nDeveloped and Published by: GSC Game World\nPlatform: Windows Only.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nPreamble\nThere are games that leave an impression for a lifetime and this is one of them. How else could I forget such a unique title as this? The world you explore and survive in feels alive unlike any other open-world game I've played to date or since. This is a game that has sent me through a whole range of emotions from fear to exultation at having succeeded at survived in the dark depths of the Labs....those labs...*shudder*. Good adventures always end bittersweet. It was constant anxiety with this one. I was never quite certain what was around the next corner. Always wondering if I would run into a pack of mutants ready to rip my face off or other more murderous STALKERs. This will be a spoiler-free review of the game and I'll do my best to cover what I can. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl originally took over seven months for me to complete. Granted, I took a few breaks from the game which is why it took so long. According to Steam, I've logged over 41 hours with the game. Feels like the longest 41 hours of my life. The game made me as jumpy as a rabbit when playing it and some of the things in the game elicit such a fearful response that it made it difficult to play it. Is that silly? Maybe, but that's the fun of it as well. Even so, I still faced my fears down and finished the game. Only to begin jumping right into the sequel afterwards. I am a sucker for punishment.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nShadow of Chernobyl is such a unique game that it's hard to quantify all of what makes it so. When I had played this, I hadn't really been exposed to much of the horror genre and it's still not one of my favorite genres, except for psychological horror. Which I can only think it's because I want to overcome my fears. What better way to do it than in a world full of radiation, mutants and horrifying creatures. SoC is an FPS and RPG hybrid with lots of open world elements. There's a main quest to complete, lots of optional side missions that you're free to tackle and plenty of weapons to choose from. The big selling point for SoC (outside of its post-apocalyptic themes) is the A-Life engine. The A-Life engine allows creatures and NPCs to roam the wasteland with a set of guidelines and rules. They eat, sleep, move around, shoot enemies, talk to friends and generally act like human beings. In combat they avoid hazards, throw grenades and act tactically, sometimes sneaking up on you when you don't realize they're there. It isn't uncommon to see a skirmish between an important NPC and his vanguard against a random bunch of mutated dogs that were at one point on the other side of the field they were in. This world is unscripted which means that sometimes events such as a quest giver being attacked and killed can happen. And then you're completely unable to finish your quest. That's not intended to happen, but A-Life allows for it.\n\nOblivion Lost Mod & The Modding Community\nMy first run through of Shadow of Chernobyl was with the Oblivion Lost mod. You'll want to run this game with at least one mod to fix a lot of the issues the original game has. Due to a rushed development timetable, a lot of content and original ideas had been cut from the game. But, the modding community took it upon themselves to fix up the numerous issues and open the game up to the developer's original vision. One of the more popular mods is Oblivion Lost, which was recommended by Moonshinefox as the most optimal and true experience of SoC. You can find a full list of changes at this link[forums.filefront.com]. Suffice it to say, it makes the game shine. As an overview, the mod adds Emission events which happen at random times. If you're standing outside, they can kill you with a big old dose of radiation. Worse, it causes the anomalies to move around in the world, kills off NPCs that are also outside (potentially screwing up your quest) and also causes an increase in the number of mutated creatures. Yay. Oh and what are anomalies? They are areas where the laws of nature and physics have been corrupted and are dangerous/lethal to passing entities. There are anomalies of fire, electricity and so on. The mod also adds factions that interact/shoot at each other, weapons, random weather, artifact transmutations, better realism, and a lot of other things.\n\nPC Settings & Modding\nSettings are fairly reasonable and include most of what you need. However, some settings don't work such as the AA slider, it doesn't actually do anything and V-sync is completely broken. Fixing these problems will require installing a mod. You can check out the issues and modding solutions on PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com]. As for what settings do work, there's a reasonable selection of resolution options, gamma, contrast and brightness sliders. Advanced video options include vision distance, objects detail, grass density, textures detail, lighting, shadow quality and anisotropic filtering sliders. They don't give you any numbers to understand what you're changing though. Key rebinding and alternative keys are also available in the game. The only audio sliders are SFX and music though the game supports up to 7.0 surround sound.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis isn't a perfect game by any stretch. It has a lot of bugs and quirks that have been tackled by the modding community but it can still lead to some unfortunate situations while you're playing. Including but not limited to: being stuck in a level with no ammo and unable to move forward, wonky combat balance and NPCs behaving erratically. However, I think the Shadow of Chernobyl experience is worth the risk. It's steeped in atmosphere, the game engine makes the world feel truly alive even if it's heavily scripted and the richness of this Russian post-apocalyptic world is utterly unique. Sometimes the best games are the ones that are the messiest. It's a pity that there hasn't been any continuations in this genre but I hold out hope someday, someone will give it a go.\n\nRead the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\nA Paladin's Review: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat","November 25, 2013","true","41.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's the beautiful atmosphere created by the lightning. It's the tension built by running around trying to find that one last bit of radiation protection before you die of radiation poisoning. It's that feeling of satisfaction when you finally manage to fight your way through a group of clever AI enemies, or the stress built by panickingly trying to drink enough energy drink to simply run through them.\n\nOr, more broadly - it's the perfect mixture of challenging difficulty, fantastic atmosphere and great survival mechanics which make it so special.\n\nThe game builds itself on creating tension through its inventory management system and creates such perfect results through it. Funnily enough, early in the game I found it annoying that managing your inventory doesn't pause the game and sometimes I stopped dead in the middle of combat because I was too heavy to move, but by the end I realised that was such an incredible way of building tension. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is, after all, a game of scavenging and half the fun of the game is about deciding whether you can afford to go over to pillage a befallen enemy, work out what you need to take and if it's not too heavy to carry without getting killed.\n\nBut great survival mechanics and a really well balanced difficulty don't make a game on its own and the other main thing which really makes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. stand out is its gameworld. It's such a beautiful, desolate overworld and as much enjoyment as the challenge was just running over the baron plains with dogs howling and boars roaming around with some odd shots in the background. Even, the main homehub of Rostock has this incredibly eerie and desolate feel about it.\n\nThere's just this exquisite balance of challenge and ambience which make this the perfect FPS. Played alone, at night with headphones it is quite the experience.","January 22, 2015","true","16.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I wanted to play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. since it's release after i have read an article on it. Now after 32h of game i have completed the story mode, what can i say? This game is definetly not for every one. It's specific atmosphere is somewhat depressing, well, there should not be any surprise on this as ti is a part of game.\nMy first impression when i started to play was that camera movement is kind of weird, but after a while i got used to it. Next weird thing was shooting mechanism, to desctibe it in one sentence: "I shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the head and then he kiled me".\nI have wrote about atmosphere if the game, but there is more to it. If i would have to choose what genre this game is i would say something between survival horror, sneaking game and FPS. Game is not scary all the time, but there are some locations that can give you a goosebumps, like lab x-16 or x-18, or any other location, where you have to use a flashlight and creepy noises are all around.\nNice thing in game was possibity to pick up gun from your fallen enemies. During gameplay i didn't have to buy any of primary weapon, all of them can be droped by mobs, however some of them are quite rare, like Gaus Gun. I have picked it up on very end of the game in Chernobyl NPP sarkophagus.\nAnother thing that i liked was posibility to sneak on almost every enemy including mutants, sometimes i is quite handy, that you can try to kill a baddie with a single shot (ammo conservation is important cause you don't want to be left with a knife, trust me ;)\nGameplay of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. in  overall was nice, after i got used to it, despite some frustrating moments, of F7, F7, F7, F7 ;). This is another thing that you should remember of: quick save whenever you are sure you are safe. If you forget to save, you can lost your progress very easily as on every stage of game almost every enemy can kill you fast.\n\nFor me this is a nice game and i don't feel disappointed, now it is time for second part :)\nI would recommend this game to everybody who is not affraid of exploring radiated teritorries of Chernobyl outskirts and want to have their whish granted :)\n\nTIP: In game you have to run a long distances, at the beginning use energy drinks, later equip yourself with artifact Flash x2 or Moonlight x2 or combination of those two. They will give you infinite stamina when you are not too loaded and if you walk because you run out, your stamina will regenerate.","May 14","true","53.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Cringeworthy AI/Combat bullet dmg however.\n\n(The amazing atmosphere, guns, sounds, mutants, visuals of this game outweight the poor AI cons a million to one)\n\nI am not mad or angry writing this review. I am perfectly calm. Not butthurt. I love that stalker exists and technically speaking is one of the most impressive fps game engines i've ever experienced. I am still enjoying the game right now actually. I know this will hurt your feelings bringing up some negatives but its what i observe from playing the game again in 2016\n\n1.Terrible AI. Sadly this is true.\n\n-Sometimes enemies will tactically walk into the room.. backwards??\n\n-you can walk up to a bandit camp with a non-silenced rifle, shoot one of the three patrol guards in the head.. watch him drop.. then just watch his friends walk around his dead body like nothing happened.\n\n-You shoot a guard, watch him flinch, see the blood spatter, and he will just continue patrolling without becoming alarmed or doing anything differently\n\n-Enemies do not respond to sounds or flashlights, they just automatically face you when you come within 15ft of them (regardless if you are sneaking or not)\n\nOnce you get a little way into the game, It takes about 1-2 headshot to kill, or... 30-70 body shots. I wish i was being sarcastic. How could a game with so much realism ingrained into the atmosphere possibly have such an insultingly unrealistic bullet damage system? It takes smart people to make such a realistic engaging atmosphere like this. So i am surprised that they all collectively agreed on this arcade-like bullet damage system. I just wish it was more realistic (3-5 body shots for medium armor enemies, 7 body shots for heavy armor enemies)\n\n**UPDATE** The above statement needs to be re-visited, yes it does take a lot of shots to kill an enemy.. But after playing for many more hours i have determined that this game is set up more like an RPG than a traditional FPS. It makes sense because the developers want you to come across better geared enemies as you go deeper through the game. Although it does feel silly having to shoot an enemy with 70 body shots at times.\n\nSo...Continuing with the horrors of AI. They rarely respond to gunshot sounds, if they do its completely incorrect and they walk to the wrong location\n\nIf you see an enemy in a window and fire at him, you would expect him to look out the window and return fire.. But no. The AI just gets confused, walks around in that room for a bit then crouches and aims at a wall until you walk upstairs and kill him as he stares at the wall.\n\nIf you are behind a big 6 inch steel wall or something, enemies will just shoot at the wall till the end of time\n\nThe game does have a lot of positive things too however, the graphics are top notch, the sounds are FLAWLESS, the controls and user interface is very fitting for the atmosphere..","May 18","true","57.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Came back to the same camp and the guy was dead.\nCame back to the same camp later on and two more guys were there, left. came back for the fourth time, one of them were dead. No enemies for miles. Pripyat/10\n\nThis game isnt like fallout where it tells you what you need and where you need to get it. You need to read up on some of the mechanics and make sure whatever you have on you is enough to get you through the next zone, or you'll land flat on your ♥♥♥ and find yourself loading a quicksave... again. The AI is abnormally stupid and will often hit you flawlessly whereas you could use the same exact gun and youd be lucky to hit the broad side of a barn. The enemies are repetitive and seems like you're just in a mod for half life with a rusty reskin. The atmosphere is amazing though. There are many times where the task would be to go underground and I'd be frustrated because of the closed spaces and Snorks (sp00ky mutants with gas masks) could be waiting for you to..... spin around in endless circles. The AI is unbalanced aswell. During a side quest where you can help a faction called the Duty, where you have to raid a military and I ended up taking on the base by myself and not even getting the reward for the task because my commanding officer was dead.\n\nPros:\n-Atmosphere\n-Vodka\n-Sausage\n-Guns\n-Story????\n\nCons:\n-Unbalanced AI\n-No quick radiation button\n-Inaccurate guns\n-No fast travel\n-Repetitive enemies\n-Wonky AI (Will often run in circles)\n\nOverall:\nвосемь из десяти (8/10)\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is blatantly broken in some aspects, pop ins, OP enemies. But this game can do one thing that Fallout couldnt do in a post apocalyptic franchise, Scare me. Make me feel the cold in Russia. I personally couldnt finish this game due to not having the right armor but i was literally 5 feet away from the ending cutscene so watching the ending on YT was good enough.

I enjoyed this game more and more as I played; loved it by the end. Fantastic atmosphere.\n\nThe game is very grim and challenging. It plays mostly like an RPG, because you're taking on missions and learning a story as you go. But there are no levels, no experience points, and no skill tree, so in that regard it's somewhat like an FPS. It's also scary, and resources are scarce, so it bears elements of the survival horror genre, too.\n\nThe ending is satisfying. Unlike many RPGs that cop out with a boss battle, STALKER gives you answers and a conclusion that makes sense.\n\nA few tips if you play. 1) Find and use the "STALKER Complete" mod. It improves the graphics and the English translation, and fixes bugs. 2) It's OK to play on Novice -- you'll die plenty on any setting. 3) Use a game guide. It will help you with the weapons, and keep your story on track. I liked IGN's guide.\n","August 29, 2011","true","31.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

A lot of it. And thus, STALKER was born.\n\nSTALKER is an amazing series, with three games in the series, I have several days on this game, but Steam doesn't show it because I was offline while I played it. (Since I had no internet access at the time.)\n\nWith a huge map to explore, plenty of monsters to face, a large assortment of weapons, armor, and missions to do, this makes for a fun time.\n\nSTALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is an open world FPS game. Taking place in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Did you read that?!  THE FREAKIN' Chernobyl Exclusion Zone!  I even bolded it, just to show how awesome that is. The game is not creepy in a sense, but if you are prone to being frightened easily, a few areas of the game may give you a slight scare.\n\nPros:\nBro, this game takes place in Chernobyl, that's awesome in itself!\nA huge map to explore.\nPlenty of missions to do.\nI large assortment of weapons and armor.\nTreasure hunting!\nImmense variety of enemies.\nDifferent atmospheres and moods of tone.\nA few scary and eerie places in the map.\nA nice story. (Could use improvement.)\nChallenging gameplay.\nGood graphics.\nModdable.\n\nBut, of course, like all games, STALKER has some downsides we can't dismiss:\n\nThe game is highly buggy and glitchy. I had a big problem getting the game to work, and I still don't have it working fully.\n\nLONG LOAD TIMES:  The load times are atrocious, and without doing some tweaking work, it will typically last from 10-15 minutes. Although settings can be changed, and mods can be installed to help this issue, it's still a problem. While the game loads, go take a shower, clean the house, or mow the lawn, it needs to be done anyways.\n\nIf you don't mind bugs and glitches, sit down, grab yourself some Cossack's Vodka, put on your Russian hat,  bring a bear into your house  buckle up, and enjoy the awesome ride this game has to offer!\n\nPS: Don't actually bring a bear into your house.","March 8, 2014","true","13.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","3"

This game has weapon decay, and if one random npc manages to get a headshot on you then its all over! The world has been crafted really nicely, the atmosphere gives you the feeling that even though people are struggling to survive their's still hope IF your willing to put your life on the line. Only thing I disliked was the sheer amount of enemies that would be in nearly every single firefight, I mean seriously! You expect me to liberate an entire base by taking out nearly thirty something enemies? Now that might be an easy thing to do in CoD or games similar to that, but this is way more hardcore and death can come as easily as you sprinting around a corner only to be one shotted by a dude toting around a shot gun. ^__^","January 6, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, specifically, Shadow of Chernobyl, is iconic for it's atmosphere so thick it drips out of your screen. The distant sounds of assault rifle fire as you clutch your rusty Kalishnikov to your chest are always terrifying. Is it bandits? Is it a local militia trying to fight off some horrible mutant? You'll always feel vulnerable in the wide, gray fields that make up much of S.T.A.L.K.E.R's landscapes. But don't think running for cover inside will make you safer.. Buildings can be home to traps set by enemies, a bandit camp, or a vicious Bloodsucker's lair.\n\nThe game mechanics are solid, if abit stiff. You'll never feel cheated if you die; This game is much alike Dark Souls in that regard. However, if you play on any difficulty above Stalker, expect frequent deaths; I reccomend Master, but that's just me. Fortunately, the game features a fairly primitive, if not effective quicksave/load system.\n\nMany weapons feel powerful and give feedback; The thunder as you unload a clip from the shiny gun you found on a corpse will always light up the darkness and make you feel alittle less vunerable. Don't take it as a sign of invincibility - Often, you'll be found a few bullets short, gun empty and useless as something with razor-sharp teeth and claws advances on you. However, unless you play a stealthy character, often your knife will be next to useless in combat; As will many of the game's sidearms, unless your primary's run dry.\n\nThe game also features enemies of the variety of the environment; Anamolies.\nThey're results of the radiation that envelopes the zone, and they're very dangerous; being anything from Static electricty that'll light you up like a christmas tree, to a minature vortex that pulls skin from the bone. All are usually dangerous, but the name of the game in S.T.A.L.K.E.R are the results of Anamolies; Artifacts. They're mysterious objects that grant mystical properties on the human body, from massively increased healing to bullet resistance.\n\nOf course, the game isn't flawless. There's many glitches in A.I., but you can't fault a game made in 2007 from a third party company for having some weaknesses. The number one problem with the game is it's voice acting and it's graphics - Even for the time it was released, it wasn't a pretty game. The voice acting is generally pretty atrocious, when it's there - Two of the more famous memes from the game result from this; (Come eehn! Doan juss stah ther!) (GEET OUYT OFF HEER STALKHERR), but overall, that's not the game's strength.\n\nOut of the three games, Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat; I would hesitate in calling this one the best. The other two have far stronger mechanical changes, as well as generally improved voiceacting and graphics.. However, Shadow of Chernobyl will always be the strongest in terms of the feel it gives you. You feel helpless, weak, and scared. Your life is valuable, and the zone can snatch it in an instant. The game doesn't baby you, nor does it hold back. You will die, and you'll love every second if you're a junkie for the things I've mentioned.\n\n\n\nIF TL:DR, LOOK HERE.\n\n\n\nOverall..[Starting score of 5 - An average game.]\n\n-PROS-\nFantastic, immersive atmosphere (+2.5)\nA unique story and universe (+1.5)\nA powerful way to improve your character via artifacts (+1)\nSolid, if stiff mechanics (+1)\n\n-CONS-\nGlitchy, sometimes outright broken A.I. (-1)\nHorrendous Voice Acting (-1)\nOften uninventive areas (-1)\n\n-TOTAL-\n-8.0-\nA powerful but sometimes unintuitive experience. It'll be memorable for it's unique combat, lore, and mechanics, but occasionally the things that bring down the experience really bring it down. Several times does it show off it's impressive concept of an apocalyptic world, but once or twice it falls short. If you're a fan of a deep, immersive game that'll take you a week or more to complete simply from just how difficult it can be, then this game's your one-trick pony. If not, you might be able to get some enjoyment from the pure russian that this game is. If not, then it likely isn't your sort of game.\n\n\n\n","August 18, 2014","true","18.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

No, life IS tough. Anomolies waiting to tear you apart, radiation sitting everywhere, freaks of the zone gaining territory by ripping apart anyone in their vicinity, factions battling for control, bandits causing chaos, and the military attempting to put a stop to everything permenantly. The zone is a painful, unforgiving place, in which one mistake could lead you to your end. Welcome to S.T.A.L.K.E.R..\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the three games from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. In S.T.A.L.K.E.R., you are a man living inside of the zone. Following the explosion of the chernobyl reactor, the radiation and other unkown forces created the zone. Anomolies, mutants, radiation, and other hazards litter the zone. The anomolies within the zone have the power to create artificats, objects defying physics and producing astronomical results. Catching the worlds attention, these artificats quickly became sought after, with people like you heading into the zone to retrieve them. Normal men, looters, murderers, bandits, rapists, all types of men flocked over to the zone to become rich. These men would eventually be known as stalkers. In this game, you are one of these men, trying to uncover the mystery of the zone while also trying to uncover your memory and how an assasination order came into your hands.\n\nSo how's the gameplay? Extremely brutal. The game doesn't explain anything, it doesn't hold your hand, there is no guidance towards what you do. Things are out to get you, bandits wanting your stuff, military wanting to put a bullet between your eyes with a sniper. There is nothing safe in the zone. You become genuinly scared of the zone, and when the first night hits, you simply want to put yourself in some attic and wait out the night so the things making noises could go away.\n\nActual gameplay wise, it's a standard FPS with some RPG elements. Lots of focus has been put into the guns, the enviroment, and making it feel like a real shooter in a lawless land. This is not Doom styled gameplay of megasprinting everywhere, this is serious tactical gameplay of where you plan everything ahead, shoot good and shoot fast. Utilize the lean mechanics and the enviroment to stay alive the best you can. The weight limit is low and unforgiving, bleeding and radiation constantly nag at your health, and if you step into an anomoly you can consider yourself dead. Supplies are extremely scarce, and the game loves teasing you with it. One time I set out to scale a destroyed building, a task which proved to be immensly difficult. Upon finally scaling it, I found a single supply crate tucked away, which upon breaking, was empty. That's when the bandits begun their ambush from ground level.\n\nThis is the game if you want a serious, tactical shooter set in one of the most scariest enviroments I have ever played. This isn't a horror game, but it sure as hell felt like one later on in the game. This is Fallout for men. A serious dose of Russian, Vodka, AK-47s, bandits, and mutants.\n\nOne last thing. The base game itself while somewhat buggy, do not mod it until you finish the first run so you understand what is being changed. If you do set out to mod it for your first run, only try and get the bug fixing mods like the Zone Reclamation Project. There are tons of other graphical and gameplay mods you can choose from once you get to that point. And play on the highest difficulty(Master). In lower difficulties, a horrible system exists, of where a chunk of your bullets and the enemies bullets simply doesn't exist. You fire it, and even though the shot would hit, nothing would happen, and same with the enemy. On Master, such a thing does not exist.\n\nGood hunting stalker.","August 26, 2014","true","29.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

While post-apocalyptic reminds many of us of Fallout 3, Stalker's surroundings are different and instead of the barren lands full of debris you have to imagine a nuclear wasteland.\n\nThis wasteland is called the Zone and interestingly, the game follows the catastrophe of Chernobyl by adding a twist to the story: here the activities in the power plant did not stop after the incident, in fact, quite the opposite happened which was eventually followed by another explosion. Now, this huge radioactive area is fully of anomalies and mutants and of course stalkers, mercenaries who are obsessed with all this and aim to find all kinds of artifacts that are the results of the catastrophe.\n\nWhile the game was released back in 2007 it should be noted that a mod called COMPLETE is available to enhance everything in the game: it ups the visuals, lowers the amount of bugs and glitches and even adds new features to make the gameplay easier and more exciting.\n\nThe game offers a free-roaming system: missions can be triggered after speaking with various individuals, other than that you are free to go wherever you want and whenever you want. There are many side missions, too, that lengthen an already long story and as the game offers at least half a dozen endings in the form of rendered cutscenes you have a high replayability value here.\n\nOne of the downsides for me was that I was not exactly notified that once I start a particular mission there will be no return. With the COMPLETE mod this is now corrected as after completing the story the game puts you back in the Zone and you are free to complete any pending missions you had. Another thing was the difficulty - I have played a lot of FPS games and these I usually complete on hard difficulty settings, too, so I consider myself a veteran but even Stalker was too difficult at times. I believe it is an AI issue as enemies can easily give you headshots from a far distance and there's no room for suprises attacks, either. They are just too good so quick-saving is recommended frequently.\n\nStalker is a classic. It may not be a beautiful game but its gameplay is certainly entertaining and unique. With the COMPLETE mod in place it is an even better experience.","March 21, 2014","true","23.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, unless you play a stealthy character, often your knife will be next to useless in combat; As will many of the game's sidearms, unless your primary's run dry.\n\nThe game also features enemies of the variety of the environment; Anamolies.\nThey're results of the radiation that envelopes the zone, and they're very dangerous; being anything from Static electricty that'll light you up like a christmas tree, to a minature vortex that pulls skin from the bone. All are usually dangerous, but the name of the game in S.T.A.L.K.E.R are the results of Anamolies; Artifacts. They're mysterious objects that grant mystical properties on the human body, from massively increased healing to bullet resistance.\n\nOf course, the game isn't flawless. There's many glitches in A.I., but you can't fault a game made in 2007 from a third party company for having some weaknesses. The number one problem with the game is it's voice acting and it's graphics - Even for the time it was released, it wasn't a pretty game. The voice acting is generally pretty atrocious, when it's there - Two of the more famous memes from the game result from this; (Come eehn! Doan juss stah ther!) (GEET OUYT OFF HEER STALKHERR), but overall, that's not the game's strength.\n\nOut of the three games, Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat; I would hesitate in calling this one the best. The other two have far stronger mechanical changes, as well as generally improved voiceacting and graphics.. However, Shadow of Chernobyl will always be the strongest in terms of the feel it gives you. You feel helpless, weak, and scared. Your life is valuable, and the zone can snatch it in an instant. The game doesn't baby you, nor does it hold back. You will die, and you'll love every second if you're a junkie for the things I've mentioned.\n\n\n\nIF TL:DR, LOOK HERE.\n\n\n\nOverall..[Starting score of 5 - An average game.]\n\n-PROS-\nFantastic, immersive atmosphere (+2.5)\nA unique story and universe (+1.5)\nA powerful way to improve your character via artifacts (+1)\nSolid, if stiff mechanics (+1)\n\n-CONS-\nGlitchy, sometimes outright broken A.I. (-1)\nHorrendous Voice Acting (-1)\nOften uninventive areas (-1)\n\n-TOTAL-\n-8.0-\nA powerful but sometimes unintuitive experience. It'll be memorable for it's unique combat, lore, and mechanics, but occasionally the things that bring down the experience really bring it down. Several times does it show off it's impressive concept of an apocalyptic world, but once or twice it falls short. If you're a fan of a deep, immersive game that'll take you a week or more to complete simply from just how difficult it can be, then this game's your one-trick pony. If not, you might be able to get some enjoyment from the pure russian that this game is. If not, then it likely isn't your sort of game.\n\n\n\n","August 18, 2014","true","18.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegooey/recommended/4500/","thegooey","Doomgooey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegooey/","92 products in account","Living in the Zone, life can be tough. No, life IS tough. Anomolies waiting to tear you apart, radiation sitting everywhere, freaks of the zone gaining territory by ripping apart anyone in their vicinity, factions battling for control, bandits causing chaos, and the military attempting to put a stop to everything permenantly. The zone is a painful, unforgiving place, in which one mistake could lead you to your end. Welcome to S.T.A.L.K.E.R..\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is one of the three games from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. In S.T.A.L.K.E.R., you are a man living inside of the zone. Following the explosion of the chernobyl reactor, the radiation and other unkown forces created the zone. Anomolies, mutants, radiation, and other hazards litter the zone. The anomolies within the zone have the power to create artificats, objects defying physics and producing astronomical results. Catching the worlds attention, these artificats quickly became sought after, with people like you heading into the zone to retrieve them. Normal men, looters, murderers, bandits, rapists, all types of men flocked over to the zone to become rich. These men would eventually be known as stalkers. In this game, you are one of these men, trying to uncover the mystery of the zone while also trying to uncover your memory and how an assasination order came into your hands.\n\nSo how's the gameplay? Extremely brutal. The game doesn't explain anything, it doesn't hold your hand, there is no guidance towards what you do. Things are out to get you, bandits wanting your stuff, military wanting to put a bullet between your eyes with a sniper. There is nothing safe in the zone. You become genuinly scared of the zone, and when the first night hits, you simply want to put yourself in some attic and wait out the night so the things making noises could go away.\n\nActual gameplay wise, it's a standard FPS with some RPG elements. Lots of focus has been put into the guns, the enviroment, and making it feel like a real shooter in a lawless land. This is not Doom styled gameplay of megasprinting everywhere, this is serious tactical gameplay of where you plan everything ahead, shoot good and shoot fast. Utilize the lean mechanics and the enviroment to stay alive the best you can. The weight limit is low and unforgiving, bleeding and radiation constantly nag at your health, and if you step into an anomoly you can consider yourself dead. Supplies are extremely scarce, and the game loves teasing you with it. One time I set out to scale a destroyed building, a task which proved to be immensly difficult. Upon finally scaling it, I found a single supply crate tucked away, which upon breaking, was empty. That's when the bandits begun their ambush from ground level.\n\nThis is the game if you want a serious, tactical shooter set in one of the most scariest enviroments I have ever played. This isn't a horror game, but it sure as hell felt like one later on in the game. This is Fallout for men. A serious dose of Russian, Vodka, AK-47s, bandits, and mutants.\n\nOne last thing. The base game itself while somewhat buggy, do not mod it until you finish the first run so you understand what is being changed. If you do set out to mod it for your first run, only try and get the bug fixing mods like the Zone Reclamation Project. There are tons of other graphical and gameplay mods you can choose from once you get to that point. And play on the highest difficulty(Master). In lower difficulties, a horrible system exists, of where a chunk of your bullets and the enemies bullets simply doesn't exist. You fire it, and even though the shot would hit, nothing would happen, and same with the enemy. On Master, such a thing does not exist.\n\nGood hunting stalker.","August 26, 2014","true","29.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

STALKER is a bleak, nightmareish vision brought to life even more so with the huge collection of community made mods available.\n\nThis was the first game in the trilogy of games the other two being Call of Pripyat and Clear Sky (a prequal). Both of which are also incredible, CoP more so.\n\nWhen you leave the Cordon for the first time after speaking to Wolf, walking up that path towards the road, turning and seeing your brothers slowly disappear into the distance, hearing the wind howl around the barrel of your creaky old shotgun, suddenly hearing some sort of demonic cry far away to the east and a chill creeps down your back. The sun is low in the musty sky - but just up ahead there is an old abandoned mill to explore, just make use of the fading light.\n\nFor me this game creates an atmosphere I've never felt before (or since, other STALKER titles not including) of a world gone to hell - the Zone, a huge area of land around the defunct Chernobyl reactor, now infested with nightmareish creatures deformed by radiation, different collections of (human) mostly factions wanting to kill you on sight and rob your last tin of tuna. Secret underground labs where horrific experiments happened before everything went to hell. Deserted farm buildings where blood hungry things lurk in the dark. STALKER is all about tension and fear, but also survival.\n\nThere are mods you can get that improve just about every aspect of the original game, textures, weapons, music, audio, bugs ironed out, even previously unnavailble areas.\n\nI love STALKER, it's tremendously satisfying to survive in the Zone, it's terrifying, compelling and full of detail (if you also read all of lore/diary entries that Marked One enters into your PDA throughout the game.\n\nFor anybody that likes FPS/open world survival shooters with strong RPG elements, for anybody that loves to become really immersed in their chosen universe, there is nothing quite like STALKER.\n\nJust don't forget your anti rads, and take care of Nimble - he's worth it.","April 29, 2015","true","14.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/recommended/4500/","Pakkidis","Pakkidis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/","1250 products in account","Rating 8.5/10\nOverview: First Person Shooter\n\nNote: I used the complete mod 2012 to play the game.\n\nThe Good:\n\n+ The atmosphere is probably the main standout for the game. The setting, locations and realistic art style really showcase the destruction of the Chernobyl incident.  The developers really nailed being in a destroyed post apocalyptic  nuclear death zone. Buildings are crumbling and dilapidated, broken vehicles litter the roads, small settlements of makeshift homes and building house some of the other inhabitants on the 'zone'. Every aspect of the game facilitates you feeling like you need to survive. The game has a lot of contrast between the outdoor and indoor environment. When your outside with the sun shining, things don't look all that bad despite being surround by destroyed buildings and vehicles. Indoors is a different matter, things are dark, gloomy and taking your time is advised unless you want a quick death. No matter where you are, it's hard not to soak in the atmosphere this game has to offer.\n\n+ The lighting effects are incredible. The lighting effects really shine when your indoors fighting enemies with flashlights and you see all the shadows being cast from every object in the room. The fact that this is an almost decade old game with a mod makes this graphical feature even more incredible.\n\n+ Level design really standouts and just adds to the overall game play. The game has an over world split into different sections. Each section isn't too big and can easily be traversed from end to end in a short amount of time. Each section is designed differently depending on how far you are from the main city. Most areas consist of buildings and landscapes where more of the gun battles take place.\n\n+ The game features some of the most impressive AI I have seen since FEAR. Enemies will flank you if you don't pay attention, work together and carefully use the environment around them to get the upper hand.\n\n+ Gun battles are fun, challenging and require some thought. Charging head first into a gun fight will result in a quick death. Combine this with the impressive level design and AI and you get some truly amazing gun fights in this game.\n\n+ Game play consists of killing enemies as you traverse 'the zone', scavenging dead bodies and loot to find weapons, armor, ammo, health etc. Survival is a main underlying component with the game. Weapons and armor degrade over time making them less effective and need to be fixed or replaced, radiation levels have to be checked, getting shot or attacked by mutant animals require you to use bandages to stop bleeding, eating is required every so often and you also need to watch your weight limit. Carry too much and your stamina runs out very quickly forcing you to stop or walk until you regain it back.\n\n+ The game has an interesting story albeit starts off very cliché. You start with amnesia with a quest to kill someone on your PDA. The story unfolds slowly after that. The game has different endings depending on whether you completed certain missions or not which is also nice\n\n+ The game has items called artifacts that when equipped grant you certain benefits in one stat but lowers other stats. You can equip up to five and which ones you equip depends largely on your play style. It provides a nice light rpg element to the game.\n\n+ Strong mod community\n\n+ Sound effects\n\nThe Average:\n\nDifficulty is fairly balanced for most of the game but becomes problematic in the later sections of the game where enemies can one shot kill you leading to some very frustrating moments. Quick save/load become your best friend in moments like these.\n\nLoad times in-between sections can be annoying and sometimes long\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- This game has some of the worst stuttering I have ever seen. At first I thought my computer couldn't handle it until I read many other people were having the exact same problem.\n\n- The game has generic side quests. I.e. go to a location and kill enemies or find an item. The side quests are not engaging nor are they fun and they add very little to the story. The second problem is that there is little incentive to complete any of these quests in the first place. The majority of the rewards are not great and you can easily get most of the money/items from fallen enemies and loot stashes.\n\n- No fast travel exists in the vanilla version of the game making side quests even more tedious which may frustrate players. The mod I was using added a fast travel option.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI've heard nothing but great things about this game so I'm finally glad I was able to play it. Technically it is rough around the edges but the good more than make up for it. Highly Recommended\n","April 30, 2015","true","14.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was in a class of its own for graphics, and aledged gameplay.\n\nI managed to get a CD copy on release, and loved it....Glitches and crashes were common, but somehow seemed normal.  Years later this game has been patched up.  Modifications small and large have been on the scene for years.  This game is totally stable as of 2016, and still totally wonderful.\n\nThis is one of the best FPS titles I have ever played.  The story is unique, and draws players in.....  The atmosphere of the game is so real, that at times it is best to walk away for a bit and make sure you are not part of it.\n\nEasily a classic in my book.  I Have bought this game at least a half a dozen times on steam.  For myself, for my family and friends.  It is worth it.\n\nYears later, I have somehow lost the physical copy....But my pc has not had a CD drive in years....It may very well have been in the drive when it was removed, and unresponsive.  Hopefully someone at the recycling center found that cd and enjoyed it as much as I did.\n\nBuy this game.  It is a FPS survival horror that sets the bar higher than most ever expected it would.  It has some "RPG" elements that add to the experience.\n\n\nOf the STALKER series, this one is (my opinion) the best.  It has the most depth, and challenges you to balance all parts of your quest throughout an irradiated wasteland.  I find that no matter how often I return to this game, I always feel that I am simply not equipped well enough to survive.  This is normal I think.  It only adds to the fear of the unknown.","February 11","true","265.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Contem três finais, bem diferentes e muito bons.\nA ambientação, atmosfera e trilha sonora são sensacionais.\nThe Zone é um lugar que você precisa conhecer e explorar.\nAs side quests são fracas e repetitivas, e o trading é ridiculo.\nAs facções diferentes praticamente não fazem diferença no jogo.\nO gunplay é um pouco esquisito e alguns inimigos são simplesmente bullet sponges.\n\nSe for jogar pela primeira vez, não use MODs como Complete, Lost Alpha, Autumn Aurora pois eles alteram demais o jogo. Jogue o mais vanilla possivel, com pequenos MODs que só consertam bugs e melhoram a atmosfera como ZRP, Absolute Nature, AtmosFear, etc.\n\nDou nota 8/10, recomendo, e com certeza está na minha lista Top 10.\n\nE 'get out of here, Stalker'!","May 24, 2015","true","75.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In fact, despite its bugs, unfinished and missing content, janky world etc. has managed to find a spot in my top 10 most beloved games of all time.  Not only that, it is the one game that has sold me on the concept of a survival game.  The Zone is a trecherous, scary place that is caked in so much atmopshere that it's hard not to feel as though every step you take is one step closer to your own untimely demise, and nothing is as satisfying as making it out of a rough encounter without bleeding to death or barely escaping an irradiated area after you realized you didn't pack enough anti-rads.  You are NEVER safe in this game.  Ever.  Admittedly Shadow of Chernobyl is the most linear of the three STALKER games, but honestly each one is cheap enough that you should just get all 3.  If you want a more open world, then play Clear Sky or even better Call of Pripyat.  But Shadow fo Chernobyl is still a gripping experience and a great starting point for this wonderful, creepy world - and there are lots of mods out there worth checking out, as well as the excellent standalone game STALKER: Lost Alpha which seeks to recreate STALKER based on its original design document and the many features that were cut during its lengthy 6 year development time.  Definitely check this one out.","February 20, 2015","true","29.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is amazing. It is about the Nuclear disaster that occured at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The signle player is just Great. It's mission after mission after mission and with the 7 total endigs that are within the game you will never get bored of completing it over and over again. One other thing that amazes me is that the game looks very realistic the only thing that makes it unperfect at this point is the mutants. The other good thing about the story mode is all the NPC's that you eventually get to meet and this features different methods of Communication because you basically just get recommended to every NPC within the zone to work for them. There are also different groups where you have an option to choose from where to join. There are also a lot of different gun types and accessories you can aquire throughout the paythrough.","January 27, 2014","true","31.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

(no this is not a fallout wannabe, even though at first glance it seems to be)\nThis game it not perfect, nor that beautiful, and there are bugs and errors.\nBut why am I then recommending this game? 'cause nothing is perfect, young padawan.\nThe quality of the game gets highly increased if you mod the game, I did only play with weight mods, so I can bear a ton XD but there are lots of other quite interesting mods out there.\n\nLets firstly take the "killers" of this game.- The game can crash a lot for some people, for me it was a very few times, there can be weird errors here and there but nothing that can't be fixed either with a reload, restart or just by ignoring it.\n- It is an old game, it is from 2007, so the grafic is only okay, not ugly but not pretty, and it is a russian game, I am not against russians gamedevelopers, they have created truly unique games like the stalker franchies, the hard truck apocalypse franchies and lots more. But it is wellknown that there can be a lot of bugs, luckily this one only has a few.\n- Better agrosystem. You can, if you snipe friendly target, kill them and if killed by one shot, you will therefore not be attracting agro to you, therefore you can kill all of your allies and loot them if you want to and still be ally with their fraction.\n- without any doubt there is missing a little bit of more detailed landscaping, more weapons, maybe a little more work on the plot and other small things. (not that the game is missing a lot on these things)\n\nThen there is the sunshines of this game- If you like a game which you can set to a hard difficulty, then this game is for you. You cannot be rambo in this game, not on higher difficulty, and if you choose to remove your sight of your weapon, then it gets a hell lot more fun(this game prepared me for killing floor to shoot without a weaponsight)\n- The atmosphere.... uuuhhh that is the one reason I really love this franchies, it has really caught this dark, lonely, chaotic and sometimes horrifying post apocalyptic atmosphere. It is not a game which "romantice" the post apocalyptic setting which many other post apocalyptic games do(not that it is bad, but it is great to get this realistic, "autentic" post apocalyptic atmosphere"\n- interesting monsters, they have been quite creative with some of their monsters, especially some of the rare ones did frighten the ♥♥♥♥ out of me when I encountered them for the first time, especially the one which could affect your mind.\n- multiply endings! I didn't know this before I read about it, but this game has different endings! Of course now many games now at days, even FPS games, have different endings, but for me it is really a plus especially when this is an old game :)\n- Interesting univers/world/setting, lore and plot. Even though the plot wasn't the best in the world, there was still enough of mystery to this setting, that you wanted to explore more.\n- I love the real russian feel of the setting, because you really felt that you are in chernobyl because  the dialouge is in english with a heavy lovely Russian accent, then the NPCs talked russian to one another while you are walking by. But I have to say, I am a big sucker for the Russian language. :P so that is why I have this as a pro\n\nSo yeah is this game better than fallout? No, especially not this one which is the first one in this franchies, go look for the newer installments, they are a lot better than this one. But if you have been playing through all fallout games and still crave for a postapocalyptic world, then this series brings another perspective and alternative setting(because it is not the whole world, only the closed world of chernobyl which are the setting)\nAnd yeah it is recommended to mod it(just like fallout) :)","January 16","true","47.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","3"

Fantastic night sight and weather system.(Probably have some thing to do with the STALKER COMPLETE 2009 MOD)\nWhen the sun sets.It'be better if you crawled into your sleeping bag and actually sleep like in real life.If you dare to venture out at night you will find it hard to survive as you will either:A.Turn on the flash light and become a easy target and die quickly.B Turn off the flash and you can's see ♥♥♥♥!And also he weather system will change your sensibility and the sensibility of your enemies.During a rainy night the sounds will cover your footsteps for a sneak-in slit throat and you may be able to detect your enemy via the moonlight on a clear night.\n3.Atmosphere and sound effects are captivating.You can sometimes here the howl of a monster or some distant gunshots in a vast plain,as where as strange the cry of babies when you ventured in some underground tunnels.They really creates a horrifying atmosphere as if you are really in a apocalypse.And when you finally make it to a camp and take a deep breath,you will find it extremely comforting to see one of the fellow stalkers take out a guitar and slowly plays some gentle Russian folk tunes.\nCons:\n1.Just like fallout ,the survival element aren't emphasized enough.The game time elapse the same speed in real world so you won't get hungry normally in one gameplay experience (say 2hours).You can manually speed up the time though and you will find soon enough when it gets dark and you can't see anything and regret changing that!(Sight at night is a pro BTW).\n2.Weapons feels really strange to handle.It feels like neither the normal FPS type(COD,Metro,Farcry,etc) nor the shooting simulator type(ARMA,Red Orchestra,etc).It just feels so strange,can't really tell what's wrong.\n3.No quick-save option.Even if you can do it via the COMPLETE MOD,you will generate a save file every time you quick save and I JUST DELETE 1GB of saves after about 5 hours of gameplay. And there's no quick travel mechanics as well.(The Mod add a teleport option and that literally means TELEPORT(1000 miles in 0 seconds and you can teleport to somewhere you haven't even been to)\nTo conclude,as a fallout and survival game fan I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME.\n","December 14, 2014","true","20.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pringlex/recommended/4500/","pringlex","Preenglecks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pringlex/","168 products in account","Where do I start with this game? I've played through it twice and am currently on my third play through after beating the trilogy a few years ago. I downloaded the STALKER Complete 2009 mod which I hoped would refresh the game without introducing stupid gameplay imbalances. I was right. It's still one of the greatest and most demanding open-world first person role playing games out there. And I think I would be justified in saying that it on its own rivals the AAA competitors like Fallout 3 or New Vegas. It's just that good.\n\nIt plays really nicely, and because it's such an old game it runs smoothly with high anti-aliasing and high frame rates. As a core game you are sort of thrown into the combat with little preparation, but it doesn't take an experienced shooter-player to realize that you need to duck and cover. Leaning is super important, and enemies like to shoot when you move forcing you to play patiently and not go commando. That being said, once you get the formula down, you just sit and pop enemies when they poke their heads out. Pretty standard. The real challenge is fighting monsters which will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you and really put your twitch-shooter skills to the test. Interacting with friendlies and setting out on quests is easy enough, but oftentimes the quests will end in ways you don't expect due to the uncertain nature of everything occurring in the game-world. You plan an ambush with some buddies and only you made it out? That's your fault but you gotta move on.\n\nThe Complete 2009 mod really polishes off the game nicely. Textures are still pretty sharp, and the world is brimming with anomalies and enemies. You really notice the subtle touches like rain pouring outside and forcing friendlies to huddle inside next to barrel stoves. The sound is good but definitely dated. I really like having to use directional sound to orient myself and in a game like this that feature really stands out. The day-night cycles are intense and I found myself sleeping through the nights so as to have a daylight advantage in combat.\n\nThe story is super intriguing and really enhanced by the dark and radioactive atmosphere. Everything could be dangerous and you gotta be on your game if you want to make it out alive. What's awesome is that you can play this game multiple times and get fairly different experiences in terms of the narrative and your late-game character's attributes. Some people go full ecologist and collect anomalies to enhance their character. Some seek the best guns ever. Some have the best armor. It's all pretty standard for the genre, but it is executed well and provides a player with a large range of choices to make throughout the story.\n\nAddendum: So I beat it after reloading a quick save every 15 minutes because holy ♥♥♥♥ the monolith stalkers really throw everything in the game at you including gunships, mutants, armor piercing ammunition, and their sheer numbers (I killed maybe 40 in the last part of the game?). I don't want to spoil the ending so I won't, but I will address the "incoherence" some people claim the game's story is guilty of. I am pretty sure that the curators that made that claim were either skipping through all the dialogue, or just refuse to acknowledge that a team of devs outside of the United States can make a compelling, unique, and deeply original story. Or maybe game journalists are all ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I think that's most likely.\n\nThis game is not appealing to the same crowds that find the Fallout or Metro games appealing, and I think that the reason for that is in the fantasies and idealized situations the game constructs for the player. It really does give you the sensation of being inna woods with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soviet guns that jam all the time fighting hostile creatures and violently entrepreneurial bandits. You also get the neat sensation of collecting artifacts for science, and doing so under the constant oppression of the military and rival paramilitary factions that seemingly have no scientific aims. While in this debut title, there is no explicit faction-joining for the player, you do participate and witness the war for these radioactive artifacts, and it absolutely informs your player-choices that do in fact yield wildly different endings to the game--bad endings if you're a lazy and stupid player that doesn't read dialogue. I have beaten this game 3 times now I think? I'll never be able to eat ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spam knock-offs again without thinking about my misadventures in the zone scrounging for artifacts, assassinating corrupt military commanders and bandits, and drinking a dozen handles of vodka to make the radiation sickness go away.\n\nIf you're intrigued play it and get hooked and maybe you'll pick up Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat which I'll review at some point.","May 31, 2015","true","56.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naroon91/recommended/4500/","naroon91","Kensho Comatose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naroon91/","86 products in account","This game has had a pretty notorious reputation not long after it was announced in the early 2000's. It underwent numerous different designs, names, and builds before finally getting released in late 2007. Even then, some felt that the game was still a rushed beta, and honestly it was. It wasn't until several patches that the game was decently stable. However to many people, the game's now-trademark atmosphere, brutal gameplay and unforgiving gameplay environment were enough to leave the game permanently ingrained in gamer's minds across the globe.\n\nFlash forward to 2013, and this game still has a devoted modding community who are regularly working on and releasing ambitious new total conversions, weapon packs, gameplay tweaks and even restorations of previously-cut content.\n\nThis game must be experienced first-hand. Even the base 2007 game is still good today, though the game truly shines once one ventures out and starts downloading various mods that make the game several orders of magnitude better. This reviewer here prefers 'Oblivion Lost 2.2', which is based on a previous version of the game -- it restores many gameplay concepts and features that were left out for reasons unknown. It adds in more weapons, more suits, creatures, improved graphics, smoother performance, vehicles, and even free-play. It also adds in complete A-Life, which is unlocked after a player beats the game with the best ending, where every STALKER in the Zone begins to operately totally freely, which can open up many unique scenarios which no two players will experience the same.\n\nThe story is fairly gripping, though players expecting constant cutscenes and characters who never shut up will be disappointed. The story is told primarily through notes left in PDA's and some interactions with other humans face-to-face, though the few cutscenes there are do a wonderful job of contributing to the haunting atmosphere the game promotes.\n\nThe gameplay is tough and unforgiving -- this game isn't for the noobs out there. You won't be charging at enemies doing 1080-degree backflips while going for no-scopes here. You have to pick your shots and battles carefully. Sometimes it's better to flee than fight, or use stealth to completely dodge enemies (or ambush them to take their loot!)\n\nSTALKER in essence is an FPSRPG. You've got the traditional first-person shooter gameplay, combined with an inventory system, a stats system for both weapons and equipment, the latter of which directly affects the player's endurance and performance, quests, NPC's to interact with, and a fully dynamic open world that is constantly alive.\n\nThe harsh environment, dubbed "The Zone", is as much a challenge as the humans and mutants you must deal with on a daily basis. Due to the events which took place prior to the game, the Zone has changed drastically, and there are mutant creatures and "anomalies" scattered everywhere. Careless players will go on raids without enough equipment, or foolishly walk through dark areas without watching their step, only to find themselves getting insta-gibbed by an anomaly.\n\nThe A.I. is nothing to snicker at either, and they get even tougher if you play with most mods. Don't be surprised to be in a firefight with someone, only to lose track of them and then have them sneak up behind you and offload half a magazine into the back of your skull.\n\nShadow of Chernobyl also boasts a pretty barebones multiplayer component, but in all honesty, this pales in comparison to the single-player experience, which is a shame. It can be fun for a little while, but several gameplay decisions quickly make it evident that it's easy to become overpowered against other players, making the experience very un-STALKER like.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth the asking price, even years later. Buy this damned game, it's worth it.","December 27, 2011","true","154.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

STALKER SoC is an example of a systems-heavy open world FPS, that does an amazing job of demonstrating the broader potential within the genre. The mix of exploration, survival, hostile environment, and warring factions, makes for a much more compelling setting than any standard military or tactical shooter. The story of SoC is particularly strong, despite leaning on an amnesiac opening, and with multiple endings, you'll at least want to keep a few save files on hand. Travel and exploration are both dangerous and rewarding. Managing your inventory is a challenge, requiring mastery in itself. If you go into Stalker expecting to be an RPG-style pack mule, you'll be disappointed. For all that it does so well, and the ways in which it innovates, I don't feel that the game as released is truly "complete". While I'd recommend playing it in vanilla, for your first run through (and you'll probably want a second), I can't recommend "Oblivion Lost" too highly, when it comes to revisiting the game. Previously empty areas of the map are filled, new creatures introduced, and others taken to a superior state. If you ever wondered how the "Psuedodog" got its name, you'll figure that out pretty quick, in a playthrough of Oblivion Lost. If you're a fan of the FPS genre, this is a must for you to experience. The Zone is not for the feint of heart, but it is a pivotal stop for FPS fans.","December 2, 2015","true","72.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Don Draper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWerepyreKing/","392 products in account","S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a great game. One of my favorites. I've been told modding it makes it the most fun, but I haven't done that yet.\n\nSTALKER is has some bugs, silly voice acting (some characters only have one line and will repeat it every time you come into view: google "Get out of here stalker", or "I said come in, don't stand there"), but overall it's a great game.\n\nSimiliarities and differences: STALKER is most similar to Metro: 2033, probably because they are some of the same people who made it. It is not very similar to Fallout 3, other than the large world (Fallout 3 is much larger) but there is no level system, no experience points. Just reputation with factions, which basically means "Did you kill any Duty members? Did you kill any Freedom members?" since these are the only real factions in the game which don't initially hate you.\n\nMechanics: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is an exploration based game, if I had to call it something. The world is filled with anomalies that hurt you as you stand near. Throwing a bolt in the direction of one will activate it, showing you where it is. Expensive "artifacts" will fall out of them sometimes, and they will have various effects on your character. For instance, there is one that increases health regeneration but decreases bullet defense, and all other defense. It is terrible. There is also my favorite, Moonlight, which increases Endurance and decreases electrical defense.\nEndurance is the system of sprinting, carrying things, etc. If you are over-encumbered, and you walk places, your endurance will slowly go down. If you sprint, it will instantly go down. Having an endurance boosting artifact is one of the best things in the game because it gives endless sprinting when below 50 KG and longer sprinting above that. You cannot carry very much and must be very careful with inventory management.\nSide-missions will reward artifacts and special weaponry. They have a time limit. One set of side missions unlocks the "true" ending, you should save multiple times in the end of the game to ensure you get that, and look up how to unlock these side missions before going into Chernobyl.\nThe storyline has you going from different areas into the game, until you get to the top of Army Warehouses, which is the end-game area.\nThe shooting mechanics are very nice. Everyone, including you, has low health. Guns are inaccurate, damaging, and have bullet drop. Headshots are very powerful and can lead to a quick death, which makes this game hard for you too. There are many different guns and armors, many different bullet types. Rifles, Grenade Revolvers, Handguns, SMGs, shotguns, gauss gun, rocket launcher, sniper rifles. You can equip one major weapon and one pistol at the same time. To switch them out, you need to go into inventory.\n\nI love this game and it has a great open-world exploration aspect of it. Anomalies, bandits, mutants, and monolith are your enemies and the zone watches your fights.","August 14, 2014","true","48.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wish I'd played it sooner and had higher expectations with it, or I might never have tried it out. If you enjoy this and want a multiplayer version, I think DayZ mod for Arma 2 feels quite similar.","August 15, 2012","true","101.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you have never heard of this game, then you're in for a treat. This game has got an enjoyable and replayable story, not to mention some of the mods for this game (StalkerSoup and Priboi Story being my favorites). If you are just starting out on this game play it through in vanilla (just a warning its quite buggy vanilla) and once you've completed the story, I would recommend downloading a mod. It can be any mod of your choice (obviously) but I would highly recommend Priboi Story for a completely new story (Different protagonist, Different Quests etc.). As for StalkerSoup, It is difficult I would only recommend this to experienced STALKER players but you can have a go if you want. If you haven't got this game, what are you waiting for? GOTY 2007 10/10\nP.S Lost Alpha is out (and its free) so definately check that out, it was made by the people who made Priboi Story (Dez0wave) and it's a completely new game (not mod). Its got different locations, animations, items and much more, so check it out if you haven't got it (which I highly doubt).","May 24, 2013","true","281.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Had this as a physical copy, in the first place, way before Steam.\nThis game is the pinnacle of post apocalyptic games. Pure survival.

And not to mention gravitational/eletromagnetic anomalies you'll stumble into while running for your life, or searching for radioactive artifacts, that will either way kill you hopelessly.

SOC on retail disk countless times and then regretably selling it, I jumped at the chance to pick up the Steam version cheap on Ebay.\n\nYou play as the "Marked One" and your travels will take you across the vast wasteland of the Zone near the Chernobyl NCP in the Ukraine.  This open ended blended RPG FPS will keep you plenty occupied with enough playtime to log countless hours.  There are a number of quests and side missions to partake in or just venture the Zone and kill mutants and search for artifiacts if you please - this i what I do sometimes to kill time and play around in the world.. just to enjoy its menacing atmosphere.\n\nThe immersion and atmosphere is deliciuosly unique and the Stalker series is my fav regarding a creepy feeling.  I use the "Complete" mod available at artistpavel.com and it intensifies the atmosFEAR and graphics as well as does a complete overhaul of the game for a more stable experience.  Real time weather and day/night cycles are a treat to behold.  Sound and Music is great with eerie/spooky ambience throughout, gun effects are realistic.\n\nThe graphics look stunning for portraying the grislt world of the zone which is a treacherous, darkly beautiful radioactive wasteland.  For as big as the game is the world looks fantastic and considering its a few years old.\n\nThis is a hard game (my opionion) and I think is designed toward a more die hard PC player - it is not run and gun - you will die plenty.  The A.I. is tuff and smart - dodge and cover is there motto.   The first time you encounter a controller watch out - one of my favorite enemies ever.  Nearly half my friends list already has this gem, so they know a great game when they see it.\n\nGood hunting Stalker.  ✔Recommended","December 24, 2012","true","5.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Granted its not exactly post apocalypse since the world has not been destroyed just...Chernobyl but thats beside the point since the game still gives of that feeling. Now to the game itself.\n\nIt doesn't hold your hand right from the start and you can easily die on the first mission if you don't plan properly. Firefights are not a walk in the park and you need to be very careful unless you like reloading saves since you didn't notice the guy hiding behind the car. This game also allows the player to customize their loadout and make sure they have enough healthkits and food for when its needed...as well as vodka since it can remove radiation...apparently. Now everything wants to kill you in the game including the environment. Ontop of this be prepared to ♥♥♥♥ your pants since this game does horror well. You can go through 6 rooms in a building and then as you are leaving you hear a noise and well...something bad is in the building with you and it wants to meet you.\n\nTo sum up, it a game which you will love if you enjoy a challange, a time sink, amazing enviroments and the genre itself.","November 16, 2014","true","23.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game was groundbreaking in it's time, and it's hard to believe (Okay, well, except for engine bugs. it's not like source.) It's an old game. First in the series, i'd reccomend you to get this game first in the series. As any other part of the game wouldn't make sense. And, with mods, this game will have you coming back for more and more. (and more!) [EDIT: MODS SHOULD ONLY BE APPLIED AFTER PLAYING THROUGH THE 'VANILLA' UNMODDED STORYLINE A MINIMAL TIME OF ONCE. TRY VANILLA BEFORE SPRINKLES.] This game's really quite better than the other two, in my opinion. Please, If you like fallout and are a bit upset with how NV turned out, Try this game, at least once. If you don't like it, you can complain to me. But I bet you'll like it for one reason or another.\n\nEDIT:\nI have racked up over 600 hours of this game, (12/2/13) making it nearly surpass my most played game (Mabinogi, 1500+hrs) in at least half the time.

Unlike most devs, the devs of STALKER paid extreme attention to even the smallest details, leading to a very immersive game. With fun gunplay, decent difficulty, a great story, and excellent exploration, this game deserves more than it's current "cult favourite" status.\nProtip: If you're going to play, play on Master difficulty, as on Master all weapons deal more damage (yours included!) and enemies have more advanced AI (flanking and such), leading to extremely fun and interesting firefights.\n\nAlso has an absolutely brilliant modding community. I'd recommend trying out Zone Reclamation Project for a first playthrough, and AMK (difficulty), Zone of Alienation (Difficulty + immersion), or OGSE (Loads of new content) for a second/third/fourth/etc, playthrough.","January 31, 2013","true","67.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is an immersive, free roam survival, and it does a damn good job at it. The storyline is one you can really wrap your head around. The gameplay throughout the story is intense action and fun at the same time. The game has a realistic fighting system with bleeding effects and radiation. There's also the mutants that you can fight with. If the story isn't good enough for you, there's tons of side missions and free roam exploration. You can even win favor from different factions in the game and get special weapons and suits from them only. The only problem is in this game you can't join factions and control them without mods.

It's a difficult question to answer, but I can easily that STALKER SOC is the best FPS I've played in the last 10 years. The RPG elements, inventory management and the sandbox environment add a lot of depth to the game and the atmosphere is just brilliant. The exclusion zone is beautifully created and the bleak atmosphere is captured well. There are plenty of weapons, not weapons different because of stats but different unique weapons that can be modified with a scope or a grenade launcher. Artifacts can be collected and used for additional stats like protection against radation or bullets.\n"You kill two blood suckers and your health is down and the screen stars to swim and that moment of dread when you realise that a controller is nearby!" that's horror!\nI'm playing the Pripyat mission in the night looking for the secret lab and it was so brilliant that I had to pause the game and come here to write a review.

This game has it all with the rough characters that are earthy and simple, the huge amount of inventory that's available and of course don't bring back everything you can to the trader for extra cash because you're simply going to have a huge pile of gear in the ship or near your locker and then the game slows down because you brought back thousands of extra handguns, knives, ammo and whatever and then tossed them in the corner. If you do that then spread them around outside because the game get's unstable with thousands of weapons and stuff tossed in the corner of a room. Trust me you don't want to do that because the game doesn't like it but otherwise this game is solid, fun, kewl, awesome and it gets very creepy, moody, spooky and full of pressure and tight suspense. There's a lot to risk and a lot to think about and the more you play the more you want to play more. This game needs the mods from MODdb and after that you're set and ready to play. The MODS there will stabilize the game, tweak the graphics, add some gear and make everything operate better and more stable. Buy it because it's sooper and buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat too because it' simply awesome too. The other STALKER Clear Sky I've not played much and it seems different and so I didn't find the extra time because I have 48 shooter games ;) Buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat and buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl because these are the best in the series and both have great support at MODdb and you'll love the trippy weirdness of the game that is 100% a full on first person shooter experience with some really kewl other stuff to do too.

It 's graphically impressive, yet can be scaled down to work on weaker machines. It's poorly executed at parts but the very ideas behind it were so ambitious that you have to like it just for trying. And it has a highly moddable and customizable structure.\n\nI most definitely recommend this to anyone interested in open-world shooting or post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Invest time looking into and installing mods to really get your moneys worth.","May 16, 2014","true","199.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Both the open world and the AI are very unforgiving. There are constant dangers not just from the wide variety of enemies but also from high levels of radiation and strange spatial anomalies. The Zone is a large place and during the course of the game you get to visit a diverse range of environments and encounter many weird malevolent forces. The combat is always demanding and requires a good deal of strategic thinking given that you have to deal with other health-depleting factors at the same time. The story, although it does suffer from the usual lack of focus as a result of non-linear gameplay and some uninspiring side quests, is still reasonably strong and engaging. Graphically it’s quite impressive, although I should point out that I installed the STALKER Complete 2009 mod from the get-go, which (as I understand it) improves on the vanilla game in this area. It’s true that there are some annoying bugs, but they didn’t dampen my enjoyment of the game too much. And even though the weapons and armour deteriorate (a feature I’m not overly fond of) the speed with which this occurs is more realistic than in many RPGs so it didn’t bug me too much. Overall the game scores very highly for its outstanding atmosphere, which is one of the most engrossing, and idiosyncratic, that I’ve encountered. Highly recommended. 4/5","April 3, 2015","true","40.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It raises some interesting questions and points about how people perceive a catastrophic event - to most it's a tragedy, but to some it's an opportunity. One thing I would have liked to be explored is how the player character reacts to waking up with no memories and with his only direction being to kill a man. Would he do so unquestioningly, or would he resist? But that's a question for another time. Overall, STALKER is an excellently atmospheric open-world game where the realism augments the feel instead of getting in the way.\n\nFull review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/07/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl.html","June 19, 2014","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. may seem dated when compared to modern shooters it does have what most lack, interesting mechanics  and immersion that you can really sink your teeth into. Can't really even say I've played anything else like it. The world of this game feels alive and really captures the hoplessness seems to permeate Russian fiction. This game, while not perfect, offers some of the most immersive moments I've ever had\n\nA lot of people recomend going into this game modless but I have to disagree. Currently playing with autumn aurora 2 and it's amazing without sacrificing the original feel of the game.\n\nPros:\n+ Immersion that is so deep, you could drown.\n+ Interesting locations and content\n+ Firefights are intense, especially if you have a gun that is prone to jamming.\n\nCons:\n- Story can be ho hum at points\n- A.I. can be a little unfair at times\n- Difficulty spikes throughout the game (for the love of god bring lots of ammo)\n\nOverall:\nAt the start of my second play through I ran away from a pack of dogs...into a military squadren. Dodging bullets, I sprinted back to the first HQ which started a firefight between the military and stalkers. I hid in an abondanded house, while a quest giving npc caught a bullet with his face and died. I failed the "quests" he gave me but I got to scavenge his body and took his guns and money.

For whatever reason it was one of my earliest Steam purchases, and really set a precedent for me. I'm probably one of the few people left that plays this game without mods/vanilla, and I'm always hesitant to install them. This game was my Dark Souls many years earlier. It is brutal and unforgiving and really takes an understanding of what is happening around you so that you can eventually feel like you are actually a powerful force in the world you inhabit and deserve to be as such. Hauntingly beatiful and deathly terrifying, I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys difficult atmospheric shooters (think early Metro 2033/Last Light with more outdoors settings). It has been a long time since I've had to learn and pay attention as much in a game as in this one, and I'll forever revel in it as it holds a special place in my heart. The following games advance in different directions but still afford notice, I've only played its prequel and not the sequel so I can't make particular recommendations there.\n\nIf you like what you've heard here, and want to pick up an extremely interesting game that it would be hard to spend more than $20 on, heed my advice and go for it\n\n8/10","June 21, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/czthedude/recommended/4500/","czthedude","CZtheDude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/czthedude/","389 products in account","I would describe this game as a "survival horror semi-open world first person shooter".\n\n"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl" has an amazing atmosphere and a challenging difficulty unlike most other shooters. Instead of running and gunning, you need to approach objectives carefully and plan your route through areas, which make gunfights feel more real. You also need to eat, treat your wounds, take anti-radiation drugs and manage your inventory.\n\nThe A.I. is pretty good, and will live its own life whether you participate in the game or not. You will run across non-scripted events like faction clashes, mutant vs stalker fights and even mutants vs mutants brawls.\n\nA lot of guns are customizable, there are various armors and outfits with different stats for use in different situations and there are artifacts scattered around the world which will improve (or worsen) those stats.\n\nThis is one of few games where I can just stay in one place for what feels like hours, admiring, listening to and soaking in the rich atmosphere. But in the other end of the spectrum, there are places that I don't even want to visit because of the horrors that awaits there.\n\nI highly recommend playing this game on Master difficulty, even if it is your first time playing, to get that real S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience. Successfully finishing a raid or quest when you know that death is always just seconds away just makes everything so much more rewarding. Instadeath is everywhere, so remember to save often!\n\nThe community has created lots of mods, ranging from graphical improvements, bugfixes and in-game tweaks to complete reworks of the game mechanics and content, which all adds to this game's replay value. This community is still very much alive, even though the game is seven years old at the time of writing, and new mods come out every now and then ("S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Lost Alpha" being one of the latest).\n\nMy personal mod recommendations for enhancing the game but retaining the "vanilla" experience are:\n\n- Zone Reclamation Project (ZRP) - bugfixes and game tweaks\n- S:T.A.L.K.E.R. Weather Overhaul (SWO) - A new and better weather system\n- Absolute Nature and Absolute Structures - Texture packs\n- Less Bad Nightvision - Slightly improves the night vision\n- Shaders MAX - Lighting engine improvements\n- Brussell's ENB - Adds bloom, motion blur and depth of field (DoF) and further improves the lighting\n\nToday's wave of survival games need to learn from THIS game when it comes to atmosphere, loot, gunplay and build upon its environmental ideas.\n\nI'm a big fan of survival and immersive game experiences, and this is, hands down, one of my favourite games of all time!","June 25, 2014","true","67.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It raises some interesting questions and points about how people perceive a catastrophic event - to most it's a tragedy, but to some it's an opportunity. One thing I would have liked to be explored is how the player character reacts to waking up with no memories and with his only direction being to kill a man. Would he do so unquestioningly, or would he resist? But that's a question for another time. Overall, STALKER is an excellently atmospheric open-world game where the realism augments the feel instead of getting in the way.\n\nFull review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/07/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl.html","June 19, 2014","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. may seem dated when compared to modern shooters it does have what most lack, interesting mechanics  and immersion that you can really sink your teeth into. Can't really even say I've played anything else like it. The world of this game feels alive and really captures the hoplessness seems to permeate Russian fiction. This game, while not perfect, offers some of the most immersive moments I've ever had\n\nA lot of people recomend going into this game modless but I have to disagree. Currently playing with autumn aurora 2 and it's amazing without sacrificing the original feel of the game.\n\nPros:\n+ Immersion that is so deep, you could drown.\n+ Interesting locations and content\n+ Firefights are intense, especially if you have a gun that is prone to jamming.\n\nCons:\n- Story can be ho hum at points\n- A.I. can be a little unfair at times\n- Difficulty spikes throughout the game (for the love of god bring lots of ammo)\n\nOverall:\nAt the start of my second play through I ran away from a pack of dogs...into a military squadren. Dodging bullets, I sprinted back to the first HQ which started a firefight between the military and stalkers. I hid in an abondanded house, while a quest giving npc caught a bullet with his face and died. I failed the "quests" he gave me but I got to scavenge his body and took his guns and money.

Fallout does not come close to what Stalker presents. The level of immersion, not to mention paranoia is the best I have experienced in any game. Stalker feels like a more serious and realistic Fallout, meaning that survival is THE most important thing. You always need to keep your eyes open and your ears listening or you could end up walking into death. You never know who is enemy or friend.

So to summarize, first, this game is an incredibly excellent game that suffers from some bugs and semi-regular crashes, but you can get unoffical patches and mods that help fix that a little bit. I gotta point out though, this game can potentially be balls-to-the-wall hard. So... Expect to play this game methodically, and not rushing through Call of Duty style hoping you won't get hosed down will bullets or surrounded by mutants and mauled to death. Because, spoiler alert, you will. And now, on to the big explanation!\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a game ahead of its time. Running off of a system where you need to conserve bullets, monitor your weapons' and armor's conditions, and be very conservative with materials. All of this is mostly thanks to the weight system. In most games that incorporate a weight system, like Elder Scrolls titles and Fallout games, ammunition (Usually) weighs nothing. Not in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., no, in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., bullets weigh a devent amount. So this brings an interesting system to the fore. In most games, I would have main firearms, one as my preferred gun, and the other as my backup, and load up on ammo for both of those. You can do that in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., but it's not optimal. Rather, you should probably just load up on ammo for your main weapons (Pistol and assault weapon), otherwise you'll be over-encumbered.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. also has a bleeding system. If you get shot in a non-vital spot, you bleed, and you should bandage up or you're gonna slowly bleed out. If it's a lesser wound, you don't need to worry about it, it won't bleed much. It's color coded, if it's red, you'll bleed out if you don't treat it, if it's green, it'll most likely heal in a moment or two. If it's yellow, it'll heal, it will just take a while, and you're probably better off bandaging it. This is the first game (Regarding it's time of release, in 2007) that I have seen a game make the bleeding system pertain to enemy AI as well. You hit and enemy with a few shots to the chest, he'll probably either die in a few moments, or curl up on the ground and eventually die like that. It's still very impressive.\nEverything about the weapons, armor, and gameplay, generally is extremely impressive. But that doesn't mean I don't have my gripes with the game. There are a few problems:\nA: this game can be buggy as ♥♥♥♥. F6 oddly is the default quick save button. I set it to F5, becuase that's what it is in most games. That button is your friend. Use it a lot.\nB: I feel that a lot of the mutants take waaaaaaaay too mant rounds to put down. Unless you manage to hit them in the head, which is hard. Hell, even the blind dogs take like, at least a clip and a half from my Vintar BC to drop if I don't hit them in theh ead. There's a point where it starts to feel ridiculous, considering that this game pretty much forces you to ration off your ammo supplies.\nC: This game has an INSANE difficulty jump at the end of the game. It would be fine, if it didn't break all the rules that this game makes you obey. It forces you to move fast, and to act fast, while not dying. Up until that point, you essentially have to take everything slow and planned out. This ending just... It threw me off.\n---- Quick save is your friend. Remember this. ----\n\nAnyway, altogether, this game is awesome. There's a whole lot to do in it, between the warring factions, Duty and Freedom, and the side missions, there's a surprising lot to do. I would strongly suggest picking this game up if you haven't yet, and pick upt the STALKER: Complete mod for Shadow of Chernobyl. Makes it look a lot better, and tends to fix a lot of the issues the game has.","August 26, 2014","true","30.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl is an RPG set in the post-apocalyptic grounds of radiation-filled Chernobyl, where S.T.A.L.K.E.R's roam and reign in this wild west of mutants and Russians in gas masks. This oldie remains captivating to me because of this one, simple thing: It was crafted with care. Hell, the designers went INTO CHERNOBYL and modeled parts of the game after what they saw.\n\nShadow of Chernobyl is a game built on atmosphere. Ho-lee ♥♥♥♥, atmosphere is extremely present. From the way the lighting is done, to the wind effects, to the echoes of mutated animals crying out in the fields, to the eerie trance of quiet music beneath the whoosh of wind blowing by you as you trek through a field, bleeding and tired from an encounter... It really feels like what the developpers intended, which is that you're struggling to survive in Chernobyl with what you can find. Without adding legitimate "horror aspects," S.T.A.L.K.E.R developped a tinge of scariness with the excessive ammount of eerie that drives home the point it was going for.\n\nThe combat engine is relatively simplistic, but it's satisfying. The damage frame makes cover actually necessary to outlast a longer fight, therefore making the lean function actually useful. The noise and visibility system added to the game also gives you the choice to go in stealthily or half-cocked, and also makes it that much more realistic; other people can HEAR YOU SNEAKING if you're sloppy, and wandering around with a flashlight will give away your position to anything that wants to kill you. Combine this system with angry russians, a gas mask, and some creepy torn up towns, and you've got S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\n\nHonestly, I'd pick this over Fallout any day of the week. I'd recommend this game to ANYONE.\n\n\n\n","April 21, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is as fluent throughout the game, as it is realistic. Your character will succumb after only a few hits or shots, even on the "normal" difficulty or, "Stalker". (Novice, Stalker, Veteran, Master) Scavenging for items is nice, searching dead bodies and even being able to drag them as to not alert others, weapons perform realisticly as one cannot pull headshots with pistols or shotguns no problem, and the recoil and reload animations are very nice. Theres a trading system also, which allows practically any friendly person to be a potential purveyor of goods ranging from food, weapons, ammo, and other various necessary gear items, allowing yoiu to trade off found weapons and such or even buy new ones with the money provided, It is first person, has a nice open world feel to it as you can accomplish objectives and side missons from however angle you please, but also requires the patience of a saint to play. Ive died an innumerable amount of times in the first two hours of gameplay, being too gung-ho or  trying to be that guy that rambos the entire russian federation. plus these "anomalies" encountered are THE biggest pain. imagine an invisable enemy that you cant kill. that just repeatedly attacks you when you get in its proximity. this is "fixed" by providing the player with not only the ability to see the dust these things kick up, but an infinite amount of bolts that youre just lugging around. This game, all in all, is solid and promising. i do hope to enjoy it.\nPROS\n-Realism of firefights, weapon handling, and environment\n-creepy as hell creatures, mutants and such\n-plenty of weapons/gear\n-sound effects are nice\n-still eye pleasing even after all this time\n-Weather/time of day changes\n(think, Metro 2033/Fallout before they were big)\nCONS\n-Dead bodies too ragdoll-y at times\n-frustrating "trial and error" combat\n-no auto save...?\n-even the normal difficulty is still hard\n-controls are a bit fumbly","January 11, 2014","true","53.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay throughout the story is intense action and fun at the same time. The game has a realistic fighting system with bleeding effects and radiation. There's also the mutants that you can fight with. If the story isn't good enough for you, there's tons of side missions and free roam exploration. You can even win favor from different factions in the game and get special weapons and suits from them only. The only problem is in this game you can't join factions and control them without mods.

Between the vast swaths of abandoned structures that you can explore, and the wonderful dynamic weather system, Stalker is a game that truly and deeply immerses you in a terrifying alternate reality.  Truly, I cannot say enough about this bona fide classic.\n\nPS:  And don't let its age scare you away.  Get the easy to install Stalker Complete mod, and this game looks and runs just fine on a modern rig.

Both the open world and the AI are very unforgiving. There are constant dangers not just from the wide variety of enemies but also from high levels of radiation and strange spatial anomalies. The Zone is a large place and during the course of the game you get to visit a diverse range of environments and encounter many weird malevolent forces. The combat is always demanding and requires a good deal of strategic thinking given that you have to deal with other health-depleting factors at the same time. The story, although it does suffer from the usual lack of focus as a result of non-linear gameplay and some uninspiring side quests, is still reasonably strong and engaging. Graphically it’s quite impressive, although I should point out that I installed the STALKER Complete 2009 mod from the get-go, which (as I understand it) improves on the vanilla game in this area. It’s true that there are some annoying bugs, but they didn’t dampen my enjoyment of the game too much. And even though the weapons and armour deteriorate (a feature I’m not overly fond of) the speed with which this occurs is more realistic than in many RPGs so it didn’t bug me too much. Overall the game scores very highly for its outstanding atmosphere, which is one of the most engrossing, and idiosyncratic, that I’ve encountered. Highly recommended. 4/5","April 3, 2015","true","40.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fallout does not come close to what Stalker presents. The level of immersion, not to mention paranoia is the best I have experienced in any game. Stalker feels like a more serious and realistic Fallout, meaning that survival is THE most important thing. You always need to keep your eyes open and your ears listening or you could end up walking into death. You never know who is enemy or friend. And don't get me started about the mutants...\n\nI would buy this game, as well as the other Stalker games, for every one of my friends if I could!\nWorth the purchase!","February 9, 2014","true","20.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a difficult question to answer, but I can easily that STALKER SOC is the best FPS I've played in the last 10 years. The RPG elements, inventory management and the sandbox environment add a lot of depth to the game and the atmosphere is just brilliant. The exclusion zone is beautifully created and the bleak atmosphere is captured well. There are plenty of weapons, not weapons different because of stats but different unique weapons that can be modified with a scope or a grenade launcher. Artifacts can be collected and used for additional stats like protection against radation or bullets.\n"You kill two blood suckers and your health is down and the screen stars to swim and that moment of dread when you realise that a controller is nearby!" that's horror!\nI'm playing the Pripyat mission in the night looking for the secret lab and it was so brilliant that I had to pause the game and come here to write a review.

With beautiful environments, a haunting ambient soundtrack, and vicious monsters, Stalker sets a dark tone for this survival-horror shooter. However, you will find that, unlike Metro 2033, humans play as great as threat as the monsters, perhaps even more so depending on how you play. With dozens of weapons, quests, and characters, you will be well prepared to discover all of Chernobyl's secrets. What is more, compared to Western post-apocalyptic games such as Fallout, Stalker possesses a much deeper and more intense story, especially towards the end, when the truth is revealed. Normally I would never recommend mods for a game, but in this case, I believe that Stalker Complete is well worth it, removing/fixing multiple glitches, and thus contributing to a smoother game. Overall, despite the savage nature of the environment, one cannot help but be impressed with how beautifully the developers strung together the story and characters.

(S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Complete 2009)\nVery badly dated athstetics\nWeak/Almost non exsistant story\nDissapointing/Unfulfilling ending\n"Open world" is divided into VERY small areas\nBuilt on the most offensively terrible game engine I have ever played a game on\nAt 8 years old has aged severly\nAnomalies are EVERYWHERE killing you almost instantly setting you back to your last save (SO SAVE CONSTANTLY)\n\nThe ending of this game throws any fraction of balance there may have been out of the window. I was expecting so much more from the end of the game and all it ended up being was a frustrating shooting gallery, with no final boss fight. I was expecting far far more from this game coming from Call of Pripyat.\nIf you have finished this game you know exactly what I am talking about, not to mention the fact that when you beat the game with that terrible ending, thats it. No more exploration. No selling your mad loot for an epic weapon. Nothing.\nThe game just send and gives you the chance to replay the ending again. Thats it.\n\nNow S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was supposed to be the game to make up for all of this, but sadly it was killed off just like the staff of the nuclear reactor after the melt down.\n\nThe game also has a surprising lack of mutants. That was supposed to me the main horror factor of this game but they stopped showing up to the part about half way through leaving me feeling a little unsatisfied.\nThere was only a hand full of times this game really had me scared, and they were short lived.\n\nWould I reccomend this game?\n\nIf you are willing to install a mod or two and overlook all the cons this game has then it is for sure a yes from me.\nBut only if the good things I listed really interests you.\nIf this game does not really grab your attention, then I would reccomend for $20 you hold off on this one.\nIf you are not all that interested than you really aren't going to miss out.\n\n\n","July 28, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Complete with role playing elements, fantastic action, extreme difficulty and terrifying moments, the game delivers in every way.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nFirst off all, I would highly suggest everyone download the STALKER Complete 2009 Mod on www.moddb.com, as it increases visuals and gameplay performance tenfold and makes the dated game look on par to Crysis. Without the mod, however, colors are bland, facial expressions are dull, shading is downright awful, and textures are muddy. It's not terrible, but I would highly suggest the mod be installed if your PC can handle it.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThis is the iffy part of the game. While the controls aren't particularly difficult to comprehend, some movements feel clunky. Also, without the mod installed (let's face it, the mod improved everything), guns will jam frequently and bullets will go off course at point blank range. This is most of the time a reoccuring glitch, but is no less annoying. With the mod installed, you can have more role playing options available - joining groups and factions, repairing weapons and armor, and even getting more weapons and equipment not available in the original game, and the fact that this mod is free and easy to install just makes it better. However, the gameplay isn't perfect even with the installed mod. Enemies can shoot you through walls, the easiest difficulty is unbelieveably brutal to new players as enemies can kill you in just a few rifle shots or a few melee hits (if it's a mutant). The human AI isn't very smart, but hell they can kill easily. The truly impressive enemies are the mutants. Ranging from sickeningly deformed hounds to massive monstrosities that will haunt your nightmares for days, each mutant comes with its own abilities, attacks, and frightening appearances, making this just as much a survival horror experience as an RPG/Shooter. Glitches aside, the gameplay (though made better with the mod) is fun, easy to learn, and solid.\n\nSTORY:\nThis is where the game truly shines. The story is perhaps one of the most original that I've seen in any game in the past decade. You are a man known only as the 'Marked One,' due to the tatoo on your arm. You have no idea who you really are, what you're doing, or why you're in Chernobyl. All you know is that written on your PDA are the words: "KILL THE STRELOK." From there, you must fight through the horrors of the nuclear wasteland in the heart of Ukraine, uncovering the secrets of your past and the dark horrors that the government have tried so hard to cover up. The story is interactive, compelling, and interesting. The story alone makes the game a better experience.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:\nNothing is more useless than the multiplayer. Not only is it completely broken, but the cooperative play just derives from the role playing experience offered in the main campaign. That, and you'll be incredibly hard-pressed just to find another person to play with, much less be able to connect to a lobby. This isn't an FPS made for multiplayer; I'd steer clear of it.\n\nVERDICT:\nSTALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is a fantastic game. Mods improve the experience and make the game more interesting than ever. With a fantastic story, solid gameplay and nice visuals from actual locations in the haunting Chernobyl landscape, this game, despite it's flaws, ranks in among the top best games I've ever played.\n\nRATING: 8/10","April 17, 2014","true","51.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sense of isolation, of total fear, is unmatched by anything except perhaps if you played System Shock as a child.

All you have is yourself, and man has made his own personal hell in the Zone.

The game has an amazing story. If you enjoy Russian/Ukrainian science fiction mixed with urban legend wrapped up in a big, beautiful plot twist bow, then this is the game for you. Although the story may feel patchy at times, I enjoyed it the whole way through. There are about 7 different endings, two of them being very special. This game effectively incorporates horror, action, and survival tactics into one large environment. This is a very immersive game; the audio is spectacular, the lighting system is top notch, the enemies are terrifying, and the combat system is well put together and feels good. There are plenty of enjoyable mods for this game which does increase the replay value. If you get this game, I highly suggest playing on the hardest difficulty. The game will be much more enjoyable. I never got into the faction system very much, but if you enjoy factions then it's a feature of the game. I did not experience very many bugs or glitches while playing this game, yet it seems that others have had a lot of difficulties with bugs and glitches. I believe the bugs and glitches in this game are hit or miss. Overall, this is a well made game with a superb story and I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys RPG-FPS style games.","October 6, 2015","true","84.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I however don’t think a game should need a "anti-retch" mod just to walk across the friggin room.","March 14, 2013","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With beautiful environments, a haunting ambient soundtrack, and vicious monsters, Stalker sets a dark tone for this survival-horror shooter. However, you will find that, unlike Metro 2033, humans play as great as threat as the monsters, perhaps even more so depending on how you play. With dozens of weapons, quests, and characters, you will be well prepared to discover all of Chernobyl's secrets. What is more, compared to Western post-apocalyptic games such as Fallout, Stalker possesses a much deeper and more intense story, especially towards the end, when the truth is revealed. Normally I would never recommend mods for a game, but in this case, I believe that Stalker Complete is well worth it, removing/fixing multiple glitches, and thus contributing to a smoother game. Overall, despite the savage nature of the environment, one cannot help but be impressed with how beautifully the developers strung together the story and characters.

Guns are very inaccurate, Ammo is expensive, and headshots are one hit kills.\nIt captures a great atmosphere, done with simple things like surviving on two sasagues a day, coming to a trader with a 100 lbs of loot, stopping by a campfire to hear to the guitar tunes and Russian banter between stalkers, and trying to survive with torn-up armor, a gun that misses every shot and jams every other, and no medkits and a clip of ammo left.\nPlay on master difficulty. It's not too hard and brings a fun challenge with highly lethal weapons going both ways.\n\nCertain artifact setups can make the game very easy.\nThere's a stealth feature, but it's unfortunately underused, and most areas make stealth impossible.\nSuffers from some bugs. Nothing game-breaking for me at least, but breaks immersion when NPC bodies are littered around campfire because they spawned in the fire, or when the quest marker for one I already did/someone dead stays up.\nGame's old, and graphics haven't aged too well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013396664/recommended/4500/","76561198013396664","Cpt. Brenner","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013396664/","111 products in account","NOTICE: This review is on the original (vanilla) version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. which excludes all mods.\n==================\n\nEditorial Notes: One of by far the best FPS/RPG games I've ever own, was at first a little hesitant about this style. It has very odd controls and the AI is a laughable joke at easy settings but get incredibly difficult in harder/master difficulty (learn to duck and run when they reload). I'll be straight honest it is by far one of my favorite games to play when you have time to kill, just the missions alone can spend roughly 10+ hours if you really go above and beyond the beaten path and investigate nearly everything possible. A few Easter eggs can be found which I thought was rather clever but more importantly is the factions that act as you biggest pain the butt but the source of your jobs as a murderous psychopath. Each time I replay my game I try to use a different weapon that I rarely use, or a subset of weapons that I deemed unworthy to best myself and train in the hardest way possible (i.e. take a pistol or knife and kill a: snork, bloodsucker, any military officer) and even getting semi-creative with the use of surroundings.\n\nI will admit that the AI is very old and outdated meaning that they go by the line-of-sight controls. If they see an enemy they'll attack via line-of-sight and will gain a foothold by literally going straight even if that means going into a: fireplace, anomaly, or direct line of friendly fire (which in return get mad at you). AI also have two settings for accuracy, either they trained in the clone troopers training base or became solid-snake that trained with Agent 47's agency which ultimately depends on the difficulty you have it set to. Word of advice, rely solely on F6 && F7 your two newly formed friends of the trade.\n\nPros:\n+ Fun and interesting gameplay that stands against older games\n\n+ Can be rather challenging even during a 'weapon-free' zone; certain missions can leave you with an complex scenario where you can either go in guns blazing like Rambo or be like Sam Fisher and sneak your way in.\n\n+ Able to 'peak' around corners for some very unique firefights, AI can also assist in firefights (just watch for friendly-fire).\n\n+ Certain areas/zones have eerie soundtracks that even to this creation of this review, has a creepy factor that makes you watch your back.\n\n+ Open world; once you have certain missions completed or can pay off the right people.\n\n+ Different factions can ultimately change the gameplay; each having their own perks respectfully. (Duty = weapons, Freedom = Armor, STALKER = 'Monay Monay Monay....who needed Monay?')\n\n+ Semi-stealth; there is a stealth factor to the game as in if its dark enough enemies will have a harder time detecting you while you sneak. Whereas if you were to walk into a bush everyone including their mother will hear you thus alerting them to your presence. [Silence weapons are silent, if you get a kill it will be a silent unless they had line-of-sight on that target].\n\n\nCons:\n- AI; as said before they will follow the path of the least resistance, even if that means walking into a anomaly or your line of fire. Some AI are even clueless as to where to go sometimes and will watch your movement until nearly everyone is dead in that area or they'll aimbot the next available unit even if its behind walls.\n\n- Controls; some of the controls are a little wonky. To access your PDA, press P. To check status of active task, press TAB. To go nearly prone, press CTRL + Shift (whilst using WASD and peaking corners). Some of the motions are a little clumsy, especially when getting shot at and needing to heal but fear that the moment you let go of the mouse you will literally run smack-dab into a bandit.\n\n- Difficulty; Can be easy as pie one minute then the next you are in the middle of one heck of a firefight with no clear visual of where that sniper is and "BAM" you see the text "You Are Dead" in harder settings. The harder you go the more accurate the enemy becomes, thus meaning that AK's can quite literally kill you in 2-3 hits even with a SEVA/Exoskeleton suit.\n\n- Buggy/Glitchy; Like most games there are bugs, but this game has quite a number of them (most are actually funny to see and do not really hinder the game performance). Situations such as side-missions can be tedious especially when you have to attack a group of military outside of Agroprom Research Institute by the zone load area and one of the military officers goes way behind the loading zone thus you cannot kill them but they can attack you. Certain areas have a weird NPC spawn area (wild territories) where friends or foe can literally spawn above you. Some of the more funnier glitches is using an explosive barrel near NPC's and watch them run into the fireplace and die.\n\n- Loading Areas; certain areas will have a 'loading' area to render the next part of the game. This can be very annoying when being chased and you 'load' into the next area but since you ran before the load you will waste your entire stamina and now your character cannot run away from what was hunting you down (i.e. running from the dogs in the bar area) You can theoretically bypass a few of them by going into a different part of the world but does not work for all.\n\n- Stealth; Like I said before there is a stealth factor but its very odd. You have to get a kill with a silent weapon (guns with silencer or a knife) whist being undetected or seen from an enemy. You have a visual bar that will show if you've been seen but it doesn't work part of the time, long distance firefights are the way to go if stealth is the objective.\n\n==================\nConclusion: I really love this game with a passion! Even though that it was outdated and old, and a clumsy control but it rivals with Call of Pripyat and in general is a lot of fun to explore the different options that you couldn't do the game before. It's a fun game to have if you like FPS/RPG games and is by far one game that I love to use with mods (L.U.R.K. and the complete pack are fun to use). The replay ability is unheard of because you can replay the game but different NPC's will be used in different areas so where enemies might be wont spawn there till later or earlier in game, it has a random factor that always makes it more fun to snipe people out in full stealth and watch them squirm in their boots.\n\nScore: 8.5/10\n\n\nTL;DR version:\n* Wake up in room with bald guy while maintaining coolness factor.\n* Get gun from dead guy's body, wipe blood off face, stroke knife like a psychopath.\n* Run into military outpost, kill everyone with worst pistol in-game.\n* Shoot blind dog in face with AK-47, watch it skimper away as it holds hind leg up.\n* Almost shoot friend thinking was a bandit, shot them anyway, stole loot and ran off before their friends arrived.\n* Peek around corner in bar, greeted "I said don't just stand there, come in" multiple times.\n* Get told to "get out of here stalker", joined the Ukrainian-gladiator arena for money.\n* Peek around boxes in arena, see enemy stalker at end of arena.\n* Sneak up like Sam Fisher to enemy.\n* Peak around another boxes to spot enemy stalker, walks out in front of me, shoots my face.\n* You are dead, cry as i didn't quicksave.\n\nWould replay to crap my pants and get shot in face again. 10/10\n","June 14, 2015","true","191.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has the most tense, dreadful,  and eerie atmosphere of any game I've ever played. It's not aging well graphically however, and the vanilla version still has a ton of bugs. That said, it's a huge amount of fun once you get into it and soak up the Zone's own little world of monsters and anamolies, but it requires patience, this is not an easy game and can be very frustrating. It's a very well made shooter and the story (while confusing at times) is worth getting into to learn more about the Zone and the game's incredible lore. There are a TON of mods out there for this game that can add things like graphical updates to complete overhauls of everything including the story.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend getting into the regular version first to play it as it was made to be then, if you ever want to play it again, mod it for a new experience.\n\nWith all of that said, this is easily one of the greatest PC games ever made and is still incredibly fun 9 years on.

With beautiful environments, a haunting ambient soundtrack, and vicious monsters, Stalker sets a dark tone for this survival-horror shooter. However, you will find that, unlike Metro 2033, humans play as great as threat as the monsters, perhaps even more so depending on how you play. With dozens of weapons, quests, and characters, you will be well prepared to discover all of Chernobyl's secrets. What is more, compared to Western post-apocalyptic games such as Fallout, Stalker possesses a much deeper and more intense story, especially towards the end, when the truth is revealed. Normally I would never recommend mods for a game, but in this case, I believe that Stalker Complete is well worth it, removing/fixing multiple glitches, and thus contributing to a smoother game. Overall, despite the savage nature of the environment, one cannot help but be impressed with how beautifully the developers strung together the story and characters.

Be sure to update the core game with Stalker Complete mods (cleans up most of the minor but annoying bugs from vanilla).  A game that challenges you to shoot straight and use cover; run & gun will only get you as far as the "load game" screen.  An environment that tries to intimidate and injure you throughout the game (and does a very fine job of it).  Turn down the lights, put on some good headphones and just absorb the atmosphere.  One of the few games that I played that I had an AN-94 with grenade launcher and scope, a desert eagle, an MP5, 6 grenades, 500 rounds of ammo, and I was STILL hesitant to leave a safe area in the dark.

Only lack i find here is the lack of multiplayer, since i think this would go great in multiplayer, however it is bearable since it's a 2007 game, when gaming wasn't so full of multiplayer. I was always attracted to these types of games, so i might exaggarate. I just have 11 hours so far but i'm ready to go deeper into it, now i need to go to the lab X18 which is known to be the most scary, it's night time so i'm at the bar preparing for the day, another thing is a lack of skipping a night, this is my 2nd night, and i need to wait, it's around 0.5h. You see all these games about surviving in a post apocalyptic world, like DayZ, well, stalker started it, and it started well. One of the things i find priceless is sitting around the fire or at the bar and enjoying with fellow NPC stalkers, too bad it's only NPCs. Anyways, if you are looking for a good game, this is for you. 8/10.","October 14, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Be sure to update the core game with Stalker Complete mods (cleans up most of the minor but annoying bugs from vanilla).  A game that challenges you to shoot straight and use cover; run & gun will only get you as far as the "load game" screen.  An environment that tries to intimidate and injure you throughout the game (and does a very fine job of it).  Turn down the lights, put on some good headphones and just absorb the atmosphere.  One of the few games that I played that I had an AN-94 with grenade launcher and scope, a desert eagle, an MP5, 6 grenades, 500 rounds of ammo, and I was STILL hesitant to leave a safe area in the dark.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ANCRON/recommended/4500/","ANCRON","ANCRON","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ANCRON/","352 products in account","1st person, open world, apocalyptic action shooter with RPG, fiction and horror elements. It's the 2nd game in timeline, following soon after the events of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky. This is the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and first game in the series, about zone that surrounds 30km around destroyed nuclear power plant. Aftermath of tragedy at Chernobyl power plant (Ukraine USSR) that took place in 1986, when one of nuclear reactors in Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded, releasing big quantities of radiation and contaminating large area around the plant and nearby town of Pripyat. Developers took this true and gruesome story, added fiction and horror elements from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. books, to make a unique and atmospheric 1st person action shooter experience.\n\nStory takes place long after the events of 1986, now it's 2012 and zone around Chernobyl is nothing like it was before. In year 2006, there was 2nd reactor explosion (fiction) that expanded the zone and sent waves of energy and radiation outwards, killing every living being in the area. Only military personal and scientists were allowed to enter the zone. Even though military closed all the entrances and fenced down 30km area around the power plant, despite the dangers people started to venture inside the zone, exploring unknown areas, discovering new anomalies, artifacts and creatures within. Later those brave yet outlaw individuals were called Stalkers.\n\nThough your story in beginning of the game is unclear, because you are suffering from some sort of amnesia, you must uncover the events that took place before you awoke on Sidorovich's table, with strange tattoo on your arm and single objective in your "Personal digital assistant" (PDA), to kill someone called Strelok.\n\nGame has open word imitation with many large, open yet fenced areas to explore, as well as indoor and underground levels. All areas have checkpoints between them, and going through one will load the next area connected to it. You can easily check map, objectives, statistics about yourself and much more in your PDA. Many areas in game are radioactive and hazardous, some filled with anomalies that are dangerous and hard to notice, so make sure you always listen to your "beeping" Detector (no puns intended) to quickly leave the dangerous area.\n\nAs well as invisible hazards there are plenty of dangers that you can see, one of those are mutants (creatures, animals, people that were exposed to large amounts of radiation, and through many generations mutated more and more), some previously were wild animals or livestock, others are heavily mutated humanoids. All of them are very resistant to radiation and many in game hazards, which explains how they survived the 2nd reactor explosion in 2006.\n\nOne of many ways to protect yourself from hazards is wearing suits made by Stalkers, they range from simple clothing with simple weather protection; one piece body suits with rebreathers to armor with chest kevlar plates and radiation reflective layers, to protect you from many types of harm. As well as gear, there are many medications that can save your life: few kinds of medikits, bandages, anti radiation drugs and injections. Some basic survival equipment includes: knife, binoculars, food (sausage, bread, canned food, energy drinks and vodka which is ideal to reduce radiation exposure).\n\nMain source of income in game are artifacts. Usually found near anomalies and secret stashes where Stalkers and other people hide their valuables, around the world. There are many different kinds of artifacts, each with their own unique look, statistics and value. Most artifacts will give you useful "buffs" but also expose you with radiation, others absorb radiation or add positive effects, so mix and match to get the best symbiosis, or simply drink more vodka / anti radiation drugs if your radiation exposure is reaching high levels.\n\nThere are many kinds of weapons in game. Different kinds of pistols, sub machine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles and grenades. As well as some futuristic weapons I wont mention to not spoil the game. You can put scopes, silencers, grenade launcher modifications on some weapons. There are few bullet types for each weapon, as well as many bullet calibers. You can't modify or repair armor and weapons like you can in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky, so I would suggest to get mods for that if you really want to. Game has working ballistics system, so bullets fly in arc and will ricochet from surfaces.\n\nGame has few factions and depending on your actions, you can be either hostile, neutral or friendly with them. Hostile reputation will not benefit you in any way, neutral will grant you the ability to speak and trade with them and friendly will open up some side missions, discounts and chance to join said faction. Best game for faction play is S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky. Just wanted to add, even though game has many difference types of NPC roles, there are no female nurses, cooks or any females whatsoever. Developers decided not to include those because of harsh world and nature of players, go figure.\n\nTo close it off will say that game is somewhat aged and may not look that appealing to many players. But what game lacks, it compensates with atmosphere, grim feel, gameplay and story. It has working day and night cycle, life simulation for NPC and decent AI. Game will not hold your hand, and is challenging on harder difficulties if you don't take cover behind something. Voice acting is a bit basic but only if you play with English language, it's just a bit weird with the accents. I experienced minor graphics glitches concerning lighting and shadows, as well as many xrCore.dll relates crashes without modifications, but maybe it's just on my end.\n\nOther than that game is fun, with tension and scare moments once in a while. Try this out, and better yet get all 3 games and play them in this order: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat for the best story experience.\n\nP.S. Don't forget your anti radiation sun cream, it's not often but occasionally you can see sun in between rain and thunderstorms.","August 15, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend this particularly to fans of Metro 2033/Last Light as a more challenging and atmospheric alternative, despite being a good few years old, the game has aged well and (as far as I have experienced.) Runs smoothly; it contains a very nice inventory system also. The plot follows a Russian 'S.T.A.L.K.E.R' who has come to the zone to scavenge for artifacts after a fictional second explosion at the Chernobyl reactor, but suffers amnesia. The rest picks up from there. Despite the stellar experience, I do find the game is plagued by steep difficulty curves, an unusable stealth mechanic (the HUD has a sound metre but as far as I know, stealth isn't possible unless the enemy is sleeping.) And I found a lot of the areas looking a little too similar to one another, however, this doesn't tarnish this true gem of modern times.\n\n10/10 Would cheeki breeki again.","May 23","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even the illusive sniper rifles are weirdly inaccurate, and yes I know what bullet falloff and spread is, but this is ridiculous.\n\nIf you can get used to the gunplay, it provides a satisfying experience once you consistently take down enemies, watch them flop to the ground, loot all their corpses, and waddle back to the shop to pawn it all.\n\nSo S.T.A.L.K.E.R, get questing, killing mutants, shooting dudes, collecting artifacts, exploring creepy corridors, and taking in the sights of the hazardous deathtrap that is the zone.","July 3, 2011","true","84.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The last 30% of the game is just horrible where the difficulty comes from extremely long levels filled with non-stop enemies. Add to this whenever you reload a save file enemies will spawn in addition to the existing enemies.\n\nAlso my worst complaint is that enemies respawn infinitely and completely ruin the immersion. You kill an entire military outpost and guess what? 2 minutes apparently all it takes for more baddies to run out from their secret hiding place to repopulate the outpost. I've killed at least a THOUSAND bandits in this game, all in a freaking 10 km square map in an apparently secret and susposedly hard-to-get-into zone. 99% of these kills are because I'm running past a base or have to do some pointless side-quest.\n\nIf you are looking for a very atmospheric exploration game with good horror elements then you should get this but be warned this game is extremely over-rated.","June 4","true","48.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a semi-open world game where you can explore areas to find stashes and run into other stalkers and their respective factions. The stalkers are those that roam the zone, the area within and surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. As you can imagine, the zone is infested with pockets of radiation that can cause severe harm, strange monsters roam about, people fight for survival, ecologists are simply trying to study, and you're at the center of it all.\n\nIn the game, you play as the "Marked One", a stalker that was left for dead on a 'death truck'. Luckily for you, a fellow loner/stalker finds you and takes you to Cordon, where the gameplay begins. Because you're rescued by a fellow stalker who is employed by the local trader, you're tasked with a few missions and he also helps you set up your PDA where your sole mission that was already there is to "Kill Strelok". Who is Strelok? Well, play the game and find him, dammit.\n\nThe story is really intricate, but let's shift away from that as it really boils down from going to area to area and accepting missions, sidequests, fighting in an arena for money, trading and selling goods, collecting weapons, ammo, etc. The story is really good by the way, but I just wanna talk about the gameplay. It's an FPS, duh. It's not like other FPS games, though, as it's more open in your choices, there are dialog options, albeit limited, and you can swap armor. It's not exactly an RPG, however, as there is no leveling system employed. And it's not a full on horror game as it's not terribly scary, there's just some really bizarre creatures that you run into. Most of the time, however, you'll be shooting other humans.\n\nThe atmosphere is grimy, grey, and at some points, yellow, but not in a filtered Fallout 3 kind of way. It's natural lighting. Well, technically artificial, but you get the point. Buildings are destroyed, people speak about staying alive, playing guitars around a fire pit, smoking, laughing, drinking. The atmosphere is really cool with both the characters and how they interact and the world, itself.\n\nPripryat shines in this game, the devs clearly took the time to research the city, the blueprints of the city, and I believe they visited the city as well, considering the devs are Ukrainians. As the devs are Ukrainians, that means the spoken language is accurate, the facial designs are accurate, etc. These guys knew what they were doing and they also did the scientific research as far as radiation pockets and possible effects of an expanding radiated zone.\n\nVery good game.\n\n9.2/10","September 15, 2015","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, you might be the "Marked One", but that simply means you are in the wrong neighborhood.\n\nThe amount of things to do is enormous. You can hunt stat-modifying artifacts, assassinate other stalkers, search for particular items, you name it. The quests are randomly generated, giving lots of ways to build yourself in the world. And once you're ready to step into the Chernobyl NPP, you'll find a wealth of possible conclusions, all dependant on how you play the game.\n\nA game that is a true milestone, unique in every way, replayable with mods or vanilla, in a very interesting and painstakingly reconstructed world.","November 27, 2013","true","110.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/realskeleton/recommended/4500/","realskeleton","jc helmet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/realskeleton/","460 products in account","First to set the scene, the game is based within an area called ‘The Zone’. The area around the Chernobyl power plant before it leaked radioactivity all over the place. This Zone became a gold mine for explorers because of Artefacts, strange pieces of rock, debris or organic life that show incredibly weird properties. Selling them to scientists can make a fortune, if you survive the harsh life in the Zone. Mutants, bandits and warring factions wander the zone so lone stalkers tend not to make it that far. Already from reading this summery of setting you’re probably thinking ‘How are you supposed to survive all this!?’ Well if it wasn’t a challenge it wouldn’t be fun to play, right?\n\nSoC is a game where you need to think tactically to survive. You can’t run in guns blazing because the AI also thinks smart, and will take you down in a few shots.\nThat’s another thing to note, guns work properly. Most FPS games have the main character able to take hundreds of bullet wounds whilst enemies are effectively made of paper maché, not Stalker. If you head shot an enemy, they will die instantly. If you get suffer a head shot  you will die instantly. This is what makes gun fights so fun. The AI is smart, they will move towards you whilst trying to stay covered. Sometimes the AI won’t even try to get to you if they know they will die trying, they will wait out your patience till you make a mistake. Fun right? A good feature with this, especially for stealthy tactics, is a little counter on your HUD. The counter tells you the number of humanoids in your area. It’s always fun creepy around in the dark only for the counter to suddenly beep up to 5 and you realise you’re not in a good situation.\n\nBut the counter only tells of humanoids, Stalker is set in an irradiated zone so of course there are plenty of monsters to really shake you up in the pitch black nights of The Zone. You get your basic dogs, rats and boars. All bite and bark but simple to deal with. Then you get grotesque Psuedodogs and Psuedogiants, monsters of huge endurance who could knock you a fare distance. Then you get the truly terrifying creatures. Snorks are the mutated bodies of soldiers, still wearing their old torn uniforms and a gasmask burnt onto their face. This is not even all the listed mutated horrors in the game, but suffice to say the game makes it pretty clear that you won’t have a good time running around in the dark. Cause if it isn’t an ambush of bandits you are bound to run into, it’ll be some horrible monster and in the dark you will end up paranoid.\n\nStalker is a brutal but fun game. You could be hiding in a building sniping military soldiers to get through to the next area, only to find yourself out gunned by the soldiers as you struggle to hold your position. You’d think yourself screwed, only to be saved by a random Psuedogiant who decides the military are making too much noise and kills them all. You think you’re alive but now you have an angry giant who doesn’t like you much either. The game can be random and tough; sometimes you will die but it’s fun to die. It’s fun to see a group of soldiers in the distance and plan your attack. S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a survival horror I’d recommend to everyone because it has everything you want from a survival horror and more.","December 13, 2012","true","13.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","2"

In stalker you have an inventory system very similar to resident evil 4 where it’s a grid and each item will appear as a diagram and will take up space on the grid only you can stack all items, there’s weight limit with the inventory system: once you’re above the weight limit your stamina will drop extremely quickly if it will let you sprint. You have various suits and artefacts that you can find which all have different effects on the player such as resistance to radiation, reduction to how much you’ll bleed out when you are shot, an increase in stamina etc. You have a hunger and thirst system which you’ll need to use drinks and food when an icon appears on the right side of the screen, you’ll have to drink vodka or use certain medical equipment for when you have radiation poising and you’ll have to use bandages and med kits to stop you from bleeding out which both of these are notified by an icon that will appear on the right side of the screen. You can also trade items with various NPCs. There are also various enemy factions which you’ll come across in this game.\n\nIt’s extremely difficult to say what’s to like about this game but one thing I can say is that this game is strangely compelling but it comes with a few glaring issues and problems.\n\nStalker has some of the worst gunplay I’ve ever seen in any shooting game, most of the time you can’t hit what you’re aiming at, regardless of the distance between you and what you’re shooting at, regardless of whether you’re stood still or moving, regardless of your posture, regardless of whether you’re spraying or using burst fire or single shots and for the most part regardless of what weapon you’re using. However if you turn on the crosshair, unless the gun has a scope, hip firing is significantly more accurate than using iron sights,well when you put it on paper you are more accurate firing at a wall using iron sights from a distance but this magically disappears when shooting at an enemy, and hip firing is generally more effective against enemies and it also doesn’t help that the iron sights are horrible in this game and seriously get in the way. Even if you are going for the “realistic” way: DON’T, because iron sights are useless in this game (they’re better in the two sequels though)\n\nThe combat is just far too inconsistent in this game. In most games the enemies can hit you most if not every single time and the damage output is consistent and varies game to game, in Stalker the enemies have a completely random chance of hitting you, they also have a random damage output, so sometimes you’ll get just a scratch but others you’ll die instantly. A perfect examples of this is where I had to defend an area from a bandit raid, I was about 50 feet away from the enemies, they seemed to be unable to hit me until one of them suddenly and randomly did and I died instantly. You can go from an enemy noticing you and killing you instantly in one shot, then reload a save but this time that enemy might not be able to hit anything even when you are banzai charging towards them with the knife, which I have done before. Your success all comes down to retrying until you succeed because you got lucky, it doesn’t ever feel like skills matter in this game, and it’s, not like reaction time matters or anything in this it’s just ridiculous. There is the argument of “it’s trying to be realistic” no game is properly realistic, none, not even something such as Arma 3. I guess quite a fair bit in reality with wars can be down to luck but nothing like in this game.\n\nwhen you reload a save, the enemies go back to their starting positions and sometimes their starting positions are behind you and you’ll get killed right away when you’ve loaded a save.\n\nThe movement in this game is almost headache inducing it does this really sickening head bobbing when you move, it sways to the bottom left and right really quickly.\n\nI’ve had an extremely difficult time deciding whether to recommend this game or not, I guess it all comes down to whether you think you can put up with these problems and I’m only recommending this game because I don’t hate it enough to not recommend it. Though after several playthroughs I like it significantly more than the first time I played this game.\n\nI have played this game with some mods but to be honest, you should just play the vanilla game because the mods don't really make much difference or properly improve the game, they all pretty much update the graphics, improve one or two features, overlook some of the issues and then add new ones on top, a lot of people say “oh it fixes all of the bugs”, well I can tell you I’ve played quite a bit of the vanilla game and I’ve NEVER come across a bug. There’s also a trend that’s been going around for a while with games such as the Stalker games, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and onward, where people think playing it with mods is better and they become complete elitist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and have a massive go at people for playing the vanilla game and look down on them as if they are sub human. You can’t just ignore all of the problems with the vanilla game and say “oh but with this mod it’s great”, that’s like taking some really crappy games such as Ride to hell Retribution and that calming playing it with mods is good, and the vanilla game matters the most. ♥♥♥♥ this trend, and all of the elitist people who support it.","June 12, 2015","true","64.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The word was the graphics were horrible and the bugs were rampant.  I went straight for the user-end patch that offered a complete graphical upgrade, bugfixes, that sort of thing.\n\nStalkers are basically looters inside a series of zones polluted by Chernobyl's alternate timeline fallout.  Your character was discovered amongst a pile of bodies outside a military truck, and you are nursed back to health.  The only thing you know about yourself is that you have a PDA with a single message:  kill Strelok.\n\nSoC isn't actually that big of a game.  Each zone has your assortment of bandits, mutants, and factions that you can ally with or open fire upon.  Some encounters are random, dynamic, but some are pre-scripted.  The group of loners (your starting faction) that are defending themselves against bandits in the west end of a zone called Garbage will always be doing so no matter how many times you visit, and should any friendlies fall, they'll have randomized replacements next time.\n\nI'll be up front with you - the story is gibberish.  I'm not even sure how much of the actual information was missing, but all of it was presented very, very badly.  Nonsensical flashbacks appear sometimes, but it's clear they had a sequel in mind to explain everything.  That may be the case, but having seen that mechanic plenty of times before, they still half-♥♥♥♥♥ its implementation.\n\nThe combat is challenging.  There are multiple types of ammunition, some armor piercing and others not.  Ironsights, even patched are essentially useless.  Bullets go wherever the ♥♥♥♥ they want, and you will waste entire clips trying to get ONE headshot that is EXACTLY within your sights.  Scoped headshots on the other hand are right on the money, but it'll be a little while before you can get either a scope or a weapon that already has one.  Part of the unofficial patch is supposed to improve the enemy AI.  Since I haven't heard anything about it failing to do so, I don't even want to think of how bad it must have been because it's STILL broken.  Enemies are obnoxiously perfect shots (you take extra damage from headshots) and yet somehow you can crouch and flank them and they will be completely oblivious - sometimes even ignoring you after you start shooting.  Should you sneak around and flank, frequently they'll pour whole clips into concrete walls in the direction of where you USED to be.  In any case, get used to reloading previous saves - it will happen many, many times.  Especially on the last mission where the enemies are downright CHEAP.\n\nI'm not sure if sleep actually matters, but it's a way to pass the night.  Food matters, but there's so much of it that it isn't an intrusive mechanic.  Weapons deteriorate in condition but it happens so slowly that it doesn't matter.   Storage is a bit of an issue - always store your stuff in blue boxes (never store stuff in "stashes").  The inventory system in the game has strict encumberance, so if you're a loot ♥♥♥♥♥ it will drive you bonkers.  Take my advice and only sell artifacts after you've gotten some starter cash.\n\nThe weapon system is broad, with some degree of customization, but the truth is it's kind of wasted on the game.  It's just too short.  That's not to say there aren't things to do, but if you do minimal sidequesting, the whole game takes you about 20 hours, and it's hard to say how much of that time included reloads.  Being that there are two sequels, I see no reason to explore.  Most of the side missions have terrible rewards.\n\nThe game has great atmosphere.  It's nothing like Metro's polish, but it does the job, especially in the underground areas.  Mutants are creepy as **** and you'll always have some anticipation about what new kind you'll discover.  I feel inclined to point out that only one reload was from a mutant death.  The other several dozen reloads were from human enemies, so make of that what you will.","October 6, 2014","true","19.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/4500/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on January 28, 2009\n\nWhen I first heard of STALKER, it was the graphics and spooky atmosphere that impressed me. That was over 5 years ago. Since then it has undergone a convoluted and long development process, which left many to believe the game was dead. Well, the finished product is pretty good, despite some bugs and missing features.\n\nYou play the role of marked one, in a subtle and chilling story about genetics and radiation experiments in the Chernobyl disaster zone. The place is full of mutants and warring bandits, loners, and factions, and is one of the most atmospheric games I've played.\n\nGraphics- The technical visuals are quite solid, as the engine was updated since they originally started development. Shadows cast during storms and by lights stand out in particular. The draw distance is decent enough to make you feel like you're actually in the world, and the animations and effects are quite good.\n\nSound- The sound design in this game is top notch, you can hear every clap of thunder or rustle in the grass, but the gunfire is what really stands out. You can hear every distant shot fired at you and the sound of bullets whizzing by inches from your head.\n\nGameplay- This game has some really incredible survival mechanics. You are forced to scavenge for ammo, food, water, and other survival essentials, or buy them at inflated prices from the few merchants in "The Zone". Your inventory allows you to carry a reasonable amount of supplies, but you will get tired quickly if carrying too much. The game does not rely on any traditional RPG stats, but you can improve your chances of survival by finding, stealing, or buying better armor, from simple kelvar-cloth hybrids to full military exoskeletons. You can also obtain a wide breadth of real world guns to fit your playstyle, and they fire a variety of ammunition types, adding another gameplay dynamic. Finally you can find "artifacts" out in the zone's many radiation anomalies which can reduce the damage you take from radtiation, boost your health, and increase your stamina, among other things. They also sell for a pretty penny, if you prefer not to be irradiated by artifacts.\n\nThe zone itself is an interesting and varied wasteland, with some interesting characters and fedgling game dynamics like random bandit attacks on stalker camps (which you have no obligation to assist) and faction alliances.\nHowever, the game world is rather linear and segmented, it is a far cry from a true open game world like in the elder scrolls series. Also, the while the main quest and random encounters and factions battles are compelling enough, the minor quests given to you by traders and others feel really generic, like an after thought to the game. They are entirely random and never run out, unlike other games, in their defense. The factions feel like a remnant from alpha- they hardly ever leave their bases and go on raids (except the military) and they have very limited reactions to your actions beyond friend or enemy.\n\nThe game has been patched and is no longer the buggy release I was told about a while ago.\n\nValue- The game can take anywhere from 25-40 hours to complete, but I would advise you to take your time, and explor to find the really rare weapons and gear, and meet all the interesting people. I probably spent closer to 65 hours playing it, which is not bad for a game i got for $5 on steam. It is a good deal even for the current going price of $20.\n\nOverall, I would say try this game if a spooky survival shooter with some really original ideas sounds appealing to you. I am excited to see how clear sky plays in comparison, and what else GSC has up their sleeves.","December 31, 2013","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What makes it great is not what you get whilst you play it, but rather  the eerie industrial feeling you get after you've completed it.\n\nIt's definitely a 35 hour game. And you'll know whether you like it within 8 hours. It's definitely not a game where you can stop for a few days, play some other game and then resume it. You have to play it in one go.\n\nThere are several endings. I think 5 wishmaker endings and 2 real endings to the game. The wishmaker endings are based on how you played the game right from the start.\n\nA lot of reading, but I reckon it added production value. I couldn't imagine S.T.A.L.K.E.R with characters speaking directly to me. It just wouldn't have been the same.\n\nMemorable moments:\n- Some invisible monster in a dark underground tunnel.\n- Some area where the whole screen goes yellowish and you see apparitions.\n- Chernobyl, obviously ... and the abandoned city that surrounds it.\n- The end talk about C-Consciousness.","November 17, 2011","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

It manages to create a living, breathing and believable world, with beautifully decaying industrial complexes and a marvellously captured, distinctly Soviet architectural style. Exploration of the Zone is an exquisite and sometimes genuinely scary experience, as is the unique scavenging gameplay. Too bad the quests are extremely generic and boring, failing to provide an incentive to stay in the Zone longer. Too bad the storyline is messy and shamefully chooses to provide cheesy explanations for what worked much better as a mystery. Too bad the endgame is truly dreadful, switching from free roaming exploration to frustratingly hard, corridor based shooting. There is still greatness in Stalker, even if there isn’t perfection.

The description is accurate if not complete, because this game is a lot more, I would add sandbox and exploration to the mix at least. I will come back to this a bit later in the review.\n\nYou start the game in a rather nondescript way, you were left for dead in a field and wake up in the fringes of the "zone" with no memory. By investigating and exploring the "Zone" , a large exclusion perimeter of roughly 30 sq kilometers around Chernobyl which have been sealed off by the Ukrainian army, you hope to regain your memory and discover the place secrets. The "zone" is very dangerous, not only because of all the bandits , trigger happy military, mutants  and mercenaries roaming the place, but also the "natural" phenomenons called anomalies that will shreds you to pieces, burn you alive or electrify you depending of the type if you step on the wrong place. There is offcourse the radiations areas you must avoid in order to survive. The zone contains lot of treasures to find however , mysterious artifacts that can be very valuable and "caches" of gear left over by other lesser fortunate stalker which you have to find.\n\nThose treasures and caches give an incentiv for you to explore the «zone» desolate landscape with it's abandonned factories and villages following the 1986 disaster. The people behind the game made a really good work depicting the zone and people who grew up in the 80's and 90s and have seen reports from the Chernobyl disaster in the medias will recognise several landmarks , like the famous  wheel of Pritpjat or the Chernobyl plant itself. The SGS Gameworld team did an excellent work at rendering the place in a very realistic way and at time I marveled of the landscapes of the ruined area in all their sadness. All in all the atmosphere in this game is topnotch and it makes even the most mundane generated quest an experience as you get to explore all those places , abandoned villages and ruined factories with the leftover of old trucks and cars there and here , a sad but beautiful reminder of the madness and destructiveness of human civilization.\n\nThe inhabitants of the zone are no less fascinating, and not all are enemies bend on killing you. many are stalkers like you or mercenaries hoping to find the mysterious but dangerous riches the zone has to offer. At night you might you might encounter small groups gathering around small fires telling stories , laughing (in russian) or playing the guitare. This gives an human dimension to the people of the place, stalkers like you trying to make it.\n\nThe story in the game is also very good if not always very clear, especially in those days when we're  tea spooned feed in other games plotwise, S.T.A.L.K.E.R let you do a lot of guesswork on what is really going on, and the answers you get from the plot usually set up more questions. Even the discoveries you make in the game are up to discussion about their meanings. Having finished the game which has no less than two distinct ending, and several versions of those ending depending of your gamestyle and decisions, I personally loved it but it's probably not everyones cup  of tea if you desire a more traditional tale with a “everybody lived happily ever after” end.  It must be said that the game has been partly inspired by the Sovietic art film directed by Stratovsky, Stalker taking on question as existentialism and human potential ,  you will find many elements from the movie in the game although it goes less into philosophy . Just like it's cinematic counterpart S.T.A.L.K.E.R isn't easy to gauge, let's just say it's a great experience gamewise.\n\nThe gameplay in S.T.A.L.K.E.R isn't very varied, but what it does, it does well. We've gone into the sandbox and exploration part of the game, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a competant first person shooter in it's own right, I found the enemies to be challenging and at time rather smart, hiding from me and trying to flank me or throwing grenades at me when possible. During the game you discover many different guns and rifles, both of Russian and Western fabrication. Although I'm not a gun specialist, I found the weapon system to be rather realistic and entertaining, with the weapons themselves true copies of the originals, mostly weapons dating from the 70 to the 90's, something you'd probably find if you were stuck in a postsovietic zone in the near future.\n\nThe quests , especially the generated ones,  can be rather bland but the great atmosphere of the game saved it from being a shore. While the main story was quite entertaining and really catched my interest through the game. It must be said the game could be rather creepy if not directly scary at time while you explore abandoned depots teaming with dangerous mutants and hidden enemies in the dark. I was a bit annoyed toward the end of the game when I was rather suddently forced to change my gamestyle from “crawling and shooting” which I had done in the majority of the game to “running and shooting” as I had helicopters shooting at me , leaving me no chance to challenge them. Other annoyances would be the bugs, although I played the “complete Mod” which eliminated many of them , I had a few crashes , but nothing gamebreaking.\n\nAll in all I can only recommend this game (which I would recommend to play with a Mod to eliminate the bugs), a competant shooter with a good if a bit convoluted plot  and a great atmosphere than very few games can measure themselves with. This game is quite old (from 2003) but has a vibrant community who deliver new mods and addons to improve the original product to this day.\n","May 31, 2014","true","77.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Gameplay is good, combat is phenomenal and so immersive, AI is good but can't take cover, throw grenades and so on. Story is great, multiple endings. Music is fantastic, sounds are beautiful, but limited. Not much voice acting, except for combat, where it's hilarious cause they speak russian and I don't.\n\nGreat storyline, and immersiveness. Has proper multiple endings, including 3 endings which you can fail in and obviously this ends the game earlier. Super immersiveness, great environment, ambient sounds and okay stealth system. My only major problem is no fast travel, so if you wanna go back to earlier areas you have to walk there, which takes like an hour if you have reached the Duty base.\n\nAnother problem is that you can't fix items, so if your weapons starts jamming or your suit is damaged, you can't repair 'em and you have to buy new ones, and that's super expensive.\n\nLovely game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joaten/recommended/4500/","Joaten","Yung Joaten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joaten/","81 products in account","I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\n\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.\n\nBut one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.\n\nIn a sense we've come to our nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.\n\nThis note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds."\n\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\n\nWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.\n\nNow is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\n\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.\n\nThe marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\n\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?"\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.\n\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating "for whites only."\n\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.\n\nNo, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.\n\nGo back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.\n\nI say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal."\n\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.

It was stuck in development hell from 2000 to 2007, mostly in part because of the fact that an entire new engine had to be made for it that Quake or Unreal couldn't do.\n\nThis game is noted for its very good ambience and portrayal of environments, being very detailed. While the textures are not exactly great and you can tell the game is dated by playing vanilla, there are mods out there to improve on what's already there.","August 6, 2015","true","74.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/recommended/4500/","Saleck","Saleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/","650 products in account","This game was in development for about 7 years and came out of nowhere in 2007, GSC Game World's last game series and will probably be the only thing they are remembered for.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is a First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing / Survival Horror game set in a sci-fi alternate reality inside the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and its Exclusion Zone. People risk their lives sneaking into "The Zone" in order to retrieve rare and precious artifacts to sell on the black market.\n\nYou play the role of The Marked One. After being rescued from a freak accident and suffering from amnesia, you're placed in a harsh world of bandits, anomalies, dangerous killer mutants and the Ukrainian military tasked with keeping people out of the Zone. People around the Zone dream of breaching the Zones inner defenses and as rumour has it, unlimited wealth and artifacts await the first person to do so.\n\nThe story involves you travelling to many places around the zone including abandoned warehouses, labratories, millitary baracks and power stations. The game swaps its pacing around fairly often; dealing with humans in hostile environments to having to infiltrate areas infested with deadly mutants that will tear you to shreds in seconds.\n\nAnd they WILL tear you to bits. Most games cast you as some kind of bullet sponge able to survive multiple shotgun blasts to the face. You try running head first into a gun fight in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and your insides will be decorating the scenery before you can pick out a target to shoot.\n\nThis vunerability of your character greatly enhances the fear and survival aspects to S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. You will need to think about eating and drinking on a regular basis to avoid death and keep your strength up. You'll need bandages to stop yourself bleeding to death, You'll need Vodka to flush radiation from your system and you'll need to really focus on aiming and timing shots as one shot to the head will finish both enemies and you off in no time.\n\nThe artifacts around the Zone will also help you. Most artifacts come with both positive and negative effects that can help you survive. Some rare artifacts only have good effects to them but you'll really have to keep an eye out for them. Artifact effects include health regeneration at a cost to being very vunerable to bleeding out when hit, protection from the numerous anomalies around that will kill you if you get too close and many more. You can mix and match artifacts as you see fit.\n\nThe game also tells you how visible you are to other enemies and even how much sound you're making when moving and reloading your guns. Enemies can hear you so reloading whilst right next to an unsuspecting bloodsucker might be the last move you make.\n\nThe game also has multiple endings but don't think that the ending you find right away is the... 'correct' one :)\n\nThis game took me completely by surprise back when it first came out. I had not heard of it until the day it was released and picked up the collector's edition on a whim. I'm so glad I did as this game is one of the most terrifying shooter role-playing games I've ever encountered. Highly recommended.\n\nP.S. You can also use the STALKER COMPLETE modification to fix bugs, add HD textures and tweak the gameplay slightly to balance out some other issues.","July 13, 2012","true","108.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
