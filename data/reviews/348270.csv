I wish it was a system where you could pick a reply and based on how that reply is weighted, your attack would resolve or you would lose points. But it just lets you pick the same options that are not clear what they do. There's very little substance to this game. It should be free if the only point it wants to make is, "see you fight people on the internet like it's a supremely crappy RPG or something!".

Like I said in the review, I threw money at something and expected a good game, so I just wanted to restate that I am reviewing based on what the game is, not how dissapointed I was.\n\nTL;DR:\nRepetitive and boring, was hoping for a free roam where you venture the internet in a midevil themed world. Sadly, I just threw money at the screen when I saw it was about the internet and you got to fight trolls. Would be positive if it was free, because it seems like a F2P.\n\nFor the $6 I paid for it, and I was stupid enough to see that it had something to do with the internet and then proceeded to throw my money at the computer without doing research. I had some fun at first. I loved the concept of battling trolls without actually battling them so you wouldn't lose real sanity.\n\nI was dissapointed to find out that trolls are the only things you fight. On top of that the dialogue is very repetitive. I was hoping to fight other things on the internet like feminazis, bronies, furries, but all depending on what fandom your character is in if he is even in one in the first place. For example, if you say that your character is a brony, then you would most likely only fight trolls. If your an anti brony, you would focus on bronies, while fighting others. I was also hoping for a free roam element where you could go to amazon which would be the merchants where you could buy items to fix up your sanity levels or your PC. It could also have quest too.\n\nSadly, this game is just battling a few type of trolls, from the popular trolls to the rabid trolls. It gets boring real fast and doesn't really have much replay value. Character customization is really bland, and you only get to choose from a paladin, mage, rouge, and an archer. They all have their own perks, but it doesn't really matter what class you choose because the games pretty easy. You can use parry to regenerate sanity and almost never fail the action.\n\nOn top of all of this, according to the disscussions, the developer is calling people who dislike the game, "trolls". I hate trolls, but I guess that i'm one of them in the eyes of the developer.\n\nI suppose it's my fault for not doing research on the game and throwing my money at it. Although since I did purchase it, I thought that I might as well tell people and my friends my opinions on it. Overall I give it a 2/10.\n\nHeres how I did my point system thingamigig for the few that care.\n~ Points start at 5\n~ +4 for concept\n~ -4 for gameplay\n~ -2 for developer being a ♥♥♥♥\n~ -1 for graphics (I really ♥♥♥♥ing hate pixels, but they dont effect gameplay much for me.)\n\nNOTE FOR DEVELOPER:\nI do not hate you or your game, because hate is a strong word. I dislike your game and do not personally know you so I cannot judge you. I am unaware if developers can delete reviews, but if you do then that would cause me to dislike you for being one of those developers who cannot take critisism.","February 27, 2015","false","0.3"," 960 of 1,230 people (78%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","78","960","1","52","36"

I think the idea is great. As a proof of concept for a starting point to work on a more fleshed out game this could work very well. As it is though, I feel that fails both as a game and as satire.\n\nIt's very short. I'm talking a few minutes here. There's too much reliance on a random number generator and after a few tries I just got to the point of not caring what I picked because it all seemed just random anyway. There's also really not a lot to it. It's just Defender picks one of 4 responses to troll, hit enter, roll the RNG, rinse, repeat. That's pretty much it. The same responses tend to show up too so it won't take very long to start seeing repeats of what you already saw.\n\nI'm willing to make allowances for games to be shorter, cruder and have less meat to them if their main point is satire, DLC Quest being a great example of this, but in this case it's just too short and too rudimentary. I really wish there were more to it but there's not.\n\nOn the satire end it seems to fall flat too. I think the combination of the satiring the White Knight complex of the so called 'Social Justice Warriors' being too subtle (a quick glance at the forums shows that many people didn't get that they were being satired and not celebrated) along with the opposing side always being portrayed as trolls for the sake of trolling just makes the whole thing not work.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, both sides take this subject matter and their role in it way too seriously and could well do with a mirror being held up. While true trolls exist, most people who get involved in these internet crusades do believe they are in the 'right' so not having the ability to choose both sides as a hero (in their own mind) seems to have the effect of making the whole thing come off as a SJW propaganda piece to many. Which it's not; having to 'retreat to a place where everyone agrees with you' is not exactly a quality to be celebrated but it seems many people don't get that far and just write the game off.\n\nIf you have to explain your satire then it really hasn't done its job.\n\nMostly though I just wanted more game. More to do. More from the opposition's perspective. Maybe planning and strategizing outside of the forum 'combat'. Something to make the game play last more than 5 minutes and be less random. Just more. The seed is there but it needs much more than this.\n\nI'd love it if we could get updates or this could get much more fleshed out but as it stands I really hesitate to recommend it at any price. There are 99 cent mobile games that give much more game play than this and if you want Gamergate satire you're probably better off searching Google for an opinion piece article. It would take you longer to read than the time you would spend playing this game anyhow.","March 1, 2015","false","1.2"," 193 of 235 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","193","235","4","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/348270/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1846 products in account","Review composed for http://www.apochs.net.\n\nIn recent years, debating on-line in the name of "justice" has not only become a norm throughout the internet, but also the center of hot button topics in pop culture and news organizations. Of course, it was only a matter of time before someone tackled the concept of keyboard warriors and turned it into a game. Enter: Social Justice Warriors. Nonadecimal Creative present this casual independent RPG/Simulation title that pits one of these social justice individuals against hordes of trolls looking to wreak havoc in r/. You are the voice of sanity in this offering, but if is as positive a message about society today, or does it just paint itself to be nobler than thou in the most insulting of ways possible?\n\nAs stated, you take on the role of your every day social justice bringer behind a computer screen. You take on various trolls, largely ignorant or rabbid ones, utilizing health and mana in the form of sanity and reputation. Each are affected by your opponents choice of words, or even by your own actions like a direct "lunge" at someone's character. The more you assert how right you are over your opponent, the more the Social Justice Knights, mythical beings that represent sanity and reason in the game's internet world, smile upon you. The better they look upon you, the more they alter the battle at hand, positively or negatively. But, once one of your bars are depleted, the game is lost, and your name enters the Hall of Justice for all to see, leaving you to start anew through standard Rogue-Like rules.\n\nWhile Social Justice Warriors stands as a great idea in theory, the execution greatly misses its own point. First, you need to understand the goal of this game. The following is a quote taken directly from the title's Steam store page under the "About" section:\n\nSocial Justice Warriors expresses frustration with how people use divisive labels – like “SJW” and “troll” – to discredit and silence each other. No matter what social values you have, attacking and ridiculing other people not only fails to achieve progress but has an additional effect of escalating the conflict while exhausting your patience and eroding your reputation.\n\nIn the actual game itself, you play the role of someone who is meant to support the greater good, taking on all trolls in your path to do so. Your foe, who looks exactly like you, says something one might consider stupid, which, from my time with this game, was mostly about women or women's rights, to which you have to point out why the troll is wrong. However, this is largely an opinion-based system, and not all the things the trolls say are entirely inaccurate. The same goes for your characters legitimacy as far as statements go. This goes on until the arguments change for a brief amount of time, such as tackling racism, before just shooting right back into inequality with the ladies once more for no reason other than probably running out of talking points on said topic.\n\nThe game is also played through the use of four different attacks, which the type of move is named differently upon the choice of your standard stock Final Fantasy characters (and just as similar sound track) ranging from Rogue, Mage, Paladin, and Cleric. Each one also offers different incentives with additional random knights appearing to do things like give you a riddle, attack the opponent, or bestow some sanity or reputation to keep you alive. There is a necromancer, but he's basically worthless outside of giving you one last shot you won't really benefit much from other than one more shot at the troll who's opinion differs from yours.\n\nThere's also a level system, though it seems absolutely pointless as you stand as much of a chance taking on and defeating an enemy a few levels higher than you compared to one a level or two lower than you. This leads to another issue, which ends up being balancing, and an ineffective combat system all together. In the games I played trying to figure out what attack best worked with what comment, I would lose after four, maybe five trolls, the latter if I was lucky. However, while taking a break in this review, I went ahead and played as the Rogue and, for the sake of curiosity, just kept spamming the enter key over and over. By doing so, not only did my character take down a foe six levels higher with four hits, but this was the longest battle waged, having reached the tenth troll. This means nine enemies, four of which sub-bosses, were decimated by spamming one single button, and the only reason the character was defeated was because the Troll Warlord boss knocked down nearly all of the three-fourths filled sanity bar in one shot, leaving very little chance for my warrior to survive.\n\nAs far as the gameplay itself goes, you basically just choose a text prompt until you win or loose. While this aspect does stick with the traditional J-RPG template, but, the game is literally just that. You can take the high road with facts, block, share your foe's statement to your followers, or just attack by degrading yourself to insults, repeat until you defeat the enemy, immediately fight the next. Having a choice of topics to fight for so players can choose something they may be passionate about, or perhaps choosing their own text instead of just an attack name with the next scripted set of lines coming up, would have allowed a little more variety outside of staring at the eight-bit zombie-looking slacker you don't care anything about. Maybe if you could customize him (her?) beyond the name input would help build the slightest bond to your character.\n\nBut the final nail on the coffin for Social Justice Warriors is the inability to play as the troll. You are committed to just being the good guy in a game about opinions, meaning you should be allowed to play devil's advocate as well. This would further push the theory that we're all just spinning our wheels in the mud by bickering about these topics to assert who's ♥♥♥♥♥ (literal or metaphorical) is bigger, all the while landing attacks that basically counter the point of your character. If anything, this title airs more on the side of preachy by focusing only on the positive, helpful, or beneficial aspects of the arguments that your character alone makes, and tearing down any the opponent might have that actually may be factual or far more grounded in reality than our faceless main character. Even the most spiteful on-line arguments can sometimes have a middle ground, one specific thing people can agree on to end things amicably, which isn't any sort of option in this game either. Instead, we are left with a "I'm right and that's that" debate anyone stuck in a religious discussion will immediately find themselves wanting nothing more to do with this title.\n\nSocial Justice Warriors offers very little to the player overall. The gameplay is weak and as basic as it can possibly get, there's no real variety whatsoever except the same animations on a loop (though the troll slamming the monitor onto the desk is humorous the first few times you win a fight), and, what's more, it kind of misses it's own point. You could argue that Nonadecimal Creative is trying to show even the most well intentioned keyboard warrior is, in fact, an internet troll or bully him/herself. After seeing the depths some of these people go to pick a fight in the name of "justice", even when there's no need for it, they have a point. However, the game isn't presented this way. Instead it's a boring, depressing to look at game or incredibly basic RPG fundamentals, some of which are pointless, and generic topical battles you more than likely won't give a damn about at all. A few plays in and you'll start to wonder what exactly the developer was trying to achieve with this title that is so minimalistic that it actually loses it's gimmicky replay value after your first few deaths.","March 2, 2015","false","2.9"," 109 of 143 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","109","143","4","1"

So as a playable version of internet arguments, 10/10, extremely realistic. But there's a whole lot more to this game than you can tell from screenshots and comments.\n\nFor starters, despite playing as an SJW and battling a variety of trolls, the game doesn't pick a side as much as you'd think. Yes, the narration describes you as a valiant force of good against internet ne'er-do-wells, but it's so over the top at times that it's clearly not expecting to be taken completely seriously.\n\nThe actual depiction of the trolls does a lot to help the balance. While they're helpfully labelled 'Rabid Troll' or 'Popular Troll', they actually look just like you, an ambiguously-sprited person tapping away at a keyboard. And your actions in, erm, 'battle', can sometimes mirror their's, since you have the option to always try to maintain the moral high ground, or lose your patience (and reputation) and start mudslinging.\n\nThere's a lot of variety in the game. You can choose four different classes, each with unique play-styles that coincide with different areas on the internet. The Paladin uses Twitter, the Cleric uses Reddit, and so on and so forth. And each has a multitude of choices in conflicts. Try to logically defeat the troll, or wreck their reputation until nobody takes them seriously, or take a second to regain your composure. Each of these choices has their own impact on your own Sanity and Reputation, which act as dual-health bars.\n\nThat's not to say the game plays fair, at all. My biggest complaint is the amount of sheer randomness you can encounter if things don't go your way. If your sanity or reputation ever get too high, any troll can instantly use a powerful attack and wreck them. A rumour or exposed phone number, and you're back to square one. If left alone, they'll call upon the dark forces of the web, and even though they'll occasionally get a reassuring answer of 'NOT YOUR PERSONAL ARMY', you stand the risk of total online annihilation. And every once in a while they just completely disregard any move you make. It's not a very consistent game to play.\n\nBut the game puts a message above the gameplay, and the message is good. If you somehow managed to get high sanity/reputation, you transform into the Social Justice Champion (yes, I cringed a little writing that,) and how does this mighty warrior fight their battles? Well, all your combat options are replaced with things like 'Listen to their concerns', 'Defend opponent from attackers' and 'Propose a compromise', and the goal changes from 'Try to ruin the troll' to 'Acknowledge their point of view and try to raise their sanity/reputation until they no longer feel the need to argue with you. I don't see how anyone who isn't a genuine troll can't see this as a pretty good message to portray in what I expected to be a silly game about internet fights.\n\nIn short, it's not an incredible game, but as a representation of arguments on the internet, it's accurate in a way that's comedic but not shallow. Plus, if you took one glance at the game, decided it was 'pro-SJW propaganda' and immediately started frothing at the mouth, thank you for confirming on a slightly meta level just how accurate the game can be.","July 9, 2015","true","16.0"," 55 of 69 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","55","69","9","0"

The irony is so incredibly sweet because as part of the game mechanics you can choose to run smear campaigns against anyone who opposes you, additionally you have the lie and use social media in order to spread false truths. Zoe Quinn doxxing herself anyone? Or how about Anita Sarkessian and Brianna Wu's fake death threats?\nWith the wider context out of the way the game itself is a joke. Four characters who all play identically with so little dialogue you'll blow through all of it in 30 minutes, to show just how lazy the developers are; They reused their basic pixel characters over and over again for every single enemy in the game. As for the gameplay it boils to picking one of four options and that is it. What this travesty of a title proves and what depression Quest then further compounded is that a politcal agenda is not enough to make a game, you need to learn to program, create art, design, compose music, and of course be able to write. You will see poor examples of all of these skills here.

I get the message the developer was going for, but that message is hollow in the reality of post August 2014. People have had their lives ruined, pushed into suicide, and even nearly murdered by cop via misinformation. You can't keep going down that both these "sides" are somehow equal in their personal failures, and while I do agree with the meessage of meditating on one's actions (something I had to learn the hard way), that's not what the game ends up saying to many.\n\nThe way its structured, it says that the "trolls" always win. Their victory is inevitable, and thus they are right for it. Inserting dialog about actual issues that have resulted in death and ♥♥♥♥ threats simply for being brought up just lets them insert themselves more into this, and they see the game's message as satire ONLY aimed at "SJWs." They live in a culture where their hatred and ignorance is not isolated, it is shared and supported, almost coming off as cult like. They don't get the message.\n\nMore egotistical people also won't, more likely to get angry by the portray of their beliefs, while others will just feel like they were talked down to by someone who doesn't understand their personal experiences at all. They don't know the pain or suffering they had to go through. They don't understand why they've had to fight for so long just to start a dialog about their suffering.\n\nAs satire, this game is ann absolute failure. It's too focused on a particular idea and culture to have the more universial message to have impact, and that message is tainted and lost by the context it creates.

Social justice warriors, the infamous scourge of the internet gaming community, who have recently done their part to ruin everything as we used to know it.\n\nExcept, the problem is that in this game, the trolls exemplify one of the logical fallacies in the standard school of "logic",  which itself is used ad nauseam in the game, referred to as "No middle ground"  It's very clear that there is heavy bias painting the SJW as the hero, when the reality is (despite the disjointed and non-existent arguments presented by the trolls [caused by  the game deciding the "troll's" next moved based solely on a random number roll associated with a set of statements]) BOTH sides in the game are trolls, and some of the statements that were used for the troll side's dialogue are actually reasonable, if not the outright truth. Even so, they don't make any sense because they are random, so it's not as if you are battling a "troll" that's actually presenting a real argument.\n\nThis was probably done on purpose, but for a game it doesn't work. When you argue with a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the internet and they say something non sequitur, that's the end of it. Unfortunately the game doesn't end.\n\nOnce you get past the humor of "lol, I earned the favor of the necromancer and he used me to achieve his goal of becoming a lich", this game plays no differently from any of a dozen flash games - hentai or not - where you just have to use a list of pre-determined moves to try and reduce the enemies health gauges while keeping your own at manageable levels. But you don't even get to see ♥♥♥♥ afterwards.\n\nAs someone else said in their review, I wish I could give it a thumb sideways.

And it hits where it hurts.\n\nFor all those who engaged in internet arguments before, it is a mirror that they have to look into, and what they see is that there is no winner in these bitter arguments on twitter, reddit or wherever they happen. It makes people reflect and they don't like what they see.\n\nFrom a perspective of someone who doesn't take part in such arguments, its a humoristic experience, that shows the absurdity of the human behavior on the perceived anonymity of the internet. The Social Justice Warriors and the Trolls they fight are one and the same, just with different coloring. In the end there is no winner.\n\nThe Gameplay is solid, 4 classes with different abilities, high score table, lots of references, funny and sad at the same time. It's good to be played for short bursts but gets repetitive relatively fast. No bugs encountered.\n\nThe asking price is probably too high for the length of the entertainment that might be provided.\n\nStill it is a worthwhile experience,\nand it's probably the game people deserve.","February 28, 2015","true","3.9"," 88 of 218 people (40%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","40","88","218","15","4"

It's also funny to see so many MRAs, Redditors, ♥♥♥♥♥ners, etc, hate on it because it shows them for what they really are: Hateful and angry people.\n\nThey demand "Both sides" on the forums. Both sides of hatred, I suppose.\n\nBut anyway, back to the game. You pick four choices based on what type of troll the person is, and I swear these arguments are copy and pasted from those sites above (sans death threats of women of course), which means I hope the developer adds more with updates, since... all you have to do is go to the comment section of any news article of Facebook and tada, new content.\n\nThe developer is kind of a Liberal, which is good for some, but not for someone like me who is on the more radical Left (Communist) who believes in real Social Justice, but the answers given by your character are pretty good.\n\nOverall it's a good time waster and it's funny to see comments you see in real life in the game made by people from those aforementioned sites, who are going to vote this review down because they need an outlet for their anger.\n\nOne minor issue though that annoyed me, but had nothing to do with the game: The developer banned me temporarily from the forums because I was making those hateful people upset, which they deserve to be. They deserve to be shunned. They deserve to suffer the stress of anger. Why? Because all they do is hate.\n\nThe developer from Hotline Miami 2 deleted my thread wherein I asked if they took out the ♥♥♥♥ scene or not. No trolling, just a simple question. Before he deleted it, I was told to kill myself multiple times and the posts could have been ripped from that thread into this game.\n\nIt's kind of terrible when you think about it. It's 2015 and caring about Social Justice is a bad thing in this world. The reception to this game and the fact that this game exists proves it.\n\nEdit: Gamergate isn't and wasn't about Ethics in Game Journalism. It's about redditor, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, 9 gag or whatever being awful children whining about other people than them (straight white males) having a say in video games and playing them.\n\nAlso if you want a demo of this game, read the comments and drink Bigot Tears.

You then begin to 'battle' trolls.\nBoth you and your enemies are visually similiar and have a 'Sanity' bar and a 'Reputation' bar.\nAttacks will decrease one, or both of the bars, depending on choice of attack. Some attacks also have a 'cost'.\nReaching zero on either bar results in defeat.\nYour attacks are context sensitive. Choosing to Rebroadcast to your followers ican be more effective against a troll that  just presented a horrific statement than choosing to Reply with a counterexample - depending on the specific statement.\nYou will encounter SJ Rangers which can 'snipe' enemies, and others who will help you on your quest.\nThe qoal is to see how many trolls you can defeat before you are defeated.\nDifferent enemy types - An Ignorant Troll is has different stats, chooses different attacks, and is sensitive to different attacks than a Populer Troll\n","February 28, 2015","true","0.9"," 28 of 101 people (28%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","28","28","101","4","0"
