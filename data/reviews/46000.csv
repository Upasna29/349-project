Immediately tasked to explore and locate the pieces, it's up to the player to help Bob rebuild his little ship so that he can leave the planet.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about Bob Came in Pieces is that as you locate pieces of your ship you will need to use them to build your ship into a variety of different ship designs in order to solve the planets various puzzles. The games music is outstanding and I remember just sitting there and listening to one particular levels tune repeat itself over and over again just because it was so lovely.\n\nWith 25 levels and achievements alike there is plenty to do here with this little downloadable title. My only gripe is the controls. They are incredibly finicky and often had me getting on the wrong side of irritated. After having tried both keyboard/mouse and controller combo I would say the controller is probably your best bet due to the analogous thumsticks making it far easier to fling and steer little Bob than the WSAD combination which in all honesty is a simply...a nightmare.\n\nI enjoyed Bob Came in Pieces but I can't say it stands out as anything memorable or fantastic and for a simple little diversion it's fun but forgettable.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 7, 2014","true","9.4"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","32","37","0","0"

I don't think Bob Came in Pieces is an outright bad game, it's just a game I can't get used to, nor do I find any fun in it.\n\nThe basic idea is sound and actually somewhat original: controling Bob, you have to travel through several levels in order to collect the missing parts of his ship (Bob is a spaceship that came down to earth in pieces). There are several obstacles on the way, most of those objects that have to be removed or replaced (well, in the few levels I played anyway). By putting together Bob in the right way on the work-pads, you can figure out how to overcome the obstacles/puzzles: putting an extra engine in one of the slots makes a huge difference, and there's a "pull beam" that lets you pull away objects. At least, theoretically. Since the controls of this game are off-target to say the least, controlling Bob once some pieces of the spaceship have been adjusted, became a nightmare. Even more problematic is that the game relies on physics to solve puzzles - bu the physics seem to have been hugely overdone, with every action leading to a much greater reaction than I would ever expect. That makes the game nearly unplayable for me - although I would love to progress further into the apparently well designed levels and discover more of Bob's pieces, the controls and physics just don't let me do so. Graphics and sound do a pretty good job, so all the more regrettable that the gameplay let me down.\n\nWith over 80 achievements, of which the greater part have only been achieved by under 2% of all players, this game seems like a nightmare for achievement hunters. Apart from achievements for completing levels & gathering spaceship parts (fair enough!), there are lots and lots for finishing the levels within a certain time limit. These limits are set so extremely tight, that those achievements are only for the most stubborn gamers out there, or for these who figure out the wonky controls to perfection. People looking for another 100% game, definitely should skip this one, and it won't help in getting a good average completion rate either.\n\nBut there's a fair chance anyone else can actually figure things out, and enjoy this game. It's just not my cup of tea, I guess.\n\nNot recommended, unless you're very good at solving physics puzzles and have lots of patience","September 29, 2015","false","3.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/46000/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Real dedication is when you love your job so much that you’re willing to travel across the surface of a vast alien world to find all the ship parts necessary to repair your damaged craft, rocket back into the cosmos, and then jet to work to punch-in on time. Even if such an extreme dedication to the nine-to-five grind work doesn’t ring as true with everyone, Bob Came in Pieces is still an intriguing indie game that blends exploration and problem solving puzzle elements with a strong physics engine and a lovely design to create a whimsical adventure.\n\nBob loves the freedom to dress casually and chat all day on the phone, and who wouldn’t? Except Bob is a green octopus-like alien that works as a telemarketer in a crummy cubicle at an intergalactic call center. While most of his co-workers don’t share his enthusiasm for the less than stellar gig, he’s pleased as punch to clock in each day and go about his normal work routine. Unfortunately for Bob, his commute to work is cut short one day when his ship is struck by a wayward meteor. And his day doesn’t get much better from there.\n\nLosing his hyper drive unit, as well as numerous other crucial chunks of his ship, he crash lands on a strange planet without help in sight. In order to get Bob back to work, you’ll guide what’s left of his spacecraft through different and interestingly designed areas of the planet to recover missing parts and the ever-important hyper drive system. What makes the explorative journey so fascinating is that you’ll use the junk parts you recover along the way to constantly re-build and re-design Bob’s ship to overcome the obstacles you run into.\n\nBoth above and below the surface, the mysterious, earth-like planet is rife with mechanical contraptions designed to impede your progress. Among giant locking mechanisms and puzzles that must be assembled you’ll find trigger plates to depress, large objects to move, and force fields to circumvent, alongside more peculiar hurdles. While solving puzzles on the first few stages only require some basic common sense, these impediments grow increasingly complex and you’ll have to make more drastic alterations to your ship to proceed.\n\nYour core ship is a small orb with eight bolt points where additional parts can be attached. As you explore the planet, you’ll find basic extender parts, various hinges, and several special functioning items that you can combine and assemble onto your vessel. Most levels have multiple hotspots where you can stop and freely play around with re-designing your ship using any parts you’ve collected. Frequent experimentation is necessary. For example, one area may require you to assemble a long hook-like fixture to your ship in order to flick a hard-to-reach switch. Other areas require you to attach a pushing or pulling device to manipulate rocks, mechanical devices, and other gadgets you find.\n\nBut it’s not as easy as just dropping anything onto Bob’s ship willy-nilly. The game features a dynamic physics system, and the more you add to your ship, the more it affects how it handles in accordance with balance and gravity. Plunking down too much junk on your craft without beefing up your boosters will render you virtually immobile, and you can only move in certain directions if you have boosters located on the opposite end to push you. The realistic physics make designing your ship a fun challenge, and tinkering around with the different parts to see what you can come up with to solve each problem is equally entertaining.\n\nThe levels, puzzles, and the overall visual worlds in Bob Came in Pieces are really nicely put together. While it’s great to focus on the task at hand, you’ll also find yourself taking a moment to soak in the colorful backgrounds and unique terrain designs. Also, the way some contraptions are put together is pretty brilliant.\n\nThere are 14 stages to go through which doesn’t take terribly long to accomplish, but you can revisit previously completed stages to try for a faster time. And there are plenty of things you’ll miss on the first go around due to initially having limited parts. Sprucing up your ship with the cool technology unlocked later on in the game makes it worth going back to check out where else you can use it. Bob Came in Pieces oozes creativity and rewards you for noodling around to your heart’s content. It’s easy to get into but hard to stop playing once you’ve been hooked.","February 27","true","21.6"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","1"

This indie physics-based puzzle game is pretty fun. Your goal is to navigate a spaceship to the end of a level. Sure, it sounds easy enough, but there are always obstacles in your way. The main hook of the gameplay is mixing and matching parts on your spaceship in order to solve physics-based puzzles in each level (pushing and pulling objects, smashing through things, etc). I found the controls to be a bit touchy at times and wasn't a huge fan of the ship-building interface, but overall, there's not much bad to say about this game. Just go into it without any grand expectations. It's pretty laid back and is a nice way to kill a few hours. There are also a number of advanced levels available, in addition to the main story chapters, for those looking for a bit more challenge.","October 8, 2011","true","6.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Most of the "challenge" with Bob Came in Pieces comes from the fact that Bob doesn't usually do what you want him to. "Building" the ship is just a matter of sticking tubes onto your ship with a few rockets for awkward thrust and a push or pull device to move around objects. The rest is up to your mind... or your willpower to simply keep chugging at the same "puzzle" until Bob finally decides that he really does want to go the way you want him to.\n\nThe addition of fans in later levels make the game way too frustrating, and I'm glad I got this in a bundle for almost nothing... or literally nothing. Fighting the pull of gravity, the push of a fan and a thrust system that can easily turn Bob upsidedown, makes me not willing to recomend.\n\nSomeone will enjoy it, of this I'm sure, it just isn't me.","June 18, 2014","false","1.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

A physics-based thrust/lander puzzler with an interesting mechanic, whereby you can change the design of your craft, affecting its flight characteristics and abilities.\n\nI've played the game up to level 7 of the main "Adventure".  It took about 4 hours and I think that's about half-way through the main arc of the game, but there is a lot of additional content in the form of single "challenges".  The puzzles are not hard, but finding the right way to fly your craft or a combination of ship components that works to accomplish the task-in-hand can be tricky.  It's possible (and recommended!) to save useful ship designs to recall quickly at the docking stations within the levels.  All the levels seem to contain hidden areas with extra ship parts, which are rewarding to find.  The game can get very frustrating sometimes, however, due to the physics simulation.  It's possible to get your ship trapped in various ways, such as under a bit of falling or sliding scenery, or by having the wrong thruster in the wrong position on your ship, leaving you jammed up against a wall or spinning in circles with no way to get back to a base to change it, meaning you have to quit and re-start the level, which can be maddening, especially if it happens in sight of the exit gate!\n\nI'm saying it's a 7/10 overall (but 3/10 when you get the damn ship stuck!).","March 19, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
