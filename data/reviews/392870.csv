Huh. Let's give it a whirl. *half an hour later* Huh. Money relatively well spent. It was the most fun 24 cents i've spent. That is, it's 24 cents. It's not a lot. But, for the price it normally goes for, I can't reccomend it. It's loud.  it's simplistic. the camera controlls are a bit weird, and there is no multiplayer. I wish that was a thing. Multiplayer would be cool to have. It would definately increase playability. It definately needs more updates and such, targeting silos and anti-nukes, more stuff you can do. The graphics aren't great but they're not the most terrible thing in the world.\n\nIn short, I recommend your 24 cents, but not full price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really wish there was a neutral review button.","August 9, 2015","false","0.5"," 218 of 256 people (85%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","85","218","256","30","3"

Controls are simple: WASD to spin the globe, Spacebar to return home, F to attack, and R to defend.\n\nWhen you start a game you'll notice floating resources all over the map. Click the resources to send drones out to collect them. Once you have enough resources you can start your assult on the enemy. Pressing F will switch to attack mode and if you click on an enemy city you are given 3 options, one is to arm a nuke, the next is to fire the nuke, and the last option is to cancel the attack (in war we don't use that button). You need to are every nuke before launching it and every nuke costs resources so collecting resources is a big part of winning.\n\nDefending is also very important since you only have a few cities. Pressing R switches you to defensive mode where you can target incoming nukes and destroy them by firing rockets at them while in mid-flight.\n\nRotation of the globe can be wonky at times, but this is really the only issue I have with it. Overall it's a fun game and with such a low price there is no reason to complain, unless you just enjoy complaining.","August 7, 2015","true","2.4"," 431 of 576 people (75%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","75","431","576","52","9"

Such as; the camera rotation has been improved but is still a tad wonky, nukes no longer fly up in the atmosphere and circle the globe for indefinite amounts of time, a 'more helpful' menu has been added when you first open the game that helps new players understand what is going on, anti nukes also work properly now. Basically, the game is now playable and isn't too bad. While additional features would be undoubtedly appreciated, 24 cents isn't a bad price to pop off a few nukes here and there. Let's hope, MSD continues to update the game and add new features.\nUpdated Vidya:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hXRVlPgdkY\nOriginal:\nGameplay Footage and Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM7r9xspdxI\nI want to start out saying, I love DEFCON and games like Superpower 2 and I love raining down ICBM's upon unsuspecting virtual citizens. Don't get me wrong, I love nuclear hellfire as much as the next guy but there are right and wrong ways of doing it. This game, unfortunately, is the wrong way but that doesn't mean it doesn't have potential. Unexplained rules (ie... when do the nukes come down? Is it random? Why can I only target cities and not silos or anti nukes?) really water down the experience and make it hard to enjoy the game when it seems like nothing is happening. Graphically, the textures are pretty poor but to me, that's really not that big of a deal except why is Canada completely covered in snow? The rotation for the camera is also a little wonky but if you're willing to put up with it, you'll eventually get it. All in all, the game is meh and needs some serious work... but if the dev puts in the time, this could be a really fun game with a great concept.","August 8, 2015","false","5.1"," 120 of 151 people (79%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","79","120","151","24","9"

The Help screen lacks so much info that it isnt really a help screen. The controls seem basic but when i got to the stage of working out how to fire it wouldnt fire a missile and this is the same with the defence. Obviously i am playing the game wrong as it does not work for me and i geuss it does for the creator but that is because there arnt really any instructions anywhere. I understand that the game came out today so there will be bugs and the creator will hopefully inprove from feedback. Saying all this I liked the idea of the game and the 3D world thats an inverted rotation. But if the game didnt have the 3D and functions like the help screen was focused on more so i could play the game it would probaly be better. saying that go if I could use it on 3D it'd be even better than that.\n\n\nThis bit was added later the next day.\nThe game has now got a working helpscreen that pops up at the beggining of the game which has been improved and is understandable.

WELL... I'm going to create a new thing called the Homicide-ometer, It is a scale where I put all of Digital Homicide's games onto a scale and order them on how much they want to makeme kill someone. Here's the meter:\n\nKill someone, with a gun, but give them a burial:  Temper Tantrum, Deadly profits\nMakes me want to kill my family but still bury them:  Forsaken Uprising, Medieval Mercs\nDeclare war on a country and kill everyone there with a minigun: The Slaughtering Grounds, Dvil's Share\nKill a house full of 500 orpheons and old people: Attrition: Nuclear Domination, Galactic Hitman\n\nYes, I just compared Attrition to Galactic Hitman.\n\nThe one thing that makes me hate Attrition more than other Digital Homicide games is that you have no clue what to do. There's a unity asset earth and missiles go from one place to another and you're faced with tons of random sh*t on the sides of your screen and you have no clue who u are on Earth or who your firing the missiles at or WHT THE HELL YOU'RE DOING! Digital Homicide don't even put in a tutorial to tell you what you're even doing.\n\nThe graphics look like what Unity looked like when it was in beta. Look at good games that were made in the unity engine like The Forest. The game looks good, plays good and the devs are passionate about their  product and that's just in early access! Whereas Digital Homicide just sh*t anything out onto the steam market they can (THE 18 F*CKING GAMES ON GREENLIGHT AT ONCE!)\n\nThe reason this is on par with Galactic Hitman is because it has one thing over Galactic Hitman and one thing worse than it:\n\nBetter: It isn't missing any walls and objects aren't fused into the walls\n\nBelow: WTF DO I DO?!\n\nTHIS THING IS SH*T ONTOP OF SH*T AND THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING FOR DIGITAL HOMICIDE!\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nPros\n+ Nothing\n\nCons\n- WTF DO I DO?!\n- Ugly graphics (the Earth looks like my ball sack)\n- I can't even force myself to play it\n\nFinal verdict: 1/10\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","March 28","false","0.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","12","14","8","0"

I like the idea of missle defense and tactics and resource collection.\nFor its price, it makes sense why this game is the way it is.\n\nThe graphics aren't good, the controls are hard to handle and you don't really get it until you screw around with them for a while. I still struggle moving around the world.\n\nGame progression is very very boring. When is my missle going to hit? I shot it a good 5 minutes ago, why is it taking so dang long? I guess its different when you play with friends but it isn't very enticing for me. After 20 minutes I have seen enough of the game and have gotten bored of it.\n\nThe fact that I can easily make my money back off the steam trading cards is a win I guess. If you can get this game for cheap it is a good purchase, if not, I suggest to save your $.99 for something more worthwhile. I threw $.10 at it with a coupon and for that price it was not bad.","October 6, 2015","false","2.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This game may be cheap but I doubt it would have cost the developers that much money to make the text on the globe legible. I'm not asking for 4K textures but something that doesnt look like it came out of a Playstation/N64. [I would like to point out when I was looking at the video settings, apparently I could only lower them further. I shudder to think what that would do.]\n\nThe framerate jumped about for me, it was nothing crazy but I know thats going to irk some people.\n\nThe camera controls are broken. Straight up broken. W and S were inverted at first, then they stopped being inverted and A and D got inverted then W and S instead of going up and down would do a little arch with the camera. Its honestly some of the most sloppy stuff I've seen with a camera to date.\n\nAnd finally, the thing I held my hands up to possibly just being my problem, the missiles wont launch.\nThey just wont, either that or I'm getting zero feedback to let me know one of the many missiles in the air around the world might be my own. I know how to play the game, at one point I had to make sure cause I was worried I didnt know the controls, but I learnt that I wasnt at fault here.\n\nNow I know one discussion in the forums tries to defend the game due to it being incredibly cheap. That excuses nothing. Google Maps is free [And I think Google Earth is too], and I could just imagine myself nuking the planet for a more fulfilling experience. A cheap game can get away with some things, I would never expect a AAA experience, but I would expect something, Anything other than this.\nDont buy this.

The graphics are PS2 quality in my opinion, with just small character portraits, low rendered missile, missile trails and explosions and small unregocnizable drones that gather resources.  Aside from the missiles and explosions, there's not much going to to wow about.  I should also add that when played in a window mode, after each match, the game goes back to full screen by it's self.\n\nSound:\nThere is NO music, only ambient noise on the title screen and missile launches and explosions.  That is literally ALL there is for sound.  I have no been able to get the music to work at all.\n\nControl:\nYou use the WASD to move the globe around and the mouse to gather resources or fire missiles.  Sadly, navigating the globe is annoying, as sometimes you won't be able to rotate it in a certain direction, or it will just wiz by.  The mouse control seems fine.\n\nGameplay:\nYou pick from one of 8 different nations (it doesn't matter who since it seems none of them have any differances besides portrait and name), and then go about collecting small orange blocks (resources) so you can launch missiles at enemies or defend yourself from missiles.  Each attack missile costs 20 resource to fire, while defense missils cost 10, but they can be rapid fired.\n\nYou win by being the last nation standing, but you will find this difficult as it's hard to see when a missile actually is coming at you, not realizing until until after the missile hits that you were under atatck.  You will waste resources firing at missiles that were never going at you, while it will seem nothing short of a full Macross-style barrage of missiles will get through your target's defenses.\n\nThe opponents just randomly attack everyone with no seeming strategy. I tried 3 rounds with all opponents on easy and never survuved very long due to all the missiles flying around and not being able to see which ones were coming at me.  I did 1 round with a single enemy, and still missed a few missiles getting through, since it takes a few seconds for you to figure out if your defense missile stopped the enemy missile.  It also seemed like the enemies have unlimited resources from the amount of missiles and defense missiles they fire.\n\nRegardless of wether you win or lose, nothing happens and you are chucked back to the controls screen.  Every time.  No score, no ranking.  Nothing.  There is nothing here but a lame and not as fun Missile Command ripoff.","August 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The camera controls are awkward, the launch buttons rarely ever work and the graphics are absolutely terrible, even for a Unity game.

The missiles are flying but who owns what missle? There is no way of telling your missle from the enemies.. Still, no complaints for the price @ 19 pence.

Then when u have enough, build nukes to send them to nuke enemy cities. You can also spend resource to send missiles to destroy those enemy incoming nukes. A nation/faction is fully destroyed when all of his/her cities are destroyed.\n\nThere are much better free flash games on the internet. There are also much better games on steam that are free.

This was about £3 when I bought it. I showed my friend and he hated it aswell.

This games HUD has so much minimal information that I wa surprised it existed, I truthfully didn't even know what faction I was because it did a bad job if display everything. I didn't know what right click or left click did, or ctrl did even though I read the keys I wasn't able to be able to use them. I got it refunded after an hour of playing, I know it's the cheapest game inn the world but the devs don't deserve a penny that this game makes them because they didn't focus on gameplay they just made a random game about blowing things up. For a tiny price aswell. If this game was better (Had better controls, maybe a tutorial), then the price would go up and I would enjoy to buy it for that price.

It is a simple game that will take maybe 3 minutes to win ( once you know what you are doing). It lacks the feel of most stratagy games becuse you can win by hiting random cities.

There's no clarity in why I couldn't hit the missiles flying by, even when I could fire at them, and the objects are not well distinguished enough to allow a player to recognize the tiny orange boxes as "resources".\n\nA fine first effort, but it should never have been sold; it would've bene pretty engrossing on Kongregate two or three years ago.","August 16, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are no true instructions or guidance on what you are supposed to actually do in the game and after trying it out, it's also completely unclear if you are doing anything other than turning the world and watching the AI blow everything up.\nVery little to nothing happens when you click anywhere and about the only other thing you seem able to do is change the look of the mouse pointer.  I must have done something as resources suddenly appeared but after several quick games, this still seems to be a random happening rather than due to something I actually did.

The guide for how to play in-game is not very comprehensive at all in terms of explaining what to do. Once I learned the basics of how to play I was able to collect resources and pop off nukes at my global enemies. Incase you were wondering after pressing "F" you click on the small "L" bubble to launch a missle. Also when you press "R" for the blue cursor click on the small brown squares for resources.\n\nThe game is not perfect and definitely has some bugs along with some other small set-backs but it is definitely still playable. They recently updated the game (8/8/15) to allow for smoother navigation of the globe using WASD which was one of the large problems I first encountered. Glad to see the devs are actively updating the game and fixing the big issues along with gathering our feedback.\n\nOverall though the pros outweigh the cons once you figure out what you are doing. I heard they plan on introducing Multiplayer in the future so I can see how that would only make this game more fun to compete in a PVP environment.\n\n7/10 - Good times are to be had if you can figure out what the hell is going on.","August 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 27 of 56 people (48%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","48","27","56","9","2"

I set it for two players on easy.  You know, just to test the waters...  I won at first, by wiping out the other guy, but somehow there was a third player shooting at me that I could not find.  I looked all over the freakin' planet.  Nothing.  Then BOOM!  BOOM! BOOM!  I could't fire at most of the incomming missiles even though I had the resources.  I hit some of them, but my cities were wiped out.  I lost after all.  Actually kinda realistic.  Perhaps a better name for this game is Mutually Assured Destruction.  No winners allowed.\n\nThen again, maybe I just have to play it more.","August 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 34 of 71 people (48%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","48","34","71","27","2"

Resources are collected by clicking on them, in which a drone is sent to pick up the strange coin thing. Controls are extremely simple, WASD to move across the globe, Space to return to your home, F and R to select missile and antinuke. You have to defend your own faction against foreign nukes while also striking against your foes. Easy enough? Not quite. It can actually be difficult to manage your defense and offense at the same time, all the while sending drones to collect your resources for you.\n\nNot something I'd play on a daily basis, but definetly worth a buck.","October 18, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

As you first start the game, you are shown a comprehensive list, that details all the in-depth mechanics of the game, and how to control them. After the brief tutorial screen, you're throw right into the action, and given the freedom of choosing whatever character you want, each possessing a variety of entirely useless stats.\n\nThis game brings a whole new meaning to the 'Open-World' tag. The whole simulation is observed from a beautifully designed bird's eye perspective.\n\nA problem I often see in Earth centric games like this; is the global navigation is very convoluted and not very efficient.\nThis game could not be farther from that!\nPrepare to be effortlessly wisked away by your WASD keys, dragged to the far edges of the globe, so that you can defend, and return fire, with nuclear war heads.\n\nFrequently, the devs are so busy, perfecting the engine and the mechanics of the game, that they quickly gloss over the audio and soundtrack.  NOT HERE  The game includes a collection of roughly 5 sound effects, that along with massive amounts of repitition, will have your mind beaten into submission.\n\nAll in all, with a moving soundtrack, extensive gameplay, and gentle learning curve, I am positive that this groundbreaking title will be a classic for ages!\n\n\nOverall Quantitative:\n\nGameplay   9.5/10\nAudio          5/5\nEngine        10/10\nGraphics     8.5/10\nStory           N/A\n","August 8, 2015","true","0.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","38","5","13","14","0"

The basic idea is there - gather resources, launch missiles, defend against enemy missiles with a surprisingly accurate SDI system against 1 to 9 opponents (who fill the other countries you don't select as your own).\n\nPros:\n-Great Basic Idea\n-Fun\n\nCons:\n-Sound can get annoying (individual missiles generate their own launch sound effect, with 9 opponents, this can get crazy)\n-Virtually nonexistent UI (besides the resource count and count of countries' cities, defenses, silos etc.)\n-Controls are a little wonky (especially movement of the camera, sometimes the controls actually get reversed based on how you're looking at the world)\n-Can't aim at anything other than cities or missiles (depending on if you're in aggressive or defensive mode) - I would've liked to have won in a bloodless victory by just targeting silos.\n-Missiles are far too easy to shoot down\n-No research or development system, if you have 10 resources you can shoot a laser at a missile, if you have 20 you can shoot a missile.\n-No Multiplayer\n-Resource gathering means collecting floating barrels or crates with helicopters\n-No diplomacy system\n\nFinal notes (this is mostly for the developers if they're interested):\n\nOverall I would say this is a great start for this game, the menu needs some fixing and the basic game, given more time, could be truly great if it's fleshed out more and some of the problems fixed.\n\nIf I were going to make improvements I would focus on this:\n- Add a research and development system so that you start out with less advanced weapons and virtually no SDI whatsoever to make it more strategic. I would start the game with the only delivery system be early bombers (something like B-29s for example) and the only proper defense be early fighters (something like P-51s or MiG-15s).\nIf you have enough resources, you could "advance" by researching certain technologies that will give you an edge, like proper missile delivery systems and then more advanced missiles, more advanced bombers/fighters, the upgrade from early atomic weapons (fission based bombs) to more powerful ones (hydrogen, possibly even antimatter) that would increase the damage of the bombs/missiles.\n- Change the resource gathering and economy by making it so you choose whether to produce resources or missiles in your country (or just bombs if you haven't discovered them yet) as well as fighters, bombers, facilities and power plants (to charge the SDI lasers).\n- Make it so that you can aim the missiles at anything, not just cities.\n- Add the chance for some missiles to be duds and give the enemy a possibility of salvaging them to gain resources.\n- Add a diplomacy system and give players extra benefits by seeking alliances instead of just attacking (give the option for the world to start at peace with or without alliances and allow players to decide when to declare war, and against who).\n- Add a spoils system to conquering enemy countries so that it's actually more beneficial to destroy enemy militaries instead of killing all their civilians (for example, you could gain their industrial power, their remaining missiles, resources or just more territory).\n- Add a fallout system so that even though you may shoot a missile down, it still irradiates whatever it explodes over (unless it's in orbit, then make it less effective).\n- Add the chance for nuclear winter to happen, which, based on settings can either just be cosmetic or even end in a stalemate. Also make it so that you know when this is going to happen, so that players know they need to stop launching missiles or detonating bombs for a while to keep from ending the game. This could be linked to the research system as well by giving options to either discover ways to detect the possibility of this or even prevent it entirely (even if it's just one country).\n- Fix some of the problems listed above (sound, menu, camera control etc.)","August 15, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I went from losing my first game on easy, to winning 3 games, even one on NORMAL in 40 minutes.  The game has some short comings, though.\n\nMap movement is on the sad side of "OK" ... it's workable, but without the space bar to get back home, it would not be playable.  Dear developer ... give us a rotate command (or keep the planet orientation always north).\n\nYou cannot defend your cities by shooting down enemy missles until they are close enough.  Dear developer, give us an indication that the missle is close enough to shoot down.  A clear warning sound would be nice also, if we are off elsewhere.  COLOR it, or pop up a 3d "shield" view around our territory to indicate it has been breached, -- something.  It's impossible to tell when they are close enough.  You can get better at guessing, but you will always be guessing.  And sometimes it takes 3 ... and sometimes 10 anti-missle shots to take an enemy missle down.\n\nEven sitting with plenty of resources, and 5 missles, I had troubles launching a missle at the one remaining enemy city.  While the enemy was launching 3 in a row.  Eventually "something" gave, and I was able to lob 3 missles towards his remaining city and win.  Dear developer ... if you can fix this, then giving us the ability to target a country's missle silos and/or anti-missle silos, with a rebuild option (for when ours get destroyed), would be a nice add for a longer game.\n\nNot sure how long I will play this.

Mainly 'cause developers thought that it would be a cool idea to have a nuclear explosion with no volume control whatsoever. My ears are still beebing. Then to the actual game.\nYes, you have a character/nation selection but no idea does it affect the gameplay. In the game, your UI is strange and while there is that "HELP" button, it does not tell you anything useful. Besides that you can make your head hurt more when you are trying to make some sense with freely spinning globe.\nI suppose that the idea is to nuke everyone else but how to shoot missiles, I do not know. A bit more of that "HELP" button would be nice. Also got nuked immedetially with Easy- mode on.\nSo as a conclusion I can recommend to buy this game to your friend just to make their ears bleed. And also trading cards are included.\nBut seriously, could be nice little game just needs a lot of polishing and making it more understandable.\n\nEDIT!!!\n\nThank you developer, when you added that "real" help option, this game makes a lot more sense. Also the fact that now you have more options how to move your camera and for the first times I saw the resource crates. Still, not Defcon but I like this. Also 1up to developers for making game better. That is the reason I change my review to be positive. Keep up the improvements","August 7, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I admit, the camera control is a bit dull but I'll write something about this problem a bit later...\n\nPros\nGood fast-paced game with acceptable graphics\nAlternative countries ( Fighting with real countries has been a bit boring :D )\nAdjustable number of opponents (1-9 ), easy difficulty is really easy, insane difficulty is really insane :D\nMy 79 y.o granddad likes this game ( NO JOKE )\nCons ( I'll take about all of the cons later )\nUnreal resource gathering\nAs I mentioned before, camera controll is a bit dull, but after one or two games you can get used to it.\nThere should be more types of missiles ( Yes, I know, this game was released a few days ago, so I cannot except tons of content. - No hate please :D )\nThings, that I'd like to see in the game\nBetter camera controls ( = Mouse control ), using arrow keys or W A S D keys is not much comfortable\nBetter resource getting system - Sending helicopters ( I don't know, what is it, but in this review, I'll call it helicopter :D ) to collect yellow dots is cool, but I think that adding destructible quarries that will slowly gather resources would be fine. I also think, that sending your helicopters to steal resources of the destroyed nations is a feasible idea.\nMore types of missiles with different effects, each for  different price ofc. To make this balanced, I would reduce price of the basic missile to 10 resource points, and reduce it's DMG. This means  that you'll need for example 3 missiles of this type to destroy a city, two missiles do destroy a quarry. Then, I would add missile with a power of two basic missiles with price of 20, and a big missile with price of 30 or 40 with an ultimate effect ( for example destroying nearby helicopters or destroying some resources of the attacked country. I know, this sounds very, very bad, but I wanted to give you an example of my idea.\nThis game is pretty small, so I don't think that we'll see official multiplayer servers, but adding LAN multiplayer would be fine.\nOverall,  I think, that this game has it's potential. If the creators will focus at the needs of the community and if they won't tottaly screw the game with some crazy update, the game can be pretty good.\n\nIf you want to ask anything or tell me, that this review was just a piece of worthless crap, feel free to add me and hate me to tears :D\n\nEDIT - Corrected some English mistakes :D","August 13, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have 3 things you can do, send helicopters out for resources, that you can use to shoot down enemy nukes, or send your own nukes, there's a help panel that you can use if you're ever in doubt. There's also a multiplayer mode, but even though I have not looked at it for a single second I'm pretty sure it's dead, though I can see it being a good fun game to play just 1 or 2 rounds on vs. a friend or 2, as there is a grand total of 10 nations in the game, and it would be odd if they weren't all playable. It also plays out on a map of the real world... So that's a thing. For 1 euro I'd say I've seen more complex free games on various sites on the internet, but it is true in what it states on the About page. The devs have also stated that "some polling will be made available to see what type of things players would be interested in seeing. Details and polls will be given in announcements." though I haven't seen any sign of this the game is just over a month old, and I'm willing to give it some time, since I can't get it refunded even if I wanted to.\n","September 16, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I admit, the camera control is a bit dull but I'll write something about this problem a bit later...\n\nPros\nGood fast-paced game with acceptable graphics\nAlternative countries ( Fighting with real countries has been a bit boring :D )\nAdjustable number of opponents (1-9 ), easy difficulty is really easy, insane difficulty is really insane :D\nMy 79 y.o granddad likes this game ( NO JOKE )\nCons ( I'll take about all of the cons later )\nUnreal resource gathering\nAs I mentioned before, camera controll is a bit dull, but after one or two games you can get used to it.\nThere should be more types of missiles ( Yes, I know, this game was released a few days ago, so I cannot except tons of content. - No hate please :D )\nThings, that I'd like to see in the game\nBetter camera controls ( = Mouse control ), using arrow keys or W A S D keys is not much comfortable\nBetter resource getting system - Sending helicopters ( I don't know, what is it, but in this review, I'll call it helicopter :D ) to collect yellow dots is cool, but I think that adding destructible quarries that will slowly gather resources would be fine. I also think, that sending your helicopters to steal resources of the destroyed nations is a feasible idea.\nMore types of missiles with different effects, each for  different price ofc. To make this balanced, I would reduce price of the basic missile to 10 resource points, and reduce it's DMG. This means  that you'll need for example 3 missiles of this type to destroy a city, two missiles do destroy a quarry. Then, I would add missile with a power of two basic missiles with price of 20, and a big missile with price of 30 or 40 with an ultimate effect ( for example destroying nearby helicopters or destroying some resources of the attacked country. I know, this sounds very, very bad, but I wanted to give you an example of my idea.\nThis game is pretty small, so I don't think that we'll see official multiplayer servers, but adding LAN multiplayer would be fine.\nOverall,  I think, that this game has it's potential. If the creators will focus at the needs of the community and if they won't tottaly screw the game with some crazy update, the game can be pretty good.\n\nIf you want to ask anything or tell me, that this review was just a piece of worthless crap, feel free to add me and hate me to tears :D\n\nEDIT - Corrected some English mistakes :D","August 13, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had to reset my settings in the main menu. I was able to experiment and get it to be windowed...in the bottom of the right corner of the screen and still at top graphics. I had to mess with menu again to get it centered. Not a good start.\n\nThe game opens with an animation of a mushroom cloud with a help menu telling how to play, though I will admit I didn't notice the first time since I was more annoyed at the fact it didn't saved my settings and just wanted to get to the main menu to fix it. There also isn't a menu for controls on the main menu and had to poke at the keyboard during the first match just to get the help menu back up. Either have a menu for controls or have a tutorial. A bland help menu at start up just doesn't do it.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. You and up to nine AI players fight one another by launching nukes at each other. Your and your opponents' places on the globe is determined by the character choosen. You send out helicopters to retrieve boxes (resources) on the globe and launch nukes at opponents' specific structures in their areas.

I got great ones for free before! The descroption sounded ok: war, missiles, maybe some cool action. I couldn't have been more wrong!\nI oppened the game and chose windowed mode but it went to full screen and all I saw was a low quality fire background with "instructions". They were quite confusing by the way. And when I closed the instructions window I was left with only fire. Thought maybe was some kind of bug due to specific hardware or maybe was loading. None: you're suposed to hit esc to bring up the main menu and then choose play (by the way the in game  menu did work to get to the windowed mode).\nFinally gonna start playing right? Nope! After a not very good menu I started the game and had no idea how to play: you get a view from space of the earth with a few city icons and some round things I foudn out were missile launchers but what should I do? Oh get some ressources (the orange squares aparently). Click them and wait for troops to go get them. Oh there's a missile going up, shoot it? Nothing happened. After a while there's a lot of missiles around, you have no idea if they are yours or enemies, and nothing makes sense anymore. Sudenly something appeared on the screen saying: you lost.
