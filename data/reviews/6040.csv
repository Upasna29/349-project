Couple years later you bring together Spielberg, Orson Scott Card, Brian Moriarty (who was behind some of Infocom's greats) and LucasArts and you get The Dig.\n\nInteresting development history aside, i really enjoy this game. I got it when it came out back in '95 and still own the original box and soundtrack. The Dig wasn't your typical lighthearted LucasArts adventure game dealing with survival and death on an alien world. In some cases that made for a challenging game, as a lot of the alien devices required a good bit of finagling to figure out how to solve them. Back then, there wasn't an internet readily available to turn to when you got stumped. The game could get frustrating in that aspect but there was still plenty to like; The serious nature of the setting, Robert Patrick voicing the main character (LucasArts games were getting a lot better in the voice department when they started getting Talkie versions of their games), the alien landscapes and the ambient music by Michael Land.\n\nYes, i grew up in the golden age of adventure games, so i am going to be a bit bias about these gems that i love. Point n' Click is pretty much ingrained into my being and will always feel second nature to me. Doesn’t mean someone can't stumble upon The Dig, give an almost 20 year old game a spin and still find something really special. These hand drawn graphics still remain pleasing to me heh.","September 29, 2014","true","2.4"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","38","40","0","1"

The development history of the game is almost as interesting as the game itself, and I recommend you look it up.\n\nBy modern gaming standards, I'm not sure if I would call it a 'good' game but there are lots of good things about it.\nThese good things include gorgeous visuals and amazing sound design.\n\nI have to be brutally honest, though. You are probably not going to be able to complete this game without a walkthrough. This game is full of classic point and click puzzle bs. Items you're supposed to interact with can be hard to find among the lush background art, and the game's hints can be cryptic at best.  This game's puzzles will make you feel things. Most of these things will be frustration, but it's a very special type of frustration you don't get from modern games. I admit that it's a rewarding feeling to figure out a puzzle on your own\n\nA big selling point of the game is the cinematic writing, and there definitely is a cinematic feel. The quality of the writing declines as the game progresses, though. It feels rushed in my opinion.There are some genuinely funny moments, but at times you may be frustrated with the characters' stupidity. Actually, this is sort of a plus for me since I found it amusing. Then again, I think Plan 9 From Outer Space is a science fiction masterpiece, so your mileage may vary.\n\nI still enjoyed the game though, Maybe it's because I grew up on this stuff. But Despite it's flaws, you can tell there was a lot of effort put in. For the price, I say give it a shot.","October 5, 2015","true","12.5"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","40","44","0","1"

The DIG started as an idea by Steven Spielbeg that he soon abandoned with nowhere to take it, handing it over to his friend George Lucas' studio to make something out of it.\nWhat they created was something magical.  An odyssey into space and the man's determination to survive and explore.\n\nPlaying as the aging astronaut Commander Boston Low, you must traverse a strange and marvellously deadened world beyond our reach, of a planet long abandoned by most of its former inhabitants.  Joined by his two crewmates being the severe reporter Maggie Robbins and the cool-minded geologist Ludger Brink, Boston must use his natural survival instincts and quick-witted skills of human engineering to try and formulate a way to escape, explore, and uncover the origins of this mysterious planet, and how they must find their way back home.\n\nWhile the DIG may not be LucasArts' best work by far, it is certainly not one you should miss if you love their library.  The graphics are not the best, being that while the LucasArts style works well for more cartoony games such as Sam & Max or Monkey Island, it's a little more uncertain to do so with actual human characters and as a result they can look rather off during cutscenes.  Like "monkeys wearing human masks" off.\n\nNevertheless the rest of the game shines through with its pure atmosphere.  The graphics for its weird alien backgrounds are gorgeous, the sound design is just absolutely at the top of its game more than ever from LucasArts with roaring waves, howling winds, deep resonance within space and the most oddest of creatures wallowing and shrieking from all around you.\n\nThe dialogue is rather snarky in about 80% of its places but that only makes it more fun with the likes of Steve Blum and Robert Patrick delivering the most deadpan of deliveries.  The puzzles are...infamous to say the least and in truth one or two of them could have been much better designed.  I'll give you a hint for free, the head of the skeleton is not meant to be on the top left, but bottom right.\n\nRegardless, I say go ahead if you love LucasArts' work, and try out this gem from the past that, while is a little rough around the edges and is perhaps at the lower end of their library, is nevertheless one worthy of playing if you are a fan of such games.","June 18, 2014","true","2.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I didn't have any money on my own and my parents were very strict in spending money with videogames so I never had any chance to try it... Until 20 years later I bought it on Steam... MUAHUAHUAHUAHUA!\nOk, so I knew already this is a classic point & click adventure, made by the Great and Storical Lucas Arts which was leader in the sector so it was a guarantee on its own. What I didn't know was the subject and part of the plot was from Steven Spielberg... OK, not entirely, because this game took 5 years to develop, and there have been many different directors that changed, partly and sometimes completely, the game.\nAnyways you can feel the Spielberg touch, this is a beautiful science fiction adventure. The premise might look boring and quite abused, but remember this is a 1995 game: a giant asteroid is going to crash on earth. A team of astronauts with different specializations are being sent to blow it up and limit the impact damage. And now comes the first plot twist: once the field team blows up the minor charges to crack an opening to blow the asteroid from the inside, the find inner chambers and kind of technologic manufacts. As soon as they put together a few parts the asteroid morphs into a poliedric spaceship that brings the team to an abandoned planet, Almost dead with traces of civilization, mysterious artifacts and astonishing landscapes. Here our team will struggle to find a way to get back to planet Earth between internal conflicts and amazing discoveries.\nSo... Yes, the story and the characters are amazing as well as the music, and the puzzles are not extreme and illogical, they just require some wandering, exploration and logic.\n\n+++PROs+++ STORY. One of the most important sides of an adventure, besides puzzles, is the story and here we have an amazing story. As already said even though the premise might look already seen a thousand times the plot twist demonstrates you know nothing and you have seen nothing. Everything happens in the unknown planet and the revelations you'll discover, together with the conclusion (with a minor but not so different alternate ending) is something that will amaze and make you wonder why nobody made a movie out of this. And actually this was supposed to be a movie as this game came from a Spielberg's idea, but the cost at the time was excessive, so...\nCHARACTERS. I admit I didn't relate too much to the three protagonists at the beginning, but the more you hear dialogues, and you see their interactions, the more I've appreciated them. I really liked the dialogues, their conflicts and the moments when Boston Law is on his own speaking and commenting about stuff on his own.\nMUSIC. Another very strong point of the game: beautiful strings and atmosphere tracks always accompany your journey in this unknown world. On top of that a dynamic engine will make music change according to your actions (this only in few particular situations, of course)---CONs--- INCOMPATIBILITIES. Of course this is the classic Ol game released and forgotten so when you play you'll see a small window pop up... And you can't set any option. Luckily there's always the Steam community ready to help, so I quickly found out that I had to check the DPI options in the compatibility tab of dig.exe properties, while for the full screen the good old ALT+ENTER will just work fine... B-)\nDURATION. Unfortunately it's quite short. Even though there are long dialogue sections this game really didn't lasted too long and it's a great pity... I Demand Moar!!!

You don't want to just come in to a room and finish everything in it; in the first few seconds.

Discovering and exploring a lost civilization, pondering on humanity's existence, its condition - that's all that this game is about.\n\nI found that the story has a few darker turns, but occasionally it has that cheesiness that in some of the cut scenes. I felt that a couple were overplayed and were not appropriate if one was really in this situation. They have a certain Lucas silliness honestly.\n\nI recommend to get this game if you liked Myst. This being its unnoticed brother with a tendency for, like Myst a couple of not perfect puzzles.\nThe game is slow and at times sluggish - you can't skip dialogue lines and some animations take too long.\nA great ambient soundtrack though makes the ride worth it. Its one of these nice commentaries on what lies there in the stars and the limits of a human being.\n\nA big thank you to The Vintage Feeling for being a really nice person and gifting a copy of the game to me.","May 17, 2015","true","9.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","5"

A total classic point-and-click game with excellent music, graphics (for it's time) and voice acting. The store line is so complex, amazing, and not at all what you would expect. The puzzles are challenging, and yes, there is some "back-and-forth" that is required, (i.e. you will have to go from one side of the game to the other to get an object in order to move on). The back-and-forth though, while mildly annoying is totally worth it, in the context of the puzzles over-all, and the plot which continually makes you question, "what is going on here?"\n\nOne of the best made games of the era in my opinion.

The soundtrack was created by Michael Land, and it is definitely one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.\n\nAs for the "Outdated feel" of the game, I wouldn't let that sort of thing bother me since it's full of AMAZING and UNIQUE layouts, backgrounds, characters and creatures. The cast is brilliant. Robert Patrick (T-1000 from T2) lent his voice talent as Boston Lowe.

As others mentioned, the music fits very well, the graphics and the story is okay also. There are some really good reviews, so I won't go into the details why this game is awesome.\nI've read all the negative comments because I was curious what are the cons.\nThe dialogues are crucial in a point and click game, sometimes you have to interact with others to move forward,  deal with it.\nThe other one was the difficulty. All I can say, welcome to the 90s. Yeah, the game is hard, and not so straight forward as games nowadays, but that makes it challenging. I don't think there are much pixel hunting and there are clues most of the cases, what to do. I agree that keys are annoying but I think a little trial-and-error can be forgiven in an alien environment. :) The thing with the bats annoyed me also, I was pretty sure I tried to use the flashlight earlier, but there was a clue here also. Most of the time, Brink was working on the relic but when time has come to scare him, he was fumbling with the crystals, and he was visible from the bat cave too. Nevertheless, I understand the frustration in this case.\nIf you get boring due to the long movements and animations, you can skip these if you want. No matter, how long an animation is, you can skip it with Esc (it is in the manual too) and you can move quickly through scenes with double click: you are teleported to the double-clicked new area (e.g. room). So there are tricks to speed up the game.","December 26, 2015","true","13.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

With LucasArts developing and a combination of Orson Scott Card and Steven Spielberg writing the game's story, you would expect something of a fairly high calibre. Unfortunately that isn't the case.\n\nAtmospherically the game is rich - warm coastal seascapes and alien sunsets accompanied by a wonderful ambient score which benefits from rich infusions of Wagnerian excerpts (the third track 'Ghosts' is sublime). The history of the defiled planet is intriguing to say the least, and labouring to uncover the secrets is actually pretty fun. But what drags down the game are the repetitve puzzles (I was absolutely sick of the rods), the embarrassingly dated animated and 3D sequences, the sub-standard dialogue, and a cast of boring characters. The ending which I chose was an incompatibly sappy finish to an otherwise cynical and forlorn narrative, but the other one could be better - it's not like I could have saved right before the end and watched both, since there's no way to save your progress from within the launcher. It was an admittedly tiring straight six hours.\n\nIf you're a fan of point and click adventure games then this is half-heartedly recommended, but if not then it's maybe better to just leave The Dig alone.","January 11, 2014","true","6.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It was certainly a trip back to the old school Lucasarts' point 'n click. I'm going to try to give an objective review since I never played it before now.\n\nAudio: I've played both the GOG version and the Steam version. I couldn't read any difference despite what other reviews have said. The music is good, eerie at times, definitely atmospheric and I think works for the setting. A dead alien world. The dialogue is clear and fine but the voice acting is a bit inconsistent. Robert's voice as Commander Low is perfect. You can definitely tell the difference between a professional actor in his element and the other's sometimes wooden delivery of dialogue. That said every does a good job and I particularly liked the Alien language what little is heard anyway.\n\nGraphics: They are old. Great for their time. But old. At times I cringed at what used to be so stunning to my generation back in the day. Some of the cut scenes are quite good actually. The Tram underwater scens looks impressive for their time and I imagine I would have been blown away back then.\n\nGameplay: The puzzles are tough. There is little in the way of hints. If you miss something going back through the tunnels and trams is tedious and annoying. Though you can at times skip bits of it by double clicking on the edge of the screen and you'll jump to the next scene which can be handy.\n\nThe game requires you to figure things out by trial and error. Click part A to parts B thru Z and you may find a connect. Honestly... use the youtube walkthru if you get stuck. The game should be about enjoyment... no one is going to judge you for cheating on a 22 year old game when you get stuck. Some of the solutions are ridiculous and there is one puzzle I would have strangled the devs for at an early stage in the game that I think almost broke me.\n\nSurprisingly there is no combat like in Indiana or Monkey Island which I think is a bit of a let down when you're supposed to be a tough military commander and you get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by a scientist... twice!\n\nThere are limited people to interact with and in that the game gets very lonely in a way.\n\nOverall I liked it and it was fun to play it because I missed out all those years ago but... I don't think it's for anyone unless it's on your bucket list.","March 16","false","9.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Thankfully, they didn't scrap the idea and turned it into one of the most amazing adventure games ever made.\n\nThe cutscenes may look dated and not as cool as the ones from Full Throttle, another Lucasarts masterpiece that came out that same year (1995), but the puzzles, music, sound FX and voices (well, maybe not Mary Weiss' and Steven Blum's performances) are top notch.\n\nInstead of spending large amounts of money into yet another generic, cookie cutter FPS, give this title a try. 21 years have passed, but it's still incredible.","January 28","true","8.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is not to say that it is without its merits, as there are a great many things it does quite well.  The game’s opening is effective and catching with a wonderful sense of mystery and foreboding.  As the story progresses, the plot does take some odd turns but I found I enjoyed it.  And it must be stated that even late into the game the art direction is fantastic and settings feel alien and strange.\n\nThat said, there are some big issues holding The Dig back: namely the puzzles.  After the opening segment, the puzzles quickly dive into nearly incomprehensible territory.  A great many of them are just frustrating and lacking any sort of direction or hints.  While this may be intentional, as exploring an alien world without guidance would undoubtedly be trying, it doesn’t make for a fun game.\n\nOverall, The Dig does have virtues but they are obscured by some terrible puzzle design.  I’d recommend the game only if one is exceptionally patient or willing to use a walkthrough.","November 24, 2015","false","7.0"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","19","37","0","0"

The puzzles weren't too difficult, but I, admittedly, lost my patience on some.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n- Cinematic story and animations\n- Great voice acting\n- Most puzzles meshed well with the story (didn't feel artificial or random)\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes identifying objects were difficult in a scene given the pixelation.\n- Some puzzles were very difficult without leaving any clues to help (requires a lot of patience and tinkering)","November 7, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game design and gameplay did not age well.\n\nA number of ridiculously far fetched puzzles, a few of which are plain illogical and counterintuitive, that too slowly unlock a forgettable story as you use a walkthrough pretty much every step of the way, while you you spend a lot of time walking back and forth, waiting for walking animations, screen scrolling, screen transitions and especially slow animations of puzzles. Many of the puzzles require too many mouse clicks to cycle through all the combinations of shapes and colours and make you wait for a slow animation to finish after every mouse click. What makes it worse is that you can't dial back, only forward. The story is not worth putting yourself through all that for.\n\nYou absolutely can't play this without a walkthrough. Ask an NPC the same exact question 4 times, then another question 2 times or you can't progress. That doesn't make sense. The worst puzzle in The Dig is more far fetched and random than anything I've seen in other old point and click adventures.\n\nYes the atmospheric music and voice acting are nice (for their time).\nOverall still not worth your time.","November 7, 2015","false","11.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/recommended/6040/","thecolorurple","TheColorUrple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/","511 products in account","+Some colorful, interesting environments\n+Pretty sharp writing and voice acting for the 90's\n+Double-click to fast travel\n\n-Obtuse puzzles\n-Pixel hunting with dated graphics = missed clues and hours of turning around in circles\n-An overabundance of poor design choices\n-Sloooooow movement\n\nThe Dig is not a logical game. It holds a special place in adventure gamers' hearts for its numerous merits, and this means that a negative review will certainly be unpopular. But ignore the fact that this is marked 0% helpful and bear with me anyway. The flaws in this game are largely due to adventure gaming tropes like pixel hunting and obscure puzzle solutions, but the critical difference is that in other, better adventure games, these are not detrimental to the fun factor.\n\nPixel hunting can be a pleasure if the environments are not only beautiful, but are crafted in a way that draws your eye to a certain place. In The Dig, objects are intentionally obscured using monochromatic color palettes. Also, there aren't many points during a puzzle where you will find yourself saying, "I need to find (this) in order to make this work." Partly due to the alien nature of the location, most inventory items are strange artifacts that must be arbitrarily used in combination with everything else in the environment until you figure out what they do. Items needed late in the game are mostly obtained very early on, which means you will try the Tusk with half of the entire game's points of interest until you actually use it correctly. I cannot stress this point enough: The Dig is illogical and thus not particularly fun.\n\nAgain, I understand that other LucasArts adventure games like Monkey Island or Grim Fandango also have these problems, but these game's illogical solutions enhance their comedic value, whereas the Dig has no such reward.\n\nPlay, in contrast, a game like Machinarium back-to-back with the Dig. In Machinarium, which also features a very strange world populated by strange machines, every puzzle contraption in every environment contains contextual clues that help the player understand what to do. There is a logical process to every puzzle, so while solutions are difficult, they never feel unfair, because each step in the puzzle reveals a critical aspect of its nature that, in turn, allows you to think differently about the next step. Machinarium is a hard game, but it is also a brilliant one. The Dig is also hard, but in a very different and ultimately unfulfilling way, since that logical process is not guided by design.\n\nThe Dig has a ton of examples I can offer where the design is flawed:\n\nOne puzzle has three holes that seem to beg the player to find three compatible objects to insert. In reality, you only need one object, as upon insertion, the other two holes magically sprout identical objects.\n\nIn another situation, you collect alien rods that, upon examination, reveal colored symbols which turn out to be lock combinations for certain doors. You have several in your inventory, but there is no logical way to determine which combinations to use for which door, forcing constant trial-and-error. One of these rods, the first you pick up in fact, your player refuses to examine for no discernible reason. If the player logically assumes that each rod, when examined, will yield the same uninterested reaction, that player will never even realize that there are combinations to view until he/she has had the brilliant idea to examine the other rods for an arbitrary change in object design.\n\nIn another puzzle, an image flashes on the screen - a location in the game that you have to go to. Unfortunately, the image is low detail and not very well drawn, and you can only access it once. Miss it or interpret it incorrectly, and you'll never know what the game was trying to tell you.\n\nAnother puzzle involves scaring a colleague with some animals. The problem? The colleague, who remains at the same place for virtually the entire game, does not react to these animals at all when you release them before you're supposed to. But the same exact action performed later on when the game wants you to do it? The colleague suddenly freaks out.\n\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\nThese design choices don't make the game unplayable, but they add a thick layer of frustration and ultimately take the fun out of finding the answer. And of course, you'll have to spend lots of time backtracking with your terribly slow walking speed to rescan the same static screens with your mouse to see if there was anything you didn't pick up on. In these situations, suddenly happening upon a solution or a critical puzzle piece does not feel rewarding; instead, it feels cheap. I had countless sparks of inspiration that didn't pan out, waiting for my guy to cross the screen at his casual pace to go and try another probably futile idea. Whereas a logical adventure game would have me stop and just think, ultimately coming up with the correct answer, you can apply no such mental process in The Dig. Most of it will be trial-and-error based, crossing your fingers each time that whatever nonsense thing you try will actually work.\n\nPlot-wise, The Dig is passably interesting, and there is some natural-feeling and well-written dialogue (Orson Scott Card), but the sci-fi plot turns into utter nonsense - a late-game assertion that there are 3 dimensions of time and 3 dimensions of space that combined form "Space Time 6" almost made me uninstall.\n\nI also fell asleep on the game no less than 3 times. Maybe it's the synthesizer playing endless loops of long, reverb-heavy chords on the Sci-Fi setting that lulled me. Or maybe it's the total lack of interest.\n\nDespite all of this, I finished the game, but mostly because I am a completionist that way. I cannot recommend this game to anyone at all. This isn't the 90's fault though, nor is it adventure gaming. Broken Sword, The Longest Journey, Riven, the Monkey Island series - all games that are vastly superior to The Dig. It is no surprise that it holds spot #92 on adventuregamers.com's Top 100 list.\n\nAt one point, the characters in The Dig discuss what would have happened if they had overlooked a crucial item.\n\n"Who can understand why aliens do what they do?" one says to the other. "Maybe it's a test of our intelligence."\n\n"Or maybe it's a test of our dumb luck," the other responds.\n\nI think it's the latter.\n\n\n2/10","January 14, 2014","false","7.7"," 27 of 57 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","27","57","3","2"

These live or die on two things: the strengths of their story and puzzles. This game carries both.\n\nThe story would fit right in as a sci-fi blockbuster: a team on a mission to save the earth from an asteroid discovers it's actually a ship, and get stranded on a deserted planet. And that's just the first 10 minutes. Time to explore the ruins and get back home. Includes the usual sci-fi commentary on the hazards of the pursuit of certain goals -- I'm trying to stay spoiler-free, but you'll understand as you find & use the green crystals.\n\nThe puzzles are difficult but not unfair. (These days you have online walkthroughs, but where's the fun in that?) There's the usual inventory-combination tricks, but there are also environmental puzzles like operating the controls of a crane with the input of a series of colors, each of which performs a certain movement.\n\nGraphics are a little dated in HD times, but don't let that stop you.","January 4, 2011","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It invokes feelings of wonder and awe, of horror and amazement.

I can't do that. I can't use these two things together.." And then all of a sudden you can. Bloody awesome.\n\nIt's an old game, but it isn't great. This game was a pretty sub-par pixel-hunt of a light Adventure game in the nineties and that has only changed for the worse with the windowed mode that the game starts up in by default - it's really much easier to miss points of interest now that everything is so much smaller in a 640x480 window. I would really recommend hitting Alt+Enter a few times to switch between window mode and fullscreen, when you enter a new scene for the first time. Perhaps not all the time, because it certainly isn't pretty in full-screen.\n\nThe game is pretty easy, with just one brain-teaser, and it's kind of short in itself, but is made long by the slow moving and uninteruptable cutscenes and likewise dialogue. The hardest parts of the game are made hard by a really shoddy 2D design and slow moving. At least 80% of my gametime was spent on just moving around looking for items I missed. I spend about 12 hours completing it, even though Steam counted 17, because I also had an odd issue with unresponsive controls that made it impossible to save and quit the game for quite a while.\n\nEverything is really slow and painful in this game. There is no running and there is no skipping cutscenes or zapping your way through dialogue and only in some cases are you able to skip past the walking animation straight into the next scene. The game is much more a challenge of patience than of puzzling strength.\n\nThe story and dialogue is pretty boring, which makes it quite an unusual LucasArts Adventure game. In pretty much all LucasArts Adventure game dialogue is an essential part of the game with funny and wacky lines, but in The Dig dialogue is virtually completely devoid of any humor and substance. There are a few attempts of humor, but it's just cute and silly somehow. For the most part dialogue is completely pointless. The only time dialogue is remotely funny is when it happens during action sequences. The voices are not really bad, but the characters and lines are. At best you may almost be able to chuckle one time throughout the whole game. The puzzles are generally pretty easy and straight forward, but all the unskippable dialogue and incessant walking are quite taxing to the point where you'll be tempted to fly through the game with a walkthrough. There is really only one brain-teaser. I had to look up a solution once, because I got the head and tail piece mixed up. After you've depleted every "topic" in a conversation it goes blue, but it's reset on exit! Ugh!! Sometimes there is new content, but mostly there is not and it's really annoying to have to listen to the same uninterruptable dialogue again while you examine your options.\n\nI got stuck a few times, because of the 2D design and a really poor visual representation of interactive areas. The game is made up of scenes, that doesn't move until you walk close to the edge. The game also has a very poor depth of vision and there is no highlighting of points of interest even though most items do look different. As I said, "pixel-hunt" is the key-word and even though there are rarely more than a few points of interest in each scene you still need some attention to detail.\n\nThere is no manual included in Steam and there is no menu in the game, but the function key F5 brings up the Settings/Game Menu. Sometimes it doesn't work.\n\nA few hints, which isn't going to spoil anything for you, but I will add spoiler tags nonetheless.\n\n\n\nThere is a red metal rod, which can also be used in the Tomb room in a rather senseless way.\n\nAt some point you come across a scene with a derelict spaceship - among other things there is chest just on the inside of the ship. Inside that chest is an item that will enable you to find the only item, and a vital one of that, that can't be found in any other way.\n\nAt some point there is a scene with water in the middle, the area known as the Map Spire, that has a natural bridge across. On the west side is a Tram and on the east side is a Cavern. Just a few nodges east of the Tram there is also an Opening. Once inside the Cavern on the east side there is also a Nest on the left side.\n\nI am not really sure I like this game. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are craving for an Adventure game and your list has grown really short.\n\nIt's a very naive game on a more serious and somber note than is usual for LucasArts Adventure games. While there is no nudity, there is both violence and death. The game starts as a pretty mundane story with a cast of equally mundane and boring characters, then it becomes a sci-fi adventure and in the end it turns into a typical american meta-physical Happy End. Somehow the game actually reminds me in bits and pieces of the end of the movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The influence of Steven Spielberg is quite clear, especially in the end, which is really too bad.\n","April 5, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a perfect showcase for all that is good about Lucasarts adventure games - especially given it's deadly serious nature. This was a departure at the time, as Lucasarts had a reputation for games that were wacky (Day of the Tentacle), darkly humourous (Sam and Max) or just plain straight forward satire (Monkey Island). The Dig is none of those. It's a masterpiece of story telling and a fine example of how the genre can be used to tell a drama.\n\nBUT\n\nThe puzzles are thoroughly obnoxious. A lot of them don't make much sense even after you solve them, and there's a *lot* of back tracking needed to see if anything has changed and what can be done. There's also a lot of pixel hunting as useable objects blend seamlessly into the background. So, The Dig is also an example of the worst of the genre.\n\nIt's a very lovely game, but don't expect something straightfoward and logical like Broken Age or any of the Telltale games. You will be challenged. You will be frustrated. You will probably have to look up the solutions to some of the puzzles. But that was part of the genre in those days. People didn't complain how unfair Infocom adventures were at the time, but nobody would dare make one as illogical nowadays (Well, maybe Starship Titanic counts).

Here's my review:\n\nI recommend The Dig only to true fans of the old school point-and-click adventure genre. The puzzles are very abstract and can prove to be a challenge. There's a lot of pixel hunting for hard-to-see objects that kind of blend into the environment. There's a lot of slow walking from section to section. For someone who isn't a fan of this genre, this game will not convert you.\n\nBut, I still have to give it a thumbs up because it's a great adventure game at it's core. It has a few faults (the game is over 20 years old, after all), but they are easily overlooked.\n\nThe story is AMAZING and unravels in carefully crafted layers that will make you want to keep pressing on to see what happens next. The characters are developed, feel real, and all of them are backed by superb voice acting. The world is vibrant and beautifully illustrated. There's a sense of exploration and mystery that few games manage to capture as well as The Dig. It's a very rewarding experience to complete this game.\n\nIf you are a fan of the old school point and click adventure games, and especially the Lucasart's games, then this is a MUST PLAY.","August 11, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were many occasions where the background art still impresses and most of the puzzles are fun to solve with the exception of the genre tried and true obscure solutions and easily overlooked locations. The story and mystery is engaging but the characters and dialog really bring down the fun. These people should be highly trained professional astronauts, yet they're full of egotistical sarcasm and insubordination (Lookin' at you Maggie). I was excited to see how well a 5 character crew could come into play with puzzles and comedy, but it's massively missed opportunity as two of the 5 crew members are completely out of the picture after the opening. There are animated cutscenes that amplify the presentation but they're slightly inconsistant in quality.

Geez, you're a tough crowd. Okay, well it's your standard full-talkie puzzle-and-story-driven adventure fare running on everyone's favorite SCUMM engine seen in such games as The Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. Unlike those games, however, it uses a much more simplified interface which more closely resembles a typical Telltale adventure. One click fits all, and there aren't a vast many things you can click on in any one screen. Not that there's a lack of things to look at, however. Be prepared for some truly gorgeous alien scenery. And don't forget it - it may help calm you down when you inevitably get stuck. Don't get me wrong, The Dig isn't supermassively hard. But there always seems to be that one thing that just doesn't enter your mind, or something you never think to pick up, or the turtle skeleton puzzle. It doesn't help that you probably only have access to - and the materials to work on - one or two puzzles at any given time. So once you're stumped, there's nothing really to do but walk around as you become increasingly frustrated. This does, however, come hand-in-hand with an immense feeling of satisfaction whenever you complete a challenging puzzle without consulting the Internet, so it's not entirely a bad thing. Overall, The Dig is a little more serious than the LucasArts adventures you may already know and love, but in the long run it's a beautiful game with a strong atmosphere, a decent story, and several interesting and occasionally brain-racking puzzles. If you've played the other classics, The Dig deserves the next spot in your collection.","January 8, 2013","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I can't do that. I can't use these two things together.." And then all of a sudden you can. Bloody awesome.\n\nIt's an old game, but it isn't great. This game was a pretty sub-par pixel-hunt of a light Adventure game in the nineties and that has only changed for the worse with the windowed mode that the game starts up in by default - it's really much easier to miss points of interest now that everything is so much smaller in a 640x480 window. I would really recommend hitting Alt+Enter a few times to switch between window mode and fullscreen, when you enter a new scene for the first time. Perhaps not all the time, because it certainly isn't pretty in full-screen.\n\nThe game is pretty easy, with just one brain-teaser, and it's kind of short in itself, but is made long by the slow moving and uninteruptable cutscenes and likewise dialogue. The hardest parts of the game are made hard by a really shoddy 2D design and slow moving. At least 80% of my gametime was spent on just moving around looking for items I missed. I spend about 12 hours completing it, even though Steam counted 17, because I also had an odd issue with unresponsive controls that made it impossible to save and quit the game for quite a while.\n\nEverything is really slow and painful in this game. There is no running and there is no skipping cutscenes or zapping your way through dialogue and only in some cases are you able to skip past the walking animation straight into the next scene. The game is much more a challenge of patience than of puzzling strength.\n\nThe story and dialogue is pretty boring, which makes it quite an unusual LucasArts Adventure game. In pretty much all LucasArts Adventure game dialogue is an essential part of the game with funny and wacky lines, but in The Dig dialogue is virtually completely devoid of any humor and substance. There are a few attempts of humor, but it's just cute and silly somehow. For the most part dialogue is completely pointless. The only time dialogue is remotely funny is when it happens during action sequences. The voices are not really bad, but the characters and lines are. At best you may almost be able to chuckle one time throughout the whole game. The puzzles are generally pretty easy and straight forward, but all the unskippable dialogue and incessant walking are quite taxing to the point where you'll be tempted to fly through the game with a walkthrough. There is really only one brain-teaser. I had to look up a solution once, because I got the head and tail piece mixed up. After you've depleted every "topic" in a conversation it goes blue, but it's reset on exit! Ugh!! Sometimes there is new content, but mostly there is not and it's really annoying to have to listen to the same uninterruptable dialogue again while you examine your options.\n\nI got stuck a few times, because of the 2D design and a really poor visual representation of interactive areas. The game is made up of scenes, that doesn't move until you walk close to the edge. The game also has a very poor depth of vision and there is no highlighting of points of interest even though most items do look different. As I said, "pixel-hunt" is the key-word and even though there are rarely more than a few points of interest in each scene you still need some attention to detail.\n\nThere is no manual included in Steam and there is no menu in the game, but the function key F5 brings up the Settings/Game Menu. Sometimes it doesn't work.\n\nA few hints, which isn't going to spoil anything for you, but I will add spoiler tags nonetheless.\n\n\n\nThere is a red metal rod, which can also be used in the Tomb room in a rather senseless way.\n\nAt some point you come across a scene with a derelict spaceship - among other things there is chest just on the inside of the ship. Inside that chest is an item that will enable you to find the only item, and a vital one of that, that can't be found in any other way.\n\nAt some point there is a scene with water in the middle, the area known as the Map Spire, that has a natural bridge across. On the west side is a Tram and on the east side is a Cavern. Just a few nodges east of the Tram there is also an Opening. Once inside the Cavern on the east side there is also a Nest on the left side.\n\nI am not really sure I like this game. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are craving for an Adventure game and your list has grown really short.\n\nIt's a very naive game on a more serious and somber note than is usual for LucasArts Adventure games. While there is no nudity, there is both violence and death. The game starts as a pretty mundane story with a cast of equally mundane and boring characters, then it becomes a sci-fi adventure and in the end it turns into a typical american meta-physical Happy End. Somehow the game actually reminds me in bits and pieces of the end of the movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The influence of Steven Spielberg is quite clear, especially in the end, which is really too bad.\n","April 5, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A wonderful cast of characters keeps you invested with the story if the subject matter doesn't. You'll find yourself getting attatched to some of the terrifically realized characters. When it becomes apparent that there's a traitor in your midst, an agent of Big Pile, you'll be left breathless as you try to find who it is before the whole dig is endangered, and the twist ending will blow your mind.\n\n","December 18, 2010","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aesra/recommended/6040/","aesra","Aesra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aesra/","68 products in account","The Dig was released in the closing days of the point-and-click adventure genre, back in 1995. Unfortunately, due to a number of delays which beset the development team during its production, it was released years later than intended. By this point it was considered 'dated', despite its fantastic story dreamt up by none other than Steven Speilburg himself, and was poorly reviewed.\nThe Dig is an underappreciated gem of a game that I believe any adventure fan would find worth in revisiting. Its graphics, though outdated even at the time of its release, are still beautiful in their own way. The bright environments of the alien world Cocytus look as though they were drawn with colour wheels and charts always at hand!\n\nPros:\n- An intriguing and well-written story which will keep you guessing, easily its best quality\n- Beautiful, colourful environments\n- Well composed; its score is moody and atmosperic\n- Features the voices of a number of celebrity voice actors, including Steve Blum and Robert Patrick; also, most of the voice acting is extremely well done\n- Quirky 2D animated cutscenes, like MS Paint Disney!\n\nCons:\n- Frustrating and extremely time-consuming puzzles which require a lot of trial and error. Trust me, you'll end up looking for hints more than once\n- It is a very old game, so it displays in a tiny box in the middle of the screen and can't be resized\n- While I said above most of the voice acting is good, Robert Patrick occasionally voices his lines with a little less emotion than he should\n- The game is very short if played with a guide, so the difficulty of the puzzles was probably intended to pad out the game's length.\n\nTL;DR: This is an old game, and of a genre that's lost its popularity.

The Dig is one of lucas art's point and click adventure games from the 80's and 90's. However this particular game is unique and rises above the rest due to the names attached: Diologue by Orson Scott Card, Idea by Stephen Spielberg, and voice work by the T-1000 himself Robert Patrick. As such The Dig delivers primarily in the story department, and the puzzles and gameplay are not quite as steller. A lot of them are simply trial and error and will leave you searching the internet for the solution because you are lazy and or don't have the time to try all of the possible combinations.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigscaryprawn/recommended/6040/","bigscaryprawn","bigscaryprawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigscaryprawn/","22 products in account","I picked this up becuase I have very fond memories of this game from when I was in middle school, spending the summer with my friend, struggling over the crazy hard puzzles, tons of aha moments, and being immersed in a classic sci fi world.  I got nostalgic and decided to part with a couple bucks for old time's sake.\n\n~20 years later, the game is still amazing.  The graphics are obviously dated, though with the uptick in popularity in pixel graphics it's right at home with what is popular now with adventure games.  The 20 year hiatus made me forget the bulk of the puzzles, so it seems fresh enough, but I have certain scenes that stuck out in my memory, so triggering them again was like reliving a joyous time from my past.\n\nObviously, I'm biased towards liking this game, but if you are reading the review of a sci fi point and click adventure game from 1995, you are probably just as biased as I am.\n\nNow, some of the puzzles are rediculously random.  If you can play this game cold without getting a couple of hints from a walkthough, you sir, are in a different league of gamer than I am.  I won't look down on you if you need a hint every once in a while, I sure did (wtf orb with the pointy spinning bit).  But, randomness in the puzzles adds to the mystique of the alien world, so it works out thematically.\n\nBottom line, I'm super glad that I found the game on Steam, and would recommend the game to anyone into challenging puzzles, great sci fi writing, and the golden age of adventure gaming.","June 3, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the puzzles are HARD.  Not a bad purchase if you like old point and clicks I suppose.  This one is more about the story than the puzzles or the humor.\n\nOccasionally the game bugs out and even when you hit F5 it wont let you save.  Prolly some issue of alt-tabbing, just mashed the keyboard and control key and it seemed to fix it self.","April 28, 2011","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
