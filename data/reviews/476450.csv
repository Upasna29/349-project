It is cheap, fun, and challenging. My only real complaint is that there is no instructions for the game. It doesn't tell you any controls or what the goal of the game is. If you want to see some gameplay of the first zone check out the video below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYpaW0iAKb8","June 4","true","2.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

On your beginning mode, you get the perfect balance of hard and easy. There's also a nice arsenal of weapons you can purchase at the shops. This game is deeply rewarding with huge blood splatters after slaughtering semi-cute pixel-art monsters.\n\nSo yeah, get it. Now.","June 4","true","0.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Highly addictive and very interesting concept and awesome graphic style. I think it could do with a simple tutorial at the start, show the people the controls and the goals, this it what stumped me at the beginning as i had no idea that i was meant to defeat a boss, or that i was meant to find him at all(on the first level i camped at the shop and bought pretty much everything from shooting the adjacent, until i found the boss) . I was also annoyed because i could not switch between guns that i had bought, but i think its suppose to be like that. Don't take that the wrong way, i love this game and its super fun. I give this a game a 9.7/10. It's super cheap and only 32MB.","June 4","true","3.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The music is good. The game is addicting, I've played for one hour straight and didn't stop. The levels or stages have different feels to them. All the bosses are fun to try to beat. (Then lose all the lives) When you die you don't lose everything, (ex. points) whick makes it feel like every life lost has did somthing good for me. The shop is done extremely well. It's easy to navigate.\n\nThe music gets old quickly but you can easily turn it off and play your own music. The level design is bland. However since the levels are randomly generated, there is always a new level every time you start a new game.\n\nOverall I give the game a 8/10. The gameplay, levels, shop, and most obviously blood make the game addicting. This is a game I will always remember, because of the experice you have while playing it. This game it worth the money to give it try.","June 3","true","5.1"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","2"
