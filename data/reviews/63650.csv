I played this back in its release year. I'm not sure if that was a good choice though, because of my age at the time, I looked at a bunch of walkthroughs, and therefore spoiled a bunch. :P\nRegardless, even after being 10 (11 for non-expansion)  years old. This is still by far one of my top 5 favourite games of all time!\nThe reason I don't have many play hours is because... well, I've played it a hundred times over before it even came to Steam. :P\n\nThis game has many many abstract worlds, mind boggling puzzles, a very unique style of gameplay, and so much more!\n\nDespite Cyan still updating the Uru: Live (free online!) version of it, I'd really like to see a new game similar to this with improved physics, graphics and such. They did attempt to change physics before with the current game, but well... to many things broke for them to keep it, and despite being so old, the grahpics are still very good for its time, and it is almost gaureteed to not even lag on newer systems that are crap!\n\nAnyhow, that's besides the point. If you love adventure-puzzle games, you should really check this game out!","October 13, 2014","true","43.3"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","24","24","0","2"

However, you should be at least familiar with how these games work.\n\nTo answer the questions:\n\nNo, you don't need to have played or liked the other games but if you haven't at least played them, or remotely liked them, then this game is not for you.\n\nIf you felt like a genius when you finally solved a puzzle by yourself then you will feel like the most intelligent person ever when, or more likely if, you solve even ONE of the puzzles contained in this game without a guide, especially if you can solve the final ones without any hints what-so-ever.\n\nThe puzzles in this game range from mind-screws and mind numbingly difficult to fourth dimensional radical geometry, in that some of the answers seem to come from nowhere. Each book (Books represent different levels) is a self contained world with its own puzzles and is not connected to other books (at least the base game), so there is no jumping from book to book, but you may have to jump out and back in to advance to different areas within the book. Some of the puzzles are quite interesting once you realize what they are actually about. The expansion levels and their puzzles become almost impossible, as if it were designed for multiple people to play at once to solve them (which it was but doesn't have, at least on Steam) but it can still be solved by one person.\n\nSolving the final puzzle will feel like a test of endurance and strength more than intelligence.\n\nSo, would I recommend this game?\n\nYes.\n\nAs much as I disliked figuring some of the puzzles out without any assistance, I can say that I did not dislike the game. I even sort of liked the original levels, once I understood them that is. There were times I was amazed at the level design or when a puzzle was solved and its solution displayed.\n\nThe levels were beautifully designed. Once the story behind a level became known, the design of the level became more interesting.\n\nThe game URU is about discovering the history of the lost civilization of the D'ni. (The past)\n\nThe expansion To D'ni is about the remains of the civilization. (The present)\n\nThe final expansion, Path of the Shell, is about a future that will never be.\n\n\ntl;dr head bashing puzzles, interesting levels, missing multiplayer portion, decent game.","December 31, 2013","true","31.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

It's a picture of dysfunctional brilliance that awes the player with it's original ideas but flubs the most basic game design principles. This is a game that you will want to play without a walkthrough but it will likely end up being impossible. Having to resort to the walkthrough really will dampen the fun. There are puzzles in which it assumes the player has beaten Riven (and kept their notes from said Riven playthrough) it actually requires you to have clues/knowledge gleaned from other games to solve a few puzzles.\n\n(spoilers)\nThere are also some rather infamous puzzles in which the effects of your actions don't show up for 15 IN GAME minutes making it difficult to tell what you actually did and there is even one puzzle which can only be solved by standing on a spot and literally being afk for 15 minutes.\n","June 4","false","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bernlak/recommended/63650/","Bernlak","slusho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bernlak/","153 products in account","For a myst game I was expecting a lot better. I'm not going to say much in this review, but; you can play the game for free on its site. Its visuals still have that amazing myst charm but it's clear from the start that this was designed to be a multiplayer game. You'll find yourself walking through large open spaces that don't contain puzzles which can be a bore even though they are quite a pleasure to look at. I don't think I mentioned that this game isn't the standard "on-rail point & click" adventure that myst was. URU isn't pronounced as a word. It is pronounced "You are you" in the sense that you don't control the standard myst protaganist who has been given the alias, "the stranger" on his voyage across the uncharted D'ni landscape. Instead you are given an avatar that you design with standard and "Cyan worlds themed" clothing. You play in third person with first as an option. I won't give you much to the story if you actually plan to play this, as it is in itself a "Myst game" but the premise is; you go to New Mexico because Obama told you to or something and you find this guy in an rv who tells you to find the clues. Thats it. You are then sent out finding linking books solving some-what clever puzzles; finding more clothing crap for your avatar. I did find the game quite entertaining however as a third person adventure game. Imagine Zelda without enemies, items, or dungeons. This game makes a nice extension of the D'ni's world and a nice item for myst fans to have in their collection but otherwise, play Myst or Riven instead.\n\nP.s. The game takes place hundreds of years after the strangers adventures in Myst and Riven. SPOILERS: There is a D'ni renovation project going on in the game where the npcs (which you never see) are rebuilding gateways and fixing books. By this I mean; the D'ni perished a long time ago; you won't be finding any new or familiar friends on your lonely trek around pre-discovered locations in the Myst universe. The only signs of life are holograms and cave paintings. Once again; clearly a multiplayer project.\n\nP.p.s. There are no multiplayer features in the game.","December 1, 2013","false","10.9"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

I certainly love the first two myst titles and was quite willing to depart from the myst formula a bit to try 3rd person modern blending etc. but:\na) the controls are insane and jumping around just doesn't work, so you get insanely frustrated\nb) the whole thing seems like a big WoW fetch-quest with no xp reward... you're finding these 7 cloth banners in every area and I don't feel like playing where's waldo the video game.\nc) the game is pretty much a walking simulator: it doesn't feel urgent in any way and while the visuals are interesting even by today's standards, it often seems like there's no purpose in anything your doing\nd) related to the last point, the story in myst and riven really created a sense of urgency without overly stressing you out... you wanted to discover more about the mystery. Well, the writing I saw was mysterious enough all right, but more on the insanity level... there weren't many understandable characters or w/e, tho I did like yeesha the one time I met her.\ne) environments seem incredibly empty, and arguably quite boring... few things are actually interactive and this seems quite odd coming from Cyan.\nf) I went to an age that listed "visitors" and the last person to visit that age apparently was in 2004, unless I'm misunderstanding things...\n\nSo, despite some interesting ideas and visuals that looked like they might be interesting, I largely judge this title irrelevant by today's standards, since I'm incredibly bored after 4 hours of not knowing what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I'm doing or why I should care about it. Very dissapointing since, as I said, I rather love Myst and Riven... don't buy unless you like dissapointment or have some godly level of patience and a masochistic streak to your gaming life... ugh :(","September 7, 2015","false","13.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The puzzles are endless and deeply complex as only myst can be. I dont think i will ever complete this as its so huge with the 2 expansion packs included. You feel like a lost explorer in a world that should be filled with people but has long since been inexpliccably abandoned...\nThe ability to keep your very own Journal as you play is sublime...\n\n4/5","October 7, 2011","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing this though, I seriously saw what I was missing and that I never really did understand wtf is going on in the first game (which then led to me avoding the next 2 being RIven and Myst III).  Back in 2004 this game completely drew me into the worlds (ages they are called) I was journeying to and since then I haven't had the same experience with any other game.  URU Live was the big thing back then as everyone was trying to log into the beta and it was worse than a slideshow, seriously nobody moved and the frame would advance every 30 seconds or so.  Another attempt with Gametap was a success but wasn't raking in the money Gametap wanted so they closed it down once again which was a bad mistake as they suffered a lot of members cancelling memberships, including myself as this was the only game I wanted there.\n\nThis year the game is actually back. join in on the","June 26, 2012","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Myst and Riven were far and above my favorites, maybe due to nostalgia, but after playing through URU, this one get the top spot for me.\n\nOne thing to note is that this version is full of glitches that would probably be game breaking to someone who doesn't buy into the slow paced exploration type games.  I had to re-set ages multiple times and there's a couple of spots where you'll fall through the floor or get stuck on a ladder.  It turns into a chore to get past these areas and will definately not help in making any new fans.\n\nBut, all that being said this game is extremely well thought out and crafted (aside from the above mentioned glitches).  The worlds feel large and organic, and I was totally immersed for the vast majority of the game play.  It's a must play for anyone that's a fan of Cyan, or any other puzzle exploration style games.  One of my new favorite games I've played.  10/10","March 3","true","79.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
