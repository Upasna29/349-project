I'm absolutely floored. La Peri is a short, but masterful experience that perfectly illustrates the potential of film and theatre for the VR medium. The environments, character designs, special effects, and performance art-- every  aspect of this piece is remarkable in its own right. This experience sets the gold standard for the Arts in VR.\n\nIf you're appreciate the arts: it's a no-brainer.\nIf you're a gamer: expand your horizons, and give this a try.","April 5","true","0.2"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

Wow, to think out that I might of missed out on this treasure. Truly inspirational and very well done. It was entertaining and much more comprehensive than I thought it would be. Clearly other developers should hire dancers to mocap—I felt much more connected and immersed because I knew there was a human in the movement I was seeing.\n\nDon't miss this one—well worth the $.","April 7","true","0.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

Not overwhelmed, not underwhelmed, but whelmed - lukewarm.  I had concerns about resolution, clarity, and comfort.  Were my lighthouses setup right?  Is this going in the drawer in a week?  I was really starting to doubt my purchase.\n\nThen I loaded up La Peri.  Like another reviewer, I didn't buy this game for me - I figured that ballet would be fun for my daugher.  But being a responsible parent, I wanted to experience it first and make sure there wasn't anything that was going to jump scare her or be a problem.\n\nMy preconceived notions have never been quite this wrong.  This "experience" is a totally new medium.  This isn't a play, or a ballet, or even interactive theater.  This is theater of the real.  In every way, the neurons in my brain believed 110% that I was standing on the stage.  Looking over the cliff.  Watching the dancer whirl around me.\n\nThe environments are breathtaking.  The flashlight seems out-of-place at first, but I quickly realized that it only further sold my brain on the reality of what I was seeing.  I spent 5 minute examining a scultpure with my eyes, my flashlight, and my physical positioning.  I held my breath as the dancer whooshed through me.  Felt real empathy when she was in peril.  Real thought behind the game's final choice.\n\nThe medium of VR storytelling was born this week.  A completely new way to communicate and express art just came into being.  And La Peri is an excellent first example of what that medium is capable of.  After experiencing this performance, I had to sit down and be introspective for about 10 minutes just to regain my emotional grounding.  Yes, it's that good.\n\nStop reading this review and buy it.  Enjoy the first coming of the new VR art form.  Transport yourself to a world far away from where you're physically standing.\n\nBravo, La Peri.  Merci.","April 7","true","1.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The first 3 are INCREDIBLY short (10-15 sec) moments of gameplay, and the final part features the actual dance. They call these sections dances, but the only one where dancing occurs is the last.\n\nAs a customer I was expecting multiple dances, and getting to either view the performance as an audience member or up on stage. I didn't care much at all about interacting, I just wanted to see the performance. I would show this game to friends if there were a way to fast forward to the only dance in the game, at the end. It is the only compelling part, sadly :*(","May 7","false","0.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It seemed a bit pricey but I bit the bullet and tried it out and I am glad I did. You feel like you are part of the play and the art style did not disappoint. Overall it is pretty short, especially for the price. It should cost about half that but I have no regrets with my purchase.

Watching the ballet dancer move around you is an amazingly immersive visual and I lost myself in the environment as I watched.  The game producers used mo-cap and it really shows since the dancer's movements look real!  It uses the Vive controllers and room-scale very well, with some interactivity including the ability to draw in the air for certain sequences.  Overall highly recommended, even if you aren't into ballet or dance performances!","April 22","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was finished it in 9 minutes. It is barely interactive, and the 'narrative' is difficult to understand.  The 4th act was visually interesting, but the whole experience was quite underwhelming to say the least.  Fleshed out into a full performance that you were actually involved in, this could be visually spectacular and engaging. As is though, $11 for 9 minutes of almost no interaction simply doesn't cut it.","April 9","false","0.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I felt like I was doing something wrong at first, so I tried everything to make the experience longer to no avail. The experience isn't something you'd really want to revisit multiple times, either.\n\nWhat they have is neat, but feels more like a demo than something worth $10. I'd recommend buying this at $5, or $10 with a lot more content added. As it stands, it's overpriced.","April 12","false","0.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
