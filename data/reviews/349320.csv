Apparently an update earlier wiped some people's actual saves. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nIf you're here looking for gameplay and not a fan of reading (which makes me wonder why you're reading this review), turn back now. Visual novels are basically voice-acted choose-your-own-adventure books with drawn characters and background. I'd also recommend you to turn back temporarily if you can't read Chinese, as currently, aside from certain menu options, it's completely in Chinese. The devs did say they'll release a free English translation eventually, but I don't think that'll come any time soon.\n\nIf you want to know more about Taiwanese history and don't mind strong anti-KMT (Chinese Nationalists) bias, then I highly recommend this VN. Even if you don't, I'd still recommend it, only for the sake of learning a bit more about that country that used to make a bunch of electronics while enjoying a decent VN.\n\nObjectively, The Rainy Port Keelung is a decent visual novel. Being an indie VN, the OP and voice acting can't compare to high quality Japanese VNs and was jarring to me at first, but I soon got used to it. I can't find fault with the background music, or the art for both characters and the background.\n\nWhat makes the VN great for me though is the setting, characters, and story. Set in a time where Taiwan is going through a cultural identy crisis between their Japanese colonial past and future under Chinese rule, the three main heroines parallel each culture. There is the super jealous childhood friend who was born in Taiwan, there is the kind-hearted and air-headed half Japanese half Taiwanese land lady who wears a yukata, and there is a tomboy ojousama who just arrived in Taiwan from the mainland. Rounding out the female cast is a cold, intelligent, calculating, and manipulative senpai who received education in Europe. The VN centers around the protagonist and his female acquaintances while cultural tensions rise and living conditions deteriorate around them.\n\nThe only major issue for The Rainy Port Keelung is its strong anti-KMT bias. Sure, all sides in the story have both good and bad guys, but the majority of the Chinese nationalists are clearly portrayed as evil. I can't even recall an evil character who identifies as Taiwanese or Japanese.","April 2, 2015","true","10.0"," 55 of 70 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","55","70","6","16"

It's extremly amazing, the graphics are really nice and the soundtrack is very beautiful. There's plenty of diffrent choices which changes the story somewhat and how the ending will turn out to be, so make sure you save each time you get to choose, incase you want to load back and try out another choice.\n\nAlso even tho there's a lot of good points about this game there is ofc also a few negative points such as there being no actuall translation to text besides the menu & interface being in english.... everything else is in chinese. But they did say they were working on getting the rest translated so I'm sure this won't really be a negative point later on.\n\n\nIf you like VN's that are diffrent or simply not like most other VN's (im ref to all these romance/dating VN's) or if you simply want to try out a VN that is more the opposite of most other VN's such as IMHHW (If My Heart Had Wings) then this game is for you.","November 29, 2015","true","8.7"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","34","46","2","0"

I dig into the game , the cutsence are nice. Although the dialouge in Japanese is not very good, I think the actress failed to pronounce frequently. It's still worth the price and keep my mind on the game. I pretty sure I'll finish this game. Nice one.","May 1","true","6.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
