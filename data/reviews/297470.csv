I know it's still in development, but it does need quite a bit of work. The UI is a bit tiring. The graphics are fair for a game like this. Lag makes hunting impossible. Character customization is less than satisfactory. No ranged weapons (yet at least). Item discriptions are fairly important, yet they only appear randomly. The worst part about this game...you pay $30 and you need a monthly subscription. I made the mistake of not reading that, so I screwed myself.\nThe crafting and skill systems are amazing.

I did buy the game. I was not aware of monthly payments. I was regretting buying the game, much having monthly payments. I guess everyone loves monthly payments, I would too.  Some things are very frustrating in this game. Since I just left long message in forum, I will keep it short here. I went throught most the tutorial. Some things are easy to find, some things I do not have a clue. I am not impressed with what others have built and gave up on I guess. Looks abandoned to me. I am bored to rashes. I went in all excited, but came out withered and contorted.\n\nI can't even recommend this game for $29 much less monthly payments along with with it.

MMO bu||sh\\t subscription models are a declining model or so I thought. Anyway suffice to say the game is complete garbage, I feel like giving a detailed review but its almost like whats the point, having only done research on the history of this game after getting it. It is disappointing and clear to see the developers have no idea what they are doing.\n\nThe engine is complete garbage.. I initially I thought it would be a good thing that the developers built there own engine, but this feels like feel like a decade old. Maybe just get with the times and jump onto unity or unreal to build your game on.\n\nThe ingame gui consists of flippin buttons and that is it.. sliders?  dropdowns? ui widgets anyone? or is that to be implemented in 2years once you've got enough on subscriptions. The character creation screen (can the character be any further away) alone is joke, and again lack of sliders.\n\nWent to the pvp server first, it was completely dead, and from there on realized just how I will never touch this game again unless the developers actually sort this mess out. Friend crashed out within after barely 5mins of being on the pvp server.\n\nI think what sucks about this game the most is that there are far better games to enjoy, ie sandbox building games with multiplayer aspect..\n\nAt a time when games like 7dtd, rust, reign of kings, the forest, etc all offer similar building, hunting, survival, trading gameplay, better gfx, allow players to play on multiple servers, even allow people to start there own server... offer far better gameplay. They don't have singleplayer storylines either. Games like this trying to go the MMO route completely owner controlled servers, ontop of poor gameplay, ui, gfx and bugs, zero singleplayer storyline.. its just sad, I feel like I'm kicking a dead horse, but I'm posting this just so that at least someone considering this game really does there research on it because right now the game sucks. In the 60mins of playing I didn't even get to the building or terrain deform aspects.. supposedly that was one of the big points of this title, but the way its designed, the actual feel of the game interface, there is no intuitive tutorial for players, sure there is the intro/help box you can go read through, but when you look at so many other games out now, you just go straight into playing and interacting with the world in very intuitive ways\n\nThere are ♥♥♥♥♥ minecraft servers made by kids with better thought process put into helping new players on the server with guides and directions as to where they can go to build in the world. This game you leave the main spawn area (which is completely flippin dead, not even npc's roam it) trying to find somewhere you can even see what the terrain deforming is like.. or base building. Instead everywhere I went after equipping the shovel in my right hand, with left hand empty as per the help instructions was left with a message "You can't do that here..."    ok.. so I spent 15mins running around the map trying to find an area to try out some of the terrain deform actions.. it left me with a clear message about the developers of this game. They are flippin morons, of all the things they could have done to make this easier, maybe even show on the tiny flippin minimap areas that are claimed so I don't bother going in that direction. Maybe show new players where they can go build etc.. nothing is done, the error message of you can't do that here, isn't followed up with directions of where you could go to do that, maybe a fullsize map to show areas that are blocked, or even why you can't do that here... The pvp server as I said is completely dead, so asking for help on it was met with zero response. Which sums up how many people are playing this game.\n\nAnd jumping animation, wow, jumping added skill points so while roaming the world I would jump every so far often to see the stupid jump animation... funny until out of no where enemy walked up and my character then proceeded spend over 10 seconds in exhaustion/fatigue, was getting hit and I couldn't even move.. died on spot and had to wait like a 1min before then being give the chance to spawn again at the spawn point..wow thanks so much, maybe just offer an uninstall button in that same flippin death screen.. there is no flippin point in forcing a player to wait a 1min! when the option they have is just being respawned back at the same spawn point they joined the flippin game you idiots, perhaps thoughtless aspect to the pvp server maybe.  Nothing in this game feels polished, you would think the character would start walking as it got to 10% or less energy so player is more aware of exhaustion. Even basic ♥♥♥♥ like [esc] actually going out of menus.. doesn't work.. its one way thing... everything in this game, its all just a bit amateur, I could go on with all my gripes on this game.. but I'll just stop. and say this...\n\nThe actual 2d icons gfx is probably the only decent thing in this game.. it at least looks professional.. the rest.. not so much.\n\nThe subscription model works with AAA games, it worked for WoW, there was a storyline and questing to actually add incentive to paying monthly, on top of the end game raiding and pvp aspect that also added incentive to keep paying to play after most storyline was done. However this game is just adding insult to customers for even buying it with its subscription aspect and its clear to see why its dead. After 60mins which I'm sure wasn't even enough to fully explore much of what this game has to offer ...it doesn't matter, you couldn't even pay me to play this crap because there is no way I would pay anything monthly for what it has.\n\nAnd I find it sad the game was out like 3years ago!.. and now its in early access, one can only wonder what improvements (or not) it went through before getting steam greenlit, its now in a permanent state of early access and you should feel privileged to play it, and pay the developers monthly for the complete experience... As opposed to the... you just bought this game for the price of many other much better games, but you can still populate its crappy world with your gimped skill cap and join another tribe because someone in that actually pays the monthly fee... for decade old gfx and gameplay... yeh sounds great, count me out.\n\nAnd another issue is that I'm really getting flippin annoyed with Steam allowing such titles.. that don't actually use steam auth, but instead require you to register new accounts elsewhere and worse subscription fees... there should be glaringly obviously notifications going through the purchase of such titles so buyers are made aware of just what they are buying into. Getting this game was like receiving a gift that you can't even take back and exchange for something else you would actually prefer. That is just how flippin sh\t steam is with its fk you consumer no returns bu||sh\\t, one hopes this game will someday not just be a awful title in my steam library, but I've written it off as the worst crap I've got my steam account now.","May 22, 2015","false","2.4"," 274 of 335 people (82%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","82","274","335","17","17"

This is completely dead, not a soul. There are SOOOO many options, buttons, etc. I've played many mmorphs like WoW, Tera, RIFT, etc. They all have a pretty straightforward setup, there was a terraforming skill I managed to find and everytime I went to atempt to use one of the abilities I got the response 'YOU MUST HAVE A SHOVEL EQUIPPED IN YOUR LEFT HAND' well I had already dragged a shovel to said hand, even tried switching it and my dagger, no luck.\n\nJust insanely confusing, GUI was not much better, graphic wise it looks better int he sceenshots than actual gameplay. If it's just one guy, it's pretty cool, but compared to all of the other games out there similar to this that have come out, it's not even in the same ballpark.","May 24, 2015","false","0.8"," 143 of 167 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","143","167","0","3"

Stay far away from it if you're looking for something that it is actually worth your money. The month you get with buying the game is fun, if you find some established players you can enjoy being around. After that, the $15 monthly fee is really hard to fork up.\n\nSaying the combat is crude would be a complement, and you are punished for completely filling up your food and water bar. If you can get around these playing elements, as it is still early access, then I would love to hear even one good reason to lump this with any other subscription based game that asks for that kind of money. I hear some people boast the terrain is pretty. I would say its more like a pretty big pain in the ♥♥♥ and the best graphical quality still pales in comparison to any other subscription based game.\n\n"But the subscription is optional",  you might say. It really isn't. All your skills are limited to 30 instead of 100. Are you okay doing 30% normal damage and taking 330% more damage. Because thats what low quality stuff you will be stuck with.

Lets be up front... Xsyon isnt for everyone. This isn't a mainstream game. It's a niche game. A free world, open ended sandbox. Not sandbox themed. You get what you put into the game. There is alot of ambiguity, and alot of hiden mechanics that even the veteran players don't know. The learning curve is steep. If you have ever played any large space-based mmo's before their tutorial systems, you know what a daunting learning curve that is. This is no short-termed end-game. Here is what my personal opinion of the game is:\n\nPros:\nOpen ended, there is no end.\nIn depth crafting system.\nSandbox, full customization of tribal areas.\nVery helpful player base, not alot of drama.\nPvE or PvP Server option.\nA VERY willing Developer who listens extremely close to their player base.\nBig ambitions for future expansions.\n\nCons:\nCurrently a low player population\nSteep learning curve\nHard to solo in the game\nSlower development\n\nWhile there are alot of reviews on the billing of the game, I am not fixated on subscriptions. It costs money to make a video game. Time = money. But to be a part of the metamorphasis of this game has beeen awesome. I have enjoyed this game solo and as a large tribe (guild). It is tough going solo unless you are near a larger tribe or willing to travel. That is what I ENJOYED as one of the challenges. The transparancy of development is a refreshing change and I truly feel the maturity level of the existing players is a welcome change. For those that are looking for the "next best thing", do your research. There are alot of apocalyptic games out there, this I would truly categorize as a survival game against the elements more than zombies, rogue bandits or space pirates. Watch your video clips, check out the wiki. I reccomend you overlook this game if you do not want to commit to a long-term game. If you want to be challenged, explore, and enjoy that liberating walk in the wilderness, then this game is definetly worth a try.\n\nThere is alot of fixation on billing. Dropping cash on any steam game is a gamble. If you put that money on an impulse you will always have it, yet it just takes up space on your hard drive. Do you actually play those 200 games? I have put my focus on the actual game play. I see it as an investment, and as a player in this game I make damn sure that my investments into the development get heard. It's ultimately up to you.\n\nFrankly, I enjoy a polite, helpful global chat over epeen sword swinging egos boxing back and forth over who has the most testosterone. Steep learning curve? So what! That to me is part of the challenge. Experiment, ask questions, discover the game for yourself. You want this on a siver platter? Not going to happen. Solo play? Been there done that. I found spending time on the road to trade took too much of my time, but it was my choice to live in a place over 45 minutes real time walk from the nearest tribe to trade with.\n\nAgain, this game is not for the elite players. This is a casual game, a challenging game, and one worth getting into if you enjoy something outside of the mainstream survival genre. I look forward to seeing you ingame.","November 5, 2015","true","453.7"," 59 of 76 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","59","76","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WickedPuppy/recommended/297470/","WickedPuppy","WickedPuppy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WickedPuppy/","96 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI played this game years ago when it first came out and all you could do was terraform the landscape. It quickly lost my attention. I picked it up when it came out on Steam and outside of the low server population, this is a must have game for those into survival/building games. If you like crafting, gathering supplies, exploring, and building structures you will find plenty to do. You can build roads, terraform the landscape, farm the land, cut down trees, build everything in game, and all of this is visible to other players. Everything in game ages and/or gains xp. That Reverant that killed you an hour ago, stole your clothes and shovel from your corpse and now struts around with those items on him, taunting you to come kill him to get it back.\n\nAmazingly this game is ran by a single developer; yet, has more thought and work done to it then most MMO's on the market today. If you are looking for a game where twitchy fingers wins the day, this is not that game. This is a survival game, with what could be an attempt at a Trading simulation game. Although there are many aspects of the game that remain unpolished, it is extremely playable and stable, and simple in many regards.\n\nThe learning curve is somewhere in between WoW and EVE online. It does not appear to have the same depth as EVE Online, but give this game a full staff of developers and it could easily come close over time. The next UO, probably. The next WoW, possibly. It just would depend which direction it went. Of course, neither matter if the graphics do not keep up.\n\nThe immediate downfall of the game is that the communications systems in game are horrible and most people are into solo gameplay. A new person joining the game is dropped into the middle of a huge map (literally can take hours to travel from one part to another). The server population is so low that I have only seen other players when I requested to meet them in person and travelled to their location. However, everyone is extremely nice and friendly. If the developer moved in the direction of an EVE economy I think this game would have serious staying power, and be able to expand rapidly. However, if one cannot view at distances items for sale, then one might as well be playing a solo or cooperative game, not an MMO. This game needs some way to allow a greater sense of where you as an individual, as a tribe stand in relation to others.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game, with the reservations noted above.","April 20","true","52.5"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","30","33","3","0"

This game has A LOT of character and offers a very unique experience than your dime a dozen mainstream MMO.  I played it for a while before it came to steam and for a fan of Ultima Online and SWG there are a lot of familiar mecanics here, namely a skill gain by use system.  Everything you do from walking, swimming, crafting, lumberjacking to foraging has a skill attached to it and the more you do that particular thing, the better you get at it.  So everything you do has meaning.  Like real life Xsyon seeks to create a virtual realm where you can basically learn and improve on whatever you wish.  There is also building and terraforming.  You can claim a plot of land, shape it and start building on it - completely open world, where everyone can see it happening.  Guilds can build veritable towns.  You also have the option to choose either a PVP or PVE server, so those who hate ganking will find a very enjoyable and casual gameplay experience on the PVE server along with a very friendly community.\n\nOne word of warning though.  If combat is your main thing then you might want to give this game a little more time to develop.  The hunting is also a work in progress since there are no ranged weapons/bows as of yet.  Chasing a squirrel through the woods when it's at a fraction of health just to have it jump in a lake and run off because your stamina got too low to persue it is not my idea of fun.  But if you like building, crafting and resource gathering like I do, you will love this MMO.","January 2","true","3.9"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","0"

By and large it is the most mature, friendly and helpful in-game community I have experienced. There aren't very many people playing but there are enough active tribes that would love to recruit you and you won't have to be isolated unless that is how you want to play it.\n\nPros: The community. The unique and quirky style, which is a post-apocalyptic- zombie- low fantasy - Native American inspired -with brightly colored mutant animals that want to eat you - combo. It is a bloody mental mix but I really, really like it. There is immense variety in crafting. The world is beautiful and pretty huge. You can farm and build mind boggling structures. Fully player-driven world. Development is ongoing with new features coming in occasionally and fixes regularly.\n\nCons: low population. Crafting is somewhat grindy and a clickfest. There isn't really an end-game, you really have to take responsibility to create you own experience because the game is player-driven to the extent where you need to self-motivate 100%.  PVP isn't really a thing, I mean there is the PVP server, but no one actually PVPs because 1) combat system is not very good, 2) there aren't enough players on the PVP server to feel justified in killing those few brave souls who care to show up because then you'd be all alone, and 3) there isn't much reason to PVP... most people play this game to roleplay building their town/ mansion and explore the world. This last one isn't really a con IMO.\n\nOver all, quite a few cons - but those pros carry much more weight for me. The unique style and feel of the world along with the chance to be really creative and build up amazing looking communities with some really great people - that is basically what I want from a game and so rarely experience.\n\nNot everyone will appreciate Xsyon so research thoroughly before you buy. If you are like me you'll be stuck. I have played for over three years (most of that time I didn't launch through steam so my hours played are misleading) and though I am too busy these days to find much time for games, I keep coming back.","March 7","true","211.8"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","2"

This game is a rare gem that i have been looking for a long time. Extremely in depth crafting system and just plain fun to play. It has its share of negative reviews but I find it to be a well thought out and implemented game. The player population is pretty low....but I believe that will change. Give it a try.....if you....like me are looking for an in depth crafting/survival/mmo....you wont regret it. It has a steep learning curve but it is worth it once you have learned how to play it properly. The graphics are not triple A....but they are good and unique which creates an a great atmposphere for the game. The community is warm and friendly....(at least on the PVE server....I havent played on the PVP server yet)...and willing to help new players. In my opnion....the developers of this game have done a great job....and they continue to improve it. This game does not deserve all the negative reviews it has gotten on steam in my opinion.....these reviews mostly come from people who bought the game and got something different from what they were expecting and didnt know there was a sub to keep playing after a month. I dont know if the sub warning was there when it was first placed on steam....but its there now and you can also keep playing for free if you wish but with a skill cap or 30. Don't judge this game til you've tried it....it is a very refreshing take on this kind mmo....that i havent see in years and i've played a lot of mmos. And for those of you with older computers like me.....it does work on Windows Vista Home Premium and runs fine. Lastly....my opinion on the sub: paying a subscription to play an mmo doesn't bother me if it is a good game that I will enjoy spending some of my free time on.

You can go out collection resources for the many different crafts like the Armors (Cloth, Grass, Leather, Bone,) there is toolcrafting weaponcrafting and a pretty cool building system.\n\nIf your like me and like to hunt for food and crafting matts then there is that to. You kinda have to "hunt" out your prey to get your food and crafting matts. Make sure you have a knife and enter combat mode by pressing C before attacking! :P\n\nAnyways this a pretty great game. Very sandboxy you just go out and do what you want, can explore and check out all the big tribes around or whatever you want.\n\nHope to see you in-game!","December 21, 2015","true","89.9"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","9"

The community while small (semi average for a sandbox indie) it is a polite and dedicated group - the 15dollars a month keeps most angry children and trolls from really being a threat to your gaming exp and to me thats worth it after having been trolled in dozens of games (didn't work but still is a waste of my limited time) with them randomly attacking me or blowing something up for no reason and taking hours and hours to repair (far more hours then it would take for me to earn the 15 dollars) so as such the monthly fee keeping the game going me not having to buy 25-40$ a month/week in cash shops to keep up with people and no paid expansion packs or DLC means I am exactly the same as everyone else in the game complete and total fairness - yeah skill based put into the game and be stronger not paid to win - the xsyon style I do enjoy the tribal indian post apocalypse blend, the several choices of buildings tools weapons and armor was very nice as I'm able to really create either a scavenger society of metal and tires or a pioneer camp of logs or even a grass and twig town allowing for large customization of my settlement\n\nso now time for the pro and cons\n- great sandbox building set with structures being as big or as small as you need with several varities of buildings fences and\n- lots of choices for clothing weapons and tool styles each needing different resources\n- limited grinding for resources or construction - moderate to average on skills high level skills actually making you work for them instead of being given to you.\n- good blends of skill selection - starting kits tailored to your choices at start up - select axe as your weapon you get a axe select pick you get a pick ect ect - no starting short sword and shield generic kit\n- solid community willing to talk and help\n\ncons\n-the games a bit confusing out of the gate - and needs a new tutorial / upgraded wiki majorly but after a week its not bad\n- limited decorations for inside a house - outside a house plenty of choices but not allot of furniture rugs ect\n- no current taming system - its in the works and I will remove this once its in\n- combat is a bit hit and miss atm - you can kill most small animals (squirels hampsters bunnys) but they tend to run from you and the actual click to hit system is a bit sensative meaning you have to hit a small animal running through the grass\nand its a bit difficult at times - they are supposed to be increaseing the hit detection area on small animals to remedy this and will be removed when added\n- no ranged combat - only melee weapons sorry\n- limited pvp - as the core game everyone uses is main job atm pvp feels a bit left out and the pvp server has very few people spaced far out on it.\n\nthe pro/con - this is the section that could go either way for you - some like these options some don't - and some I just have mixed feelings toward\n\n-few to no trolls - might not be a big deal to you but I have a job / family / and life away from computer so knowing I won't have to log in and deal with some angry child blowing up half my town cause his parents told him he couldn't go out with friends is major bonus for me\n\n- low player base - this is a game of hundreds to thousands not hundreds of thousands it is ment to be a small market game catering to the people who enjoy this kind of game not to the masses - to me this is big as finding a unique game mmo not just a mini run your own server game is a big pro for me as I feel like I know those around me at same time people get a bit quiet at times which can be a turn off for others\n\n- many features have not been implamented - the current game is solid but allot of those I would really like features are coming but not yet in the game - while I can't wait for them to get in game I also can't wait. . . . seriously I want them now lols\n\nso would I buy this game again?

In Xsyon, you will craft various things to assist in your enjoyment of the game.  That is the overall premise. You spawn in the world with very basic clothing and weapons.  You must then find a settlement or tribe, which is the guild system in Xsyon.  If you're lucky like I was, you'll find a good tribe that will hook you up with all the tools and gear you need to survive.  In just 1 day of play time, I was given a cart, bags, and better armor for my travels from the tribe I joined.  So my experience was handed to me initially.  If you don't get all that stuff, the game can be quite fun as you grind skills to craft better stuff.\n\nI think if you aren't given everything, the game is more enjoyable as you feel like a true survivor.  As for the combat, unless you play on a PVP server, there's little point in combat.  Right now, it is pretty terrible.  You get screen lag, bad hit detection and the mobs will usually glitch all over the terrain in front of you as you haplessly run after the little critters in an attempt to slay them.\n\nTo do any action in Xsyon, you must first equip the required tool in your "right" hand.  For some reason everyone in the world is right handed.  I found this a chore.  You have to open your inventory, drag the tool to your weapon slot, foregoing your weapon, then do the activity.  If you get attacked, you must then quickly open your inventory and drag your weapon to your right hand.  It's cumbersone and clunky.\n\nAs I stated above, the performance is an issue.  Looking at massive structures will cause most people to lag out.  I dropped to 8 fps from 30+ just looking in a certain direction.  This problem is noticed by the dev, and I've spoken to him about it so I know for certain.  He's trying to fix the code for this so it doesn't force the user to process everything in the base even though they aren't in the actual base looking at all those assett's.\n\nSo why am I recommending this?  It is a unique game.  I can say Xsyon is a one of a kind experience.  It is grindy as all heck though.  You'r skills, unless you have a high intelligence, will go up at a snail's pace. So this requires you to sit in one spot for hours a day and grind one specific resource to mass produce items to level up one particular skill.  If you enjoy this, then you will enjoy Xsyon.\n\nThe survival aspect is moderately difficult.  Once you find out where to find animals, you can quickly find meat and cook it.  Water is everywhere in the center of the map.  Going out further you will have some trouble.  A waterskin solves this problem however.  In fact, I was given a waterskin as my first item when I joined the tribe.  So my experience won't be like the average noob.\n\nStick with the game.  The ONE dev there is, is trying to fix broken features right now, like combat.  You will probably never see things like better performance or seiges on tribal bases because there is alot on his plate right now.  If the dev team was 9-10 people, you probably would.  But this game doesn't make enough money to support that size.  At least the subscription is gone now.\n\nA few things I'd like to see added to Xsyon:\n- Being able to mine just about anywhere.\n- The ability to build small houses even if you area already in a tribe.  This complaint comes up because the tribe I joined was well established and already had their base.  So, gone is the ability to really terraform and create the world I want to live in as the game tag line suggests.\n- Torches to carry around.\n- Posts to attach said torches to so you can have some decent light at night.\n\nI'd say if you want a truly voxel based terraforming MMO with other players, you should look to 7 days to die, Life is Feudal or Minecraft.  Xsyon was never meant to handle full player buildings all over the map.  If you want to build your own house and cultivate crops, you need to create your own tribe.\n\n\nHere is my video review for Xsyon:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBYjtvtq9Pw","February 18","true","93.3"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","16"

You have the ability to terraform the terrain to help you build a small shack or a large city. You can’t dig tunnels or go underground.\n\nXsyon Features a fairly good skill system that allows you to craft weapons, tools, armor, clothing, buildings and baskets. You can fish anywhere there is water and cook at a campfire, there is also a recipe system that allows you create food which has buffs.\n\nYou're able to place totem poles which allow you to control land, protect your containers and prevent players from damaging you(pvp server). This also gives you a place to re spawn.\n\nI was a big Star Wars Galaxies player back in the day and this game checks a lot of the SWG boxes, yes i'm aware of the emulator.\n\nFor city builder/planners this game is a lot of fun, there are some bugs its honestly a very relaxing game to play (on the pve server).\n\nThe playable area is only about 20-30% of the actual game world map itself. If the population ever grew the game world is ready to expand to about 3-4x the current size once the game leaves prelude(i think ea and prelude are the same thing now).\n\nPvP is fun if your able to join an existing tribe, I'm mainly a crafter but i do like PvP, i have a character on both servers. Make sure you get into an existing tribe on the War server if you join that server. (dont cry if you get jumped and lose all your stuff thats the point of the war server).\n\nIt gets a lot crap because it was created by 1 person, with only some contractors here and there helping out. But with any bugs or flaws its better than most of the junk that is coming out today.\n\nPeople complain about the grind because honestly your NOT supposed to grind your skills to level 100 on day 1. If you join a community of players on the server and help out with building a small city you level your skills the intended way. (sorry generation tumblr)\n\nI level upped about half of my basketry skills on my character just making the grass components for our tribes architect. Who in turn was building our starting house.\n\nXsyon is a better RPG than Fallout4 & The Division :D\n\nIv'e played this game off and on since the 2011 launch.\n\nCommon question: Game has been out since 2011 what gives?\nXsyon is a MMO, much like EQ, RS, Wurm and WoW; WoW took 4-5 years to create and had the disposal of the Blizzard staff. Xsyon doesn't have the luxury, It was created by 1 person and some contractors off and on that have tried to help. Much like when minecraft was released, features aren't completed and wont be completed until a time only the developer knows.\n\nBuilding is hands down the most solid feature of this game and its one of the most time consuming. PvP does have problems but it is still fun.\n\nFeel Free to check my recent games history when your wondering if this game is worth it:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/xyberviri/games/\nThis isn't even my main character at this time, ive put in more play time than steam can show because of the other account i use.\n\nThen ask your self, Do i own any of those games? Are they just not doing it for me?\n\nI bought the gold edition of the division because i though it would be fun.... i should have just bought 3 more copies of Xsyon for my friends that wanted to try it.\n\nIv'e been wasting a couple of days in Stelaris but i think im mostly done...","January 7","true","200.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

Back in the day it was very promising. Then it turned plain silly bad with no trees around and gankers roaming wild. So it kind of half died and I gave up on it. Years later Xsyon comes to Steam and offers one time purchase and codes for old players so I jump in. And WOW! What I find is one of the most in depth sandboxes around. Crafting is really deep, gathering and architecture amazing and trading has reached finally useful level. Combat still need a MAJOR rework but I heard its under way. And since it's one time purchase only, what is there to lose? If I was completely new to Xsyon I would jump in for this deal straight away.

I would recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a rich crafting and architecture experiance.  Combat is still a bit wonky at this time but the developer has started a discussion to revamp the combat according to what features the community likes from other combat systems.   If its anything like how other aspects have been implemented i'm sure its going to be great!","October 3, 2015","true","128.7"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

They answer every single question I've asked and stayed with me for 2 hours to start me off. Just purely from my experience it defines that this game has a great community, now let's just take a look at other popular MMORPG games, WoW or Runescape, the community is simply toxic.

Also, similar to our world resources could run out. EG if everyone is recklessly cutting trees without planting the seed back they could potentially be endangered because for certain trees you have to wait for a entire real time month for a full tree to grow back. There are also seasons which rotates every 2 weeks IRL time and actually plays a huge role in this game. For instance, during winter if you farm you would actually get less resource back because its cold and night would last significantly longer. (Vice versa for other seasons). Did I mention that I haven't even barely scratched the surface of this game?!#\n\nWhen a community unites, nothing is impossible...\n\nNow...

I share my more detailed thoughts on Xsyon in the following video for those interested ;)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=407VnQyZUAQ\n\nSome Special Things\nIf you play these kinds of games, you will understand many of the things they have in common, from Crafting gear, to building up your home/settlement/tribe. But here are some things I really enjoy about Xsyon you won't see in most (if any) others like it (so not an exhaustive list - just stuff I really like)...\n\n+ Quest Creation - Make a quest... what are you looking for and what are you rewarding someone with for completing it? Add these details to your quest, and anyone can complete it!\n\n+ Terrain Reforming - When a settlement is abandoned, the structures left behind can be torn down easily. More importantly, when the supported structures are gone, the terrain (any terraforming done) returns pretty quickly to its natural state! How awesome is that?!\n\n+ Skill Up by Doing But Also... - Not only do the skills you use increase as you use them, but at the same time you are doing things (crafting, etc) you are filling an XP bar. When full, you get points to spend on ANY other skills as well. It's a nice combo giving you some options without it being a straight free-for-all.\n\n+ Setting - This takes place in post-apocalyptic Lake Tahoe. The "world" is the mountainous area surrounding the lake. Things get more dangerous (and rewarding) the farther you explore away from the lake. Native American influences are heavy here and the combination of that with the apoc setting give this really cool "return to the old world" feel that is really compelling for me.","May 5","true","74.0"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

You can start a homestead with a 25m x 25m area with only one member or add your friends to your tribe to expand your boundaries.

I will update this review as I continue to work in the game.\n\nSimple question: "Should I buy this game?"\n\nGeneral answer: if you like sandbox free-to-do-as-you-please types, then yes.  It's worth the investment.  You can tell a lot of effort has been put into this game, though it's fairly underdeveloped.  The developer still seems actively involved in the community, but the community is lacking.  Nice people, just few of them on.  Expect to solo while you learn, and that's totally fine.\n\nThis game is crafting heavy, but it takes a lot of time (and boring clicking and clicking and clicking) to get what you want done.  I mean a lot of time!  Not even so much that it's a lot of time, but that it's super slow-going, and very little instruction in-game, with a fairly generic tutorial.\n\nTo have the best chance to start enjoying this game, I advise you make basket making your primary starting hobby.  This will help you get to the baskets you'll need to start developing resources without spending ten hours figuring out that you need to do this, and five more leveling it by farming grass and making thread and so on.  Once you have baskets, you're golden to start working the land.\n\nMy advice further:  Safely navigate around the lake.  Find an area off the lake that has trees, rocks, and access to the lake.  Set up a tribe.  Start developing your totem area (aka learning your crafts).  Get to know the ten players in the game at any given time.  Eventually join their tribe just so you have something to build onto.  Or keep developing your own.\n\nBy doing this, you will be in a safe zone for learning the basics.  You will be near a source of food (fishing), ability to develop tools and masonry, have baskets to store your stuff while you get started, and eventually be strong enough to get going on your own adventure or join up with others on a mmo adventure.\n\nCons:  This game is still clunky.  Poor in-game tools.  Poor explanations.  Poor interface that is arduous and annoying.  Not intuitive at all.  But as you get the hang of it, it starts to make sense and works out.  But it's still clunky as all getout.  I imagine the developer is still trying to get this thing rolling, but it's been in dev for going on ten years.  Don't expect much.  Get it for what it is and play it accordingly.  It's worth that much.  Maybe by 2050, he will have it working as fluidly as minecraft.","May 10","true","12.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

If you are looking for a strong quest system and a lot of hand-holding through an involved plot line, this is not the game for you. But if you enjoy making your own goals, enjoy foraging and crafting, you may find you'll love Xsyon, too. The subscription fee is very reasonable and I prefer it to microtransactions.\n\nThe people in Xsyon are friendly, helpful, and good company. After the first few crafting tutorials, crafting makes sense in a way it often doesn't in other games. The possiblilities are endless, expecially for building incredible elaborate camps and strongholds.\n\nI can't say how pleasant it is, after a hard RL day, to stand by Lake Tahoe fishing and watching the sunset.  Peaceful, relaxing... a great way to end the day.","July 21, 2015","true","167.9"," 23 of 49 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","23","49","4","0"

I chose to go the solo route, though. Initially it was annoying since I didn't have a bunch of needed tools. But, the recent additions of tradeposts makes being a hermit  a lot easier, since you can set your trade post up near larger tribes and trade while offline. Also, I made a few friends online that helped me get started.\n\nBuilding in the game is pretty nice. I have run across many nice multistory buildings, bridges, piers and more. I've read that the building got an upgrade recently and i'm looking forward to trying it out.\n\nThere are seperate PVE and PVP servers, so that's a plus.\n\nSuper quick response time for the Dev and the Guides.\n\nTraveling isn't bad, but it would be awesome to have mounts.  There are carts to craft, though.\n\nFriendly and helpful community.\n\nThe cons are:\nThe game is pretty grindy and there are not many other players. Trading posts make life a bit easier, though. But, it would be nice to have more people to chat and trade in real time with.\n\nMonthly fee. Not really a con, I just wish it was about $9.99 or so month instead.\n\nCombat isn't really that fun.

Please note that although my playtime record on steam is low (0.7 hours at the time of writing), it does not give a true reflection as I prefer to use the main Xsyon client - as do many other players.\n\nThere are a couple of issues that I have noticed that have crept up on the forums.\n\n1) Subscription. Yes this game is a subscription based model. I know a lot feel its silly to charge a sub for this game. But actually having written in the official forums about possibilities of being free to play, the developer has actually tried testing out different pay models (including changing the sub fee). It was found that free to play created a destructive element in the game, in that it brought players who were not good for the game. Some of the players resorted to exploits, botted and even caused a lot of tension/drama in global chat by being rude/abusive (hence the reason why the majority talk in tribe chat and not global).\n\nThe Cash shop idea. Wouldn't be good, Basically you are asking the developer to concentrate on making things for the cash shop rather than developing things for the game or patching bugs etc.\n\n2) It's Alpha. Well the developer has already commented on this. Basically it's on PRELUDE. So no, it not Alpha or Beta but the next step beyond that. I'm not paying to test a game. I am paying to play a game that is playable and published. Fact is that a majority of MMO's are never truly "finished" on release, hence why there are patches and expansions.\n\n3) Player numbers and community. Steam stats do not reflect true numbers. Majority of players still use the Xsyon client via the website as it was the default thing to do pre - steam. It's also a fact that a majority only speak in tribe chat. In the past a lot of drama was caused in global chat which became really problematic and had to be sorted out by GMs in game.\nThe community overall is very mature and helpful. There are many vets who are happy to answer questions. Do understand though that timezone may affect peak hours for this game. I believe the majority of players are in the US/Canada timezones.\n\nNow onto the game\n\nThe game tries to be as realistic as possible i.e. meaning you wont be able to kill bears until you have honed and got your skills really high. I believe people have high expectations from the get go and get disappointed because they cannot do the things they want to from the off. Sorry folks but this game is slower paced and longer longevity type gameplaying. Meaning be prepared to put in some hard work before expecting to be able to tackle some of the high end stuff.\n\n1) Crafting and resource gathering. Lot's to craft with many more crafting skills planned for the future.  You will need to either trade or gather resources to be able to craft. Be prepared to spend a lot of time gathering resources so you can grind your craft. Crafting and gathering also have a bonus in that each craft skill has a primary and secondary attributes. The more you use the skill, the more likely that the associated attribues with the skill will raise. For example, doing logging will increase your strength and agility. Making you a better fighter.\n\n2) Hunting and combat. Yes you can hunt stuff but you have to start off small i.e rats and chickens. You also need to locate them first before being able to kill them. After you kill critters, you can improve your hunting skills by skinning, gutting, decapitating etc. Don't expect to move up quickly as it will take a while to climb up the hunting ladder. There are also zombies called Revenants. Do not mistake these for players. If they kill you, they take your gear and use it. So for every critter that kills a player, they "grow" and increase in strength.\n\n3) Thirst and Hunger. Yes you have to manage these. You can fish, forage or farm for food to eat. For thirst you can drink from rivers or fill and carry a waterpouch with you. There is a balance though as overindulging will give you penalties. Become hungry or thirsty and you don't regenerate health and energy. You can die from prolonged thirst and hunger just like in real life.\n\n4) Health, Energy and Encumbrance. All of these can be improved as you keep grinding the associated skills. For instance grinding on a skill that increases your strength will help improve the amount you can carry and therefore your encumbrance levels.\n\nHealth is self explanatory. When it reaches zero, your dead.\n\nEnergy is basically like stamina. When you perform actions, it uses stamina. For example you can only sprint when you have more than 50% Energy. Once it reaches 50% or less, then you can no longer sprint, just light jog. When you run out of energy you have to rest or stop your action.\n\nEncumbrance levels is your carrying capacity. Basically if you are carrying a lot if items, it will be harder to run and uses more energy doing so. One of the ways to make this less of a problem is by using a cart to transport goods.\n\nDeath has no real penalties at present.\n\n5) Tribes. I was lucky to find a nice tribe. Personally I think it's helpful to get into a tribe early on. You can solo but expect to work a lot more. Tribes give you an advantage in that they can give you tools and food so you do not have to worry about it and can concentrate on your skills. Also having someone to give you advice or answer your questions is nice to have. Also large scale building projects is very demanding and much more easier to complete within a tribe and fun too!\n\nLike I said I'm still having fun but it's not a game for everyone. The game requires patience and work before you see any progress  - just like in real life. People who have high expectations of being uber in the least amount of time and effort need not apply!\n\nI wish people would try the game and give it a chance before turning a blind eye to it. You never know, you might enjoy yourself.\n\n","June 27, 2015","true","1.8"," 37 of 79 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","37","79","4","0"

To make better fortifications, you need to continue learning which you do by building. Eventually you can make a very strong fortress, or rustic compound of cabins to start surviving in style!\n\nTo survive, you need to either learn to farm and cook your own foods, or fish and hunt to stay alive. Eating and drinking water are critical to this like in real life. You can also forage for berries and other food plants.\n\nOf course things like tools, armor, and weapons wear out, so you can either start trading with other players or learn to make those yourself. The more effort you put into it the better those items will become.\n\nI have been playing this for 3+ years and have made tons of friends in game and had steady entertainment all along. Each new improvement the Developer puts in has only made the game better for me.\n\nIf you are looking for a game with long term play that you can grow in, making your lasting mark on the game world, then this game will be right up your alley. If though, you want it all handed to you, or need to rush to the "end" you may not like it. There is a very helpful community in game that can show you the ropes and give you tips. However, may I suggest that you do the tutorials, setup a homestead, and check it out for yourself. Once you are proficient, maybe then join a bigger tribe to have the opportunity to do even bigger and grander things!\n\nI really think you are going to enjoy the experience!\n","May 14, 2015","true","0.8"," 25 of 71 people (35%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","35","25","71","5","0"

I'd always chose a subscribtion based game over a free to play one, as free to play games usually are the greater rip-off if you really want to get into them. Almost all games i know of that are advertised for as being "free" turn out to be pay to win after a while. Here you buy the game, pay the monthly fee (you dont even have to do this if you dont mind the skillcap), and that's it.\n\nKeep in mind this is a sandbox, not a theme park. This game is what you make of it and strongly encourages team play. If you like grinding for skills and crafting, you can do it. If you like exploring and hunting, you can do it. It's also totally valid to just fish, farm and cook and never leave your homestead. It's totally up to you.\nYou wont start with all off the games posibillities revealed to you, you have to work on your skills and talents to find out what you REALLY can do.\nSpeaking of skills, what you do is what you get, chopping wood will get you logging skill, preparing meals will raise your cooking, clubbing rats will get your fighting skills up. On top of that you can spend some skillpoints rewarded for active gameplay to speed up the process. That's a brilliant concept to me.\n\nAbout limited character customization... that's just not true. There are so many different armor and cloth pieces you can wear, i dont even dare to guess a number, it's hundreds at least.\n\nThis game is tagged 'Early Access' not for being new but for being in constant developement. It may not be what you expect from a 'Early Access' game, but this one at least is totally playable and enjoyable with a huge area to explore and countless options for crafting and building on two persistent servers. This isnt vaporware like all those other early access games that never leave alpha or are abandoned by the devs after a year or two.\n\nAbout the graphics: I cant stress how much i hate the korean manga style graphics of all the WoW copy games that are out there. This games graphics may not be state of the art, but at least it's very solid with the animations and environment and get's the job done pretty well.\n\nOh, and no magic! No 300 different buttons for this spell and that buff, attack combo here and there and such nonsense. Buffs/debuffs come from food and environmental conditions. that's it. Very refreshing approach!\n\nSpeaking of combat, it's non target free for all. Swing your weapon and make sure the stuff you want to hit is where the weapon is moving to. That's how combat is done!\nNot click a target, then have some keyboard macro spit out your favourite attack combo with fireballs and sparks and flashy things until the target is dead. Bleh...\n\n\nso TLDR, this is a special game for special people. love it or hate it, but for the correct reasons.\n","May 8, 2015","true","439.6"," 29 of 81 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","29","81","3","0"

There is combat in the game (Hunting or occasional PVP), but is more of a secondary activity. The community is tight, but oh so helpfull to all new players that ask questions or need help. This game deserves the attention of the sandbox community! Come on and give it a try, if you like sandboxy games with a focus on crafting, survival and building, then you certainly wont be dissapointed!","January 11, 2015","true","4.3"," 24 of 73 people (33%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","33","24","73","4","0"

I played this game prior to steam many years ago for a very long time (probably 6 months or so).  This game may have additional content since then, but it is the same game.  This definitely shouldn't be in early access and is clearly an abuse of the early access system.  This game has been a subscriber based game for years; however, it is a fun game with a good community.\n\nI would love to get back into the game and see what they have added since I left, but now there is a new bug with the mouse.  The mouse skips around on the screen preventing me from clicking buttons very efficiently.  It took half an hour to set up a new character because of this.  I have applied a few microsoft fixes, which didn't help.

It is a game to discover little by little, exploring, figuring out how the mechanics work, meeting people, having fun. I’m not a good review writer so let me show you some other players sentences describing Xsyon, which is my felling as well about this game:\n\n-  If your a serious role player, you might of just found heaven. This game, in its current state, offers the most robust role-play mechanisms I have seen to date in a mmorpg. It is the definition of a good sandbox in the making for sure.\n-Tthis game is possibly the best sandbox ever created.\n- Been playing themepark mmo's the past 6 years or so, found this game and jumped the gun and haven't regret it any bit. This game is brilliant. Lots of fun to be had with a creative mind!\n\n- The videos don't really do the game justice IMO. The graphics are not that exciting to me. But the gameplay and the concepts are brilliant. Like the other guy said, its addicting as hell. I played the rift beta (and pre ordered) and enjoyed it. I played the Xsyon beta and was hooked almost immediately.\n\n-Looks like Freedom & Roleplaying is back in mmorpg's. Awesome.\n\n- I'm not worried, i think Xyson is already a breath of fresh air, once your in the world it lures you in with its charms.\nIt's the little details like eating and drinking or wandering of to gather some resources so your friend can craft you that new backpack that make Xsyon shine and its these little details that the MMO giants always over look. It's been along time since a game has charmed me like Xyson has and that was Ultima over a decade ago.\nXyson will appeal to the type of person who prefers that cup of coffee in that back street cafe or would rather walk that extra mile to buy from a small grocer rather than taking easy street for a cheaper, faster but ultimately inferior product from a big company.\nI personally love wandering in the snowy peeks exploring and then running for my life when a big grumpy bear decides i look tastier than the local fish... Xsyon has a great feeling of freedom, at no point have i found myself being pushed in any direction i didn't want to go in, i love it. :)\n\n- I'm liking this game more and more. It is really growing on me.\n\n- Xyson certainly seems to be bringing the RPG element back to MMOs!\n\n- The Building in this game is by far the very best I have seen in any game. Along with terraforming, it provides the right amount of freedom with the right amount of challenge.\n\nThe simple fact that I can shape the land in a permanent way is a truly amazing accomplishment. Even though a few other games may provide something similar, this one beats them all hands down.\n\nCrafting is quite fun, and requires lots of different items, making the items made feel like an accomplishment. Well done.\n\n“For me, if we also had Zombies, and decay the game would be almost perfect...”\n\n\nWhen this last player opinion was made the game had not Zombies or decay system yet, now it is ingame \n\nAnyway I recommend this game if you are looking for a breath of fresh air.\n","January 14, 2015","true","24.5"," 31 of 93 people (33%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","33","31","93","5","0"

This game is the best I've seen of the open world variety in quite a while. Real gamers don't want to hear this, but to have a clue what you are doing, just do the dang tutorial. But if you don't, and have to ask questions, most of the players I've come across are willing to help...on the PVE server that is. Yes, 2 Servers, PvP and PvE, so if you want to peacefully go out, and build your homestead, without worrying about that guy across the river taking your hard earned grass stack(grass, not weed) after he bonks you on the head, then you have a server to play on.\n\nAbout the gameplay, I myself find it to be very similar to WoW, but without the NPC's. Crafting it rather well thought out, and building has it's quirks at times, but it works, and it works well.\n\nI hunt for games like this, and like I have said, it's the best I've seen in a while.\n\nIt is a big help that there are guides(admin) that DO help, run events, and keep you updated as to scheduled patches and updates. They tell you when new things are on the test server, so you KNOW, because other players go check, that new content is soon to be available.\n\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 9/10. Few minor bugs that are irritating, but in no way take away from the fun.\n\n","March 29, 2015","true","375.7"," 28 of 86 people (33%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","33","28","86","7","2"

Fishing, farming, cooking, foraging, hunting, scavenging, and building are all integral parts of Xsyon.\n\nThe develper is very engaged with the community and responds to all concerns and requests for additions to the game.\n\nFor new players I highly recommend the game but it comes with this warning: This is not a game that you can conquer instantly. There is no pay to win.

I remember when I first started there was no tutorial and what wiki that players had started was severely lacking for information but the community was very helpful and didn't shoot you down when you did have questions. Today the game has a in-depth wiki and tutorial when you log in to the game. This is very helpful to new players entering the game needing guidance.\n\nThe game in its current state has a lot to offer with in-depth crafting systems, hunting, farming, and cooking. I'm looking forward to seeing the current round of development proceeding forward and trying it out once it makes it in game (pets, mounts, etc etc) you can find current round development under the game section on the main site to see what is next in line.\n\nIn game I spend a lot of time on weapon, tool, architecture, and bone crafting. These are the things I enjoy doing most and have put my effort in to be the best at. I really like going out from tribe and hunting, I take pleasure in it and also I need the mats for bonecrafting anyway but I get to explore the server and all the while I get the supplies I need while doing so.\n\nI love the sense of adventure the game offers, I'm really looking forward to some mapping skill eventually, as exploring what is out there and seeing what players have built, gives me joy, as it's really amazing some of the things that come out of the player base. It's also neat running around seeing things change over time, whether it be a new tribe, or watching the terrain revert back to how it once was since, we have terrain reversion now.\n\nScavenging is by far the one thing I enjoy most out of the game because you never know what recipes or items you will find and I like mapping out scavenging piles. When I say mapping them out, I'm talking about marking which give recipes more so than another or blades, nails, rivets, and the like. I've spent countless hours just running around the map scavenging junk piles looking for the best materials or recipes I could find. It's sort of like playing the lotto.\n\nThe farming system is pretty in-depth and I'm looking forward to seeing more and more crop types as development goes on along with more cooking recipes. Cooking alone is by far the best system I have seen in a sandbox MMO, having primary ingredients along with seasonings to boost the buffs you get from the meal your eating is awesome to say the least.\n\nTerraforming in Xsyon is unlike any other and very precise if you need to be with it. Changing the landscape is one thing I look for in a sandbox so that I can shape the land to the way I want it to be, if I was so inclined to do so I could have a terrace system on a mountain top with ramps leading to each section. You can really do a lot with it and the architecture that is in the game really fits the look and feel of Xsyon. There are a lot of design options to choose from along with designs you can do with laying everything out. You're not limited by skill alone to make a certain sized house, if you want a massive structure 8 stories high and have the materials and time to do so, then go for it. There are no limits other than the ones you set for yourself.\n\nThe combat system is one reason I like hunting so much, the variables, and directional user input combat like mount and blade is what draws me to it. I have full control over how combat plays out, yes there are random variables that take place but I can race in and do a charged blow and speed away or circle around a opponent. I'm not sitting in one spot watching text scroll and hitting at a determined speed based on skill, stats, and weapon. I determine the combat based on my interaction and yes stats and all that do come in to play but I could lose a battle with a player or creature by miss steps on how I do the combat on my end.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone, Xsyon is exactly what I want out of a open world sandbox ♥♥♥♥♥♥me.","December 31, 2014","true","10.5"," 35 of 105 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","35","105","3","0"

That, in itself, is pretty impressive. The graphics are pretty good for a true sandbox with full terraforming and piecemeal building construction system as well as trees that are actually removed when chopped. All these are rendered obviously which requires a balance between graphics and game performance. It does a good job on that.\n\nThe building aspect of the game is very versatile and completely customizable. I have seen rustic cabins, tent villages, stilt village areas over water, tree houses and full on castle like structures as well as mad max looking scrap metal compounds. It allows a great flexibility in customizing your tribe to your liking.\n\nNice scavenging system where it almost feels like a lotto each scavenge trying to find those rare blueprints folks pay good money for to get the rare architect plans. Robust and fairly complex cooking and farming system recently introduced. Good asset protection with gate permissions, storage bin permissions and cart permissions. We recently saw the first unique use specification for buildings, a commissary, that greatly reduces food decay rates when stored in it. This hints at a lot of great options forthcoming.\n\nThe game has some very addictive qualities in certain areas if that is the type of thing you like. The PvE server, the one mostly populated, has a very welcoming and positive community. Helpful to new players and really isn't a lot of griefing or such on their. The PvP server is left alone in that regard allowing your weapons to deal with griefing although I will say that there is not much of a PvP community currently. This Steam release hopefully will breath life back into that.\n\nIs it perfect? No. It functions well, the things it has are decently done, the developer is constantly working to correct bugs and issues brought forth by players and has a lot of very interesting things listed to be upcoming.\n\nWith a completely player driven in game economy, no cash shop or credits or other 'currency' to buy and use in game, it really is a player driven economy. No NPCs besides animals and revenants, which are essentially zombies of abandoned tribes that, if they kill you, will take your equipped weapons and armor to fill gaps in what they are currently wearing or wielding. You could come back and be killed by your own weapons. The combat isn't my thing, but a lot of the players have told me the key is to learn the system.\n\nCooking actually can end up consuming 12 ingredients to make the top end recipes and can buff various attributes, add to healing rates and other things. Pretty complex in that area. Also, you can starve to death of die of thirst, so planning ahead for such is important. Of course, you can drink from any river or the lake. Foraging for food can be done but provides minimal sustenance and making kabobs is a much better way to go.\n\nAll and all, a fun and creative game with what could well be a very bright future. I would gladly, and have, recommend this game to folks that are into sandbox games and enjoy building or, like me, hoarding. You can end up with a lot of stuff. Also, when tribes become abandoned and the totems decay away, their goods are open for looting.\n\nWith a focus on tribe (community) building and a fully player modified landscape and only player driven economy (with no cash shop) it is a refreshing game that can suck you in for hours on end without you noticing.\n\nSkills are 'grindy' so to speak, leveled up by utilizing those skills. There is no level system. There are experience points that are earned and can be used to level up skills and are often used to level up the more grind intensive skills or just the ones you may not enjoy doing as much.\n\nCurrently, I would say the game shows it is in early release and thus I would give it a 75-80 out of 100. Hopefully the changes the developer intends to make can up that a bit.","December 30, 2014","true","47.3"," 53 of 150 people (35%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","35","53","150","9","2"

And im having fun, there is no longer a subiscription so now is worth playing.\nThe game itself is good, im playing now with some friends(I bought in total 5 copies of this game). Its real nice, lacking some content and dynamics but the promisse of never ending development and evolution may keep this game alive for many years to come.\nEDIT 5: Changing it back to i dont recommend, game is stuck in time, no development at all, no player base, pvp doesnt mean anything etc. And the few players that are in the game have 3-4 extra accounts to boost their tribes.\nDO NOT BUY IT","June 8, 2015","false","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","14"

Well kind of.  The premise is good, but the controls and graphics are horribly dated.  The right click to access som commands like to eat something doesn't work all the time.   Checking there forusm this is a bug they supposidly fixed a long time ago.   The overall graphics and feel of the game reminds me of the old game Vanguard, witht he same quality graphics and attempt at a zoneless game.   Now while admitally I couldn't got past the fact that it did all this in a forced small window, if the game uses the same engine as Vanguard, which it likely does.  Then it's not truely zoneless.   Vanguard relied on loading things as you approach a new one to make it look zoneless, as moving from one zone to aother mae it load and link it in the background.   This was greate before DSL and Cable, but since then your character could move faster then the game could link in a new one, making it pause to load the new zone you just walked in to.   Now as this game looks and feels exactly like the old Vanguard engine, I am betting it has the same issue.   Still all in all, not worth the price they ant for it currently.","June 5","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
