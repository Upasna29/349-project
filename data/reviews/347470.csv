"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/recommended/347470/","MrWoodenSheep","MrWoodenSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/","2273 products in account","Mayan Death Robots is a worms-esque game where each character has unique abilities\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0LYKUgKBKU\nThe main objective is to destroy your opponent's core. You can completely destroy the level and are forced to overcome obstacles on your way while simultaneously protecting your core in some way.\n\nEach round has a short timer in which both players select their moves at the same time. When the timer runs out your action is carried out. All Death Robots can rebuild the terrain by placing Tetris-shaped blocks to either barricade their core off or create a platform. All the Robots can also use a jump action and fly across the map.\nWhere the characters differ is their weaponry. Some weapons will stick to a surface and climb around, others will drill through, while others can release cluster grenades from the air. The aiming system takes gravity into account, which is why I compared the game to Worms' similar artillery type of aiming (as well as the destructible terrain).\n\nAs you progress through levels randomizers are added to keep the game interesting. You are given random weapons, or sometimes little Mayan people attempt to defend your core and attack your opponent if they stand next to your followers. You even get a few bonuses like larger explosion radius if you destroy more things in the environment.\n\nHowever, the best event of all has to be the gigantic bosses that appear in levels occasionally. Halfway through your battle, the boss will wreak havoc and level the entire stage. You and your opponent have to work together to kill the boss, since your cores are teleported out of the battlefield. After the boss is killed, the cores are brought back and you get to fight in a basically brand new level.\n\nThe art style and character designs are really cool-looking in my opinion.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun. The objective-based combat makes the game exciting, and the randomizers like Mayan followers keep the levels from getting stale. (And oh man, the bosses are just so badass)","November 20, 2015","true","11.2"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","38","44","2","0"

It does several cool things to shake up the artillery game formula (ie.Worms) quite a bit!\n\nFor one, the pace is way faster than Worms', with all players playing at the same time so if both players know the game, matches move on forward very pleasantly.\nAdding characters with specific skills does a lot to increase variety and the boss fights help in changing the pace quite dramatically (ad they're very well put together).\n\nThe character skills have a lot of variety and there are some nice touches like the Tetris-inspired wall-building and the "skill-roulette" that manage to shake things up a bit by granting a random super skill to players.\n\nOf course everything is not perfect and the game can feel a bit overwhelming at first due to the quick pace and busy screen. The campaign does a good job of teaching you the basics though so I recommend starting from there to explore the main features one by one.\n\nIt's also cool that you can tackle the campaign alone or with people, which is a great way to learn the specifics of the game together (that's how we played it with a friend).\n\nHighly recommended if you're looking for an intense couch multiplayer game!","November 22, 2015","true","0.5"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","1"

The game moves really quickly. Since both players move at the same time there is no need to sit around waiting for the other player to make their move. Turns move so quickly that you will always be thinking about what you are going to do next and lining up your next shot. The only problem with the streamlining process is that each robot doesn't have as many weapon choices as you had in Worms.\n\nEach robot only has two different weapons with the occasional chance to use a third weapon. The only significant complaint I have with the game is that I wish each robot had a few more attacks which would have given you some more variety in how you could attack your opponent. The good news is that the robots do play differently as each robot's attacks are different enough to give each robot different strategies.\n\nWhile the game is probably going to be more fun against another player I have to give the game a lot of credit for creating a very capable AI computer to play against. At times it is a little too easy and sometimes a little too hard but the AI does a great job adjusting to your skill level in order to give you a challenge without feeling frustrating.\n\nIf you like games like Worms I think you will really enjoy Mayan Death Robots.\n\nNote: I received a review copy from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","November 21, 2015","true","6.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterxodin/recommended/347470/","masterxodin","masterxodin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterxodin/","79 products in account","TL:DR\n\nIt's fun.  Buy it.\nEspecially good party game.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nMayan Death Robots takes the Artillery genre of video games and gives it some much appreciated innovation.  Like other artillery games, the basic structure of Mayan Death Robots centers around a turn of selecting a weapon, and then aiming it, relying on the players sense of trajectory to land hits on the opponent's side to accomplish a goal.\n\nWorms is perhaps the series best known for popularizing the artillery genre, but Mayan Death Robots is a distinctly different kind of game from Worms, and it's important to know that in advance.  I'll briefly explain the differences, and why they're important.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nAction Artillery Games vs Strategic Artillery Games\n\n\nIn worms and other artillery games, combat is far more Strategic rather than Action based.  In those games, turns last longer, involve a combination of moving, weapon selection, and shooting.  Players take alternating turns, and a game might last upwards of half-an-hour or more.\n\nMayan Death Robots is more of an Action Artillery game instead of a Strategic Artillery game.  The goal isn't to blow up the opponent, but rather the opponent's core.  Losing your robot essentially equates to a one turn penalty.  This prevents games from being too short, and is more forgiving to players whom make mistakes when learning their robot.\n\nIn MDR, players take their turns at the same time, and turns are fast.  Players get six seconds to make their weapon (or jump, or blocks) selection, and then six seconds to aim it.  Weapons fire automatically at the end of those six seconds.  The fast pace of turns can be slightly daunting to new players at first, but it's easy to adjust to because Weapon selection is very streamlined.\n\nAlthough there are a lot of weapons in the game, each robot is essentially limited to two signature attacks, so you're rarely pressed to make a tough decision during those first six seconds.  That design decision means that the individual matches can be fast but not stressful.  A match usually only lasts between five and ten minutes, so it's really easy for casual players to get in to, yet rewarding for more hardcore players whom want to practice and master each robot's unique combat style.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nMultiplayer Friendly\n\n\nThe single biggest issue facing MDR has to do with the lack of online multiplayer.  One has to keep in mind that Sileni Studios is a tiny team, and simply put it'd be grossly unfair to hold them to the same standards as Team 17 which has a ton of corporate backing to fund a plethora of features.  But still, it is an issue because obviously if you buy a game like this, you're going to want to play it with friends.\n\nThat being said, the game has robust support for local Multiplayer, allowing for two players to use the same keyboard, a keyboard and gamepad, or two gamepads.\n\nAnd it's seriously fun.\nSeriously.\n\nThis would hands down be a terrific College Dorm game for whenever friends are hanging out.  The fast pace of the game makes it easy for two players to play a match, and then have the loser hand the controller or keyboard off to the next person waiting in line.  And the sheer hilarity of the visuals and action in game make it ridiculously fun for spectators to watch.\n\nFor the last few weeks I've played this game with my friends and their kids, switching out the players every match, and it felt like the beautiful nostalgia of video gaming from back when I was in college, passing a controller around whenever typical two-player games were played with an audience of three or more.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nSingle Player Friendly\n\n\nIn addition, the solo player campaign is bonkers cool.  There's a great over-the-top storyline about the Death Robots galactic TV show, and all the insanity that ensues.  There are soooo many different scenarios in the game to be unlocked, from maps where Conquistadors constantly attempt to steal your cores, to Elder Gods that dramatically reshape the map, to man-eating plants.  Combined with the ten different playstyles of the robots, the game packs a ton of replayability.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nIn Closing\n\n\nHands down, for the price, there is a ton of entertainment one can get out of this game.  It's my hope that online multiplayer will be added in the future, but in the meantime there's no real reason to short change yourself by passing over such a well-developed and designed game.","January 12","true","16.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It is very fast-paced, needs lots of tactics. The fact that building needs to be done in time and you have to be careful when to attack and when to defend, plus the recoil that changes a lot of things, makes this game interesting. I haven't played much in hours, but it was far more exhausting, than playing with other titles, 7-8 hours in a row. I played it with a friend, keyboard+controller and it was comfortable for both of us. You can get used to it in 5 minutes, yet you won't be pro for hours afterwards. Just time right, aim right, protect right. And careful with the extra advantages and disadvantages that the TV-show employs on you. Good luck, have fun!\nUpdate: I have completed the whole game. It was exciting, from the first moment to the last. I recommend you get all the robots to get the maximum fun out of this game.","March 16","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thank you for the fast reaction, guys! :-)\n\nMy son likes this game very much. Played about 5 hrs so far and had much fun. So I'll change my recommendation to a 'thumbs up'!\n\nRegarding my currently usesless second license, I won't try to get a refund. Instead I'm hoping for a future upgrade of this real funny game that enables networked co-op... fingers crossed :-)\n==== END Edit 2015-11-28 ====\n\n\n==== BEGIN Original comment ====\nThe Steam store page shows tags for 'Co-op' and 'Local Co-op'.\nSadly, this is the same: Only local coop. I bought two licenses for me and my family and can't make use of it.\n\nAs long as no real (networked) co-op option is implemented, I can't recommend this. Sorry...\n==== END Original comment ====","November 20, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
