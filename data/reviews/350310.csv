In other words, your 360 controller (or most modern controllers that don't have a switch) won't work without some 3rd party finagling, but your old cheap controllers will.\n- Default controller bindings are extremely awkward\n- Also getting the crashes early into first map.\n- Configuration app defaults to Japanese but can change it to English by going into the 2nd tab, selecting English in dropdown box, then clicking the middle button. The left button resets all settings and the far right button cancels all config.\n- Does not technically support Borderless Windowed but seems to work without issue with the Borderless Gaming app.\n- What the hell are these activation keys for?\n- Forgot to add, when you create a mercenary you can enter a name but it won't let you use the keyboard normally. The controls in general for navigating the creation menu are also awkward.\n\nProbably worth getting once patched but until then, don't do it man.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soaring_spirit/recommended/350310/","soaring_spirit","Soaring Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soaring_spirit/","249 products in account","I'd say that a large amount of the reviews are simply unfair hate with possible neglected attention when it comes to settings.\n\nTo get it out the way, you can change the language to English via the Configuration Launcher, Its in a dropdown menu in the 2nd Tab I think. As for Frames it should be fixed by turning off the VSYNC, if you still have issues turn of some of the extra options like Anti Alias AO Shading etc ie things with an OFF option. Adding "Run in compatablility mode" is supposed to also help with issues, I did this to all 4 .exe's just to be sure. Also bear in mind that while Frames may be low in the Tavern, they are usually good in the actual game (or at least they were for me).\n\nIn terms of crashes, I have only experienced them during the Nightmare storyline. I did not have any while doing The Hundred Years War Storyline which is the bulk of this game. I would also like to add that these crashes have occured after running the game (as in No lifeing it) for pretty much 4 days straight if a bit less, so maybe some fatigues on the system as its quite hot where I am at the moment.\n\nAs for the game itself, I thinks its a wonderful remake and improvement of the original BLADESTORM: The Hundred Years War, with its extra features making the game a bit more dynamic if a bit easier at times (I'm specifically refering to having access to up to 3 extra mercenaries, combined with the fact you can now decide what your default unit is, so feel free to spam horses all day).\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed replaying this remake and have not regretted my time invested in the game. The changes to the system while simple have made it different enough to enjoy replaying and my only really gripe would be the fact that they didn't think to make life easier for players buying bulk items, as you have to buy and equip each item indvidually on each character you are using, which is fairly annoying when managing more than 4 characters, and even then it can get tedious. At the same time it would also have been nice to compare stats in the menu's to characters other than my main character, as I have to go through menu's to check it in comparison to my other characters gear, which is again another minor gripe.\n\nOn the plus side however, it is worth noting that SP is now shared accross all books so if you have a certain type of book you need to level but hate using, (I'm looking at you Chariot and Engineer) you can feel free to farm the SP via another book on another character and simply use the Unit type once for a specific mission in game. A boon of which I have really appreciated, alongside being able to play as Units other than just custom Mercenaries.\nMoving on to the Nightmare storyline, I have really enjoyed the freshness it has bought to the series, though I do feel its a bit short while extremely challenging at times. I say this as a player who has entered Nightmare mode with a complete character who's very high level in most the Units I prefer (Yes Level 99 Lancers FTW).\n\nSo while I look forward to going back through it again to pick back up all the special new versions of existing Units and actual Units (Like Dragon) I am not exactly sure as to whether I can warrent the £50 I have paid for the game. I cannot pretend I have not had a very good time out of the storyline, the replay value thats been added or the prospect of replaying the "The Hundred Years War" Storyline again but this time as some kind of otherworldly mercenarie riding Dragons/Giants/Griffins or whatever into battle. I have certainly rushed though this game hard and as such its making me struggle to determine whether its price is justified. The extra story is certainly good, and I've shared my good opinion of the changes that have been made, but truth be told if you own a PS3, you could get a majority of the expierience much cheaper buying the original Hundred Years War version.\n\nIn final conclusion I would probably say that while this game is good (if you don't mind actually setting it up properly for your computer), unless your buying it as a completely fresh player, you may wanna wait for a Steam sale or a drop in price of some sorts to fully enjoy the new storyline. Otherwise feel free to buy it as it is, a fun and good game that might be a touch overpriced at £50 but certainly going to keep you busy if have not played the original. I mean lets face it, its unlikely your going to blaze through it quickly and have time to enjoy it properly anyway, right? Its not £50 your investing into a 6 hour game (as most of us gamers have done) its £50 you'll be investing in a good amount of hours worth of play :D","June 8, 2015","true","87.3"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","50","61","0","3"

I have a high end graphics card with a powerful CPU and on max settings I still don't get a guarenteed 60 FPS. The game on launch is in Japanese but there is a community guide on how to change it on steam.\n\nThe price is also a big negative however as no game should really be at this price and not be able to last the test of time. If it is on sale I recommend it, but as it is I would say wait for a sale.\n\nFirst of all if you have played the original Bladestorm it is fairly similar but looks better has another campaign as well as a few new mechanics and features.\n\nSecondly, the setting. It is based in a very romanticised version of the 100 years war so it will have troops which weren't present such as ninjas, barbarians and magic. Do not expect a realistic game it is Koei Tecmo.\n\nThirdly, the game allows you to select units into battle and later on you got take extra commanders in and form armies.\n\nFinally difficulty, as it stands there is almost no difficulty. If you want to speed through the game go through the nightmare mode untill you get guns and then go through a few missions with as many commanders as you can with guns form an army and victory is easy.

Steam's refund policy came after this was released, so a lot of us got stung by that, because we spend more then '2 hours' trying to find a way to play the game, or we waited desperately for Koei to say something, but they didn't.\n\nInstead, they moved on to Toukiden: Kiwami, another Playstation 4 Port, where they then said they found an issue with certain nVidia cards. Then, the reports came in again, from nVidia users, that they have constant crashing issues, including owners that are not on the list of the cards listed to have a problem. Like Bladestorm, the issues where with 'Windows 8.1' and yet the game is listed to be compatable with 'Windows 8.1' but if you own certain cards, by nVidia, you have to run it in Windows 7 to get it to work... if you're so lucky.\n\nThen you had the fixes, rolling back drivers to older ones, Windows 7 Compatability, turning everything down to low, turning things off. It's not acceptable and as someone who has followed Koei's releases on Consoles way back from Dynasty Warriors 2, I find it extremely saddening that Koei are giving us PC Gamers, games that are unstable, broken or extremely restricted to certain hardware. It isn't fair, especially with the price they're asking and it isn't right; and despite being a fan of Koei's games, I'd honestly say that if Bladestorm and Kiwami are what we can expect to get from them, then avoid unless you have an AMD Card, or one of the few nVidia GPU's that seem to be working without issue.\n\nOr, you have Windows 7. God help us when Windows 10 comes out.","July 3, 2015","false","5.4"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","29","37","0","0"

I was a huge fan of Bladestorm on the 360, but the lack of co-op kind of sucked. I have played almost all of the Musou games with my brother and the funnest part was definitely the co-op. I started playing this game with a friend of mine and I am happy with it so far. I have a GTX 970 and with all the settings maxed, I have a steady 60 FPS, the only exception was the tutorial. We've played a good few hours, and neither of us have experienced any crashes or major issues. If I'm to offer any advice, it's that if you want to play storyline missions with your friends, they have to have them unlocked as well, so you may have to switch hosts and grind renown sometimes. Also, no split screen co-op, so keep it in mind. Conclusion: If you love Dynasty Warriors or Kingdom Under Fire games, pick this up, but for the best experience, play it with a friend.","March 23","true","5.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When I ran the game again, and looked for save files, it seems there was a mid-battle autosave, so I didn't lose all of my progress. You also have the option of being able to manually save in battle, so crashes are more of a minor annoyance. Like I said though, I've only had one crash so far. I should also mention I have Win7 64-bit. It seems people are having problems with OS's higher than it, and have to set it up for Win7 compatibility.\n\nAside from that, I have no complaints. I would suggest waiting for a sale, because the full price tag is a bit steep IMO. I got it for 60% off, and consider it to be good value considering what the game has to offer. You basically can swap units, depending on what situation you find yourself in. Every troop has their weakness, so it pays to learn which units are most effective against others.\n\nIt seems this game has quite a bit to offer. I played the original Bladestorm on PS3, so if they've added another full campaign, then the content alone woudl warrant a purchase when it's on sale at a good price.\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter playing about 10 hours, i definitely give this game a thumbs up.

If you can get the game to run at an acceptable level, and are enough of a fan of the old ps/xbox release that you are willing to spend the money (which I do believe to be a little ridiculous), they you will surely enjoy this slightly expanded illiteration.\n\nI've yet to play the nightmare campaign, but I know if you fufill certain conditions you can unlock units from nightmare to play in your 100YW side of the game, which is a bonus. Along with that comes a greatly improved character creator, with the option to use multiple created characters in your campaign as well as send them off to earn you money and equipment while you play your main/do something else.\n\nYou should probably wait until this one goes on sale, or gets some patches for the crashing people are experiencing.

I love Bladestorm.\n\nI love nearly every game Koei makes.\n\nI will never buy another game of theirs for the PC.\n\n\nWhen a game offers a configuration menu when you try to start it, I like to take a look at it, drop all the setting to their lowest, and go up from there. I couldn't even read it. I had to spend four minutes trying to find the setting that changed the language to english. I felt that things could only go up from there. I was wrong.\n\nI beat the recommended system requirements, so it stands to reason the game will be playable. In the Hundred Years War mode (the old bladestorm story basically) you start in the bar. I wasn't paying too much attention, but the fact everyone was missing their skin texture was pretty obvious off the bat, and also vaguely amusing. The single-digit framerate wasn't though. Despite putting twenty minutes into it, I was unable to get through the bar.\n\nI'll gladly recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-sayonarababy-/recommended/350310/","-sayonarababy-","💋SayonaraBaby☠","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-sayonarababy-/","30 products in account","The game has already been released back in 2006 and recieved a new makeup on Steam as well as on PS4 and XBox One.\n\nI bought and played the Xbox 360 version a few months back and I enjoyed the game. On the Xbox 360 the game sometimes simply froze and I lost 30-60 minutes of gametime which made playing this game very frustrating sometimes.\n\nFor fans of Koei games I can be very Brief: This game is a mix between Dynasty Warriors and Kessen. It has more strategic elements than Dynasty Warriors because you decide which troups you command or if you go all out by yourself (usually not recommended). There are certain strategic points you should follow but also can achieve a victory by your own strategy. Some quests however demand to follow a certain order to siege on enemy camps.\nThere is also more action than in the previous Kessen games though the game is less story driven. You have more command not only over your own charakter but also over your troups which you can switch during battle. The difference to Kessen is that your ally npc generals will always be played by the computer and you cannot controll those.\nThere are a lot cutscenes telling the main story of the hundred years war and its interesting to fight either side of the French or British Kingdom. The skills you can use depend on which troops you command and there are so many different troops you can unlock during the game. Same goes for armor and weapon.\nThe graphics look far better than the ones of Dynasty Warriors Empire or Xtreme Legends.\nYou will probably start the game on Japanese settings but it has in fact a good English translation for both voices and menu/subtitles if you start the game with the English -exe in the Steamapp folder. I personaly enjoy the new Nightmare mode a lot since it gives the game not only a good makeover but also a new story element similiar to the Orochi series.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nFor people who arent familiar with Tecmo Koei games (do they even exist? lol kidding):\n\nThis game is a mix between an action and a strategy rpg set during the Hundred years war in France.\n\nYou can create your own officer and have already plenty of options to chose from gender, voices, hairstyle, bodyshape etc.\nOnce you finally created a char which might take you quite a while you start as a mercenary for either the French or British Kingdom and the first battle serves as a tutorial which explaines you the games mechanics. Mainly you have to take controll over a huge range of troops such as spearsmen, swordsmen, archers, lancers and many more. You cannot controll all of the different troops at once but have to first get a command book unlocking that ability.\nYou also can buy weapons, armor and other upgrades or level up your or your troops skills at the local tavern after you return from a battle. Before, during or after a battle some cutscenes tell the story. Some battles will only serve as a way to get more experience and gold while others will let you progress with the story. The difficulty also sometimes can be chosen depending on the battle you join.\n\nI suggest you use a compatible controller because gameplay might be a bit smoother but that is up to you. I will not review the performance of the game since I do not have a high end gaming pc. Some ppl say they can run a decent 60 fps while other struggle to get 30 and say its badly optimized. You better ask in the forum, let ppl know your pc specs and wait for some feedback before buying the game if you worry about performance.\n\nThe game in my opinion is a lot of fun and you can have a lot of hours playing through the story mode. There is another fantasy like mode called nightmare mode including midevil fantasy creatures such as goblins and dragons which give you again a huge amount of gaming time. The graphics arent the most advanced but they are solid and good to look at. I can recommend this game and if you enjoy a game with an action, rpg, strategy mix made by Japanese devs, you wont be wrong with this title. If you cannot make up your mind by watching the screenshots and some trailers/youtube videos I simply suggest you try out a sale. I got this game for about 60% off (23,99 Euros).

But I feel they have not put in any effort in porting it towards steam and the pc. At first I spent about half an hour attempting to click random buttons to change the game to english, a understandable struggle as the company is not english and that is a respectable decision for them. Afterwards I noticed that the game was almost a direct port from xbox, asking us to push buttons from the controller here, and not telling us the actual keys to press on the keyboard. The gameplay is fair enough, even though I myself feel they have strayed from the original mechanics with leveling and squad control, I feel that could be more enjoyable towards the public.\n\nCONCLUSION: BLADESTORM: Nightmare is a good game that has not recieved the proper attention it needs in order to port it and could be fixed but I see no sign of it.","July 3, 2015","false","1.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It is not worth the $60 in this condition at all, I will just hope that Koei soon makes Bladestorm Nightmare more portable, or just buy the game when its selling for 5-10 dollars and lower the graphics quality even if you have a moderately good gfx card.","June 3, 2015","false","4.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

In addition, throughout every cutscene, the animations play at one tenth the speed of the audio, turning a 10 second conversation into nearly two minutes of watching a facial expresion change. Maybe my system can't handle it, or maybe there's a problem with my copy, but even reinstalls havent fixed any part of it. I dont recommend picking this up quite yet.\nThat aside, the gameplay I've seen thus far has seemed at least fairly simple, and the story doesn't seem too complex, but fun nonetheless, but as I haven't had much of a chance to see much a game, I am naturally biased because of such frustrations. perhaps it may work for you, but i recommend waiting to see if there are patches to fix the above in case this isnt an isolated issue.","June 28, 2015","false","9.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

No issues with the game. Playing at max settings and achieving 60 FPS. The game looks decent for the type of game it is and very enjoyable. Love the combat and how much there is to do in this game.\n\nOnly thing I dislike is there is no option to change icons to the controller settings.

But I went ahead anyway and I'm glad I did, When I installed the game, I wasn't able to play because the screen would turn black while in map or in the tavern. I thought I made a huge mistake. But before I got crazy, I messed with the graphical settings and solved my issue. I had to turn off reflection completely and now the game runs flawlessly. This may not fix every issue, but it worked for me. That is a bit annoying to have to do, and to be fair $60 is a bit steep for this game, but if you are a fan of the console version of the hundred years war, you get that plus a whole new campaign in nightmare. I recommend this game to fans, not someone just looking for something new. Also be willing to mess around with the graphical settings. I am running the game on high everything but with reflection off. That solved my issue where I could hear the game sound but see only black and tares of color.
