Some of the humour may not be for everyone and puzzles occasionally confusing, but overall it's perfectly playable and enjoyable for people who speak english. :]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuGor_CMjfU","January 7, 2015","true","0.5"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","40","47","0","1"

It is tricky but managable, at least most of the time. :P The presentation is charming and the music sounds funny/weird which fits the game perfectly. I can recommend this game if you are looking for an exotic point and click adventure, since its east european style is charming and unique. I needed around 70-80 minutes to finish the game, but with help since I really was impatient. The game is clunky gameplaywise and you could get annoyed after a while I guess. Anyway, it is cheap and at least worth a try if you are into something different.","January 8","true","1.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
