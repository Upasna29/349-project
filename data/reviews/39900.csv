But the framerate is horrendous, the fact that mouse should be smoothened because now it  moves in annoying jumps doesnt help either.","December 29, 2013","false","0.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The game feels very uneven, like made by an amateur. The tutorial is too long and too intrusive, you never really get to play and test what it tells you. The tutorial doesn't switch off automatically, you have to go to the settings. Even on the easy level you get very quickly killed, and after that the game is just over -- no savegame, no checkpoint, nothing. Each time you start from the very beginning, not even your player name is remembered. And after dying, the default option is not -- as one would expect -- to start a new game, no: the default is to visit the game's website. The end effect is that one has to make a lot of effort just in order to actually get into the game -- let alone enjoy it. This needs a lot of polish, even for a low price of 4€.","January 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Controls are simple enough (mouse to look, WASD to fly relative to where you're pointing), and the learning curve is nice and forgiving.\n\nUntil you look outside the box(es). Then ♥♥♥♥ gets real. Seriously, solid recommendation. It's a cheap game. Enjoy.","January 5, 2013","true","6.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It's a fun game, and it's a lot deeper than it looks. It's more than it looks, like a 2D shooter in 3D, it's also a very deep sandbox building and expansion game.\n\nDefinitely worth the small price.","March 6, 2011","true","31.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"
