"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/12180/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 78%Even though GTA2 is sort of the black sheep of the franchise, it is easy to fall in love with its easier overhead driver/shooter mechanics and zanier atmosphere that manages to hide the issue of repetitive missions and tiresome platforming sections.\n\nLong version:Grand Theft Auto 2, while it retains many gameplay elements of GTA1, is still the odd one out when it comes to the franchise. For starters, it is the only game that isn’t tied to a real-world city or time frame: Anywhere City is a featureless metropolis, and the supposedly 2013 date doesn’t fit the 1950s car designs.\n\nJust like in GTA1, the goal of the game is to earn enough money to advance to the next level, usually accomplished by accepting jobs from three rivalling gangs to raise the score multiplier. These jobs also earn respect, a new mechanic that forces the player into some love/hate micromanagement to access high-tier missions at the cost of making entire neighbourhoods hostile.\nThe missions themselves are quite varied in flavour text but not in objectives: you either chase down a target or try to get a specific vehicle to a specific spot. There is some emphasis on platforming, especially in the last district, but these sections are probably the worst in the entire game.\n\nGameplay also had some tweaks, and the result is a double-edged sword. Everything is easier now with the introduction of a player health bar and by increasing the sturdiness of every vehicle. And everything also feels more dragged out with a camera that essentially prevents going fast or missions where you are expected to take on entire armies on your own. The save feature and the ability to retry failed missions helps a lot, but in the end, GTA2 just feels more tiresome (yet more thought-out) than its predecessor did.","February 19","true","7.8"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","20","26","3","3"

Игра доступна по Steam с 4 января 2008 года. В России игра была локализована и издана компанией «Бука» под названием «GTA 2: Беспредел».\n\nВводное видео к игре является нарезкой из восьмиминутного короткометражного фильма, снятого в 1999 году для повышения популярности игры. Данный фильм доступен для свободного скачивания с сайта Rockstar Games.\n\nНачав еще в GTA: London 1969 движение в верную сторону, ко второй части серия вплотную приблизилась к схеме, которая для GTA сейчас считается классической. Немного подтянув графику, игре оставили аутентичный top-down-ракурс, повысили сложность ролевых отношений с органами правопорядка и мафиозными группировками и, конечно же, сделали еще больше города, при этом так и не снабдив нас картой местности. Значительных изменений в геймплее так и не последовало, зато появилось сумасшедшее стилевое наполнение, подразумевавшее полное отсутствие таких часто встречающихся в играх вещей, как ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ьная музыка и не менее ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ьный арт. Заручившись поддержкой легендарного английского лейбла Moving Shadow, DMA получили в пользование дюжину достойнейших треков в диапазоне от фанка до драм-н-бейса. В рамках рекламной кампании была снята семиминутная экранизация игрового процесса GTA в стиле Гая Ричи («Большой куш», «Рокнролльщик»), с угоном грузовика группировки Zaibatsu, драгдилерством и спасением толпы кришнаитов.\n\nСтавка Rockstar на атмосферу показалась странной тогда, в 1999-м, хотя, по сути, ничего дурного в этом не было: игру банально подкрасили и переодели, но сделали это достойно.","January 18, 2013","true",""," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"
