In D, you're in AN UNDERGROUND MINE. It's gonna be crampped and kinda confusing. A personal computer's busses are not gonna come anywhere near that, and it does become quite klausteric in some portions, emphasising quick judgement and 6DOF-CQC, like Descent. The graphics are supposed to be fancy to reflect modern computers, although I will say that the engine the game runs on is quite inefficent, but powerful nonetheless.\n\nOne of the only negative aspects I can find about this game is the AI, where they're just kinda point-and-shoot, and don't move around much or do anything special like Big D had. I also didn't like how the conductor has this OP hitscan weapon while infected, but when NOT infected, he's defenseless. Don't do that.\n\nOkay, good elements: THE SOUNDTRACK. OH MY GOD THE SOUNDTRACK. It ain't D's techno shenanigans, but it fits the game damn fine, the synths come in warm and cold flavors and the boss themes are on-point, the neurofunk and Amen work is immaculate, and aranged OST is a standalone album - no question. Jonanthan Peros did a wonderful job composing and producing both the procedural and aranged work. I couldn't fathom how many bassbins would be destroyed if he ended up with a record deal on some label like Mindtech.\n\nThe story was grand. There were two layers: The good ol' fashion blow everything to Kingdom Come and save the babes, and then there was the email layer that told a deeper story for all those >muh immersion folks. I also like how the protag you play as actually IS a retrovirus. Able to function independantly through the system with no operating AV controller, change it's code on the fly, and then there's the Oracle's ability to forge definitions for unknown malware.\nThis level of AV tech simply does not exist yet. It is some next-level ♥♥♥♥. Most of the time, you have to have someone in meatspace to hand-scan lines and lines and lines of code before pushing it through with the next definitions update.\nI also LOVE the little detail at the end where the only weapon that can hurt the final boss (which takes place in the BIOS, obviously) is the Interupt (shotgun). If you know anything about computers, you'd know why that is.\n\nLastly is the gameplay. It's a bit slow, but the open Steam Workshop allows for gameplay modifiers, and Big D's was actually fairly slow too, until you mastered chording and/or the AB (D2 and especially in D3 where pulsing it at 100% can accelerate you to breakneck speeds). Honestly I found it completely playable, but the framerate kinda made it hard, but I pushed through anyway beceause it was enjoyable. I also liked the upgrade system, while it didn't seem complete, it was very useful and I got a lot of use out of it - switching between abilities while under fire to fulfill a situation that my current loadout can't eat.\nThere was one bug that bugged me, and that was that rockets that hit walls don't hurt you, but if they hit a target, they do hurt you.\nOH, and there are bugs that prevent you from 100% the whole game. But I got all the emails, so no biggie.\n\nOverall, 8/10 would play again. In fact, I actually have played it twice. Oh, and I bought the album. It can be found here[jonathanperos.bandcamp.com].","October 16, 2014","true","33.3"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","25","28","4","2"

It isn't a great game, but it's not bad either.  Gameplay reminds me of Descent(Never heard of it?  Look it up!).  The idea is you are an antivirus program inside of an infected computer.  Of course the inside of the computer is designed to be like subways, and other tight rooms and corridors.  I don't know why I can't get Wreck it Ralph out of my head but it can relate.  Different programs are different characters.  Anyway, the computer was infected with a worm so you have to work your way to finding it, killing stuff, and upgrading your definitions(abilities) to fight it.\n\nSo far there is a decent variety of weapons, enemies and challenges.  You are introduced with more along your journey at a not very impressive rate.  It does get repetative so I can only do about a level or two at a time.  But that might just be me haha and I do not think I am very far in it so things can really pick up soon.  I'll post updates as I play more or when I finish so check for comments before buying if you want to read any more crap I spew.","July 26, 2013","true","9.2"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

Retrovirus is a Six Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) FPS about a world within a person's computer, where a destructive worm has infected and corrupted the system. Your task as an agent of the anti-virus program is to of course, delete this worm. Emails scattered across the system, hints to the reasoning behind the worm attack.\n\n6DOF essentially means freedom of moment, so you're constantly flying and have to deal with threats that can occur from any angle in 3D space. RV can't escape (and possibly doesn't want to) the comparison to Descent and Forsaken/Forsaken 64 - I think the developer refereneces Descent in forums.\n\nMecanics are based on weaponry and technology that use a limited, but regenerative resource called cycles that are displayed on your gun. You also have a scan function to highlight enemies, a charged scan to scan a wide area of enemies and to activate marks (bullet holes) made by your weapons. These marks vary depending on the weapon, such as a small explosion with the pistol-like Dual Strike, push back with the minigun style Thrash, or creation of gravity wells with the shotgun-like Interruptor, my personal favoritte. The use of cycles essentially means unlimited ammo, but requires you to manage shooting as you can easily run out if you shoot too much and you don't have any reload canisters. This is a problem with the larger hoard fights and some boss fights as there where times I felt I couldn't deal with the threat and I felt impossible with the Corrupted Driver boss battle (until I found a level exploit). You can also upgrade your "ship" and weaponry with bytes earned from killing enemies, destroying corruption and orange byte pickups which I think are called Memories.\n\nI LOVE the high tech "Futuristicy" art style, though I'm not sure what I think about the combination of that mixed up with destroyed stone and concrete walls thanks to the Worm. I guess the idea is that the Worm is so destructive, that it's destroying the actual physical structure of the machine (though, the system is nothing like any computer I've any seen, it's obviously an interpretation)\n\nI found the game mostly enjoyable and I enjoy the technology puns and references - computer geeks may get a laugh out of the dialogue's sense of humor. I did get more annoyed near the latter quarter of the game where I died alot due to a couple bosses and a couple hordes. It's a shame that this game wasn't advertised well, because hardly anybody knows about it and there's never anybody available for Co-op campaign or competitive multiplayer (except for certain Days when the developer hosts game sessions).\n\nIf you're somebody that liked Descent or Forsaken, or a computer geek that likes sci-fi FPS games, this game is definitely worth checking out - it provided me with at least 12+ hrs of gameplay (admittedly, more deaths than I'd like). I must warn you that the game may require a strong gaming system, as the frame rate can drop significantly - it has 12-15fps on my Intel HD laptop and drops like crazy when I accidentaly leave Folding@Home on (though, it's CPU intensive anyways, but many players mentioned performance problems - look at the community hub) Due to the lack of community, it's probably best to wait for a sale or bundle.\n\n","November 15, 2013","true","15.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

I like the visuals of Retrovirus and the music (would buy the soundtrack). The story is nicely presented in a way that isn't intrusive but not overly vague either. There is enough concrete information given to me to follow along, while enough is left unsaid to keep me curious and exploring for more.\n\nI have been playing on "Admin" (medium) difficulty. The gameplay has been challenging in certain areas but not to the point of making me want to break my computer. I've died frequently but instead of making me frustrated, it's caused me to reconsider my approach to the room and strategy. In other areas I have the freedom to take my time and really absorb the visuals. Certain levels "deeper in the machine" were pretty impressive and I like how the interior of the computer has been portrayed. Some optional areas are so well hidden that I couldn't find them. There is replay value in exploring to find all those hidden gems.\n\nI use a gaming laptop and have not really noticed much in the way of performance issues that some people have commented about on the Steam forum. In some areas there is an FPS hit, possibly due to the size of the map, but it doesn't compromise the gameplay. There are some graphic glitches that the devs could spend some time polishing, and a few bugs (like Oracle speaking but the UI showing Courier's icon). I've broken out of a level once and had to reload, and there are a number of typos and grammar errors in the emails and displayed dialogue that should be fixed.\n\nI've played just over 12 hours and thought I was basically finished. Based on my progress for one of the achievements it looks like I have a ways to go yet! I haven't tried the co-op or multiplayer options yet either.\n\nFor the price? Definitely worth adding to your collection simply for some fun.","January 3, 2014","true","21.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If Retrovirus was half its length, I'd do it for it, too. But to say it overstays its welcome is selling the tedium of this game short. It's a thankless slog through a game which behaves like it's an early beta and not a full release, and the more you play, the more you feel like the devs are out of ideas and just play for time to be able to say that their game is X hours long. As a short experience, this could've been really cool, if not mechanically inspiring. As it is, I can't really recommend it unless you find it VERY cheap somewhere.\n\nSorry that Retrovirus is being made an example in this case, but devs have to understand that you've got to do what you're comfortable with. If you've got content for 3 hours, make a very well paced, tight game, and players will remember it for being better than six or eight hours of the same thing over and over again, motivated by a plot thread so thin that you'd need a microscope to see it.","September 13, 2014","false","6.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The simple and clean level design made descent work\n2. The size of the robots and bosses and being easy to read or distinguish by colors/sounds.\n3. The atmosphere.  The original Descent 1 + 2 (at the time) had atmosphere, this game hasn't learned anything from the lessons learned since Descent 1,2, and 3 (and that was quite a while ago).\n4. The essence of descent was the feel of the ship and the great weapon design.\n\nNone of these were researched or replicated.  The levels are often too big and too convoluted even though you have a navigator.  The levels feel very messy and you don't really remember much about them because everything is so cramped and jagged.  Descent needs just simple hallways with the detail kept out of the way.  Descent 3 (the worst descent in terms of gameplay) suffered the same problems this game does sadly.\n\nIf you're looking for a TRUE successor to descent look at talon.  Descent 3 is where descent fell off the tracks because they had poor weapon design, ship feel and the levels were too big.  This game repeats D3's failures sadly.\n\nCheck out http://www.refractorystudios.com/ for a true descent clone that understands what made descent great.

Taking inspiration from games like Descent and Portal and the classic CG show Reboot, Retrovirus puts you in the shoes of a no nonsense antivirus program living inside a computer. What makes it stand out is how injects its own sense of self into the gameplay to rise above these inspirations.\n\nTake the gunplay for example. While the game features six degress of movement ala the original Descent, meaning you can fly around in any direction, the game has health and ammo regeneration similar to what you find in today's cover based first person shooters. You can store a limited quantity of ammo packs and health pods, but most of the time you'll be doing your best to manage your health and ammo as the viruses try to kill you. There's also a skill tree that lets you customize your agent's powerset and weapons loadout, and you can opt to switch your talents around as well for when you run into situations that require some abilities over others. That said, oftentimes in combat I felt like I was always exactly one bullet too short to wiping out a virus, which can get frustrating when you're fighting a swarm. Fighting feels much slower in the beginning until you can start acquiring upgrades and more weapons, but the ammo problem leaves a bad first impression. It does eventually bring the awesome.\n\nLevel design is another area where the game shines. While mostly linear, they create good arenas in which for you to fight. Cadenza Interactive has helped make navigation a snap most of the time; the paths through the levels are marked with red and green portals. Green portals mark the way to go forward; red portals mean you're going backwards in the level. In some of the twistier levels where all the rooms start to blend together, this makes finding your way a lot easier. There's also an auto-levelling feature where your ship orients itself to the 'ground' depending on the room you're in, also helping to keep you aware of your surroundings. Finally, there is a 'help' function that guides you to your next objective path, but it's not always helpful for finding the last enemy in a room you have to clear. It also won't help you with any optional objects that the game can throw at you, but half the fun in these instances is hunting down the missing monsters or collectibles themselves.\n\nThe viruses themselves look like real monsters and things you might find in Aliens or the Matrix. However, I found the bosses disappointing in the design; they just look like bigger and beefier versions of the little creatures you've fought before. Some variety here would have been nice. In addition to the viruses, there are nodes of corruption that have sprung up all around them that give off a distinct neon purple glow.  Clearing these isn't just for show; hovering around them damages your ship. Taking them out gives a satisfying crunch as you sanitize an area not unlike shooting Aliens in the original Aliens Vs. Predator PC game. Unwillingly fighting alongside the viruses are program constructs, most of which look like variants of the AIs from Portal. They give off sad whines when attacked and can be even more dangerous than the viruses themselves when in groups. They add another wrinkle to the shooter formula as you have to manage the zombified AIs while taking down the viruses. It would be nice if they helped you but it's only in the late stages of the game that you encounter other programs that will join the fight. Most of the time they mingle and get in the way, which can be annoying.\n\nThe story is what it is: an excuse to get you into fighting a lot of nasty bad guys. What starts as a typical day for you and your handler, Oracle, turns into a nightmare when a worm invades. There are twists here and there, but they are expected for the most part and you won't be seeing anything new here. That said, it's well done and entertaining. The AI programs you meet all have their own personalities and help push the computer story along well, from a bubbly web client to the gravel and static voice of the AV Vault's Warden. The plot is a chase throughout the computer system, and you get to see the inner workings of a city inside your computer. The file systems of the email client give way to the rail systems of the web browser, and the environments do a great job of being varied so you never feel like you're retreading ground... until you hit some levels late in the game that  recycle content. Level recycling dampens the impression of the game because it wasn't hurting for content, but the level retreads make the experience feel a little fat. At least the game has a sense of pace to break up the super heavy infected levels with quiet strolls where you get to rearm and plan your next move. One set of levels introduces stealth mechanics that are serviceable enough for what they are. Inside the computer things are never dull.\n\nYou can uncover the real world story behind the virus by finding emails hidden throughout the levels. While not as compelling as the game itself, they do add an extra level to the narrative even if it's not as great as the invasion story playing out inside the computer. The humor found in the spam emails you find is too over the top to be funny, but they serve as nice breaks when you don't want to read about hackers getting in over their heads.\n\nRetrovirus clearly has its faults. The game's narrative over-extends its welcome, and some mechanics, such as using your system scan setting to activate alternative uses for your guns, feel tacked on rather than integral to the experience. There is also multiplayer and co-op, which I cannot comment on because I haven't played it. That said, the game makes for a complete packaged experience and the stats screen and Steam achievements will make this game good for die hard completionists. The world of your PC is well realized and full of neon glow wonder. Retrovirus is a breath of fresh air to a long dormant genre while striking out on its own.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go track down my copies of Reboot to watch again...","December 15, 2013","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure there are objectives written at the top right but nowhere near enough. The level design is quite big, and with the lack of pointer you can lose your way alot and backtrack because of that. Dead Space implements the best helper - if you press 'M' you'll be shown your way. More action less backtracking, great.\n\nNext comes the vertigo. This is shooter FPS basically but since you can move, literally, in all directions, you lose focus easily. You can train your eyes so you don't get motion sickness, but I gave up after trying. It's just too much. I can play CS: GO for an hour straight and can walk out just fine. This game gave me vertigo after 5 minutes. GG.\n\nGameplay's rather generic also. You just shoot your way around find key clear out enemies yadda yadda. I'm not expecting each game to implement open world, but well.... I don't think I can finish playing the game this way.\n\nGraphic is too bland also. Oftentimes I can't discern between real threats and pathways. I have to scan often so I don't get blasted unknowingly. Or maybe just me being bad.\n\nOverall: disappointing purchase. I'm glad I got this for less than a buck otherwise I'd be weeping over wasted dollar.","October 13, 2013","false","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well, it wasn't. Actually took me quite a few hours to clear it, although I wanted to 100% it more or less.\n\nI liked this game a lot, for various reasons. For one, you're taking the role of a little anti-virus software agent that is sent on a mission to rid the host computer of a malicious worm/virus, which is an incredibly interesting premise. As you float along the corridors and tubes of your beloved PC, you find e-mails scattered all over the place that will slowly but surely unveil the bigger picture behind this attack. Major sympathy points for the cheeky web browser Qat that can't be fed enough cookies. I love how the characters build up and change throughout the story, obviously affected by the virus.\n\nGameplay-wise, well a word of warning here: the steering takes a little getting used to, especially since the first few minutes will most certainly give you some kind of motion sickness. Once you get the hang of maneuvering your little ship though, you'll start enjoying hunting those evil corruptions. The difficulty curve stays steady throughout, bar the last fight which took some trial and error but it was at least a good challenge. Progression is really tough going though. Many passages seemed a bit too stretched and the fighting very repetitive at times - omniscan a certain area, find out where the intruders are, take them out one by one, rinse repeat. But it's fun, you do have a bit of choice with six weapons and several skills that you can tune to your liking. The music is good, could have used a bit more variety though.\n\nAll in all, this is a cute game worth playing. Especially computer nerds will definitely like wandering around the OS.","September 7, 2013","true","15.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

(You should, it was recently re-released on Steam.) You remember Tron? Retrovirus would be the child of those two.\n\nRetrovirus is a 6-degrees-of-freedom-first-person-shooter where you're the antivirus program in a computer. A worm gets into a person's system and starts destroying everything with its gross, purply corruption. Your job is to destroy the worm and clean up the system. The controls are very responsive, it's not really flight-sim-y as Descent is. It is, however, a resource hog. Older computers would probably have a hard time running it.\n\nThe mechanics go like this:\n\nYour health and "cycles" (basically ammo) regenerate. You get canisters for both which replenish it quickly when you find yourself in a tight spot. Your health doesn't start regenerating until the red meets the green. You upgrade your ship by collecting data from enemies you destroy, or other programs you clean up. There's also data clusters lying around in some levels as well. When you upgrade things on your ship, they're not final; you can switch them around as you please.\n\nUnfortunately, multiplayer's a bit dead; but the campaign is lengthy enough to keep you playing for a while. If you've got a friend with the same game, there's co-op as well. Plus, there's bots if you're into that.\n\n\nAll in all, it's a very fun, beautiful game which is worth the money.","April 4, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many people are calling it a Descent clone or comparing it to Descent, which is completely wrong; just because this is a 6DOF shooter doesn't mean it is the same game. That's like calling Serious Sam the same game as Call of Duty, because they're both FPS shooters.\n\nSure, the multiplayer's a bit dead, the bosses are too easy and the final boss is more of a monotonous grind than an epic last fight, but apart from that this is a brilliant game that isn't getting the recognition it deserves. The concept behind it is, as far as I am aware, totally original, there is a pretty good backstory, and the levels are well-designed. The soundtrack is pretty funky too, almost perfectly matching what you are going through in the game.\n\nThe only major issue with this game is the optimisation and the lack of graphics options apart from "make the pixels visible or not", but if you have a good computer or you're willing to deal with a less good-looking experience, this game will be incredible.","May 15","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
