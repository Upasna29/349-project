You take on the role of helping Crowman & Wolfboy escape the darkness that relentlessly follows in their wake.\n\nI typically don't like this type of game but the graphics and gameplay were both good enough to make me want to continue on playing for a bit. After a few minutes though, the monotony starts to set in and you will soon want to succumb to the darkness which you first avoided.\n\nI completed 15 levels in about 36 minutes; so you could easily complete the entire 30+ levels in around 1.5 hours flat! The price is right; but I would like to see some more content and features with this game. The game desperately needs settings such as sound and resolution; the only controls right now are for full screen.\n\nI'd pay $3.99 presuming the updates keep coming in. Purchase this only if you know that the game is not complete and will have more coming!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Note: Crowman & Wolfboy is currently in Early Access. The version reviewed was the first release.\n\nHelp the good-hearted Crowman and Wolfboy flee the Darkness to reach the happiest place on Earth.\n\nCrowman & Wolfboy is a two-dimensional platform game / runner hybrid, somewhat similar in basic gameplay to other games in this cross-genre combination, such as Vector, although with a completely different setting. It was originally released on iOS and Android back in 2014. Now in 2016 it has come to Steam in Early Access.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Great! Although the characters and levels are mostly black and white and shades of gray, they fit the storyline to a T. The art style is fantastic and the few characters have great personality imbued in their two-tone forms and animations. Even the faceless Shadow or Darkness that pursues the titular Crowman and Wolfboy oozes evil, brooding personality.\n\nSound - The soundtrack is very good, with excellent ambient music that once again fits the story perfectly. Sound effects are mostly good, but nothing special. Although, particularly well done is the painful whimper that you hear when Crowman and Wolfboy are injured.\n\nGameplay - The 2D platformer and runner combination has been done before, but it is used to great effect in Crowman & Wolfboy. Each level starts with our heroes standing still and once you have begun to move them you can't stop them again until they hit a wall or barricade, finish the level, or are captured by the ever-pursuing Darkness. The Darkness moves faster than Crowman and Wolfboy, however, so you have to keep them on their toes. Thankfully each level is scattered with white jiggling balls of light of different sizes, which our heroes pick up and hurl behind them at the Darkness to push it back, allowing them more time to complete the level.\n\nThe game begins with Crowman and Wolfboy only able to run and jump/fly a short distance. Throughout the game they gain a few more useful abilities, allowing more flexibility and variation in the levels. The difficulty curve is thus quite gentle as you are introduced to each new ability.\n\nThe levels themselves are well designed, some with two or more different paths through them, but were it not for the time pressure and continuous movement, they would be fairly standard, but relatively easy, platforming fare. To enhance replayability each level also has three different goals that can be fulfilled: rescue a fellow critter, collect enough of the larger light balls, and finish the level without being hit. However, at this stage these are not tied to Steam achievements, which I imagine will reduce their attraction to many players.\n\nThe Steam page states that the game has full controller support, but I haven't yet tested this. I played with keyboard and was a bit confused at first because some instructions mentioned the keys to press and others were buttons (e.g. A, X), which actually mapped to different keys.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Great ambiance\n+ Engaging story that's both entertaning and sad\n+ Likeable characters\n+ Very stable, with no bugs encountered\n\nCons:\n- Short: a little over 30 levels, but based on where I'm up to after an hour, I'd say you should be able to complete them in significantly under two hours with a little bit of skill or luck\n- Gets repetitive after a while; no achievements (yet) to award going back and replaying levels\n- Nothing new (yet) if you've already played it on mobile platforms\n- A little more work on the control displays would be helpful for those playing with keyboard.\n- The level after Bob's (I don't want to give away any spoilers!) swapped controls from WASD to arrow keys without warning.\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Crowman and Wolfboy is the most fun platform game I've played in quite a while. I really felt something for the main characters and wanted to ensure they succeeded in reaching their goal. It's a shame it's so short, but the developers have stated that there may be more coming in the future. Bring it on, I say!\n\n8/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","February 2","true","2.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

Not to bad for the price you pay. Coming in at 33 levels this game starts off by holding your hand and letting you know how things are going to be. After you start to understand some of the basic mechanics of the game is when it lets go of your hand and lets you fend for yourself.\n\nIt's a runner platformer meaning that directional running will be automatic once you start going. You are also running from something the entire adding pressure to this concept. This doesn't take to long to pick up on, but it can be challenging at times because it means you will have to master some jumps in order to progress safely.\n\nThere is some replayability because some abilities you get later can be used to collect things in earlier levels.\n\nThe music is very ambient as if you are the only two things left. It's pretty decent but it can get a bit samey after a while.\n\nThe art is really the strong point for this game. The mix of black and white have a pretty neat effect as far as the art style.\n\nAll in all I'd say go ahead and pick this up for the small price. I got a good 2 hours for playtrough so that's not bad. Plus there's going back through for collection.","January 23","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
