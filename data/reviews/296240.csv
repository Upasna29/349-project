I couldn't stop playing until i was done with it :)\n\nCons:\n- couldn't really play in window mode, because it would crash for me (only one crash in Fullscreen)\n- well, not really 24+ hours of gameplay. It took me 10 hours to play through and unlock all (ingame) achievements. the only thing i didn't do was complete all Pirate-levels with 5 Stars (because i'm not a big fan of Angry Bird-mechanics)\n\nPros:\n- although the game crashed a couple of times, no progress was lost\n- 10 hours of simple fun (totally worth the money, even at full price)\n- 12 levels of an Angry Bird style Pirate game\n- addicting unlock system, where you want to procede into higher tiers and unlock more buildings\n- it starts of very simple and gets alot more complex as you have to handle alot more wares and workers, but it never felt overwhelming\n- time challenges (optional) where you have to do certain tasks or get a fixed amount of wares (reward is a small bonus and it counts towards an achievement, but you can take all the time you want to finish)\n\n\nWhat do you have to do in this game?\nIt's all about handling your settlers. There are five different Professions which they will specialise in, depending on what you let them do more often. They will ofcourse work faster when they do a job which they are specialised in (but don't worry you can relearn them later on in the game).\nOn top of that they have 3 Statusbars which will decrease over time and might slow down their workflow alot. There is\n- Hunger (will decrease over time while they work)\n- Companionship (will decrease depending if they like their job, are ok with it, or dislike it; to raise it they will interrupt their work and talk to another settler for a while)\n- Health (some jobs are marked as risky and they will cost life over time; they won't die but need to heal up from time to time at the hospital - which needs herbs, so just like with food you have to watch out that you have enough of it)\n\nThe buildings are in fixed locations so you have to manage how many workers you declare per building or you need to drag and drop your settlers to fasten up their production rate.\nYou also have to trade your wares for Gold so you can afford more Settlers and upgrades for your buildings.\n\nSo if you like to build-up, manage economy / workflow and trade - this game is absolutely for you.","April 26, 2014","true","10.0"," 75 of 81 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","75","81","0","0"

I was most put off by the poor English in store page and such, considering it seems to be a quasi-fantasy game roughly about the English settlement of North America.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised.  I started playing it, and I did not stop for 7 hours.  Even now, I only stopped playing because I started falling asleep in my chair.\n\nIt's a slow-paced, easy-going town-builder in which you grow your "colony" from a single building and a few colonists into a bustling village, complete with trade, jobs, building upgrades, and scientific research.  I really appreciated that it never makes you feel anxious about staying on top of things, like the Anno series can sometimes do.  You totally set the pace in this game, so if you're looking for a relaxing play, this could be for you.\n\nI was surprised by the quality of the game.  While a few things are a bit off--like the way the colonists perform the exact same animation at the exact same time when they talk to one another--the game shows a lot of polish, overall.  I never felt like my enjoyment of the game was being damaged in any way by a lack of effort or expertise on the part of the game's designers and/or developers.\n\nIt's a bit like a slimmed down and streamlined Sims meets Farmville meets Anno, without any stressful situations, pushy monetization, or excessive micromanagement.  Overall, I would recommend this game to fans of its genre, though I would not really know what to call it.","September 6, 2015","true","11.3"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","40","41","0","0"

But what do you know - while getting those drops I've actually started playing - and got so hooked it's not even funny!\nThat game stands next to Artist Colony, My Tribe, Gemini Lost, Wandering Willows (well, sort of), and Virtual Villagers (sans starving and otherwise meeting their demise villagers). If you ever played any of that - you will feel right at home from the very start. And yes - I've played all of those (and more).\nPluses: really nice appealing art, easy to learn, easy to master, there's no sensitive controls or time limits that you have to meet to progress further in game...\nMinuses: if you are looking for high-octane action - that game is not for you. If you don't like resource management - that game is not for you. If you don't have patience for micromanaging and otherwise keeping track and ordering around 50 "loyal subjects" - you probably will not like it much (but I might be wrong).\nNow if only they add Steam achievements to that... ;P\n\nP.S. It took me 15 hrs to beat from start to finish - no skipping puzzles, no guides or tutorials, but not getting high scores in mini-game either.

It's a really simple casual game but there's a lot going on and it's really enjoyable if you're looking for a relaxing experience that doesn't require a huge amount of concentration.\n\nThe basic setup is similar to a lot of other games, gather resources, build things, make stuff, sell things, get gold, upgrade buildings, get more workers, etc. There is quite a nice variety of resources and manufactured goods, and a couple dozen buildings at least, each with its own series of upgrades.  There is also a research laboratory that allows you to study half a dozen separate advancements, and those unlock buildings and upgrades in your industries and elsewhere in your colony.\n\nThe workers will specialize and become more efficient after doing a certain task for a while. I especially like that the workers themselves have preferences, and if you put them in a job they enjoy, they are more productive than if you assign them a task they dislike. I also really enjoy the way that you pick up your workers to move them to tasks, and that they totally react to you doing that.\n\nThe housing has an interesting puzzle aspect to it. You can upgrade your houses to increase the number of workers you can have, but it requires manipulating rooms in a sort of jigsaw puzzle in order to maximize the number of colonists each building can hold.\n\nFinally, there is a mini-game simulating naval combat that basically is Angry Birds with cannons and pirates.","August 13, 2014","true","12.3"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","7"

It is on rails for the most part but it's a nicely designed, fairly slow paced simulation. Graphically appealing despite the lack of video options. I also noticed near the end that the music was still uplifting and not getting old like other game's musical scores do. The sound effects are mostly charming and minimal which helps when these sounds play over and over so many times.\n\nThe player has the choice to micro-manage for quicker growth, or to sit back and let things happen. Your citizens will perform their assigned tasks without maintenance. The only real choices to make are what order to spend your research or tobuild your buildings in, switching output of specific industries (switching the metal worker between gold and silver output) and specific chores for the individual citizens. Buildings are built in pre-planned spaces, and you do not choose how many of each there will be; there will be only 1 iron mine, 1 kitchen etc. However, there are 3 farm plots that unlock as the game progresses and each is relegated to specific crops.\n\nEach citizen has a preffered task and a hated task. The citizen can do any chore you want, but will stay happy if doing their favorite job and lose happiness fast if they are doing their hated job. I also feel that they skill up faster if doing something they like or are trained to do. The only combat whatsoever takes place in an Angry Bird fashion, and can be replayed as much as you wish. So you won't permanently lose any battle. It's a refreshing change of pace actually.\n\nI've played through it once and I might try it again. The single playthrough was worth the money. I don't always finish games, even the ones I like, usually because they lose me along the way. This one kept me interested until the end. I didn't feel overwhelmed, and I didn't feel the need to micro-manage to the end. I also was equally comfortable letting it run as I went to the bathroom or got a drink; event result in a pop-up that pauses the game until you click on the screen.\n\nFor the price, I do recommend this game.

There are tons of resources to gather, buildings to build and upgrade, and a good variety of areas to explore. You'll gradually manage more and more colonists with varying abilities as you explore the map and make the most of all the land has to offer, as you quest for the fabled Fountain of Happiness.\n\nWhat surprised me most about the game is an the addition of "pirate battles," which really play more like rounds of Angry Birds. There are 12 of these stages, and they are satisfying and welcome diversions. I could have easily enjoyed many, many more of these battles, but really, the bulk of the game is spent building your colony through gathering and trade.\n\nThe Promised Land is a much better game that you might think it would be.

You gradually come to realize that what you thought was the tutorial is actually the entire game. There's only one map, and the game basically takes you step by step through it. You can't fail at anything, and there's no challenge. The entirety of the game you will spend simply waiting for more of a resource to collect so you can build something that will then require you to wait for more of a resource to collect. It's as if someone took the resource management part of Age of Empires and turned it into a game. The end result is there's nothing at all you can do with your resources. If there was a game speed increase, you could finish the entire game in 20 minutes.\n\nThere's some lurking potential here if some mechanics for challenge were added. I kept hoping the "game map" was a shortened tutorial map that would later throw you into a series of more unforgiving islands. Perhaps the developers will later turn this into a full-fledged title with suitable strategy, but I cannot recommend the gameplay that's presented here.","August 4, 2014","false","3.6"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

My ship was attacked by pirates once at the beginning so I was almost looking forward to that- the risk, the danger! But then later I realized how long it would take to recoup resources I was horrified at the idea.\n\nI would *maybe* recommend it to people with young children or perhaps chronic multi-taskers who are in the process of reading a book of some kind. The play is SO unbelievably, painfully, slow. Wait wait wait until you build up enough whatevers. The people move slowly, you can't speed them  up, you can't zoom out to look at large areas. I have gotten 28 villagers and it seems like it took forever. One thing that really irritates me is that it automatically pauses when you alt+tab to try to kill time on social media or something.\n\nOn top of that, random talk bubbles come up that essentially pause the game until you respond so you can't just let it go while you go make dinner or something. The prompts are constantly coming up to sell something and putting everything you have into that resource to sell larger quantities is time and resource consuming.\n\nFishing is way too slow (even by this game's standards).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/recommended/296240/","abbydonprime","AbbydonPrime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/","515 products in account","This was an interesting worker management game. Unlike many of the others that involve simply assigning people, collecting resources, and then building, this one has some additional unique features. Most notably, the workers have job likes and dislikes, and they can become skilled in a particular type of trade, such as farmer or miner. They will level up, and become more productive, the longer they do a certain type of task. They can also be sent to school to skill up.\n\nTo gain money, resources and products can be traded with the mainland via the ship. New workers are also hired from the mainland this way. Specialty items have to be purchased from the mainland. Every now and then, a certain type of item will become more in demand and be worth more. This is when you assign as many workers as possible to collect and/or manufacture to fill the demand. As the game progresses, workers, specialty items, upgrades, etc, will get more expensive, so taking advantage of the demand spike helps raise money faster.\n\nAs part of the story, there are pirates to be dealt with. This is done by firing a cannonball at their "boat" structures. There are a limited number of balls, so they have to be aimed just right in order to cause an optimal toppling to take out multiple pirates. There are a few of these to deal with during the quest, and the final ones can get a little annoying. But, you can retry as much as needed.\n\nThere isn't any way to die and resources are infinite, so it really is a casual game. As with most Alawar games, it is very aesthetically pleasing with appropriate music and sound effects. I don't think it's worth $6.99 due to the relatively short play time and no real replayability, but it's worth picking up on sale if you just want to relax and not stress about losing.\n\n---\n\nFor more...

The animations are very cute and simple. Simplicity can cause some games to lack entertainment and a good foundation but it works very well in this case. I enjoyed them the whole way through.\n\n*Hours to complete: 10 hours on average\nI was able to beat the game and complete all challenges in the game within 10 hours.\n\n*Story line: 10/10\nThe story line is very simple and cute. You're starting a new civilization on this, "promised land".\n\n*Game play: 8/10\nYou don't get to choose where the buildings are placed, as there are already slots where they are automatically pre-placed. However, you do get to choose the amount of citizens you want at a time; you can buy them whenever you have enough money/reputation points and you can choose their job. You can choose when and what to discover as a technological advancement when it suits your needs. It's a slower paced game so patience is a must. I duducted points on this category solely on the fact that the trading notifications are quite annoying. When the old land is in high demand for an item there will be a notification telling you which item is in demand. Then, your advisor lets you know there's only a minute or so left to finish the trade. After the timer runs out, there is a notification after that either says good job for trading or to trade next time. The notifications are a great concept and I like the fact that it's meant to be a reminder, however, after you've been playing the game for five hours straight it just becomes more of an annoyance than helpful.\n\n*Price: 10/10\nThe price today, 2/23/2015, is at $6.99. I would honestly and easily pay $15 for this game so the fact that it's under $10 is great.\n\n*Over all:\nI love this game an I totally recomend it if you like games where~\n> you can build your own civilization\n> you like slow paced or casual games\n> you enjoy art work\n> you love games under $10\n","February 23, 2015","true","15.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Unlike a lot of city building games this won't frustate you with revolts(after carefully trying to keep everyone happy)  and watching your community burn while you try to figure out what has suddenly gone wrong. It doesn't force you to brutalize and wage war against the native population.  Resources are infinite and you won't have to face plundering a land and laying waste to what drew you to it in the first place.   None of the unpleasantness of real life intrudes but this is very much what I like about it.   It is a casual game in this regard, yet it still has enough depth to keep you interested over the entirety of building the community.   I wish life could be more like this and I have been satisfied by the time I have spent with it.   If getting away from games that try to force a lot of ugliness upon you,  in the name of realism,  appeals then this game is well worth the modest price.","October 30, 2015","true","16.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Players will frequently encounter an odd-ball assortment of arcade mini-games and puzzle challenges.\n\nThe sound is good.  The game is fun to play and immersive.  The graphics are particularly cute with plenty of humour lavished in some of the animations.  There are many incidental references to stereotypes which are presented in an anecdote and comedy fashion.\n\nThe player recruits and trains villagers.  Villagers specialise in various gathering and manufacturing professions.  A few villagers need to be dedicated to research to unlock parts of the skill tree.\n\nThis all sounds simple, but the player needs to focus on each villager to ensure their need for food and socialising is met.  Fail to keep people fed with food and satisfy their need to talk or have company and they will desert their jobs and create a knock-on effect of shortages in food and materials.  Maintaining a happy balance and keeping colonists productive will keep players busy.  Success requires balancing of individual needs with the needs of growing the colony.\n\nNew buildings and professions become available as the player progresses through the game.  Upgrades to buildings and increased expertise in skills of villagers create a good sense of progression.  Villagers can learn more than one skill either via experience (Doing) or through education (Being taught).  Pay attention to the likes and dislikes of individual colonists to get the best results.\n\nAdditional areas are unlocked by reaching milestones.  The Promised land succeeds in that positive action is rewarded.  The game is moderately challenging but great fun to play and creates a sense of achievement and accomplishment.  Players also need to be cautious about expanding the colony too fast (or too slow for that matter).\n\nPlayers are able to re-play many of the mini-games to try and improve performance scores.\n\nThere should be approximately 30 to 50 hours of game play to complete the game.\n\n7.8/10","October 20, 2014","true","35.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I'd like to have seen something done with the 'social' aspect like this, something that fits the tone of the game like logging a best friend for them perhaps based on who they chat to the most, but even a randomly selected one would have been nice, just to add another little personal touch to them.\nI like to try and make it slightly more challenging by tailoring my colony to the likes and dislikes of each inhabitant, it's not at all challenging but I try lol.\nThis is one of those weird games that is a complete waste of time and yet you don't seem to mind at all.\n\nThe negatives for me:\nThe pirate mini game. I didn't mind it at first but the longer I play the main game, the less I feel it fits.\n\nThe people are quite varied in looks and mixed with the likes and dislikes they do feel unique and then there comes a point when you're adding colonists and they start becoming clones of ones you already have and if they have the same job type then they're also wearing the same clothing, and the uniqueness they had is gone *boo hoo*. I don't know if I've just been unlucky with the random choice available via the boat, but I feel if they'd had something very simple like a mix of hair colors for each character type that feeling of uniqueness could have been maintained for much longer.","June 27, 2014","true","41.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game also contains a bit of a puzzle component as you add rooms to houses to increase your population cap. It was fun, I rather enjoyed it and I find it well worth the price. I finished the game in ten hours, but I didn't accomplish every achievement to gold level. I agree it has pretty much no replay value, but I do intend to get more of the achievements now, as you can continue playing despite finishing the game.","May 2, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is no possibility of failure, no death, and no time pressure. Though not particularly challenging, it is still fun to see the colony grow.\n\nClearly there was a lot of attention to detail from the designers. An interesting touch was that the minimap changes in portrait-like fashion as new buildings are added. Apart from the main story, there are mini-games in the form of physics puzzles where the player can use a cannon to shoot wooden structures to knock down pirates. Kids will probably enjoy this part the most.\n\nThe game is a steal when under $5 dollars. One caution - the natives are depicted in a friendly, cartoonish way, but some may still find their images stereotyped and dated.","June 20, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, I feel as though this game is a bit lacking in comparison. It took me 10 hours to complete, but most of the time was just spent dragging the people from their workplace back to the town hall and then back to their work place because that saved so much time. It is addicting, though, and had angry birds-style mini games. Wish there had been more similar types of games within to vary it a bit. Also, towards the end I was just hoarding money because I had nothing else to buy. In general a good game. Not the best, and in my opinion (as someone who loves these games) not really worth all of the hype, but still has a lot to offer.

This game feels like it is a prequel to a future, much larger game based on the same strategy mechanics, but hopefully with expanded gameplay functions.  I do really hope these developers do make that game in the near future.  I don't think I would have been dissapointed paying full price for it, but for less than $2, I give it a 9.5/10.

The graphics are colourful and cartoonish, and very much reminds you of the sterotypical kids-games, but in a way that didn't bother me, at least. The colonist models are fairly diverse, and only repeated 2-3 times each among 50 colonists. The gameplay is easy enough to grasp, but has a certain pace to it that kept it interesting - despite a few instances of waiting for enough resources to tick in.\nThe game, however, is also very liniar in the sense that your progression in the game comes from completing a number of quests. These quests do allow some level of "free" development through research, but ultimately limits the type of resources you can get, what buildings you can build and so on to the progress of the questline.\nThe buildings are limited to fixed, preset locations, so the freedom to make your colony as you want is more or less non-existent\nThe 7,3 hours of gameplay I've had is a complete run with every challenge and in-game acheivement on the highest level.\n\nAll in all I found the game enjoyable to play through, but with little to no replay value. It's probably well suited for people unfamiliar with city-building or management games as a first peak into the genre.","August 28, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Starting out simple by gathering basic resources and and trade, you soon unlock many more different resources and buildings. Various special offers and challenges require you to adapt your strategy. In addition, a few minigames offer variation.\n\nReview:\nIf you are familiar with strategy games and simulations, you won't have any difficulties with to this one. The strongest differences to other games of this genre are its strong linearity and complete lack of frustrating elements. There is no death or failure here; the worst you can do is to make nonideal choices which will cost you time and bonuses, but still allow you to progress. If that happens, it is a little annoying that the trading information bubbles pause the game, but if you play somewhat decently, you won't have to endure any long waiting periods anyway.\n\nAll in all "The Promised Land" is quite casual, but nonetheless rewarding: You bond with the settlers, you enjoy the cute animations, you strategize without creating spreadsheets and simply relax in a pretty environment. Although I initially wanted to write that it doesn't have any replay value, I actually catch myself revisiting this game once or twice a year. While it is too difficult to be played by children on their own, with a helpful parent at their side they can certainly enjoy this game a lot.\n\nOh, and one piece of advice that I haven't found in the otherwise great ingame hints: The colorcoded circles around the number of people working on a task indicate which class specializes on it. For example, a blue circle on the Sugar Canes states that this a job best suited for Workers, while a green circle for the Fluffer Farm suggests that Farmers are best at Shearing.\n\nCons:\n- Little Replay Value\n- ~ 10 hours of gameplay\n- Only Fullscreen, no window mode\n- No Zoom, though a helpful minimap\n- Info bubble pauses the game\n\nPros:\n+ Pretty graphics and cute animations\n+ Pleasant music\n+ Villagers have basic personalities\n+ Nice minigames (Angry Birds style, Housing Puzzle, End Puzzle)\n+ Efficiency is rewarded, but progress is granted either way\n+ Absolutely no frustration\n\n\nConclusion:\nGet the game, especially on Sale, and you'll happily enjoy ten hours of a mini-vacation :)","April 24","true","45.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is your game!  Ever try to force your way through a few dumb episodes in series you're watching and need something to do on the other half of your monitor?  Look no further!  Does grandma call you and tell you about her virtual farm?  At least change the topic with this game.\n\nThis is a basic resource management game, with no way to fail or die.  You might beat this game in 7 or 8 hours if you really played with optimum efficiency.  On the other hand, were I to train my dog to touch a mouse, he'd probably beat it in his lifetime, too.  The only way to fail is in your own mind, when you realize how inefficient you've been.  It's a casual game, but I nonetheless found it strangely compelling, and even rewarding.\n\nYou start the game by managing a handful of settlers on an island.  You click a villager and drag him or her on top of a food source.  Poof!  That villager now gathers food.  You do this to other villagers to gather wood and stone.  You slowly gather resources and build (a pre-located) farm.  You manage the farm the same way.  Slowly, you build up a small town.\n\nAs you grow over this small island, things get a little more complex.  Each settler has a job like and dislike, as well as three basic stats - hunger, social, and injury.  But their stats don't harm them, just make them limp slowly towards a refill station.  If you can match a settler to a job s/he likes, then her/his stats will decrease at a much lower rate than someone who hate's their job.\n\nThis becomes important in the later game when you might have a bunch of jobs all lined up to create an industry.  For example: one guy cuts sugar cane, the next makes sugar, and a the next drops it off at a kitchen.   Meanwhile, someone grows corn, carries it to a mill and makes flour.  Those two ingredients make a special food.  That's probably the most complex industrial structure in the game - and there is a long lead into learning it.\n\nWhat makes the game compelling?\n\nFirst and foremost, it is cheap; often less than 2 bucks during any Steam sale.\n\nSecondly, it is a simple game, but rewards the player with little upgrades often enough to keep the momentum.\n\nThridly, it is bright and colorful, and the settlers have cute little graphics, like an exaggerated 'thumbs up' they use when you help them out (via click and drag) or are placed in a happy job, among others.  And I often get connected to individual settlers unlike other games.  Ex:  I'm likely to remember that Marie likes mining and feel bad when I force her to do something she hates just to keep the colony moving.\n\nFourthly, you can play the game windowed (on Win 10), at a low resolution.  Of course, the game is stuck in widescreen, but you should be able to play the game while having a small video screen up and running on a small part of your screen.\n\nSummary:  This is a cute, colorful, but simplistic casual game that involves (pre-planned) city-building with human and resource management.  It's very casual, with no way of death.  It's not hard at all, but it is rewarding.  It can eat away hours for a splt-screener, a grandparent, or someone like me, unemployed.\n\n","December 22, 2015","true","15.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

It's a game for kids, charming and cartoony but extremely slow.  It is rather short, but when I got a ways in, I was stuck between getting tired of it and wanting to finish the game.  There is no replay value at all.  I started over to see if it plays any differently.  The only difference is the settlers coming over on the boat have apparently random likes and dislikes, which calls for a bit of strategy in assigning them to jobs, taking into account that putting them on a job they dislike really destroys their efficiency.  The tasks sometimes have time limits which vary from easy to impossible to complete on time, but there is no real way to fail the tasks.  Research is so slow that choosing the wrong sequence to learn can easily cost an hour.  Tasks include upgrading the ship to carry more cargo, but it gives no real benefit since I eventually figured on selling only the requested goods, since you have to maximize the profit because the game takes forever anyway.  Bought it for less than two bucks, and I'm glad I didn't spend more, even though time was a greater cost.  I did kinda like it, but not enough to recommend.","December 26, 2014","false","16.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You get enough workers keeping up with essentials like food and medicine, and throw everyone else head-first into the next goal.  Even then, I found myself playing games on my phone to pass the time while I waited for things to complete (tasks get annoying paused by periodic pop-ups from your advisors, so you can't just walk away).  There's no "fast forward" mode and no option to spend in-game money on tasks to speed them up.  Now that I've finished it, there's very little replay value.  I would only recommend this if you can pick it up on a dirt-cheap sale.  It reminds me more of a $0.99 mobile game than a $6.99 desktop game.","February 1, 2015","false","13.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was able to get 2 days of gameplay out of it and I feel like that was worth a couple bucks on sale. But the full price of 6.99 might be a little steep for this title. The only reason I put 2 days into this game is because I was hoping it would get better.\n\nMicromanaging your community seems a little tedious, but there are some fun minigames that mix things up a bit.\n- You play a minigame where you fire cannons at stationary pirates on crates and wooden planks (much like the typical slingshot/cannon games: Angry Birds, World of Goo, Crush the Castle...).\n- Adding rooms to a house to increase your population is a little bit of a puzzle as you determine which of the limited room pieces fit together to complete the layout of the house (but barely a minigame).\n\nI wish this game had enemies that attack the town, forcing me to make repairs and add defences. But the only enemies are the stationary pirates in the minigame that you fire cannons at (only accessible by clicking the cannon defence structure at the top of the map). There is no way to take any damage or suffer any consequences by losing the minigames and you have unlimited retry's to complete them.\n\nOne thing that gets old pretty fast is the character noises. Everytime you grab characters to move them around town, they make a childish whimper - sometimes happy, sometimes sad.\n\nI have not completed the first map, but I am pretty sure it is the only map... I would like to see a snow level, water level, an evil level? Even some additional levels as DLC? (<-- can't believe I said that)\n\nEverything in the game is backed by a tutorial, meaning that the entire game is predetermined as it tells you exactly what to do next. I am not sure if it is actually possible to lose.\nThis is where I thought it could get better. Maybe you get a new settlement in a different region where you make descisions yourself without the tutorial? Nope.\n\nThe music is fair and doesn't get too old until about 6-7 hours in. But I would not buy the soundtrack if one existed.\n\nOverall, I would only recommend this game if it were at least 50% off, but only if you want something with a low challenge and you are in the mood for something cute.\nBut for the average gamer, and with so many better choices on Steam, I can't recommend this title at full price.","April 6","false","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is vary similar to the Virtual Villagers games.\n\nThe game is casual, to be sure, in that there is no real challenge or risks. But I got a lot of satisfaction from building up my city, and the game didn't require too much intense gameplay. It was a nice, relaxing game of simple pleasures.
