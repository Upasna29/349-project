There are minor improvements, like faster walking, higher resolution, more skills... but nothing of great importance. Eschalon is a turn-based role-playing game series with astounding graphics and sound. Unfortunately gameplay is a bit slow, even for an ultima-like game. Doing almost anything in this game is fun but one thing: Walking. And there's a lot of walking. Walking through forests, walking through beaches, walking through deserts... and even more walking. The game has interesting dungeons and towns, filled with many secrets and details, unfortunately other locations are there just to be walked through. That is why I would rate this game as decent: It's a very enjoyable RPG, except for tedious walking through wilderness.","May 2, 2014","true","0.2"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","1"

It's like the older Elder Scrolls games, but with Ultima-style graphics and interface. It has a freely explorable world that is viewed in a 3rd person, top-down perspective. Resolution is limited to 1024x768. But I actually dig the graphics and interface. What I dig even more is how *challenging* this RPG is, and how you can build and play your character in very different ways to deal with those challenges. It's not an action RPG, like Diablo; it's more of a thinking man's RPG, like Elder Scrolls. (Eventhough a big part of that challenge can be a pain, dealing with darkness and thirst/hunger and equipment wear/breakage.) Combat is a tactical blend of turn-based and real-time. Keeping your character alive can be hard, especially if you're not paying attention and if you're not putting enough thought into how you build and play your character.","March 29, 2013","true","36.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

As if that delay wasn't enough, he then decided to mock his customers by joking "Better late than never, heh?". Screw this guy.\n\n---------------------\n\nAn intense classic-style RPG that continues the epic saga of Eschalon. Eschalon doesn't make any attempt to hide it's methodical turn based combat, unforgiving level progression mechanics, or epic story arc. If those qualities interest you, you'll have a good chance of enjoying Eschalon. If not, best move along.\n\nBook II introduces some new skills and balance changes to the already deep skill system of its predecessor. I strongly recommend anyone looking to start a game spend some time researching skills, stats, and builds.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed Book II, and while I did wind up putting it down at one point for a break (it is a long game), it's one of the few games I've been able to pick right back up and finish.","May 29, 2013","false","35.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

RPG... check.  Mouse-driven combat... check.  Unforgiving difficulty... check.  Sidequests... check.  Lots of interesting text to read... CHECK!\n\nSo why can't I recommend this?  It's the controls.  There is a simple flaw in this game's design that makes for a really poor experience when I play:\n\nYou have to hold down the mouse button to walk.\n\nThis might not seem like a big deal, but when I'm going to be playing a game for hours, this becomes painful quite quickly.  It isn't a click-fest like Diablo; it's both lots of clicking and LOTS of holding down the mouse button for long periods of time.\n\nOtherwise, Eschalon: Book II is a quite excellently made game.  If I were to recommend an alternative, I would point to the recent Spiderweb Software games, which are probably superior to the Eschalon series anyway.","April 21, 2015","false","3.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","2"
