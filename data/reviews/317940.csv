It's a completely crowdfunded game. They did NOT make full fuding, yet they DID finish working on the game.\n2. It's not a big company with 100 people working on one game. This means that if there are bugs, I don't expect them to be patched out twenty times a week.\n\n\n\nPRO:\n- Artstyle\n- Music\n- Story seems interesting\n- Native controller support\n- Rather unique game in the whole "music based" games\n- No "go here now" kind of hints! Look around, jump. Maybe you CAN make that jump. Maybe you CAN'T make that jump. Maybe you shouldn't even go that way in the first place. Where am I? Am I supposed to be here?\nYou play the game, rather than the game plays you (quicktime events, aarg)\n\nCON:\n- Bugs. It's day one, what do you expect? Even bigger games come out completely bugged nowadays (skyrim or asscreed anyone?)\n- *** PATCHED *** (Subtitles would be nice, as some of the grunting lines were unclear to me, making me feel less involved in what's going on in the game)\n- Pausing during a "cutscene" (characters are singing the story to you), pauses the game but not the audio. Hence, after unpausing, lipsync is off.\n\n\nWho should buy this game:\n- People who like metal music\n- People who like platform puzzle games, like Papo & Yo, Ico, Fez, The Swapper, Giani Sisters, etc.\n- People who visited the karmaflow rock opera in Den Bosch\n- Parents who want their children to play something without shooting, violence, etc.\n\n\nWho should not buy this game:\n- People expecting a finished game\n- People who are looking for a game to put 50+ hours in & replay the same game over & over.\n\n\nRecommended: YES, taking all things said above in consideration.\nIt's a small studio, it's day one, they decided to release without having all the funds, give them some time :)\n\nEDIT 1: Removed a con: subtitles have been added in today's update","January 19, 2015","true","8.5"," 164 of 184 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","164","184","5","5"

The first release of this game was clearly rushed. Music tends to get out of sync when you pause the game, the menus are very bland and when you use the controller in the menus it works as a mouse pointer.\nTo top it off, I had to use "continue" to start the game instead of "New Game" which would take me right back to the menu. This is made even stranger when I finished the first part of Act 1, because after a long loading time I was put back into the main menu and had to choose "Continue".\nCollision detection in the game is a bit shabby now and then as well. As a last minor point it would've been nice if the game had subtitles for the vocals, eventhough they are pretty clear. So far none of it has been gamebreaking though.\n\nSo much for the bad stuff, onwards to the good stuff!\nThe game looks great! The art design is beautiful and the choice of colours is perfect, giving the areas either a very 'warm' or 'cold' look. The music is pretty awesome as well, but since there is a lot of metal it has to be your kind of thing to enjoy. Especially when you've got some growling vocals.\nEvery once in a while you'll have a scene where people sing, making it feel like you're playing a Disney movie. And it is great.\nThe gameplay is pretty simple and intuitive. You get a few pointers on what to do and then you'll figure out most of it yourself. So far the puzzles haven't been too hard, but then again I don't play it for the challenge, I play it for the great music and superb visuals.\n\nBottomline; the game needs some more polishing up, but since none of it was gamebreaking I really enjoyed playing through the interesting world. It looks great and it sounds great and movement is pretty fun.","January 19, 2015","true","2.9"," 67 of 82 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","67","82","4","13"

It's had a bit of a bumpy launch, but team Karmaflow rallied together and patched most of the issues by the end of Day 1. Very rarely have I seen a team work that fast at fixing bugs. This is even more impressive when you consider this is a new studio who crowdfunded the game on Indiegogo (they didn't reach their full goal) and are new to the game development world.\n\nSeeing all the complaints of bugs on Steam, I waited until the first wave of patches before playing the game. I am happy to report that I ran into ZERO game breaking bugs and I really enjoyed my time with the game (played with a controller). NOTE: There are still some minor bugs being worked on, but what game doesn't have those?\n\nThis game is all about the music. If you don't like symphonic metal then you're probably not going to like the game, but what did you expect out of a game calling itself a Rock Opera? If you do like the genre, then you are in for a real treat. The orchestral performances of some of Metal's most recognized icons (seriously, look at the cast for this game) was spot-on and combined with the game's unique visual style, created a deep atmosphere that really drew me in.\n\nWithout going into too many details, the story follows the Karma Keeper as it travels from world to world restoring balance after the mysterious "Dissonance" has wreaked havoc. It is presented, as you would expect, in rock opera fashion by having the characters sing/scream their parts to tell their tales. There are shards scattered around the worlds that present Karmaflow's backstory, and really solidify the atmosphere of the game. The addition of subtitles (see! They were listening to the community and added this in the first string of patches!) really helped me keep track of Karmaflow's story.\n\nWhile the designers are new, they did a fantastic job of using subtle visual cues to keep players on the right path. There are no direct hints to solving the puzzles, meaning if you get stuck, you will have to look around the environment and experiment with different approaches to find your way out. I love this approach because it keeps you in the game instead of constantly waiting for a hint.\n\nThe ambient sounds in the game could be better. Like when a boulder hits the ground, it would be nice to hear a solid crash instead of an odd crunching sound. I wasn't too fond of the thudding sound the Karma Keeper made when it landed after jumping, but that's just personal preference. There lots of little instances like these where I wished the ambient sounds were a bit better, but hey, this was a crowdfunded game from Indiegogo with a killer soundtrack and vocal cast, I'm not complaining too much.\n\nLastly, while I really enjoyed the puzzles within the game, there were no consequences for failing or dying. If the Karma Keeper dies in the game, you respawn close by and continue where you left off. There's no reset or anything. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does remove any sense of urgency or fear from the boss "fights"/"puzzles" (I'm honestly not sure what to call them). But again, this game is all about delivering a killer Rock Opera experience, and it does that with gusto.\n\nOverall, I would give Karmaflow a 4 out of 5 as I sit and wait for Act 2 to be released later this year!\n\nPros:\n- Soundtrack\n- Music\n- Epic musical solos (noticing a trend)\n- Solid puzzle mechanics\n- Atmosphere\n- Solid Rock Opera style story and presentation\n- Game includes soundtrack (To be released with Act 2 later this year)\n\nCons:\n- Ambient sounds could be improved\n- No consequences for failing\n- Act 1 is very short (roughly 3 - 3.5 hours)","January 21, 2015","true","5.2"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

It's not possible to watch them twice without replaying the game. And since the levels are large and mostly uneventful and these scenes are few and far between it's simply annoying the way it is.\n\nAlso there is no sense of progression or any kind of reward for the player except for the finale of each stage. You really only keep playing to reach the music (at least I did). There are some nice touches in art design though. Some nice views are to be found, but just as much bland stuff that could have been drastically shortened to improve the overall experience. Added length is not always better if it feels like a drag. A game like Journey for reference, which was obviously an inspiration for this game but A LOT more fun to play, was very short but infinitely replayable due to it's pacing. Pacing is important in games like these, and the developers didn't get it right here.\n\nEspecially world 2 seems to drag on forever. It surprises you with 4(!!) long, mandatory escort missions after the point where I was already tired of the map. Escort missions have always been more misses than hits, even in other, better games. It's beyond my comprehension how this was considered to be a good idea at the time of planning.\nBut also chapters 3 and 4 are way too long for their own good, with more of the same stuff you'll become tired of halfway through world 2. Sure, they sometimes try to mix things up with a rail-sufring minigame similar to the modern Sonic games, but without the pace and sense of speed. You will want these stages to end long before they do, the journey is not the destination in this game.\n\nActually if the whole game was paced like the really great final stage, this would have been a hit.\nFinally gameplay and music go hand in hand almost right from the start in nicely mixed up sections which are actually fun when presented in this way. You'd wish the whole game was presented like this. Sure, it would have been a much shorter game, but way more entertaining in the long run. I'd rather play a 1-2 hour game filled with stuff like this, and always come back to it like to a good CD/movie, than traversing through these empty and out of scope landscapes that stand between me and the good parts. Especially not for a second time. It's unfortunate really, because it's an indication of where the real talent of this new developer lies.\n\nAlso for a game that heavily relies on sound and music, the environmental sound effects are somewhat underwhelming. Sometimes there are no sound effects at all. You miss the oomph when being hit by something. It doesn't happen often, but it bothered me anyway.\n\nYet, while the gamplay is not a winner even when working as intended, the game is still ridden with bugs and other issues. The sound might disappear randomly, it's possible to fall through some walls (Act 2), the camera is unfavorable in many situations (to put it mildly), jumping button may not register input now and then. A lot more can be added, but you get my point.\n\nSo, taking the actual game aside, let's get to the good part.\nAs mentioned before, the musical score is outstanding and a joy to listen to.\nEach chapter ends with a bang, a big scripted musical number, which gives you choices inbetween for how you want each scene to play out. There is no real consequence other than a different variation in the song, but it's nicely done anyway. Like I said, the game would have been so good if this was the main focus. Had the stages been cut in half and the musical scenes been doubled, this would be a metal fans dream come true.\n\nThe soundtrack is also included, and although some of my favorite parts from the choices I made are not there (apparently it must be the other choice), it's well worth a listen for fans of epic metal.\n\nLet me sum up my thoughts with simple pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n- Art design\n- All that has to do with music\n- Scripded cutscenes with choices inbetween\n\nCons:\n\n- Stages overstay their welcome by far (especially 2!!)\n- Not much to do, to collect, to actually play except jumping around and extracting/infusing karma\n- Boss "battles"\n- Musical cutscenes few and far between\n- Bugs, glitches, general lack of polish\n- WAY too long/artificially lengthened, badly paced\n\nSuggested improvements:\n\n- Either drastically shortened stages...\n- ...or maps filled with more to do, to collect, to discover, to reward players\n- More musical cutscenes with choices throughout the game\n- MANUAL SAVE OPTION! Let players use the Checkpoints as manual save spots at least!\n- Chapter select option, or separate autosave before each stage finale.\n- Movie mode with all musical scenes\n- More sound effects for environment\n\nI really would like to recommend this game to anyone who likes Metal, or simply a good, innovative game, but as it is, I can't do that whithout fooling anyone. I really appreciate what the developer tried to do, even with non sufficient funding at their disposal, but since this is 95% game and only 5% (or less) great stuff, and gameplay is what matters for most people, this game is only recommendable for the most patient and forgiving gamers out there.\nAnyone else is better off with one of the many other great games that are available these days.\nMaybe in the future after some seriously needed updates to enhance the flow of the game (*badum tss*) I'll reconsider, but for now I'll have to keep the thumbs down.","May 7, 2015","false","11.1"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","2"

All you will read below has been gathered from the Karmaflow website, Facebook, Twitter, contact with the developer, bugtesting sessions and the game itself.\n\nI am quite puzzled to see some people denounce this game in the way they do. Let's be real here: Basecamp Games is a studio that started out as a student graduation project, they are new to all this. Anyone expecting a fledgling studio selling a 15 euro game to deliver a flawless experience should get their heads out of their pretentious asses.\n\nHad the game cost 4 times the amount, or if the developer created a plethora of games before this, then I might have reconsidered as well. It surprises me how dedicated Basecamp is as a studio, as they have patched some major problems out already and are (probably) doing so as we speak.\n\nNow then, onto the game. What is Karmaflow?\n\nIn short, Karmaflow is a 3d platformer that let's you play as the Karmakeeper, a little guy who travels across the lands to try and fix an imbalance that is tearing these lands apart. There's more to it but I don't want to spoil anything for you.  Much of the narrative is brought to you in song and acted out in cutscenes. The gameplay itself is fairly straightforward, and should not be too challenging for too many.\n\nThis game stands on it's graphical style and stellar music. It's not hard to find a list of all the talented musicians that helped to compose this beautiful soundtrack, and it can be seen that the creative director is in fact a composer. During the game itself, you can find instruments that will add their sounds to the ambiant music, enahncing your experience.\n\nNow, I do have some smallgripes with this game. The camera can be a bit weird at times, which is detrimental to your jumping & gliding abilities. The camera moves when it wishes to show you something, but it can really mess up your jumps or your sense of direction. I did not yet encounter a problem with checkpoints, but I see others have. Karmaflow runs fine on my average PC, but it stutters for a slight second every time you reach a checkpoint (as a statue of you is suddenly spawned from various shards) this game also does not tell you where to go at every point, so make sure to get your bearings when you can. I tend to get lost at times, poor me.\n\nIf you see other reviews stating there are no subtitles and the music goes out of sync if you pause during cutscenes, that has all been taken care of. Basecamp is a developer that evidently listens and strives to give you the best.\n\nThe game is rather short at this time of writing, but anyone who purchases Act 1 will receive Act 2 later free of charge as an update to the game.\n\nBottom line:\n\nBuy This --> If you like games that are more about the experience and easthetic than actual gameplay, and you like the style (both music and on-screen)\n\nDon't buy this --> If you only want gameplay, or a game that just tells you what to do at every turn, and you get easily annoyed if some things work less than perfect sometimes. If you have a MAC, wait until you are sure it works (watch the updates)\n\nI am enjoying this experience very much, I hope you will too!","January 21, 2015","true","0.5"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","25","33","0","0"

A lot of effort has been put in crafting the soundtrack, and to make sure that the singers' voices match the characters portrayed. It is amazing how they've got so many talented and well know artists on board with such a small budget. The soundtrack works really well. Also the graphics of Karmaflow are really nice for an indie game. The game runs really smooth on the highest settings on my PC. The game is not particulary difficult and seems to be targeted at the casual gamer. I have been enjoying Karmaflow a lot though. There have been some problems short after the release, but most bugs and optimization issues have been ironed out by the patches. Sometimes the periods between interesting points in the game take a bit too long, but I really like how the entire story comes together in the 5th and last world.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who likes a casual platformer game and enjoys symphonic metal. I am not even into metal myself, but can really relate to the soundtrack due to the story that unfolds.","September 8, 2015","true","29.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The decisions are "hard" to make, if you actually try to relate to the\ncharacters and think about what happened to them so far.

No more gamebreaking bugs, scenes can't be aborted anymore, autosave and loading don't create stuttering anymore, sounds are played correctly and achievements finally work.\n\nI already recommended the game before, but I have to recommend it again, now that most flaws are gone! If you are unsure though, wait for it to be either bundled again (was already bundled once) or be on sale. The price will sure drop for quite a little.\n\nDay 1 review:\nWell as one of the very first funders of this small project I sort of watched the developers through their journey developing this game.\nFirst thing - the project leader on this game is a music composer. He gathered a sort of young team around him to produce this game, with a budget that was smaller than intended since they didn't reach their goal with their campaign.\nSince the project leader is clearly a professional in music expect that the most stunning part will be the soundtrack. Also consider watching the pretty big list of artist featured in the soundtrack - which is a major selling point of this game.\n\nNow back to the game:\n\nPro:\n+Great design\n+Beautiful world\n+Sort of a different approach in the jump and run genre\n+Choices in cutscenes (not sure yet how they affect the story or music)\n+Incredibly good soundtrack (given you like rock and metal mixed with orchestra)\n+It's like a playable musical\n+controller support\n\nCons:\n-Day 1 bugs including(which will be most likely fixed soon):\nlaggy menu\nshort freezes when reaching a checkpoint\ncutscene music keeps playing on pause which makes cutscenes out of sync\ncouldn't start second level due to a bug where i kept dying at the respawn point (doesnt affect everyone)\nsoundeffect controls didn't seem to work (soundeffects where a bit harsh and loud compared to the music)\nproblems with collission detection (sometimes can walk through objects, sometimes must jump over a small edge on the ground)\n\n-Menu could use a slight redesign since it's quite plain looking compared to the rest of the game.\n\nWell and that's it for me with the cons. Be really prepared that the soundtrack will in fact be the major selling point and the best thing about this game.\nBUT: I think this game might become really good once the day 1 bugs (which make most cons) are corrected.","January 20, 2015","true","8.3"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

While the gameplay itself is simple, the artwork, music and it's story are worth checking out alone. A lot of love was put into this game, and a lot of great artists participated in this too, mostly Metal musicians. I particularly liked the way story was told, just using music. Music is the main focus in the game (obviously), and it's executed very well, with tons of great Symphonic Metal tunes, although it may feel like the lyrics could be better at times, but the main composer was Dutch so I can see the difficulty in composing in another language.\n\nMy interest went up the hill after hearing about the cast, I didn't care how the game looked like, I just wanted to dive into it and see how well it was performed. Every close friend of mine also knows that I go crazy over anything with Alissa White-Gluz. The music alone is a good enough reason to play this game. If you like bands like Delain, Nightwish, Amaranthe, MaYaN, Epica, Tarja, After Forever or Therion, you'll love the music in this game. At the end of each chapter, there's even a duel between 2 singers and the great Metropole Orkest playing, it just feels like an Epic tale overall.\n\nAs for you, the main character, you're a Karmakeeper and your backstory is unknown. You don't know where you come from, what you're doing in these Worlds and why. These are questions to find out throughout the game. Now in these worlds, there's always a sub-story involving 2 opposing characters (hence the duet I mentioned before), upon reaching the end of the World, you choose who to help. These decisions carry on until the last minute of the game and believe me, some are really not an easy choice to make.\n\nPerformance wise, it still needs a lot of work. I gave up on playing this on my computer, and just asked my brother for his. Apparently a much better rig than mine only gives about +3FPS. Hopefully Basecamp Games are working on this and can sort it out, but this did not ruin my experience. Bugwise, they're minor, but in a lot of places. As I've heard, the game is way better than it was on release date. I've only found like 1 game-breaking bug in my 20 hours of playing. I'd say that's a very good ratio, plus you should always keep in mind that this crowdfunded project did not reach the goal, and they did finish it anyway.\n\nAs a brief conclusion, Karmaflow is the game you're looking for if you like both chill-out games and Metal music. It may be asking for a bit much, but I'd gladly pay 10 euros for it, I just wish the Deluxe Edition upgrade wasn't so expensive. Karmaflow gets an 8/10 from me, and if the bugs and performance issues do get sorted out, this game will become a really good underground gem that many will not play or even know about.","May 31, 2015","true","22.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

The visual concept is also very creative, but of course a matter of taste too. The problem is the annoying gameplay inbetween...\n\nI have nothing against plattformers and puzzle games, but this one is just too simple and boring. Even in the third level I did not have to think one time about a "puzzle". Actually you can hardly call them puzzles at all, simply because you never have to plan some steps ahead, which is basicly only a local-search, the devs should have known that >.<.\n\nEven if they get harder and the plattformer part gets more interesting later, i lost most of my motivation after the first three levels. So i just started hearing the soundtack instead.\n\nHowever, if you like the idea of such art projects i recommend supporting it. I want to see more creative indie games with a focus on music in the future.","May 6, 2015","true","5.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

You play as a KarmaKeeper (a Keeper),a silent construct who decides the fate of worlds (METAL worlds!) by infusing or extracting Karma.  All worlds are threatened by the force of The Disonance and you can either fight against it, or help the Disonence overtake the worlds.  There's a morality system that results in DIFFERENT SONGS!  It will blow your effing mind.\n\nHOWEVER at the start of the game, you're unfortunatley dropped into its WEAKEST level, design-wise.  It's gross, purple and foggy, which can be frustrating as all hell to players who need direction as to where to go. Thankfully the first level is super short by comparison of the other levels (an hour or two at most).  So just power through it and hope you don't get stuck on many glitches, which the devs have been VERY good at patching over the game's release.  You'll know  you paid money well spent however, once you get to the song duet between the Conductor and Muse and then proceed to soil your pants at how amazing it is.  Then you'll go onto the next level which is 10x better in design (and it's significantly more colorful).  And level 3 is 10x better than level 2 (and FULL of colors and textures and design).\n\nMechanics-wise, if you still haven't downloaded the game by now, it's a puzzle-platformer with glide mechanics, infuse-extract mechanics, a double jump and...well that's it.  It's VERY simple gameplay-wise but there are clever puzzles that can be created with these simple mechanics and unique atmospheres from world to world.  Think of it like Journey meets Banjo Kazooee without the collectathon elements, except for the Lore bits scattered about the different worlds, but that's more like Journey anyways.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a very well designed (though it has its glitches), pretty (once you get past world 1) game that IS A ROCK OPERA THAT YOU PLAY!  So just power through that super weak opening two hours and get ready to LET THE KARMA FLOW.","May 14, 2015","true","9.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

However, "Rock Opera" means what would normally be voice acting is sung. There is far too much lull in between to string it together as an opera.\n\nThe atmosphere and the surrealism is fantastic, and obviously required a lot of imagination. However, it's perhaps *too* surreal...The story and bizarre characters aren't explained worth a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEvidently "Dissonance" is probably a character or the overall evil, but if I had to hear it one mor time in the first 5 minutes, I'm sure I would hurt somebody.\n\nThe reason this review is negative is because there are just too many problems with this game, no matter how great the idea. Don't believe me? Read the announcements about all the bug fixes and what they are. Including recommendations such as deleting your save and starting over. Then consider even with these fixes, there are still too many problems to enjoy the game.\n\nThe game didn't crash, I'll give it that. But the controls are clunky, and it becomes a problem when the level design requires precison. The mechanics overall just plain suck. There is a lot of clipping, camera fighting (mostly when there's wind), and the there are clear design flaws. At one point I couldn't proceed because the game was clearly intending for you to do one thing, but you are unable to do it if you have to much "karma" (powerup) which you can't get rid of.\n\n*Sadly*, I was actually able to pass this area by going UNDER  that portion of the level. Yes, you heard me right. I went across an area that was clearly never intended ito be traversed in order to pass an impassable spot. Used a bug to workaround a bug. Nice.\n\nAt one point, I fell (it's to the death, like many games)...I fell for almost a MINUTE before I actually died.\n\nBut the final straw was the complete lack of direction. I got to a "boss fight" and it was pretty clear what to do...there were dangling thing to hit. BUT, you can't hit them. You just can't. I spent half an hour trying eveything I could think of, and finally turned it off.\n\nI wanted to like it, I really did. I don't call it quits easily, but this game left me no choice.\n\nI give it a 5/10 just because the art and surrealism and idea are great. If the GLARING problems were fixed I'd be happy with this game and give it a solid 8/10.\n\nThat said, in hindsight, I wouldn't pay $5 for this game (75% off), because it still wouldn't be fair...bcause you won't even get to play through more than 25% of the game.\n\nGo ahead, buy it anyway. When you get stuck double jumping for half an hour trying to hit dangling purple tentacles, and you're ready to break your controller, come back here and admit I told you so.","February 26, 2015","false","2.6"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","27","40","4","2"

I finished the two worlds of Act I in about 4 hours and I play quite slow and just looking around a lot. So if Act 2 brings another 4 hours of gameplay it's totally worth it's money in my opinion. Besides that I totally advise everyone to play this game with a controller.\n\nEven though there are still some bugs here and there and some performance issues I really enjoyed it.

If the bad controls and tiresome level design wouldn’t prevent us from listening to the music, it could have been a cult classic.\n\nLong version:I may be a victim of preconceptions, but when I started something called ‘Karmaflow: The Rock Opera Video Game’, I expected a few things but not a linear puzzle platformer where the titular rock opera parts make up barely 45 minutes of the 3-9 hour play time.\n\nSaid opera is divided into five acts, set in four different worlds, where the player controls the only silent character in this musical adventure, a Keeper. This Keeper’s task is to witness how each world is slowly getting destroyed by an almost parasitic infestation of dissonance that disrupts the harmony – the flow of the sustaining karma. Each journey has to end though, which in our case means the Keeper is eventually presented with a choice: help the driving force of the dissonance and let the world reach the end of its life cycle, or help the valiant defenders to sustain their homes a little more. These choices are not as simple as it seems though, as we will learn it in the final stage…\n\nAll of this would be great if the musical wouldn’t be interrupted with gameplay… really awkward gameplay. There is always something to ruin the experience, be it either the all-consuming and performance-killing ugly purple haze of World I, the four consecutive escort missions of World II, the introduction of musical memorisation minigames in World III (which is probably still the best of them with its astonishing visual design and energetic songs), the monochrome blocky emptiness of World IV, or the impossible jumps in World V. Still, if you are patient and persistent enough, the music, especially the climactic duet/duels at the end of the stages can make up for the abysmal gameplay.","February 23","true","14.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

There are occasional bugs - missing sounds, sounds cutting out, collision errors etc.\n\nA lot of people are giving this game a recommendation, and in their review pointing out how well the team did given that they did not make their initial crowdfunding goal, yet made the game anyway. I think the team did well regardless of that. This game is everything I hoped it would be and more!\n\nIt is a puzzle-platformer game, the mechanics of which hark back to classic platformers I played in my childhood.* That's not to say it's dated - it feels very modern and the controls are tight, and I like the progression elements whereby the Karmakeeper (player) gains more abilities as they progress. The challenges this game presents are rather tricky in places, too - this game is no cakewalk!\n\n* In particular, I felt the karmasurfing sequence with the Bird Goddess trying to knock back the Keeper reminded me of the second boss level in Crash Bandicoot: Wrath of Cortex!\n\nAlso the ending sequence is probably one of the best climaxes I've ever seen in a game.\n\nBut we haven't even gotten onto why I love this game so much! However I can easily see this being why perhaps you won't. It's quite a niche thing, really. I just  love  the way this game tells the story through the medium of operatic rock - possibly one of my favourite subgenres of music. I cannot stress how f*cking awesome this is. You'll just finish a platformer section, and then it enters a cutscene, and you're greeted by shredding guitars and the voice of Marc Hudson from Dragonforce (or any other members of the star-studded vocal cast), the likes of which is laden with arterial orchestra music playing, and then complemented beautifully by operatic vocals. A good musical comparisson is that of heavy metal group Nightwish. There isn't enough operatic metal in the world.\n\nI have just finished this game and I cannot wait to play through it again - to make different decisions and see what else this game has in store!\n\n\nCritically I'd guess this game gets about 7/10.\nThematically and based on my personal experience with it, it get's a full 10/10.","September 4, 2015","true","17.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

If you manage to get passed all that and get to the end of every act, you are rewarded tenfold for your persistence. Because there is where the music starts for real!\nBy the time I got to the finale, I was tired and didn't want to play anymore. But when I finished, I was more pumped then an Olympic Athlete on shrooms outrunning Sonic.\n\nThe music is fantastic (Even more so if you like Metal) and is sung by some really famous singers, Tony Kakko being a personal favorite. The story is interesting because every Act ends with a dilemma that you as the Karmakeeper has to solve (Choose really). The choices you have to make a rarely black and white but rather makes you choose what YOU think is most viable when all the choices might sound questionable. It's a really nice change from the clichéd "Good vs.. Bad" trope that plagues modern games today. Because of this it makes the characters in question more interesting and the overall story more compelling.\n\nKarmaflow in a nutshell might be, It's dull as ♥♥♥♥, but if you push through that dullness, you'll never regret it.","March 8","true","7.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I had chills on my back at every song. The story is full of awesome stuff which you can figure out by the lyrics sung. Although the songs feature grunting and screaming, because of the awesome characters that use it I believe that most people would still like it.

Game breaking glitches, audio desynchronization, video corruption, horrendous performance, and persistent crashes (once shutting my PC down entirely) caused the game to be unplayable for months after release.\n\nEven now, it’s hard to say the game is in a playable state. Even though I was able to complete the first act I ran into numerous errors which ranged from absent audio to breaking certain mechanics. Having spent a generous amount of time on the Steam forums it would appear my issues are by no means unique (outside of being one of Karmaflow’s many unique flavors of glitch), and each new patch only seems to open new holes needing to be filled in.\n\nWith all that being said it almost seems pointless to even discuss what the game underneath the bugs is like, given it’s impossible for me to recommend something so crippled by malfunctioning programming. But maybe that’s in part because I don’t want to accept that Karmaflow isn’t worth the trouble it’s given me. That it’s an ambitious but incapable experience, that even when working as intended fails to capture the brilliance of its concept as an interactive rock opera.\n\nIt at once tries to do too much while expanding on little, being mechanically shallow and unpolished even as it continues to add on new ideas throughout the game. The act of infusing and draining karma (basically the life source of Karmaflow’s world) at first appears a key feature, but in practice is used sparingly and with no room for user expirementation. The rest of the time you’re pushed through tedious platforming sections, playing as a character with poor control over their body movement in an environment they’re constantly slipping off of. Karmaflow is also likely owner of the worst camera of any game I’ve played in the last decade, commonly drifting off into random directions to focus on anything but your character and clipping on invisible walls that erupt from every corner.\n\nKarmaflow seems obsessed with making sure you never do anything it hasn’t expressly planned for you to do. It wants to be in control so its levels are designed like small cages, letting you roam around in so far as you never try to stray out of the immediate area. Sure, you can look all you want at the world off in the distance, but should you try to actually visit it a metaphorical and sometimes physical hand will descend from the heavens to pick you up and put you back where you belong. As an advocate for focused game design, Karmaflow was agonizingly restrictive and made me long for even a small amount of freedom to escape it’s uninspired linearity.\n\nFinally, and most saddening, Karmaflow’s soundtrack is so bad as to be almost painful. Though tastes may vary, there was something intensely unpleasant to me about every single track Karmaflow managed to play properly (which to be fair was likely only half, the rest having self destructed in a glitchy fit). The compositions are bizarre in ways that feel uncertain about themselves, as if the composer is holding back for fear of becoming to esoteric but ending up sounding exceptionally dull in the process. Lyrics feel forced and equally strange, never deciding between attempting to flow melodically, or forego any musical sensibility for the sake of telling an uninteresting narrative that I found impossible to follow.\n\nAt this point I don’t think there’s any hope in saving Karmaflow’s first act. I feel safe in saying it’s become a self-perpetuating train wreck that is beyond the ability of the developer to rectify. I can only pray that the second act will manage to not fall prey to the same disastrous problems, but I’d be lying if I said I’m actually confident it’s not going to.\n\nFull disclosure: Karmaflow was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

But as a first game from an indie dev I don't really see a problem with that. The problems aren't huge and as long as these problems are being fixed in a timely manner, the end result will be a very enjoyable game for gamers and symphonic metal fans alike.\n\nThis first act should be finishable in about 3 hours. Add an act 2 of the same size to that and I think you'll be getting your moneys worth in the end. The puzzles and platforming are pretty well done, albeit not all that hard most of the time. But the musical storytelling and atmosphere make up for that in my opinion. This game is an excercise in something new and fresh in the way the story is told and and the way the gameplay is represented in its setting. The gameplay occasionally reminded me of games like Darksiders or Zelda, albeit simpler, but which is still a good thing!\n\nYes, the controls are a bit clunky sometimes, the menus look pretty bland and are weird to navigate with a controller, the performance drops sometimes in certain scenes, but none of these things have been gamebreaking to me. Also I presume these problems will be patched out ASAP. There are some genuine lovable moments in this game and I'm very curious to see where Act 2 is going to take the game in April.\n\nThe devs have been active in support, which is a good thing too!\n\n\nAll in all I'd recommend this game to anyone who is in for an original adventure with a nice story and great music!","January 22, 2015","true","2.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

A rock opera videogame? Take my money! Unfortunately while it started off pretty strong, past the first storyline it falls flat on its face and can't get up again. The linearity of the first section gives way to wider choice in objectives (the point where you have to gather in three other tribesthings to do a ceremony) and this combined with confusing environment design (in the form of large sections of terrain you have to move about) led me to hit a wall and lose interest. I got to that point in a lot of puzzle games where you're just randomly poking things to see if anything will do what you need it to, and I really feel like that's death for this game concept. If things aren't clicking along, or you don't have an obvious objective immediately available, it just loses all its energy. And it is supposed to be a ROCK OPERA. Energy and pacing should be the WHOLE POINT.\n\nPros:\n* I really liked the Conductor and Muse story (the first one). Both the framing of the story, and the level design, seemed to come together to keep things ticking over. If only the whole game could have been like this.\n* I can't overstate how much I liked the first story. But twice will do for review purposes.\n* The design of the Karmakeeper is pretty neat. If your character is going to be a mute cypher, then why not go all the way and make them some kind of magical totem thing. The mechanics of how the Karmakeeper's powers worked were all easily understandable and fun to use.\n\nCons:\n* There as a lot of "oh no, my worst enemy... stairs" problems where the character just seemed to get hung up on terrain with no visible reason why. This happened a lot on the Village level near the end of Conductor&Muse. I assume this will eventually get polished up.\n* Orchestra vs Death Metal Screaming Guy? Really? That's not where I figured the music was going to go with this.\n* The aforementioned problems with level design/pacing in the second story.\n* Didn't credit achievement progress for whatever reason.\n\ntl;dr: Great as part of a bundle, worth playing at bundle pricing just for the first segment alone, sadly not worth Tier A game pricing.","February 26, 2015","false","3.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

It honestly is. This game is simple in exeecution, but amazing in implementation. I have only minor gripes in the time spent so far.\n\nYou, as the keeper. Are the decider on a tale. As best I can describe it, you have a choice to make in the world. Is it right, is it wrong? Funny enough, I can't say. Each of my choices so far has been tough. This game manages to make neither the best, neither the worst. And it has no issues gutpunching you to make them. This strives to be a rock opera, so far, i fully believe it has.\n\nI'll admit, this game isnt for everyone. It won't be. It is a music lovers dream though. Watch the video's, see if the voices and people are those who you like. If so, give it a go. I truly think you wont be disappointed. I haven't been yet.\n\nMechanically, and sadly I do have to touch base on this. Mechanically, the game has a few minor flaws. Most issues are minor, but can be an issue. At a few places, i managed to get stuck, not out of design, but my own cleverness. One of the resources you make do with, its possible to get too much of in places, and have to do some re-negotiation to divest yourself of it. It can be tricky to do so. A few minor issues getting stuck in places, but minor gripes to that. Those are the only complaints mechanically on this game.\n\nI do however recomend a controller to play this game over keyboard. It flows so much better.\n\nTo praise some of the mechanics. This game gets the jumps right that so many bigger games fail on. The controls are fluid, easy to get into, and flow without any issue.","November 28, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There's issues with the controls not being responsive enough for a platformer, the environments are a little confusing to navigate in this first episode. There's no major faults with the game outside of it not having incredible gameplay design and execution. But then I don't entirely expect it either. It's very difficult to get that in a 3D game from an indie studio.\n\nAs for the music side of things - I wasn't blown away, but thought it was a very fun way to conduct the game narrative. Subtitles are something sorely missing, however - And with growled vocals some players would have difficulty understanding the plot - And this is assuming they can hear the vocals clearly through the sound levels.\n\nI'm yet to see music form an integral part of the gameplay itself, which is something I was really hoping for. While it's still possible that the game could get better in the future, the gameplay and musical elements are two very disparate parts.\n\nIn all - I want to recommend this game sorely for the lovely idea, the pretty settings, and for it being interesting. As I say, I can't recommend you play it as a game - It's more a curiosity. Check out some videos before you make a purchase, 'cause it's surely not for everyone.","January 19, 2015","true","1.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Story wise I haven't a clue what’s going on (bar the intro and visual queues), I'm Irish and despite what it says on Wikipedia, our first language is English and there were some words/sections of the Story/Singing that I found entirely inaudible, I thought at one stage in the finale the conductor said "swimming pool".\nThis is in part to the backing track being far too loud and drowning out the lyrics and partially due to the singers clearly not being native English speakers and singing in English (at least for their sakes I hope this is correct, otherwise seriously quit your day job), a prime example being when you first encounter the conductor he twice says the word "Faith" when he meant "Fate" and clearly annunciates it as "Faith"\n\nVisually it’s actually quite nice, I almost wish it was far bigger so I could float around and enjoy myself similar to Journey, which the graphics remind me of also but not overly, it definitely has its own style. Again it’s so pretty I wish there was more to interact with and consume at a slower pace to get to know the world and characters.","January 19, 2015","false","1.6"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","22","41","2","0"

Hopefully in later patches the game wil run more smoothly :).\n\nLikes, wel since I'm happy with my choice to support the indiego of this game it goes to say i like alot of thing. in this section i will list some of the more important parts.\n1)Music, as this is a "rock-opera videogame" it goes to say the music part of it is very important. and I can honestly say they did an amazing job on it. the songs with lyrics are great and the ambient music is soothing.\n2)Visual, the game looks realy nice for an indie game, the graphics are obviously inspired on "Journey" but they look unique enough to be fresh. also the worlds to this point are diverse making for a nice change of pace.\n3)Gameplay, the puzzles in the game are simple but fairly enjoyable. and the platforming works well. only thing i could hope for is that later worlds wil have a tad more chalenging puzzles but overall they are fun to complete.","January 25, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The developers did an alright job of it, but it's far from extraordinary.\n\nThe game suffers from some platforming issues. bad camera, and not really knowing where and what to do on the first time through. Even thou puzzles were musically minded, my involvement was shallow, The platforming is lacking in epic operatic awesomeness.\n\nBosses on the other hand are awesomesauce. Their only problem is that they are story driven A or B choice candy sequences.\n\nIf instead, my actions in the platforming lead up to what operatic choices I had available or vice versa, it would be a great start in blending the two.

Unfortunately it was riddled with bugs upon release and did not live up to what I expected of a "Rock Opera" video game.\n\nThankfully the development team has been good at fixing reported issues quickly, so they get some points there.\n\nBut unfortunately the game itself is just not that good. Judjing from the way it's marketed, you would expect music to play a big part in the game, but little attempt has been made to merge the gameplay side of things with the music side.\n\nI shouldn't have to play the first level of a rock opera game in silence!\n\nBut the entire game is like that. Gameplay is accompanied by ambient noise/music and you will only hear actual songs during cutscenes and boss battles. And these are generally too short and broken up by gameplay to be enjoyable as a whole.\n\nThe concept of a Rock Opera in video game format is intriguing, but I really can't say that's what this is. The music itself is fine and and the visuals are very enjoyable to look at, but at its heart this is a mediocre platformer with glimpses here and there into what could have been if the developers had attempted to merge the gameplay with music in a more innovative way.","January 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

No thought was given to platforming and puzzle mechanics. Both are terribly easy. If you can press the jump button and point the character in the general direction of a platform they will make it. Puzzles are stupid easy and require almost zero thought to solve. With the puzzles and platforming lacking the game becomes a walking simulator to get to the next cutscene.\n\nThe story is terrible and no effort is put into explaining exactly what is going on. Your own character isn't fleshed out in the slightest. Other characters know you are but refuse to tell you exactly who you are. The game offers moral choices at the end of the worlds but your decision has no noticeable impact, and the game refuses to tell you exactly why you are making these decisions or why you should be invested in the outcome of the decisions in the first place.\n\nThere are some really good ideas presented in this game, but the execution is terrible.

Essentially you can turn things around you on and off. You use those powers alongside a few other skills such as double jumps and dashes to solve puzzles and do some platforming.\nAs you progress through the game the game the plot is sung to you in jaw-dropping rock opera songs, which is the strong and main point of the game.\n\nUnfortunately the platforming isn't that good and the puzzles are quite simple most of the time. A few areas of the game can be summed up into spending 30 minutes of your time jumping around trying to find and infuse the keys you need to unlock a door. In other words, the gameplay simply isn't fun.\nThe game also has a few bugs such as achievements not unlocking or the main character sliding through the floor, but nothing game breaking.\n\nThe game had a lot of potential. But all the good graphics and songs couldn't make up for the poor gameplay.","August 2, 2015","false","1.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Once I started, I was struck by the simplicity of the gameplay itself: you jump and dash and drain things from one set of objects to infuse into another. As the areas get larger and larger, it's less about any sort of challenging platforming or evasion and more about finding the precise objects that will allow you to proceed. If you like wandering around on the offchance that you'll hear the occasional scrap of music, go for it.

Think "3D platformer" and groan. These kinds of games take a lot of careful design to get right, and in this case it was more than the team could chew. Controls are very clunky. Through much of the game it doesn't matter, because it's very simple exploration: quite boring, actually. But suddenly the pacing changes dramatically later in the game. The swamp level is pure torture! Ugh. That whole concept really needs to be rethought. If you want the player to be jumping around in 3D, you better make that it's easy to land on stuff. I wanted to throw my whole computer out the window a few times. It's just my own stubbornness that forced me to play through to the very abrupt ending.\n\nThe game features a few moments of ethical decisions. Nice, except they seem to have no consequence at all.\n\nThe world is gorgeous, like it came right out of a Yes album cover. The music is cool -- though there's really nowhere enough of it for this to really be called a "rock opera."\n\nI'm glad I experienced the designer's vision, but I feel like I deserve some kind of special medal for playing through it.\n\nPlease guys, you have a rough diamond on your hands. Sit down and work on it more and release it again under a special name -- "Remastered" or something -- to satisfy the many people who had such high hopes for this.","March 2, 2015","false","6.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Level design is confusing, draw distances are short and obfuscated by fog and dim lighting, camera control is twitchy, puzzles are tedious, and, honestly, neither the story nor the art are very good.  Character design could charitably be called "abstract", and environments "minimalist", but really most of the art assets feel more like placeholders than release versions.\n\nThe reality is that the finished game is so far below the standard consumers expect from a professionally-produced game - particularly one selling for $20 - that it's completely impossible to recommend.

I gave it enough chances and redid enough parts/wasted enough time because of poor level design, bugs, and amateur game design. First off, visuals are solid. Rock opera  for a videogame is an interesting idea. Some parts work, and others don't because they will sing too long of lines that don't rhyme or flow, and its like trying to turn a paragraph into a song. The singing comes out longwinded and lacks flow in areas, and seems like just talking. Also some parts they do scremo low voice incoherent sounds and count it as singing. The story is incoherent and doesn't really make sense, and singing random setences that make up the dialogue doesn't help much.\n\nThen there's the actual gameplay. As everyone has said, there is no direction. You are put in big open areas and somehow supposed to find the next area, with no waypoint or objective. Many times I had to look online because I didn't know where to go. Most of the gameplay is just taking essence and giving essence to trigger things. Lot of time spent wondering around to find things. Many times how I got to the next area didn't seem like an organic path, but it must have been. Then there are the bugs, which as you can tell from the comment section are all over the place, unaccetable at this part of the game. At one point I beat a boss and it was bugged how I tried getting to the next section, and since there wasn't a checkpoint, I had to redo the boss as well, who was not bugged and not able to be activated to be beaten. Restarting didn't fix it, but finally after stopping the game and waiting a few days it worked. Annoying having a bug that won't let you progress. Then later on in ACT II I was unable to progress because of game design. I was supposed to jump into this air vent that would push me up and I would fly to the next area. As opposed to regular games where if you jump into it it will auto suck you into the stream and you can fly to the next area. This game isn't that well made. You will sometimes be shot forward but many times the game would just drop me downward from the spiral, without getting high enough. I would die and restart a bit back and have to keep trying it. I saw how someone did it online, and tried it myself, but because of the inconsistency, it just didn't work. It wasn't that I was doing anything incorrectly, the game should just have shot me high in the sky but it wouldn't because of buggy inconsistent mechanics. And they are are over the game. So finally a decided it wasn't work it. 4.5/10.","July 11, 2015","false","40.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I was an early backer, so I've been looking forward to it for a while. Unfortunately, in the current state that the game is in, I can't recommend it. Some of the other reviews say that bugs are being patched out in updates, so if I see that some of the issues I had are gone, I'll happily change this to a "recommend".\n\nOne of the biggest problems is that the mouse lags horribly in the menu. After exiting the game, it was a shock to see my cursor move fluidly on my screen again.\nAnother problem to do with the menus is that there is no keyboard support for it. When it takes 5 minutes to drag your mouse cursor to "resume game", you'd definitely prefer to tap the ESC button to return to the game. Hopefully that comes in the future.\nWhenever you activate a new checkpoint, the game freezes for a couple of seconds. However, if you move your mouse while it's frozen, the camera will move after it resumes, meaning it is very easy to lose your bearings.\nSome of the platforming parts are bugged. There was one part where I had to fly through a hole in a rock formation. Somehow I got wedged in the hole and had to restart from an earlier checkpoint, meaning I had to fight the first boss again ("fight" is used very loosely).\nSome parts of the game are too dark. There's a part early in the game where I had to jump to my death several times just to try and see where I had to go next.\nSome of the backing music is repetitive and annoying. This is more on a personal level, but the music in the early levels becomes very annoying, especially when you keep respawning due to having no idea where to go.\nThat's most of the problems I have with the gameplay of the game.\n\nI have to say that I'm a big fan of power metal; I've listened to most of the bands that have members featured in the cast of the game. And even with that musical background, I found the songs in this game incredibly cringey. The music was fantastic, but the lyrics were just embarassing.","January 20, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

There is no keyboard navigation support in the menus. Graphics are laughably bad and dour. The game is severely unoptimized (bullocks it will run decently on a GT 8800!!).

I wasn't honestly sure what to expect, so I was impressed with some parts and disappointed with others. I think the platforming and puzzle solving was pretty well-thought out. It reminded me of playing old PS2 platformers, and really hit my nostalgia factors in that regards.\n\nHowever, I was a bit disappointed with the story. Instead of a fully fleshed out tale from start to finish, the game is split into chapters, two of which are present in Act 1. The first thing to know is that you play as a robotic-looking creature called The Keeper, who controls the flow of an energy called Karma to change the world around it. The setting takes place in a multiverse, and the Keeper goes to worlds that appear to be ending due to something called Dissonance. You're given a brief history of the world and a rough idea of what you have to do before the chapter starts, but any other information has to be garnered through either guesswork or finding hidden fragments that give you a cryptic idea of what happened to the world. At the end of each chapter, you're given an option to either help the creature or person responsible for keeping that world protected or in balance, or kill them and end that world. The choices are mostly black and white so far, with some very minor gray areas.\n\nNow since this is considered "The Rock Opera Videogame," I'll go over the music. First off, the overworld music can be underwhelming at times. It ranges from silent to a bit serene to having some rocking riffs, but nothing really stood out. The cutscenes are pretty good, however. All dialogue is sung, and the singers are very talented I find, but I think a lot of the music just seems to be words sung over a given track being played at a given time. As such, it just doesn't have the kind of impact that I would be expecting from something like a rock opera. Which is a shame, because I really did enjoy the singing itself, and wish there was more of it in the overall game.\n\nAct I is about 3 hours long, and that's with some minor exploring. In addition, while none of the bugs are game breaking, some are very annoying. For example, there are a few times in the beginning area where you're just hit by invisible stuff for what seems to be no reason, and while you can't take damage, it does stun you for a few moments. There's also more than a few times where I went to jump only to immediately do my double jump instead, leading to frustration during some tight platforming moments.\n\nAt $20, I can't say I recommend the game. I myself got it from a bundle that only cost me about $4 for a bunch of games including this one. However, it is very unique in its presentation. I cannot recommend it for full price, but I can recommend it if you get it at even a small discount, perhaps even $15. It's not the greatest game, but I enjoyed playing it, all problems aside, and am looking forward to Part 2. Just be sure you know what you're getting into, watch the videos  and look at the pictures as well as other reviews before you purchase.","February 26, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music was fantastic, and the singing was just as good.  Listening to the story unfold through rock music is something I have never seen done in a video game before.  You even get to choose some of the choices that some of the characters make, which is difficult sometimes when theres not necessarily a clear good guy/bad guy.  Overall it was very enjoyable.  But, I have to mention a few issues with the core game/movement mechanics for the character you play.  A lot of the puzzles require you to do some platform jumping, and your character is not very good at platform jumping.  Often, starting to run will just fling you off a platform.  You don't carry momentum well while in the air.  You will also find that your second jump sometimes used up as your first jump, leading to a lot of falling to your death.  A lot of the terrain is very rough, full of rocks and mountains and such.  With the way your character handles, it often becomes a chore trying to navigate the terrain.  So, some mechanical issues are definitely present, but I did very much enjoy the game overall.","March 1, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What are you waiting for, get this "game" for the soundtrack, it's top knotch! This is the latest project from ostensibly Xystus and friends, and the first thing they've put out since Equilibrio, their splendiferous previous rock/metal opera. I stumbled upon this project in a roundabout way while poking around Metal Archives...\n\nWait, is this is a music review or a game review?\n\nWell, the game is super boring to be perfectly honest. It's a clunky 3d platformer with clear Zelda influence but lacking the finesse and danger. IMO platformers without a threat of danger are little more than glorified walking simulators. This one is also a glorified music player, but it has too much farting around in between songs. Maybe I'm being too harsh though, the team is as I understand it a game design school graduating class, maybe their second game will be more playable. Also, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the character design is fabulous, I love the cute abstract player character.\n\nI was faced the choice of buy the soundtrack album or buy the game, I bought the game because it intrigued me. I really do strongly recommend the music for anyone with even a passing interest in rock opera and/or symphonic power metal, but everyone else can continue not knowing this project exists.\n\npros:\n-Simone Simons\n-Music composed by Ivo van Dijk\n-Goofy english as a second language lyrics\n-Soundtrack included in base game (deluxe is double the price for a making of and concept art)\n-Cool character designs\n\ncons:\n-downtime between songs\n-playing the game","November 14, 2015","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From a technical standpoint it is far from polished, with performance issues and the odd bug every now and then -- but dang it, I can't bring myself to care when it looks and sounds so bloody beautiful. "Karmaflow" is such a fitting title, because the game has a beautiful, magical flow indeed. The amount of originality put into this game is astonishing. The mode of storytelling is gripping, the environments, art, and music just plain wonderful, and it's all combined in magical journey through dreamscape-like lands. Having just finished Act I at some 4 hours of gameplay, my only complaint would be that it is so, so short when I could still be playing this in the afterlife. But fear not, because the decisions you have to make in regards to saving or condemning each world give this game some replay value (I mean, in case you weren't already going to replay it, in which case I ask -- ?!?!?!).\n\nIt isn't flawless, but I need this game morning, day, and night.

Level quality quickly ramps up after the opening level, and the amazing lineup of musicians (this has to be the most ambitious soundtrack I've ever heard in an indie game!) helps cement the darkly magical atmosphere.

There´s just nothing else like it.\nHighly recommended to fans of the (music and game) genre.\n\nNot perfect by any stretch though.\nOur Karmakeeper (protagonist) has a lot of movement options, double jumps, glides, dashes, even a sweet bouncepad. But his movement is also somewhat sluggish and sometimes unpredictable, making it a mixed bag of stunning displays of acrobatics, to jumps landing nowhere near where they´re supposed to with no way to recover.\n\nThere´s also diverse and beautiful worlds for us to travel through, from Chapter 1´s dead snowy forest and ruins, to Chapter 2´s savannah and swamp. Chapter 3 has a floating city and goes to the bottom of the ocean and back, while Chapter 4 is mostly an industrial looking cave with machinery and huge moving structures. It ends with the Epilogue in a sort of steampunky limbo with floaing cogs and platforms. And they´re all filled with interesting looking characters, with more (and less) involved puzzles.\n\nThe talent displayed by the musical artists is nothing short of spectacular, and the orchestral score is beautiful.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this game is the sheer amount of sections on rails in ACT II,  I HATE these type of sections in games in general, and here´s no different. Trial and error BS, that´s nothing but frustrating, with no way to speed them up. To a lesser extent I could complain about the game never really explaining anything,\nMaking it very possible to get stuck for long periods of time.\nSometimes the game even trolls you, for example one of the later puzzles has four orange squares lit up and a closed door. As you extract the first point, the first square turns purple. The second extract turns the second square purple. Great. Yet the third extraction turns the 3:rd and 4:th square purple, but doesn´t open the door. And the fourth extractionpoint is the only one that´s hidden, adding to the confusion.\n\n\nAll in all, highly recommended. A game you don´t see every day, and the experience is well worth the price of admission. In our world of "day1DLC" "Pre-purchases" and "early-access" BS, ACT 2 could have easily been the same price as the first, sold as DLC. But Basecamp Games gave it at no charge to anyone who had ACT 1 in their library, as an update to the game.\nOldschool, and classy as ♥♥♥♥.

And there's this one crash-bandicoot-esque towards-the-camera chase level that I died on 50 times.\n\nBut: it's got extremely imaginative environments and characters. The music that it does contain is great if you like the genre. And it's still reasonably fun & playable.\n\nNot worth full price.
