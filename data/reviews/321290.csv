"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marigold/recommended/321290/","marigold","Demoiselle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marigold/","128 products in account","If pigeons weren't enough, now you can choose between BUNNIES and KITTENS. Well, kind of. Unlike the pigeons in Hatoful Boyfriend, these animals fortunately (?) don't stay animals forever. (I took a bunny with me to the beach; he was not impressed when I put on my $100 dollar bikini, the fruits of MANY nights of labor at the local art gallery. I would've been pretty weirded out if he was.)\n\nAnimal jokes aside, Dandelion is a lovely, very professionally done Korean visual novel aimed at a female audience. I think this may be the first Korean visual novel on Steam, and it's gorgeous, with fully voiced Korean dialogue and English text. I believe you can set the text to Korean as well. There are five different possible love interests you can pursue at the start, though at the beginning I swear it plays more like a pet raising simulator than anything else. Steambuns instead of Nintendogs, right?\n\nBut no, there's a mystery that slowly begins to unfold--and eventually romance. With people. Human people, I swear. Just ignore the occasional animal ears. Yes, the $30 price tag may seem very steep to a lot of Steam users accustomed to cheaper alternatives, but before brushing it off, try the demo (available on Steam right here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/323760/?snr=1_5_1100__1100). It doesn't take long to see how much work went into it, and how many visual novels on Steam have extensive voice acting? Not enough! I've only noticed a few small translation errors here and there, but they aren't nearly as common, noticeable, or cringe-worthy as a lot of the freemium VNs' rushed translations on iOS and Android. Overall, the translation is very well done.\n\nHopefully, if Dandelion does well enough on Steam, Cheritz might feel inclined to add Nameless, their latest visual novel set in the same general universe--but with dolls instead of cats and rabbits. Yes, dolls. How can any girl resist?\n\nUPDATE after completing all routes, including Jisoo's absolutely TERRIFYING "bad route" (totally worth it for the extra CGs!):\n\nYes, I sank 35 hours into Dandelion. Yes, every one of them was worth it. I can't think of another visual novel/dating sim that left me thinking so much after completing it. After completing all 5 routes, make sure to check the bonus content! I was really interested in the mystery behind the story--who left me with these animals and why? The bonus content was the cherry on top of an already delicious sundae--and isn't the cherry sometimes the best part?\n\nFirst, I have to praise the characterization of Heejung. I know most visual novels/dating sims use "blank slate" protagonists (sometimes without eyes--creepy!), but Heejung is the most relatable, realistic heroine I've encountered in a while. (I may be biased because I, too, wonder where my mysterious new bruises came from and how expensive it would be to install a TV in my bathroom when I take a bubble bath to raise my beauty and femininity stats in real life.) Who doesn't understand the pressures of "making it" and continuously doing things you dread solely to please your parents and loved ones, no matter your culture? Who doesn't fear being left behind?\n\nThe love interests are fantastic too, and are much more than their archetypes may make them appear at first glance (pretty bunny, baby bunny, snobby bunny, sweet kitty, glutton/pervert kitty), though of course I had favorites. I started with Jihae, whose route seemed like a good one for beginners (just remember to raise some affection with Jieun too!), and ended with Jieun because I was super stubborn about not pursuing a baby bunny. He's a baby! Heejung is a college senior! ...But his route was one of the sweetest and actually had the best ending. Jiwoo's was great too, especially if you've seen as many Korean dramas as I have and can appreciate how the game pokes fun at kdrama clichés. (Those envelopes of money! Candy Cinderella and chaebol romances!)\n\nThere is a LOT of stat-raising, but if you focus first on raising your Stress/Pressure Relief abilities, that helps a lot, and soon you won't even notice your Stress and Pressure stats raising at all. Make frequent use of Quick Save/Quick Reload if you accidentally poke/show love/feed them fruit in the wrong place (sometimes deliberately...!) and get a bad reaction, or if you can't find the bunny/kitten of your dreams anywhere in the entire apartment.\n\nIf you're on the fence about getting Dandelion, definitely try the demo first--and then just get it. Unless you really, really hate bunnies and kittens (are you more of a dog and ferret person?), you won't be disappointed.","September 29, 2014","true","46.3"," 141 of 144 people (98%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","98","141","144","17","0"

The various story lines are definitely entertaining with more than one little twist and turn that I honestly wasn't expecting and the characters are surprisingly 3-dimensional despite most of them being cat boys and bunny boys. That's right, ladies; after many long years putting up with the cat girl and bunny girl tropes it is now our turn. But wait, there’s more! Not only do we get eye-candy a plenty, but we also get actual personalities with realistic faults and flaws, (yes, even silver bunny and white bunny have their flaws, though theirs aren't quite as pronounced as the other three's). Even the main character has a personality – or quite possibly a severe mental condition that, in most cases, she manages to overcome without the need for expensive therapy and/or medication (come forth and bear witness to the mighty healing powers of cat/bunny boys!).\n\nAs for the actual gameplay: It’s pretty much a matter of grinding states to progress the story (mostly by avoiding a bad end). I know some people don’t care much for this aspect, but to be perfectly honest that was one of the main reasons I bought the game (that and Dodger). It does make the game pretty long, I admit, but for me it was kind of cathartic so I don't really see that as much of a downside.\n\nBTW: Frequent and blatant abuse of the quick save/load feature is a legitimate part of the game. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it.\n\nSo I would love to recommend this game. I really would. The story was quirky and interesting, the characters were great, the typos(which are regrettably frequent) are sometimes unintentionally hilarious, the weirdness is prevalent (which I quite enjoy), and the 'true ending' that you get after you complete all the rest was just amazing. I totally fangirled all over this game for quite some time (don't judge me), but after the most recent update I can't recommend it anymore.\n\nYou see, Cheritz seems to have graduated with high honors from both the EA and Blizzard schools of DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥-baggery. This is a graphic novel. Albeit, it is a pretty good graphic novel, but there is, nevertheless, no possible need for it to require, REQUIRE, a constant internet connection. And yet for some reason you cannot play this game in Offline Mode; some people can't even play it when they ARE online because of all the other little addendums and bugs that have come with it. Oh you can do the grinding in Offline Mode, but the moment a cutscene comes up you're pretty much screwed. I honestly can't understand what logical reason Cheritz could have for this. I always thought that Steam WAS the DRM, but now even that's not good enough for you guys? Really?\n\nI'm sick of it. I really am. This DRM bullcrap is getting into absolutely everything, isn’t it? Even effing graphic novels. Graphic novels, people! But hey, if you don't have a problem with all that and have a flawless internet connection (obviously you do not have the same ISP as I do, lucky) then go for it! It's an enjoyable graphic novel game. I just wish the company would rethink this entire thing and go back to how it was BEFORE the constant connection was necessary. If it ever does I'll change my recommendation and I'd buy their other game, Nameless, in a heartbeat. But, so far, that doesn’t seem likely to happen. Oh well. Guess I’ll just get over it and move on.","May 7, 2015","false","60.4"," 168 of 196 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","168","196","10","5"

Please, don`t look at the playtime displayed in my Steam account. I bought this game almost immediately after its official release on CheritZ, when it wasn`t available on Steam at all and used a special security server to play, and played it for around 6 months (completing all possible character stories, of course).\nI actually love Dandelion. One of the reasons for it is the main character - Heejung. Even though I never was in the same situation is hers, I still can feel her sorrow and pain. She is not some lifeless female protagonist that we can see in many otome games. She has personality and we can see her developing during the game. If you have heart, you WILL want to make her happy, though the road to happiness for this poor girl is a really difficult one.\nNow, after I have talked about my main reason to love the game, let`s look in details at what it offers.\n\n1)	Characters. There is a lot of different personalities here: timid and dreamy Jieun, tsundere type Jiwoo, dark and "bad-boy type" Jisoo, mysterious and level-headed Jihae, charming Jiyeon (whom I started to hate at some point because....well, you need to play the game to understand what he really is). And of course the Wizard, a crazy person who is obsessed with Heejung in some way (or in all ways). There is also Heejae - Heejung`s friend from the university, but he doesn`t play any major role in the story.\n\n2)	Story. This one is quite interesting. As I understood, there are two words – the normal one, where Heejung lives, and the parallel one, where animal-people live. The main two classes mentioned are rabbits and cats: rabbits are royalty and wealthy all in all, and cats suffer from poverty and rabbits` policy. That`s the reason why Jisoo and Jiyeon – the cat-boys - don`t like three other young man (who are rabbits). Developers of the game did quite a good job showing the society of cats and rabbits. As far as the romantic part of the story is concerned, it is also worth mentioning. All male characters are really different and their attitude towards Heejung is different too. Some of them are pretty shocking, to say the least, for example, Jisoo`s one. He scared me at some point. However, I don`t want to write spoilers here, so I can`t add anything else without opening some part of his route. It is also really appealing to me that male characters develop along with the protagonist and that all of them are not what they seemed at first sight. Don`t trust your first impression, dear friends, because it will fail you. Every character is unique, so the game has great replayability. Despite having already completed the game I still decided to start it again in Steam, because it is better than many other otome games, its story is more consistent and it provides something apart from love story. Yes, Heejung has to fall in love with one of them but it doesn`t mean that everything will be in pink colour. There is great social context that will make you think about different things, including how to raise your children (Heejung`s mother is one of the worst possible examples, to say the least).\n\n3)	Voices. Something I really liked was that Heejung has her own voice. Yes, she speaks, and I like how she does it. She is emotional and sincere. Male voices are very good too, they suit the characters well and if I have ever to imagine them in real life, I would give them the same ones. Though I should also say that at first I found the language funny, no offense here, people from Korea. It is just so different from Russian, and the way some words are pronounced…that`s fascinating. Nevertheless, I got used to it pretty fast, so there is nothing to complain about.\n\n4)	Interface and game mechanics. Both were nice and easy to understand in the non-Steam version of the game, but in Steam it has become even better. I like how the Status of Heejung is shown, I like how simple the stats are that you don`t have to run around the map or house to understand what to do and how to improve the protagonist. Everything is simple and it is good. At the same time I can`t but mention that all this stat raising may become a bit repetitive. By the end of the third route (it was Jisoo`s one, btw) I have already learned by heart what to do and where to go to achieve what I want, so the story is the main feature that makes you want to play, not the process of playing itself.\n\n5) Art and CGs. I love the style all characters are drawn. It`s neither childish nor too realistic. Heejung is not a super model and she never was presented as one, she is just a common young woman who is concerned about her future and current life. It is also worth saying that characters` emotions are well shown with both the art and the voice acting. The CGs are all well-drawn, I can see love of the artists who created them. Some are funny, some are scary, some are mysterious (remember the crazy Wizard?) and some are lovely and romantic. I strongly recommend completing all the routes and opening all CGs, because you will most probably love them.\n\nAll in all, Dandelion - Wishes brought to you – is worth its money and your time. I do believe that you will like the characters and the plot and that you will not be disappointed with any of the endings. There is no fairytale here, even though it looks like one. But there are actual problems of the real world that Heejung has to face every day.\n\nI wish you good game and hope my review will help you in any way. ^^\n\nP.S. Don`t forget to complete Bad Endings too, they are more then worth it. As I said before, Jisoo`s one is pretty shocking.","November 1, 2015","true","12.9"," 52 of 53 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","52","53","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melonmoxie/recommended/321290/","melonmoxie","Melon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melonmoxie/","87 products in account","Well, first off, I have to say this is an absolutely beautiful game. If you’re looking for a subpar dating sim, you will have to look elsewhere, because Dandelion is very well put-together and a blast to play. The graphics are very nice and the characters are interesting and adorable in different ways. The stories for the different boys are very cool to learn about over time and the mysterious voice from somewhere is, uh, very mysterious. Very I-don’t-explain-anything-but-I-imply-that-there-is-a-huge-background-here-wink-wink-to-those-who-have-played-the-game-enough. So yeah, very mysterious to me. One of the only issues that I had with it was the typos that popped up sometimes, but overall the translation was well done. They did a very good job of maintaining the sweet, giving nature of Heejung while also revealing her struggles and discontent. She can almost seem too placid, but it is understandable, given her past, and as the game moves forward, she does show signs of a backbone as she comes in to her own (thanks, furry adorableness?), which I whole-heartedly approve of.\n\nIt takes some time to recognize the voices and names (very creative, Heejung…lots of J’s @_@) but once you do, it becomes very easy to know who is speaking during scenes that don’t show faces. The different colors help and the personalities are so unique from one another that it becomes clear pretty quickly. The stat system is very intensive if you want to buff them all out, but the options are cute and for some of the boys, it’s important to max out your stats as quickly as possible. Just think of it as primping and sketching your way to the top. I actually do enjoy the grind, because the little illustrations are cute and it’s nice to become beautiful just by taking a bath. Unfortunately there have been no side effects in real life.\n\nThe most important thing that you should keep in mind when playing this game is FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS FURRY AND CUTE DO NOT TRY TO GAIN HEARTS FROM ALL OF THEM. You may think, ‘Oh that’d be nice to be friends with all of them! I’ll just hang out with everyone and become a more well-rounded person!’ That is the quickest path to a bad ending, except in a few special cases, which I'm sure you'll figure out after a couple of hours of playing.\n\nYes.\n\nI was there.\n\nLet me lay out the scene for you:\nThere I was on a different guy’s route, when I thought I would go out on the weekend and have a nice, friendly lunch with Jiwoo, you know? Just two buds hanging out and becoming even better friends. Maybe he’d even stop calling me stupid one day! During lunch, he says something about me feeding him, and being the desperate-for-points-and-new-interactions player I am, I chose the ‘Open wiiiide” option, thinking it was a little weird, but hey, I don’t judge friendships. Then he goes and says something about not dating any other boys. And if I were really Heejung, I would have stopped in my tracks and wondered, ‘You think we’re dating?!?!’ But of course, I am not her, and the game just continued on, unmindful to the fact that it had just rocked my world. When I started the game, I thought that Heejung was very oblivious when it came to boys, which was cute but almost a little much. Now, I know the horrid truth. I am JUST as oblivious and stupid about boys as a main protagonist of a DATING simulator. TT_TT\n\nLet’s just say there is one bad ending in particular which is more than a little traumatizing and I couldn’t stop thinking about it last night. On the bright side, they did an excellent job of unobtrusively sliding you into an abusive and very dangerous relationship, with you torn between thinking there is something very wrong, and thinking that it will turn out okay once he calms down.\n\nHe didn’t calm down.\n\nI am still a bit emotionally scarred and I have been hesitant to play his good route (I just need some recovery time…). I recommend you get all the good endings before you try to get the bad endings for completeness—that way you’ll still be able to sleep at night without thinking someone’s going to be hovering over your bed. Following you to the bathroom…not letting you talk to people…scarring the actual player for real…or maybe that’s just me. But, what the heck, do whatever you like! (It’s your funeral)\n\nOn a completely random side note, I like to pretend that the silver-haired man in the city panoramic scene that pops up once in a while is actually the main protagonist from Persona 4 (just to spice up the scenery for me). Unfortunately, no matter how many times I click on him, he does not become a dateable furball of cuteness. But I can just imagine him as a large darker gray-haired rabbit, majestically lording over everyone in King’s Game. X3 He’d fit right in with Jieun and Jihae!","October 19, 2014","true","10.2"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","41","43","5","0"

I wanted to wait to post a review until I had completely finished it, which meant unlocking everything possible.  Although it was a challenge at times, I finally did it so here are my thoughts.  ^^\n\nDandelion isn't a perfect game but overall, I loved it quite a lot.  It took me having to actually play and experience it to understand why others love it as well.  Gamewise, it's pretty lengthy in which it takes course over the span of one year (in game) and there are a total of five possible guys to pursue, four of which have both good and bad paths.  (The final one only has a good path.)  Dandelion is a combination of a visual novel and dating sim so there is stat raising involved.  Although some might find the stat raising to be annoying, I was fine with it since I've played quite a lot of games that have this feature.  The cut scenes are enjoyable, some of them being funny while others being emotional.  (I did find myself crying at certain points and I rarely do so in general.)\n\nI'm sure that everyone who has played this game has a favorite romanceable character and mine would have to be Jieun.  Spoilers as to why but beware, you've been warned:\n\nOut of the five possible guys, Jieun seems like the underdog and generally, I support underdogs.  Initially, he comes across as quiet and mysterious.  However, if you choose to pursue him, he does open up to the main character (Heejung) and tells her of his past and how it's related to another of the characters.  Now I absolutely cannot say enough how much I loved his path.  For one, Jieun does have pain in his past like Heejung and together, the two of them help each other become stronger and overcome the obstacles in their past.  As Jieun says at one point, he wants Heejung to see him as an equal even though their social status is different.  With the other guys, I didn't see that as much.\n\nAlso, he is aware of the one who sets up this "game" for Heejung in the first place and on his path, he realizes that having his initial wish granted isn't the way to go.  In my opinion, Jieun is pretty smart in that although he knows that he has to play the game until the end, he doesn't have to ask for any wish by the time he's summoned to announce that he'll be the winner.  In addition, during the time that Jieun spends with Heejung, he encourages her, tells her that she's strong and that she'll be ok, no matter what happens.  Because of his encouragement, Heejung will never make a strong wish which makes the Wizard (the creator of the game) appear.  In the other guys' paths, the Wizard appears before Heejung and unfortunately, either she or the guy she pursues will end up losing their memories.  But in Jieun's path, both he and Heejung will remember everything and that's because Heejung will never seek the Wizard's help.  I must admit that I do love how Jieun outsmarts the Wizard in this way.  XD\n\nIf there are any negative points, I'd have to say that this game could have been proofread better.  Now I know that it's a translated game but I think that it certainly would have helped if the developers had hired a proofreader with proficient English skills to check over the script.  I noticed typos, grammar errors, and weird punctuation at certain places.  Of course, I'm nitpicking but still.  Also, I would have loved for there to be Steam achievements but I do know that it can be difficult to implement them although I do hope that they can be added one day.  ^^\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved Dandelion and I can understand all the praise it's gotten.  As I've said, it's certainly not perfect and there's room for improvement but it's a great game and I'd highly recommend getting it for all the fans of VNs, dating sims, etc.  XD","December 23, 2015","true","89.4"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

Since you spend so much time with Heejung and the boy of choice, you can really start bonding with them. I'd say one storyline can range from 4-6 hours depending if you decide to skip some things you've already seen if you're replaying the game with a different boy. The cutscenes at the start are mostly the same if I remember correctly.\n\nI'd also like to mention that the art and music are really beautiful together with the storyline.\n\nI really recommend this game to anyone that considers it!","December 2, 2014","true","20.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

Dandelion was made by a South Korean company called Cheritz and it was released in Korean before English. The company is very good about the fact that there is not a long wait between when the Korean version comes out and when the English version comes out. Also they have another game called Nameless (please put it on Steam), and I hope they release many more games. Also I played this game before it got on Steam, so my play time is not very long, but I hope to fix that during my next school break. By the way, I love Cheritz. One, they make amazing games and they release them in English. Two, they have character good that you can order from their store. They do not have too much Dandelion stuff in their store, but hopefully they will add some more since the game got on Steam.\nSecond, this is an otome game with five guys that are pursuable. Supposedly you can also end up with your classmate, but I have yet to do this. There is no yuri route. This is not a pure visual novel game; it does have a stat raising part to it. The art of the characters and the CGs are amazing and top quality. I would say that the CGs are as good as Starry Sky, Hakuoki, Sweet Side, and Dramatical Murder. The backgrounds during the gameplay are not as good, but they are better than your typical visual novel that you see released in English. The test is in English, but the voices are in Korean, which I love Korean so I think it is great. Not everything is voiced, but the main parts are. I think the voice acting is great, but I don’t know Korean, so I probably am not the best judge of that. Is it worth $30? YES, YES, YES!!!\nYou play as a 21 year old girl named Hee-Jung, who is an art student at a university. Fairly quickly you find out she has an inferiority complex stemming from issues with her mother and the fact that her mother never considers what Hee-Jung is doing is good enough. I found this game very relatable considering I am a girl in college, who picked her major based off what her parents wanted, and I pretty much hate my major now. In another aspect Hee-Jung reminds me of someone who has depression, so she is not a happy go lucky heroine, and I feel that she is more realistic than some of the other main characters in other otome games that I have played. She doesn’t seem to have many friends, except for this guy (sorry I forgot his name) in her art club who obviously likes her, so Hee-Jung does not have much to do besides school and her art project. Which as a college student in a time consuming major, I find this to be very accurate. It’s also apparent that Hee-Jung feels lonely.\nHow the story begins is that Hee-Jung come home one day to find a basket with a black cat, an orange cat, a spotted hare, a silver rabbit, and a white rabbit on her doorstep. All of these animals are just peacefully chilling, and not fighting, which is really odd. She can not bring herself to get rid of them, so she decides to keep them. Hee-Jung names the black cat, Jisoo, the prange cat, Jiyeon, the silver rabbit, Jihae, the white rabbit, Jieun, and the spotted hare, Jiwoo. For the first portion of the game you do various things like studying or taking a bath in different rooms to increase your mood or grades. By looking at the map, you can see where all the animals are. If an animal is in a room that you are doing something in then you may get to interact with that animal also. This usually increases your relationship with the animal. Also you can talk to, give gifts to, and touch the animals. Be careful on the touching because if you touch the animal in the wrong place then you may lose relationship points. After a certain point you actually get to the point where Hee-Jung actually figures out that every animal is actually a guy, who can switch between the two forms (surprise if you hadn’t figured that out yet). So no, this game is not like Hatoful Boyfriend, the guys are not actually animals. By the end of the first section, you are more or less on one guy’s route, which is determined by which animal you became closest to. This doesn’t mean you can not interact with the other guys. In fact you can make some characters jealous by hanging out with the others more than him. In the second part of the game, the focus is more on going out with dates with your desired guy, and raising up the stat that goes with him. On dates you can collect stickers of the guy you are out with, which unlock extra content from the extras section on the main menu. By the end of the game Hee-Jung has grown and become a strong character.\nBe warned the characters do have good endings and bad endings. To be completely honest, the good endings are bittersweet, and they will stay with you for a long time. The feels you get from the good endings are amazing and indescribable, so I hope you experience them yourself.\n\nSPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!\n\n\nThe magician is the guy who sent the animals to Hee-Jung, and created the whole ‘game’ that keeps getting mentioned. Each guy made a deal with the magician to try to get Hee-Jung to love him, and in return the Magician would grant the guys wish. Pro: guy gets wish granted. Con: Guy falls in love with Hee-Jung, but ends up forgetting her after his wish is granted. He doesn’t completely forget her, but he doesn’t really remember what he is missing, and this is what causes the bittersweet endings. Towards the end after the guy has won the ‘game’, the Magician is allowed to actually meet Hee-Jung (he has a very pretty CG), and this is the only time that the Magician ever gets to interact with her. It is hinted at that the Magician is in love with Hee-Jung, and is constantly creating alternate realities (or rewinding time) back at the beginning of the game, so that he can keep meeting her over and over again. In a way Hee-Jung, ends up with every guy. This is speculation, but I like this interpretation. Also the Magician guy supposedly pops up in Nameless also.\n","October 5, 2014","true","25.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142521099/recommended/321290/","76561198142521099","Shady","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142521099/","27 products in account","Dandelion covers the story of Heejung who is a very studious young adult lady who spends most of her time attempting to become the ideal well-rounded student... but it's not what she really wants. She's pulled ahead by the invisible guide that her strict mom has set for her in life, but if you asked her what she wanted herself she wouldn't know what to say.\n\nTo an otome game regular, I thought she was a refreshing heroine who is quite relatable and strongly written, which can be a rarity in otome games sometimes. Her troubles form an important part of the story and I found it interesting how she ended bonding with the datable cast and changing along with them.\n\nNot everything in Dandelion is played straight and all the guys have hidden secrets for you to discover throughout the game, which adds an interesting dimension to what may seem like a silly stat-raising game where you date animal boys. That being said, the story is fairly well-written in terms of depth of character, but keep in mind that this is a game meant for dating pretty boys at heart. You may not find this game to be entertaining if you don't like said pretty boys. Ahem.\n\nAnyway, it's difficult to explain the charms of the game without spoiling the story, so I'll try summarizing briefly the different points:\n\n♡ Charming and non-intrusive BGM\n♡ Attractive and stylish art\n♡ The translation is surprisingly good, though the prose may not be everyone's cup of tea\n♡ Solid game design and system lacking bugs\n♡ Relatable conflict and emotional character developments\n♡ Full voice acting (heroine included!)\n\nWhat you may find to be drawbacks, however, are:\n\nX Prose not as strong as, say, an original English visual novel (but don't let that fool you, it's not like it's unreadable, but don't expect a flawless example of the height in literature)\nX There is some awkward anatomy in the art, but I wouldn't say it's overwhelming and it's generally fairly solid.\nX Long sessions of stat-raising with very little to break the melancholy once you've satisfied the stat requirements.\n---(The stat-raising system can be repetitive after a while but it is fully functional. I think this may be preferable to those who dislike the long sessions of reading a straight visual novel may require or those who are new to the genre altogether.\nEven if you dislike the stat-raising system, I'd say it's worth trucking through anyway if you would like the story. Keep in mind that the story has more meat on it than you may glean from the description provided, but  you can scratch the surface by playing the demo. I think that will provide you with at least the bare bones to determine if trudging through the stat-raising system to enjoy the story is worth it or not for you.)\nX Unexpected character developments you may not be pleased with (never without proper justification, though)\nX It's very easy to get lost without a walkthrough, though it is possible to get through if you're willing to make mistakes (which will sacrifice you much time unless you remember to create individual saves often).\n\nI'd recommend this game to those who will form an attachment to the characters because this is one of the game's strengths, those who can enjoy stories that aren't all sunshine and don't feel that stories that will not provide full  closure are weaker for it.\n---(Cheritz has always been ambiguous but I don't consider it to be a weakness. Their strength lies in the characters and their relatable conflicts and not the clean tying of knots for a satisfying ending, so to speak.)\n\nIf you're none of these, I can't really guarantee your full enjoyment of the game. In my own opinion, the game had many lovely moments though I couldn't come to like every character. Cheritz didn't fail to make it generally clear why they were the way they were, however. I strongly suggest playing the demo to have a taste of the stat-raising system because it really is a large part of the game and  the padding to express the passage of time. If you can't stand it, it will be hard to play because it's an unavoidable area. On the other hand, I know many who chose to play despite disliking stat-raising, myself being one of them. I found going through the stat-raising I usually abhor to read the story to be worth it in the end.\n\nCheers.","October 26, 2014","true","383.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","3"

That is a ridiculous restriction due to DRM. Being online does not enhance gameplay at all. Although this game is a wonderful game, I cannot recommend it as it stands. I paid for this game so shouldln't I be able to decide when I can play it and not because it can arbitrarily connect to the servers? Steam itself puts DRM in place so this additional layer by Cheritz doesn't not seem to be needed. Since I travel a lot internet is not always available. The game will repeatedly say it is not connected to the internet so it cannot continue. This is pervasive enought that I have to change my previous yes recommendation to a no recommendation. In addition, I no longer intend to buy their next title because of this issue. No use wasting good money on a game that will not function in offline mode. I think Cheritz should beware of alienating their customers just to put their DRM in place. This kind of thing is becoming more prevalent especially with the big companies such as EA and Ubisoft who are getting reviews based on their cr*ppy DRM software rather than the quality of the game and that is just sad.\n\n\nPrevious review when I actually recommended the game.\nThe art is beautiful and bright and the story line for each character is different and very interesting. Because of how much I enjoyed this game, This game is a bit heavy on the stat leveling, which may or may not be your thing. I personally had no objection to it but I did take a peek at the walkthrough available in the community forum to get some initial help. I think the game itself could have a small explanation section for people who are new to this genre and stat leveling in general. But gameplay can be figured out without it.  I thought the conversations with the characters during activities were very entertaining. The main character well presented, interesting and voiced.","January 30, 2015","false","145.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It is definitely one of the best contenders in the visual novel/dating sim genre. There are some things to be aware if though, which I will be addressing in the cons section of my review.\n\nPros\n+ Each of the characters are supremely unique and have interesting backstories. I've completed the routes for each of the guys, and each guy turned out to be more than what meets the eye. All the characters have positive & negative sides to them, and they each come with some surprises.\n+ The art is gorgeous! I love a game that will take the time to show you some of the pivotal scenes drawn out, and this game does it awesomely! If you look through the screenshot collection on Steam, you will easily see that the story doesn't skimp on engaging cut scenes with wonderful pictures.\n+ I *felt* a lot during the game. I really did empathize with what was going on. You can't go wrong with a game that gets your heat invested.\n+ The voice acting was a great touch! Even though it was in Korean, I loved being able to hear the emotion behind what the characters were saying.\n+ The stat system felt balanced. The stats you needed were different for each character, and I did find myself having to pay attention to make sure I was on track. It added a challenging element to the game without it making it feel bogged down.\n+ The game is VERY replay friendly! I've spent over 30 hours playing and I haven't even gotten all the endings yet. Every romance route is different and enchants you in ways.\n\nCons\n- You unexpectedly run into some uncomfortable stuff in this game. Some of the guys get extremely verbally abusive, posessive, physically violent, and stalker-ish. I did fine with it, but just beware - if you are triggered by any of these things, you might want to look up a walkthrough beforehand and avoid certain routes.\n- This is kind of spoiler-y, but whatever: Jieun's route was BORING. Like... why include this dude as a romance option if the entire time he's just gonna be like "lol i'm too young though." I felt more like I was being his babysitter and it was weird. I know plenty of people loved his story, but I thought it couldn't hold a candle to the other stories. That can be up for you to decide though.\n\nIn short: If you like anime dating sims and can appreciate some upscale art, definitely give this a shot. The majority of the romance routes will tug at your heart, but prepare yourself - the stories WON'T be all rainbows and butterflies.","November 19, 2014","true","32.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

This is why Steam only claims I have played this game for a few hours.*\nBasic plot:\nA college student, Heejung, is living alone in her apartment. The influence of her overbearing mother forces Heejung to frequently second guess herself. To add onto her worries, Heejung wakes up one day to find a basket of five animals next to her bed. She questions where they came from but accepts them as her own after a week or so. Now she must take care of five animals and manage her college expenses. Things only get more complicated when they turn into humans.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nThis game is classified as a visual novel but is more of a stat raising game with visual novel elements. The player must focus on raising their relationships with each of the available suitors while maintaining high femininity, art, and beauty. However, the stress and pressure levels must remain low. Doing activities such as going to work or taking a shower will change the stat levels. The key is to find a balance as to what activities raise the most stats while raising the stress and pressure levels as little as possible.\n\nEach suitor has stats that they prefer. Some have lower standards, while other have higher standards. If the requirements are met within a certain period, usually 1-2 months, an event will occur. Unlike other visual novels where the player picks different options to make an event occur, the stat raising activates the event. When an event occurs, there are no text options to make. I felt that the stat raising element was a nice change from the other visual novels I have played. Having to watch my stats kept my interest and made it hard to stop playing the game.\nThere are even collectible stamps. When you get enough of them for each character, it unlocks bonus content.\n\nThe Characters:\nI feel that the character development is one of the best parts of the game. The stat raising game play allows close interaction with each of the characters. The characters are confined to one house most of the time so the player is forced to interact with each. There are not a lot of events for each character, maybe seven or so. That means that whenever an event occurs, something important is bound to happen. I commend Cheritz for creating characters with faults. For most visual novels, the heroine seems to be either perfect while the options have faults or vice versa. In this game, both the heroine and the characters have problems. This, added together with the stat raising actions, gives the game a sense of relatability.\n\nThe Voice Acting:\nEach voice matched the characters perfectly. I have no complaints. The voice actors of the cats even meowed; that is dedication at its’ finest.\n\nThe Music:\nThe background music often sounds like elevator music, but surprisingly, that is not a bad thing. The music matches the calmness of a house or a stroll around the park. As a whole, the soundtrack is very happy. There are only a few songs for perilous situations, the rest are very calming. I really liked the OP song as well.\n\nThe Art:\nThe artists for the game are absolutely amazing. I am assuming that the CG artist and the sprite artist are different people since the CG’s look different than the sprites. However, the CG’s still look beautiful. The backgrounds stay consistent from behind the sprite to the background of a CG in the same room. The interface is drawn to look like a notebook and has very cute flowers and drawings throughout.\n\nPositive Aspects:\nHere is a list of some of the best qualities of Dandelion.\n-All of the characters have distinct personalities; none of the characters are alike.\n-The art is consistent.\n-The music matches the scene.\n-Having to raise stats keeps the player engaged.\n-Having the characters live together forces the characters to form relationships. These relationships are explored throughout each route, stay consistent, and add to character development.\n-Players of both genders could enjoy the game.\n-The main character is not a ‘wall flower’.\n-The main character develops alongside the suitors. Heejung changes for the better as the game progresses.\n-The game has ‘collectibles’ that the player can hunt for on dates.\n-The opening theme song is amazing.\n-The primary bad endings made sense for each character given their personalities.\n\nBad Aspects:\nHere is a list of minor complaints.\n-To get the best end for one of the characters, another character must like you a decent amount as well. The game fails to make this obvious. I was half way through the route before I realized I was on a bad path that I could not fix.\n-There was no true route for Heejae.\n-One character is significantly harder to satisfy. Some people, like me, may do his route first and fail a lot. If you are like me, playing his route first makes the other routes extremely easy.\n-It was never clearly stated that the game ends in  about a year. It only shows signs of ending a month before the game actually ends. For their first route, players will probably be scrambling at the end, reloading past saves just to raise their stats high enough by the end of the month.\n-It is not always clear what option is considered the best on dates.\n-Some of the character’s required stat levels did not make sense when you take their personality traits into account. (I cannot explain this further without spoiling anything).\n-The translation had minimal errors; Jisoo’s route seemed to have the most errors and the ‘Special’ menu’s ‘back to title’ button was still in Korean. Otherwise, the translation was pretty good.\n\nAspects that will be good to some but bad to others:\n-Since the options are living with the player and are treated as pets in the beginning, it takes a while for any romance to start.\n-Events are caused by raising stats instead of dialogue options.\n-All routes connect to each other in some way.\n-All of the endings except for maybe one ended abruptly. The endings are left to interpretation.\n-The ability to quick save at almost any time makes the game really easy to get collectibles and items to sell. This also makes it really easy to pick the proper responses on dates.\n-The game focuses on character development as opposed to plot.\n-All of the plots are connected, so the player may be confused during their first play through.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI really enjoyed this game and would highly recommend it. All of the characters had distinct personalities and I liked the stat-raising. Sadly, I wound up playing the hardest route first, and then found out how to raise each stat really easily. This caused the rest of the routes to go by really slowly since my stats were already so high; I had nothing to do between events. However, this did allow me to get the collectible stamps with ease. I disagree with the people who feel that this game is difficult. The game takes time to get used to, but with the ability to quick save almost everywhere, learning what raises what and finding items on dates is really easy. Also, people complain that the stat raising gets monotonous; I disagree with that as well. Once you learn what to do, you can raise Heejung’s stats so fast that it does not feel monotonous for too long. After going through one route, raising Heejung’s stats becomes easier.\n\nThere is no clear order to play the routes in, but I would recommend one of two orders:\nPlay Jieun, then Jihae, then Jiwoo or Jiyeon, then Jisoo\nOr\nPlay Jisoo, then Jiwoo or Jiyeon, then Jihae, then Jieun\nEither way, make sure that either Jisoo or Jieun is first or last and that you play Jihae near when you play Jieun. As you can guess, their routes go together. I would recommend order two over order one if you want to go by story since Jieun’s route is completely different from every other route. However, if you want an easy play through, go with order one.","October 17, 2014","true","12.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

But the more I played, the less I liked her. In the end, she just got on my nerves. She was much too weak of a character for me—though I acknowledge others may like her.\n\nI finished four of the five routes (mostly on an old steam account...long story), and felt sort of “meh” about them overall. I know everyone’s got their opinions on whose story/personality/ending was better (and I do, too), but I felt like all of them were pretty superficial and left a fair amount unexplained and unresolved. The daily stats building was tedious, especially after the first playthrough. And some of the typos/mistakes were distracting. I can handle typo or translation issues here or there—but there were mix ups with the characters names.\n\nI won’t even comment on the aspects of the stories that I found problematic (because I’m sure some of this is cultural and/or personal). I will, however, say that I typically can overlook some of these things and still have an enjoyable game experience. I wanted to like this game. I tried. But, in the end, the stories and characters (which is what I play for), just aren’t worth it—especially not with a $20+ pricetag.","June 7, 2015","false","3.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Each character has a unique and interesting personality, as well as a well developed back story. Not to mention, the story itself is really interesting.\n\nAs far as replayability goes, this is a game that is easily replayed over and over. Each path has it's own collection of cutscenes, so it keeps the story fresh and there is a skip option so you can speed through scenes you've already seen. So far, I've completed the game twice with two different paths and I'm still excited to play again. This game is full of feels too.\n\nMechanically, it plays well too. The inclusion of a quick save button is helpful in making sure you achieve the interactions and results that you're striving for. But there's also plenty of room to explore the details of the game so you can learn the best way to get what you want. Since most paths have both a good and bad ending, if you mess up, it's not a big deal. You can just replay and go for a different ending.\n\nSome of the English translation is a little rough sometimes, but it's still understandable and doesn't take away from the quality of the game. Plus, the characters all have a voice actor that can be turned on or off - granted, they say the lines in Korean, but I think it's a nice touch to hear the emotion behind the lines. There's also a nice inclusion of CG and artwork for the different characters that you can look at and a couple that you can unlock for each character.\n\nAll in all, this is a wonderful game and I definitely recommend checking it out.","October 25, 2014","true","123.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitKat168/recommended/321290/","KitKat168","KitKat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitKat168/","10 products in account","Dandelion is one of the best Otome games I have played. In essence, one day you found a bsaket of bunnies and cats in your room and decided to look after them, only to realised that they can turn into more human forms and they were all here as participants of a 'game'.\n\nWhat makes Dandelion really shine, in my opinion, is the story. It is not one of those shallow sim dating game where there is no content- Dandelion is extremely story rich and you get more and more questions as you play along: why the hell these boys appear from nowehere, what is the 'game' that they constantly talk about, etc. Then when you get the ending of your first character, BOOM! You see the person who is behind all this and all I can say is RAGE!!! Once you have got all the good endings for the characters, BOOM! Everything comes together - it even explains the fact that why as players, we got to go through all the different characters - MIND-BLOWN! Plus RAGE as you just hate the secret character for putting everyone through the game!!! :P\n\nAside from the story, the art is amazing. The CGs are so beautiful!!! All the characters have distinctive personalities so you are bound to find one that you like! The voice acting is super professional and you can tell that the voice actors put a lot of thought into the characters and the story so they can say the lines with great emtions... I also enjoy the opening song together with the visuals - looks just like an opening for an anime, extremely professional and well made.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, having played all the good and bad endings for all the characters. One thing to note is that if you are looking for some cheesy 'happily ever after' endings, sorry, you won't get them here. When I first got the endings, I was gutted that they weren't true happy endings but after a while, I appreciated the fact that Cheritz has decided to do so as it is a very bold move. The endings were all sort of open ended but I mean come on, it is just life, isn't it? In a way it leaves you room for imagination as well.\n\nNow the characters, they all look great and a lot of thought have been put into the character development. At first glance I really like the black cat but his pocessive nature really puts me off a bit (some girls like that so fair enough). Also I will warn you if he is your favourite, you might want to avoid his bad ending as it is dark, REAL DARK. I actually ended up having the tiny white rabbit as my favourite as I played more. At first he seems too young but his character development, together with the fact that he was the only one to KICK THE SECRET CHARACTER'S ♥♥♥ puts him my number one!!! I MEAN GO JIEUN, YOU MIGHT LOOK SMALL AND HARMLESS BUT YOU ARE AWESOME!!! If you don't understand what I mean, apologies as it is hard to explain the plot without spoilers but basically, he is the only one with a proper real good ending if that helps :)\n\nThe thing that really disappoints me is the english translation - mistakes every now and then. Dandelion is definitely my favourite of the two Cheritz games because of the clever plot of linking all the stories together. It might seem expensive but it is totally worth it. If you are looking for otome with a story rich element and amazing characters, seek no further.","January 20, 2015","true","42.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancandles/recommended/321290/","rancandles","RanCandles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancandles/","61 products in account","Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - is a stats-raising visual novel/point-and-click romance game that is, at its core, the story of Heejung, a 21-year-old university student in her last year, who feels like she has no direction in her life, suffers from low self-worth and thinks that she can amount to no more than being a failure. It's also a story about how she changes for the better after having five pets thrown into her lap out of nowhere and deciding to adopt them. It's also about the strange origin of said five pets (three rabbits and two cats) and the mysterious pact they made with an individual known as The Wizard to win a "game" he's arranged them to play that involves Heejung's unwitting participation...\n\nAnd, of course, it's a story in which the player, depending on whose affection they raise the most, can help Heejung develop a romantic relationship with one of her five pets after they turn human.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The way Dandelion is structured is that each love interest has a route and their own plot, meaning that each character has different conditions needed to get their official good ending. The similarities between these routes is that they all need to have their affection maxed out (get all of their hearts!), their necessary stats need to reach a specific level before the end of the game and the player needs to collect 30 stamps of the character they're pursuing. There are five stats to keep an eye on in all: Femininity, Beauty, Art Skill, Stress and Pressure. The first three cap at level 20, whereas the last two you will want to make sure the gauge never fills up else you will end up with a non-standard game over. In addition to these, there is also the heart gauge that once filled allows you to unlock new actions or to diminish the effects of stress or pressure.\n\nStats can be raised by performing an action, such as watching the education channel by clicking the TV in the living room to lower pressure and raise art, or by going out with a character and choosing to not look around. You can go out with a character in both their pet and human form during the weekend or you can choose to go to work (and receive $40) or stay home. Choosing to go out during a weekday gives the options of shopping at either the item shop or bookstore or to go to work (for $10). Keeping an eye on Heejung's wallet is important since the items or books that can be bought can be used to either boost her stats (or diminish the effects of stress and pressure) or be given as gifts to the character the player is pursuing. Each character has different preferences for gifts so keep an eye out for that!\n\n*A word of advice!* Prioritize buying the eye medicine, which costs 200$. This is important since it allows the player to have more luck in finding useful items during the Look Around option during dates, which means better odds of finding stamps, stat-raising items or gifts.\n\nWhich leads me to detailing the specifics of dates! By choosing to go out with a love interest during the weekend, Heejung will get the option between choosing a stat raising action at the location of choice or of looking around. This is a fun little activity where you will be offered a bunch of random objects littered all over the background and you get to pick up three of them! Alternatively, you can quit the "investigation" at any time. Either way, the date ends and the game moves on to the next day.\n\nFinally, there's raising a love interest's affection. This can be done either by taking them on dates, as explained above, or by finding them somewhere in the house and choosing the action where they're hanging around and successfully performing an action they enjoy. (For example, Jisoo frequently hangs around the fridge.) Gifts can only be given to a love interest after they turn human. An affection-raising action has been successfully performed if a yellow or pink heart appears; blue hearts or the spikey black circle signify a failed action and WILL reduce affection points.\n\n***QUICK-SAVE BEFORE TRYING TO RAISE AFFECTIONS OR LOOKING AROUND DURING DATES*** There is no penalty for quick-loading several times and it will save you a lot of grief! You have about an in-game year to work on stats, so no need to stress, but better not to waste chances!\n\nBut enough about gameplay! LET US DISCUSS PLOT, PROTAGONIST AND LOVE INTERESTS.\n\nAs mentioned before, the game is told through Heejung's eyes as she struggles to get good grades in university for a job she doesn't want for a future she has no clear vision of. She's rather depressed and is questioning why she's working so hard for something she doesn't find rewarding, when one night, a mysterious individual bestows upon her the gift of suddenly finding herself to be a pet owner of three rabbits and two cats. Needless to say, when she wakes up to find a basket filled with five strange animals in her room, she initially freaks out, but over the course of the day (and week) she decides to take care of them, and afterwards becomes incredibly grateful for their presence in her life.\n\nHeejung, in my opinion, is a huge success of a protagonist. She's incredibly relatable, especially in this day and age when our generation is struggling to find work and pay and meaning in our lives. It's incredibly up-lifting to see Heejung change from being monotone and hopeless to finding time to sit back and relax and enjoy the world around her, not to mention it gives you a warm, happy feeling to see her getting attached to her newfound family. Her backstory is also incredibly real for many of us, and though I won't spoil it, I think that helps give players someone tangible to connect with.\n\nThat, and it's nice to not play a high school student for once, especially when you've graduated a while back already and are struggling with the realities and responsibilities of Being An Adult.\n\nThe five love interests that the player can have Heejung hook up with are as follow: Jisoo, the black cat; Jiyeon, the orange cat; Jihae, the silver rabbit; Jieun, the small white rabbit; and Jiwoo, the spotted rabbit. They all have their own personalities and struggles to deal with (all of them heavy in spoilers so I won't go in detail here), each with their own appeals and possible deal breakers.\n\nJisoo, for example, is always looking out for Heejung and cares deeply about her well-being, but he's also the jealous and possessive type. Jiyeon is sweet and caring but his particular deal-breaker is a spoiler, so I'll just advise people to be careful with that one, cute though his ears may be. Jiwoo is hilarious because he reads romance novels seriously and is also just an all around hilariously arrogant and superior-than-thou type of guy, but those exact same traits might not cut it for others who aren't impressed with people who act like a jerkwad towards the protagonist. (To be clear, Jiwoo is a tsundere: Harsh on the outside, sweet and loving on the inside. It requires work to reach that soft side to him, but for many it may be more than worth it. Or not.) Jihae is nothing if not polite and courteous and forever attentionate towards Heejung, but he might also come off as boring and flat. And finally, Jieun is PRECIOUS CUTIEPIE LITTLE BABY RABBIT LET ME PET YOUR HEAD, but, uh, he's. Kind of young. His route is pretty PG, though, but that might still break it for many.\n\nAll in all, each route adds more to the story and reveals aspects of their origin as the story progresses, making it worthwhile to play every route to gain access to the true ending. The bad endings are also worth gunning for, if only to complete the gallery and memory in the extras, but I suggest playing them last.\n\nDandelion is a fascinating story that probably hits close to home for many with supernatural elements thrown in. I strongly suggest it for anyone who likes good plots, quirky but believable characters and a realistic portrayal of how stressful but varied life and relationships can be.","October 27, 2014","true","53.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It looks like your typical shoujo reverse harem otome game, which it is to some extent. The plot, however, is outstanding with a slice of life genre.\n\nLet's start with the heroine. Heejung is your typical college student who is struggling to keep up with society and her family's pressure to be constantly perfect (good grades, looks, and social life), even though she is still not aware what she really wants to do with her life. It also doesn't help that her family is quite dysfunctional and somewhat a bit emotionally abusive to her.\n\nHer bleak and stressful life takes a turn, however, when one day, she wakes up to find these animals in a basket beside her bed.\n\nFirst part of the game is spent raising your affection to the animal you will potentially romance later on. Yes, I said animal. Don't worry, they will turn into humans (or part-humans?) later on in the game. You get to pick one guy out of five: Jihae (the prettiest one), Jisoo (the bad boy type), Jiwoo (tsundere), Jiyeon (cutesy type), and Jieun (the quiet type). You are able to raise your affection on multiple guys but if you’ve played otome games before, surely you’re aware what happens when you do that. For the remainder of the game, you focus on raising your stats and affection for the guy you choose in order to get the good(?) ending.\n\nThe game itself remains sweet, cute, and innocent but deals with a lot of real life (and relatable) issues. You grow attached to the characters and the character development is splendidly done well. It does, however, take for a somewhat darker tone later on in the game that will GUARANTEE to make you cry and maybe break your heart into tiny pieces (I know mine did).\n\nThe stat-raising game does get repetitive and tiring (like Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side) and may discourage some people from playing it for that reason. There are also a few spelling and grammar mistakes but easily forgiven for the well-written storytelling and voice acting (and yes, FULLY voiced). The voice acting delivers the characters' personality and emotions well. The music is beautiful and so is the art.\n\nIt's definitely a must play for otome gamers. If you want to go for a ride on the emotional roller coaster, this is your game. Also, Jiwoo’s paws are cute and YOU MUST PLAY HIS ROUTE.\n\nDandelion ~ Wishes Brought to You ~ gets a 9.5/10 from me and I'd like to applaud Cheritz for a wonderfully presented game.","October 5, 2014","true","5.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You play as Heejung, a college student who's dissatisfied with her daily routine and is trying to find her place in life. This routine is completely disrupted when two cats and three rabbits are mysteriously left in her home. Heejung slowly warms up to her new pets, who make her happy for the first time a long while. But lo and behold, Heejung is shocked to come home one day to find her pets have turned into humans! On top of their strange transformation, Heejung keep hearing mention of a "game" set up by an enigmatic Wizard. Who will be the winner?\n\nHeejung, the heroine of the game, is one of the standout characters of this game.

You play as Heejung, a college student who's dissatisfied with her daily routine and is trying to find her place in life. This routine is completely disrupted when two cats and three rabbits are mysteriously left in her home. Heejung slowly warms up to her new pets, who make her happy for the first time a long while. But lo and behold, Heejung is shocked to come home one day to find her pets have turned into humans! On top of their strange transformation, Heejung keep hearing mention of a "game" set up by an enigmatic Wizard.

This is my first time putting together a review, so bear with me.  I'll be dividing this post into 5 sections:  Plot, Individual Characters, Technical Features/Gameplay, Sound, and Art.  This will be a spoiler-free review.  If anyone wishes for my thoughts with spoilers on anyone else, I’d be happy to post that as well.\n\n\nPLOT\nThe overall plot is simply amazing.  I have to admit, I was preparing myself to be thrown into a ball of stereotypes and other redundant plot devices & themes.  Fortunately though, there are a bunch of surprises and twists, and the game does a good job of making use of the cliches it has, while avoiding many others.  Don’t let these lovely, cute-looking pets in the beginning of the game fool you - you’re in for some pain.\n\nINDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS\nJiyeon:  Unfortunately, his route felt incredibly short (due to plot reasons), and because of this, I did not have the desired period of time to become attached to his character.  Not only that, but many of his actions weren’t really...appealing.  At all.  Overall, I felt he was the person who should least be with Heejung.\n\nJieun:  I liked Jieun more than I thought I would.  At first, I had thought his plot was going down a cliche path, but it diverted from such and I’m very happy it did so.  The story in this route was unique, and there’s much more to him than meets the eye.  There was plenty of surprises for me, especially since I did this route before Jihae’s.  He goes though most character development, hands down.  As you might’ve guessed, you get to learn plenty about Jihae as well, which is why I actually suggest doing Jihae before Jieun if you would like to be surprised about his backstory.  Out of everyone, I felt that he was the healthiest for Heejung.\n\nJisoo:  I expected to love this gluttonous dork.  Surprisingly...he was in the middle for me, due to a quality of his that you’ll run into...that isn’t healthy.  What I like about his path the most though, is that I feel that Heejung's own path in life was most recognized here, and she probably had the most personal growth here.  His route felt much longer than the others, with my personal favorite set of CG’s (besides the Wizard’s of course) in the game.  It also had some great, unexpected twists, so it was definitely a good route nonetheless, just not the best.  His ending was definitely top-notch though.  I feel that out of everyone, Jisoo had the largest motivation for winning the game.  My big tip for his route is that femininity does not matter nearly as much as your art skill and beauty, so definitely focus on raising those two up the most.\n\nJiwoo:  Being the biggest dork you encounter, this dude is hilarious.  It’s definitely a good route to play right in the middle of all the heaviness of the game.  This route had to be my personal favorite, and this ending was the only one that had me absolutely bawling.\n\nJihae: First and foremost, if you want to be surprised by his backstory, do not play Jieun’s route first.  Jieun’s route will reveal a lot about Jihae, so I recommend playing Jihae’s route before Jieun’s.  With that being said, this route was good.  Although I felt Heejung's comments about how beautiful he is and etc., quite redundant, eventually I got used to it because hey - he IS pretty hot.  He probably had some of the most beautiful CG’s as well.\n\nWizard:  I love this guy.  He’s just so interesting.  There’s really not much to say without completely spoiling his character, but personal story was probably my favorite - you won’t be disappointed.\n\nHeejung:  The heroine is actually my favorite part of this game.  I feel that anyone that has ever attended school, basically almost everyone, can relate to her - myself included.  The feeling of loneliness, of wanting to change, or the desire to know what it is you want to do in life, many of us have such wishes.  Especially the feeling of having to satisfy everyone else, forgetting you, yourself in the process.  In addition, her reactions to her situation, I believe, are realistic.  I could write an entire essay on how much I love her character.\n\nMy recommended play order for each character would be Jiyeon > Jisoo > Jiwoo > Jihae > Jieun.  Although many people recommend doing Jieun first to get used to the gameplay mechanics, I believe that if you’re looking for gradual plot progression, his route is fantastic to leave last.\nMy personal rankings for each route are Jiyeon <<<<< Jisoo <<< Jihae < Jieun < Jiwoo.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FEATURES/GAMEPLAY:\nFirst and foremost, I must mention the sprites.  I personally love how their mouths move, and how they actually blink.  Just small tidbits like this bring much more life to each character.  In addition, other little things such as the dandelions floating around the title screen, the leaves during fall, snowflakes during winter, etc. were all beautiful as well.  Secondly, I'd like to address the stat-raising aspect.  While it's cute and fun at first, it quickly becomes quite redundant.  Had it not been so repetitive, it would have been much more enjoyable.  It almost feels as if stat-raising takes up more of a route than the actual plot.  Other then that, the gameplay is pretty much standard visual novel gameplay - simply clicking.\nThe game possesses all the basic features you’d expect:  Auto, skip, CG gallery, etc.  In addition, (and I loved this) the game features a special section where you can use the stamps you find on the routes to unlock bonus art - basically some concept art of the character, and an image of them (presumably after each ending) as their future self, whether it be human or not.  I HIGHLY recommend you try and unlock these, as they are simply stunning.  AN IMPORTANT THING YOU MUST KNOW (that I sadly didn’t ;-;) is that every time you start a new route, you must start a new game, or else your stamps will not be there by the time you finished the route.  I’m one of those people that likes to make a save file right before the first choice (while you’re on the common route) and go from there for each route, but unfortunately if you want your stamps, don’t make the same mistake as me.  Another tip I’d like to add is that if you’re interested in looking for stamps, work EVERY weekend until you reach at least $1200, then buy at least 6 visual improvement medications, to get increased eyesight out of the way - trust me, if you don’t want to flip over a table, you’ll increase your eyesight to at least 8 so you don’t have keep quick-saving and loading on a date to find stamps.\n\n\nSOUND\nThe voice acting is wonderful, what else can I say?  And while most side characters wouldn't get voices or sprites, Cheritz put in the extra effort to include them as well - Heejung’s mom, Heejae, etc.  Even Heejung has a voice, and it’s rare for heroine’s to be voiced as well.  Extra props to Jiyeon’s voice actor, you’ll know why.\n\n\nART\nThe art in this game is simply gorgeous.  I think I stared at the title screen for a few solid minutes when I first purchased the game.  The chibi’s during the stat-raising activities are adorable.  The vibrant colors fit the hopeful, cheery atmosphere the game possesses.  In addition, the garments for each character are designed in amazing detail, respective to each of their positions in the society back in their world.  For example, while Jihae's clothing may appear fancy enough that he could be mistaken as a noble like Jiwoo, that is not the case:  The colors are more diluted, and it's much less bejeweled in comparison.  It is not too difficult to find a visual novel with good sprites, but most of the time, the CGs are disproportionate.  That is not the case with Dandelion.  Funnily enough, it's CGs are actually higher in quality overall, compared to its successor, Nameless, which had some wonky-looking images (beautiful but occasionally disproportionate).","October 25, 2014","true","19.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I had originally bought this game through the publisher's website, a very long time ago. And played a good 12+ hours of this game. Its a game that is so fascinating , amazing it is  truely hard to put down. Everything about it, just captivates the player, I've played all the routes, and I have cried too many tears, and laughed so many times while playing this game. I even fell so much in love with it, to the point I even started Cosplaying from it. I could relate with the heroine. Without giving away spoilers, she is so down to earth, and is facing the same challenges that us students face all the time. Which is why it is so easy to relate to her, to the point that in moments of scenes between the love interest and her, you belive for a moment that you are the one expierencing it.\nBy far one of the most amazing games I have ever played. Now that its on Steam , I can't wait to start it all over again, and get all the endings for each route.

The story was fine, if somewhat predictable, the art is great, and the character arcs were... mediocre. And two of the five characters immediately set off red flags.\n\nJiyeon ends up becoming verbally abusive in an attempt to push the Heejung away, when the whole reason he and the the others are there is to SPOILER win her heart. It wasn't even because he realised how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that was, no it was because 'everyone i've ever known gets hurt because of me'. Classic man pain. And then he becomes PHYSICALLY abusive pinning her to the wall and forcefully kissing her. Which is sexual assault.\n\nJiwoo is also the same, except he's an ♥♥♥ from the get go. And he never gets called out on it, it's just like 'oh classic Jiwoo'.\n\nAnd then there's Jisoo, who gets way overprotective and controlling and starts STALKING HER. Creepy. And that's never shown in a negative light, because apparently it's romantic??? No. And considering the Heejung's story arc, his actions are even worse, since apparently it's okay to be controlling if you're a guy.\n\nThe wizard was the most compelling character IMO. He's shrouded in mystery, and while his dialouge is classic villain drabble, it's entertaining and his motives are unclear. Why is he so fixated on Heejung? What is his relation with her?\n\nAnd speaking of the Heejung, she's well written, for a dating sim protag anyway. She has a great character arc, which is relatable, more so for those who grew up in Korea I would think, but still powerful and very courageous as leaving an abusive controlling person is very hard. But even still, like most DS protags she's boring and passive, except for the rare moments where she does take charge. Though that is to be expected.\n\nMaybe i'm just used to Bioware quality romances, but i don't think this game is worth the full price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/musthugallcats/recommended/321290/","musthugallcats","Must Hug All Cats","http://steamcommunity.com/id/musthugallcats/","71 products in account","Dandelion is a visual novel in which you control a female protagonist, Heejung, and build stats to pursue one of five men, each of whom sport adorable cat or rabbit ears. The premise revolves around two cats and three rabbits mysteriously being brought into the protagonist's home, then taking on a human form. How did they find their way into Heejung's home? What is the "game" they keep talking about, and what is Heejung's role in it? These questions are answered throughout the game's multiple routes, encouraging replays until all are completed and all of the story's pieces come together.\n\nHeejung is a very likeable and relateable protagonist. Unlike the majority of dating sim protagonists, who lack personality and backstory for the sake of "immersion," Heejung has a life and personality all her own. Watching Heejung handle her conflicts, such as an overbearing mother and her uncertainty of what to do with her future, makes her an enjoyable and relateable character.\n\nDandelion's dateable candidates offer a variety of personalities and backstories. They all feature a level of complexity that can only be experienced by playing their route. Their diverse plots and reasonings for participating in the "game" results in wanting to know these characters beyond their initial introductions. The stories pull at your heart, with just the right amount of silliness sprinkled in with the sincerity. Each route is a fair length, and the voice acting is stellar, bringing life to each of the characters in conjunction with their bright, animated portraits.\n\nGameplay is simple point-and-click, doing various activities to raise your stats, and interacting with the men to boost their affinity for you. The Stats menu lets you know if your stats are high enough to keep going down the character's good route, and you are given ample time to raise them, making playthroughs fairly straightforward.\n\nFeatures such as Auto, Skip, and Quick Save/Load make replaying the game for different routes convenient. Once you have viewed a specific scene, it becomes available for re-viewing in the Memory menu, making revisiting a previously-finished character's route hassle-free.\n\nUltimately, Dandelion is a touching, memorable experience. The characters are all unique, interesting, and multi-facetd, with appealing designs and engrossing stories. Fun, emotional, and heartwarming, I highly recommend this title to any fan of the otome genre.","October 23, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The art is also gorgeous and the music is enjoyable as well. The stories for each of the guys are also nice and I enjoyed the events that happened around the apartment as time passed and Heejung interacted with the guys.\n\nThis is a stat raising game so you have to make the right choices for the guy you're going after in order to raise affection points, which can become tedious for some people. The interactions between Heejung and each boy are very amusing and heartwarming though, so try different things out, some actions might be more worthwhile than others though.\n\nThe themes of abandonment and then about coping with it afterwards are very nicely addressed in this games story. While we may not all have magical animals suddenly turning up in our real lives, it is still soothing to be able too follow and help Heejung through her struggles.\n\nI also really like that there is bonus unlockable content, the extras are really nice~\n\n","October 4, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A million times yes! This is definitely worth the price if you're willing to splurge a little on a dating sim/otome game.\n\nCharacters and Story: 9.5/10\nThe personalities of each character as well as their corresponding backstories touched me deeply and made me cry every time. Jisoo and Jieun's especially. Story is tied into my rating for the characters because they are practically inseparable. The stories paired up with the personalities of the cast clearly define who they are and turn them into a wonderful group of characters that you grow incredibly attached to. Heejung's backstory is painfully relateable to the point that you just naturally sympathize or empathize with her. Each one of the guys also has a way of making their way into your heart as you try to understand and comfort them through the player character, Heejung. Those 29 hours were very much well spent considering how the range of emotions I went through as I played through each story. If I could go into detail about how I felt about each story individually, then we'd be here forever (and you'd have the whole game spoiled for you). My only problem in this section would just be very minor translation mistakes. It's played upon quite a bit for Jiyeon, but at times, the mistakes are a little obvious and out of place (especially at times where there is a tiny inconsistency with the name being said and the name being read). Fortunately, they don't badly interfere with the storyline, so I have no complaints.\n\nMusic+Voice Acting: 9.5/10\nOnce again, the soundtrack for this game is amazing and calming as well. It helped me relax during this stressful time (since I was in the middle of midterms not too long ago) and I truly wish I could get the soundtrack if it were being sold. Also, my reasoning for giving this a 9.5 would simply be due to the fact that the drastic changes between an intense situation and a regular day were a bit too quick for me. It's not exactly bad, but I guess I didn't have time to calm my heart after crying for a little while. I do like that the music fit the situations in the storyline very nicely though which truly added to the experience. As for the voice acting, I may not know much Korean (other than stuff from manhwa and K-pop which isn't a lot obviously), but I loved that the message, despite being in a completely different language, was still getting through. There is so much heart in their voices that it almost felt like you were Heejung and the guys were all talking to you.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10\nDefinitely buy this if you have the money. You won't be disappointed in the least. There is a bit of stat raising which can be tedious at times (as they are in many otome games/dating sims), but the effort put into it goes a long way once you get to truly delve into this beautiful piece of work. Will I continue to play this after finishing the game? I already am. If you have the time (since this does take a good 3-4 hours per route not counting the common route bad ending) and the money, I suggest you buy this game if it interests you even the tiniest bit. You will not be sorry.\n\nOh. But on the downside, internet connection is a must. Be careful playing this in places with unstable wifi (like I did).","October 27, 2014","true","34.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First, I’m just going to say this game is not worth $30.\n\nTranslation: I bought the game knowing there were translation issues but I can't recommend something that cost money and is not properly spell checked.\n\nVisuals: are mediocre. The stills are decent and I've seen worse but I've definitely seen better.\n\nCharacters: Heejung is very relatable and I like her as the female character. The guys are the typical stereotypes but they’re likeable.\n\nMusic: is forgetful and gets a bit grating at times; especially in between events when your finger starts burning from clicking so much during stat raising.\n\nStat mechanic: This is what killed the game for me. It’s the first otome game that I’ve played which used this mechanic and it’s a monotonous chore. I’ve learned that I absolutely hate it. It took me 16 hrs. to do my first route which was with Jisoo. I had to restart 3 times because of stat mismanagement. You have to save and reload constantly and pray the RNG gods give you the item or character placement you need.\n\nMy main problem with grindy stat raising is when the story finally progressed, any attachment I might have started forming with the guy character was gone.\n\nThe story itself had too much repeated dialogue. The only variations in each new playthrough were in bite sized sections which came with each new guy. And like I said, by the time those finally rolled around I no longer had any emotional attachment to their individual stories.","May 27, 2015","false","30.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I think I just tried to justified somehow the amount of money that I spend on this game. Either way, I finished all the routes and the gain all the extras and pretty much did everything there was to be done. And...\n\nIt's not good. Really. Not for this price, that's for sure.\n\nPros:\n+ game length\n+ very beautiful graphic\n+ a bit weird, but still original idea\n+ extras: CG gallery, additional scenes, unlockables\n\nCons:\n- to high price for quality\n- this story has potential, but wasn't executed well\n- stat raising (which I usually enjoy in games) gets boring really quickly\n- not enough plot related scenes\n- protagonist is awful\n- music isn't good at all - usually it doesn't fit the atmosphere of scenes\n- low resolution.\n\nAt first I decided to recommend this game, since I came to conclusion that they aren't that many visual novels/dating sims out there, but after playing their second game, I change my mind.\n\nA little bit of spoiler here:\n\nProtagonist - boring as hell. Very schematic. There is absolutely nothing interesting about her. She's portrayed as classic shy, not-speaking-much girl, but really, this is all there is to her. Nothing behind the curtain. Nothing to discover. Not even a bit of charisma. And don't get me wrong, I don't mind shy and calm characters, I'm like this myself, but "shy and calm" doesn't mean boring. Och, and stupid. Yeah, I'm sorry, but Heejung is just plainly dumb and she act like she doesn't have a free will. She allows the boys to do whatever they want. And she acts like a victim. Always. And her story does not really give her a good reasons to. I mean, sure, she has very hard situation with her mother, that doesn't really love her, have high expectations etc., but she lives alone, she has all the possibilities and at some point, she also have help of her new... animals *cough*. There are far worse things that can happens and people deal with it. I wouldn't even mention it, but it's important for explanation why she became someone's fascination.\n\n♥♥♥♥oo - I felt like he supposed to be "main" love interest for protagonist, since he had very expanded path and he was often pretty important character on other paths. Very annoying. Jealous type, who basically always find a reason to justify his completely unjustified actions. This type of man, who make jealous scenes in the middle of the street and he isn't even yet with the girl! Does not acknowledge the fact, that friend is just a friend.\n\nJihae - silent and shy, typical knight on the white horse, but he was quite interesting.\n\nJiwoo - Always repeat that main character is stupid - and how painfully right he is. This is the most interesting path, because it's the only one, where protagonist actually make a move herself and does not act like she need to be guided every step of the way.\n\nJiyeon - character with a "twist", but not very interesting and not very well executed one. Selfish and rude, with him Heejung seems like even bigger victim than usual.\n\nJieun - weird. Just... weird.\n\nAnd as for the secret character... It's really hard to imagine why he was interested in Heejung, considering everything I've written about her so far.","February 17, 2015","false","17.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The stats mechanics were annoying at times, when I just wanted to sit down and read the story. I didn't wanna worry about how much "beauty" my character had. Perhaps it was because I had just finished Amnesia, so I expected something similar. Anyway~ On to the good points.\n\nJisoo's route was love, I recommend it for the end (if you don't like when guys get jealous, you have been warned).\nJihae's route, he's too sweet and precious for this world.\nJiwoo's route..he's a tsundere, so be warned. Hahaha.\nJiyeon's route....I can't even hide my dissapointment for this one, left a sour taste in my mouth. I hated it!\nJieun's route, he was literally 16!!

How did that happen?\nWho are these animals who occasionally seem to talk between themselves?\nWhy do the animals you've taken care of as pets instead of sending to a shelter despite your stressful life suddenly transform to handsome men later on, but can't explain anything about this insanity?\n\nIn order to find out, and in order to progress the story enough to reveal their humanforms and further, you as the player need to take action! You start out with 5 adoreable pets(2 Cats and 3 Rabbits). Even though they change from pets to a bunch of dudes(with animal ears), Heejung decides to let them stay on the condition that they wear hats or hoodies to hide their ears when necessary.\nBuild up relationship points by interacting with them in your apartment, and occasionally by bringing them out for walks/dates. How you respond to events also affects your relationships, and the status of Heejung herself ofcourse.\n\nYour adoreable pets are as follows;\n\n*Jihae - The Silver Rabbit\nThe beautiful, princely and mature one of the bunch, Heejung and Jihae seem to share an interest in art.\nHe takes much care and responsibilty over Jihae and is stunning enough to be a model.\n\n*Jieun - The Pure White Rabbit\nThe (shouta)youngest of the bunch, a quiet, gentle and closest to (Eddie..)Jihae.\nHe loves apples to the point of being addicted and doesn't talk much at first, being very thoughtful.\n\n*Jiwoo - The Spotted(Cow) Rabbit\nFrom the start he isn't the most social one of the bunch, nor the politest one.\nHe is however perhaps the most intellectual one! Stuck-up and rude, but smart rabbit. Can you say Tsundere!\n\n*Jisoo - The Black Cat\nThe badboy if you will. He seems rough at first, but clearly has a soft spot for food!\nHe also likes to tease Heejung, but doesn't mean any harm. Just being a playful cat afterall...\n\n*Jiyeon - The Orange Cat\nThe adoreable sweetheart of the bunch, rarely seen without a big smile on his face.\nHe seems very pure and childish at first and even makes several small language mistakes.\nA charming heartbreaker!\n\nTry not to let stress or pressure take over completly, or you might end up collapsing like a squished pudding with Heejae, your classmate. He seems sweet and is certainly caring for you, but is sadly your BAD ENDING!\nSo focus that doki doki on your pets! (wow, that sounds slightly wrong..)\n\nYou'll quickly learn how quick save/load is your best friend through gameplay while balancing stress, pressure and raising ceratin stats for certain characters. Whenever you need to check your staus, wallet, items(some can raise stats) and relationship progress, just right click and well.. click status on the menu!\n\nOnce you progress through the story it's easy to fall inlove with the personalities of the characters, the CG artwork is neat and sets the mood, and learning their stories I find myself wanting to play more and more and get to know each character. My personal favourite so far is without a doubt Jihae, but that might quickly change within the other routes as I've been focusing on this rare silver rabbitman's route.\nI enjoy seeing how the story progresses in a steady pace of growing feelings from being awkward at first to eventually blooming a romance to adoreable CG artwork.\nAs for music, my opinion is mixed. Some of the looping music became quite annoying which made me hope for more variation(to my relief that the next season change had another loop), but some of the bgm was very enjoyable.\nI think music-wise it is more of a preference thing. However, the User Interface was absolutely to my taste!\nWell organized, easy and very practical to the game (quick save/load, how I love it!)\n\nAll in all I'd say Dandelion is absolutely a game worth playing if you enjoy rich stories with colourful characters, and the fate of the protagonist lying in your hands!

The voice actors just try so hard to make the player feel for the characters.\n\nSome of the characters good routes are still borderline abusive with how they treat the heroine, but nothing gory.\n\nCharming graphics, but major under use of CGs for such a long game.","June 4, 2015","true","129.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game was released in South Korea in August 2012 and was released in the US in August 2012. The game was released on Steam  on September 29, 2014.\n\nThe game revolves around Heejung, a Korean college student majoring in business with a penchant for art. One day, she wakes up to discover a basket of animals in her room: two cats and three rabbits. Heejung eventually adopts the animals as her own, only to discover that the would-be animals actually have human forms. Moreover, they're actually from another world entirely.\n\nDISCLAIMER: While I have beaten the good routes for all of the characters, I have not yet played through the bad routes. I'm sure I'll play through them eventually, and will amend my review accordingly if needed.\n\n\nThe protagonist:\n\nHeejung Kim, our leading lady, is an incredibly relatable character. Ever since her parents divorced, she has struggled to meet her mother's expectations. In doing so, Heejung has lost her sense of self. What does she want to do with her life? What kind of person does she want to be? As the game progresses, Heejung finds those answers.\n\nWhile the game does not explicitly call the relationship between Heejung and her mother abusive, the characters of Dandelion universally acknowledge that Heejung's mother's behavior is unacceptable. No one ever attempts to encourage Heejung to make amends with her mother; no one ever makes excuses for her mother's behavior (e.g., "she just wants the best for you!"), either. That definitely won brownie points with me.\n\nWhile Heejung's characterization is fairly consistent across all routes, there are some routes where her growth as a character is absolutely outstanding. If you like lots of character development in your protagonists, I highly recommend that you start with the Jieun route.\n\n\nThe love interests:\n\nBefore I bought the game, a friend warned me that the bunny routes were all much better than the cat routes. After clearing through all the good endings, I absolutely agree. The interaction between the bunny characters and Heejung were mostly positive; those relationships -- for the most part -- involved mutual support and care and respect.\n\nUnfortunately, the same can not be said for the cat routes.\n\nWhile the game did a fabulous job of addressing familial abuse, some of the romantic relationships on the game were abusive. While I don't plan on addressing those issues in every route, there is one love interest where the abuse is especially prevelant; that's the fan favorite, Jisoo's route.\n\nDuring his route, he does the following:\n\n-follows Heejung without her knowledge\n-tells Heejung she can't be friends with any other men\n-assumes that Heejung secretly has a boyfriend when he discovers Heejung crying about her mother and then retaliates by /pining her down/ and demanding to know why she lied to him about her relationship status\n-repeatedly drags Heejung off by the wrist and holds her down against her will/protests\n\nUnlike the relationship between Heejung and her mother, the game fails to acknowledge that this behavior is abusive; disappointingly, it's even romanticizied.\n\nAll of the bunny routes managed to make up for extremely unhealthy relationships that Heejae had with Jisoo and, to a lesser degree, Jiyeon. If you value healthy relationships, you'll enjoy any of the bunny routes.  If I had to recommend one, though, it'd definitely be Jihae's route.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nDandelion - Wishes brought to you - is your standard otome game. You play a female protagonist, you fall in love, and Things Happen. While the story itself doesn't bring anything new to the table, it's (most of) the characters, the character development, and the way the game thoughtfully and respectfully address familial abuse that make Dandelion a stand-out title for me. Highly recommended.\n\nFinal ranking: 4/5","November 6, 2014","true","25.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I figured it would be  a slapstic piece worth a few laughs. Pleasently mistaken, Dandelion offered an deeper underlying story that brought a more tought provoking level to an already enjoyable game.  The idea of having all the pathways sewn together in an overlying story arch is refreshing to say the least.\n\nThe game has faults in its own right. In order to reach the ending on a given pathway, you have to repeditivly raise stats and keep your stress level down. One of the characters, in my opinion, becomes too possessive and dangerous without any option to counteract the behavior.\n\nOther than that, a very enjoyable game. I spent many nights unable to pull away from my computer screen, wanting to see what happens next. If you like this, I highly suggest purchasing Cheritz's other game Nameless. They remove the leveling/stats aspect making the focus more on the story.","November 17, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The opening video is great and the song catchy. The art is consistent and delivers; I'm not crazy about the art style in itself, with funky legs and necks, but wow the bishonen was strong. The music used is okay. Few tracks stayed in my mind, but I always consider a non intrusive soundtrack a good thing. Voice acting is truly amazing!\n\nThere was no tutorial. There is no need for one, as I guess the only people who will play Dandelion are familiar with visual novels already, and there is a certain standard UI used in the genre. Nevertheless, I found out the player's inventory by accident. The location of it should have been mentioned, I think.\n\nThe statistics you need to raise are Art, Beauty and Femininity. Each love interest has different requirements that you need to meet in order to continue the relationship. Do activities to raise statistics. You will meet the love interests in the house, and have the possibility to interact with them to raise the relationship points. As you swirl around interacting with your boyfriend and practicing the housewife life, you also need to keep low Stress and Pressure.\n\nI saw a problem in the stats. In the writing as well, in certain routes.\nHeejung can only act within the walls of her house. Heejung has the function to save the male interest from his painful past. She is unaware of her feelings, unaware of her needs, incapable of relating personal experience to the same romantic clichés she criticizes when she reads Harlequin novels or goes to the movies. True, Heejung overcomes her fear, but she does not accomplishes it by herself. Her knight on a white horse does the talking to the source of her nightmares. She needs her prince to save her. (Notable exception is Jieun's route, which favorably impressed me!) We're in the 21st century, and although I don't expect my games to be full on progressive, I also don't expect them to be so backlash-ish in their treatment of female characters - especially when I'm supposed to identify with said female character.\n\n…but I still recommend the game. Highly recommend the game! The fangirl in me loved the cutesy bishonen romance, while the feminist in me sighed at the problematic elements in the writing and gameplay. If you're a fan of otome games, this is a must!","November 12, 2014","true","21.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At the beginning of the game, five men who before they come to you were of varying social status in their medieval-fantasy homeland end up as your roommates.  With their help you find your way in life.  Also you have to date one of them because this is that sort of game.\n\nBoth the personalities and the backstories in this game go very deep.  I kept getting surprised by each new side of a character I found.  There are even a decent number of unexpected but nicely foreshadowed twists.  Whenever I heard a conversation between the current path's love interest and another character, I found myself anticipating playing the other character's path so that I could find things out from his perspective.  Each new perspective turns out to be very worthwhile to learn (the plot of each path is completely different, and you learn a different facet of the shared backstory).\n\nAlso, the $30 pricetag seems kinda big, but it's totally worth it.  This game has a loooot of content.  There are five love interests, and within a given love interest's path, both the good (happy/bittersweet) ending and the bad ending (separate from just failing the relationship) have very different stories, depending on which one you're headed to.  As of writing this I've reached nearly three endings and have played over fifteen hours (and this includes skipping everything in the shared beginning part of the story).","February 12, 2015","true","17.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What else could you ask for?\n\nThis game offers fairly in-depth characters that actually develop as the story progresses. They're not just quickly drawn pretty boys, they have reasons for how they act and why. For men in animal ears, they're pretty realistic in terms of behaviour. (except falling for this clueless MC, ofc) The music is beautiful, art's well made. The GC's are quite breathtaking.\n\nThe game takes you along for an emotional ride, and you'll notice yourself getting attached to the characters. Each new playthrough with a new guy felt like a betrayal every time. Until I accepted the fact I just need to touch all of their butts or I won't be happy! The game play gets repetitive quite fast though, with the stat raising and waiting for the days to pass to get to the good parts. For a completionist like me, who needs to get all the bad endings, good endings and extras, after a couple playthroughs it's not that fun anymore. The character dialogue and GC's are deffo worth it though, and skip function for the heavy story parts ftw.\n\nThem speaking Korean caught me off guard first as it was the first time I ever heard the language, but you get used to it! So don't let that be the reason you'll miss out on this game. The voice acting is actually really good once you get used to the new language (although I admit, I still think they'd sound better in japanese) and their voices suit them well! It's worth the money, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in dating sims.","February 10, 2015","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is bittersweet and touching at the same time as I discovered the true ending behind the game. Each character also have their own story beautifully crafted and revealed across the time of interaction between the heroine and themselves.\n\nI personally love the story of Jihae, Jisoo, Jieun and also the true motive behind the game itself. While playing on Jihae's route, everything has been nothing but breathtaking. He truly cares and put everyone else before himself, even till the very end. On the other hand, Jisoo's route is a very touching one, especially after I realized his intention of participating in the game. For Jieun's route, there are some cute and fun moments with him which will pretty much make you think of apples all day long. I feel that his route is a bit more fantasy, especially for his ending. And lastly, the behind story summed up the whole game nicely and I wish there is more to what actually happened after all this! =D\n\nWhen one's obsession becomes a form of yearning, one's wish can eventually become a reality.\n\nFor the gameplay itself, I will say there is a wide variety of interaction and activities you can do in the game. The stats management system is a great addition to the game, and how it challenges the player to work around with it to fulfill the necessary requirements tailored to different characters. However, I believe it is quite easy to manage once you figure out the pattern. A great tip will be really to just focus on the relationship points + hearts first before you raise the stats as you progress as they will increase the requirement points, there will be plenty of time to do so, unless you keep doing those activites that only add a minimum amount. Taking bubble bath is a good way to increase both Feminine and Beauty and Sketching increase a huge amount of Art stat. And make sure you always watch the level of your stress and pressure.\n\nOverall, I really love Dandelion and its story. Thank you very much for this wonderful otome game! =)","January 11, 2015","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few problems with playing it. Mostly, it's just typos that throw me off on my reading when I play the game. The boys are amusing and you get attached to them very easily, which makes it saddening when you push the other animals away to spend more time for a play through. I wished that there were jealousy scenes in the game, otherwise the whole "wish" thing doesn't have the same amount of impact. It just seems like no one really cares enough about what they want and just spend their time fooling around.\n\nThe pacing of the story gave me problems, since I usually optimize my stats for the story, it makes the game feel rather slow  at some parts. But I suppose if someone were to just play, it would be fine as long as you don't attempt to play the game in one day, which I did. There is a lot of content to explore, so it is best to take your time and not burn yourself out.\n\nThe voice acting of the game gives a nice experiance.\n\nIt has a nice, long story that makes you want to explore the other character some more. So, for a dating sim, it's very successful in getting attachment to the fun times of having 5 guys in your apartment. But on a professional writing view, the characters are pretty two dimensional, the story has a lot of holes, the characters lack active goals, and the sheer fact that typos happen is shameful, but I still enjoyed it. The character problem isn't too bad, since they are way more fleshed out than a standard dating sim.\n\nI suggest that people buy it when it is on sale about 5 or 10 dollars cheaper. It's worth a 20 dollar experiance more than a 30. But if you can afford it, buy it! It's still an amazing experiance.","December 14, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wish there was a yellow "~" option along with the up and down votes.\n\nIf you like VNs and Dating Sims, and want to play a decent length game (8ish hours per line) with a lot of interesting types to choose from, then yes, it's a reccomend. We don't get nearly enough of these lengthy foreign titles, and I love to see more of this.\n\nIf you’re into chicks or just plain not up for a binge of cute, hot guys, then this title is not going to wow you.\n\nFinally... If you're also a fan of romance novels, or follow Hanako Games and enjoy the quality writing some local titles have to offer... then I suggest you keep reading.\n\n\n\nAll the characters in Dandelion are fully realized. They’re all typical “types,” bad boy, classy gentleman, dreamy prince, peppy neko ball, and tsundere, stuff that you can hear a couple lines from and say "yep. I like that one." The designs are excellent and enticing. They’re supposed to be otherworldly, and they certainly come off that way! And the situations they get into sometimes are hilarious! When all these personalities get together, the banter between them is quick and witty. I wish I could play the whole game with them playfully bickering.\n\nBut it’s strange. I wonder if I should bemoan the writing, or the translation. I’m not talking about the spelling errors here, I’m talking about the small, personal, and private moments. The moments where your heart is supposed to flutter, and your eyes are glued to the screen, on your gorgeous male moe blob as he finally comes in closer... and closer...!\n\nYeah. Those moments… fall soooooooooo flat in English.\n\nI’m trying to understand why… and I wonder, more than any other part of the game, is that a place that needs solid writing. Not just solid scenarios or solid characters. It’s a place where you breach into the sensual realm, of touch and smell. Where word choice is powerful. “He put his arm around me” is worlds away from “His arm slid around my shoulders, cupping me gently.”\n\nReaders of VN’s and Romance… People who have enjoyed games like Katawa Shojou, Royal Trap, and Magical Diary, or hell, the brief little tastes of Persona 3&4's romantic moments. you know what I’m talking about, right? There's a kind of writing that can make you melt into a gooey puddle of YES, even if the guy/gal isnt your prepackaged "type". There's some powerful stuff in Dandelion's plot that can reduce you to a quivering pile. But the smaller the scene, and the further from the main plot it is, the higher chance the entire moment will be ruined by the flat and simple text.\n\nBesides that, it’s easy to get knocked of the cute moeness by Bad Relationship Flags. Oh, it’s not a game mechanic. It’s occasional character moments that are played up as desirable or adorable, but in the real world are indicators of some SERIOUS bad juju, run from that relationship right now! The biggest problems I had were with "bad boy" Jisoo... I dont care what kind of situation you're in, man! Getting instant ragegasms for STANDING next to another guy is NOT. COOL.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid game with solid art, solid characters, solid scenarios… Pandery, cutesy moe pap, sure. But some serious story and writing flaws really get in the way of really enjoying that pap for all it could be.","December 15, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a visual novel with a lot of emotional pull. There is something about each of the routes you can play that will elicit some sort of emotion from you, and they're not always happy ones. This game will twist your heart into knots.\n\nTechnical Aspects - In the original non-Steam version, there were a few typos in the English subtitles, but nothing that hinders comprehension or gameplay. Saving and reloading is easy, the menu easy to navigate. There is also a 'skip read text' option for those who hate re-reading text found in multiple routes. You can tweak how fast the text appears on your screen, and how fast it auto scrolls for those that choose that option.\n\nGameplay - The stat raising you need to do for each route is a little confusing and monotonous, but there are plenty of handy guides online to help you figure out witch stats you need for which routes and how to raise them. Like this[otomesweetheart.tumblr.com], which tell you things like you need to worry about your art stat the most with Jisoo and such. There are 'Bad Endings' in some of the routes. Whether you try to get them for completionists sake is up to you, though if you can handle disturbing scenes in your games you should, if for no other reason than to get all the CG's and to have a peak into the characters darker sides.\n\nPersonal Rating  - 9/10: the monotanous stat raising and occasional typo detracts one star from an other wonderful game. =)","October 7, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I much more prefer dating sim games where you can make your own choices, build your own character instead of playing as one that already has a personality (if you can call it that) written in and overall have a story tailored especially for you AS you play the game. Don't get me wrong, the story is pretty good and the artwork is fabulous, but for me, it's just your standard grind love points to get the good ending. If that's what you like, then I totally recommend this game, though it is quite pricey. But, it does have a demo version you can try to see if it's something you'd enjoy. Though I try to stay away from games with prices like this, I can really understand that they had to pay the artist of the gorgeous artwork and the voice actors with something. And the music too. So don't judge by the price.

I watched Dodger and Cry play through one route and decided to buy the game once they took a break between their last route and their new route and I am so glad I did!\n\nBasic plot: You play as a girl who is bogged down in schoolwork and constantly overachieves in her studies since she believes it is her only staple of life and she doesn't really -live- or know how to live any other way besides getting the best grades to make her angry mother happy. She wakes up one day to a basket of cats and rabbits in her room and through interacting with them, she realizes just how hollow her life truly is. And then you date one of them.\n\nPros:\n+Interesting choices for dating partners in the animals.\n+Backstories for all characters are interesting.\n+Beautiful artwork.\n+Multiple routes to go down with each boy (some have bad endings)\n\nCons:\n-Some grammatical errors.\n-No English voice acting if you wanted to hear such.\n-Heejung can come across as really dumb in certain scenarios (whether it is from a translating error or just her own self is unknown)\n-Heejae (need I say more?)\n-Lot of micromanaging certain stats that can get a bit tedious over time.","December 29, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few problems with playing it. Mostly, it's just typos that throw me off on my reading when I play the game. The boys are amusing and you get attached to them very easily, which makes it saddening when you push the other animals away to spend more time for a play through. I wished that there were jealousy scenes in the game, otherwise the whole "wish" thing doesn't have the same amount of impact. It just seems like no one really cares enough about what they want and just spend their time fooling around.\n\nThe pacing of the story gave me problems, since I usually optimize my stats for the story, it makes the game feel rather slow  at some parts. But I suppose if someone were to just play, it would be fine as long as you don't attempt to play the game in one day, which I did. There is a lot of content to explore, so it is best to take your time and not burn yourself out.\n\nThe voice acting of the game gives a nice experiance.\n\nIt has a nice, long story that makes you want to explore the other character some more. So, for a dating sim, it's very successful in getting attachment to the fun times of having 5 guys in your apartment. But on a professional writing view, the characters are pretty two dimensional, the story has a lot of holes, the characters lack active goals, and the sheer fact that typos happen is shameful, but I still enjoyed it. The character problem isn't too bad, since they are way more fleshed out than a standard dating sim.\n\nI suggest that people buy it when it is on sale about 5 or 10 dollars cheaper. It's worth a 20 dollar experiance more than a 30. But if you can afford it, buy it! It's still an amazing experiance.","December 14, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wish there was a yellow "~" option along with the up and down votes.\n\nIf you like VNs and Dating Sims, and want to play a decent length game (8ish hours per line) with a lot of interesting types to choose from, then yes, it's a reccomend. We don't get nearly enough of these lengthy foreign titles, and I love to see more of this.\n\nIf you’re into chicks or just plain not up for a binge of cute, hot guys, then this title is not going to wow you.\n\nFinally... If you're also a fan of romance novels, or follow Hanako Games and enjoy the quality writing some local titles have to offer... then I suggest you keep reading.\n\n\n\nAll the characters in Dandelion are fully realized. They’re all typical “types,” bad boy, classy gentleman, dreamy prince, peppy neko ball, and tsundere, stuff that you can hear a couple lines from and say "yep. I like that one." The designs are excellent and enticing. They’re supposed to be otherworldly, and they certainly come off that way! And the situations they get into sometimes are hilarious! When all these personalities get together, the banter between them is quick and witty. I wish I could play the whole game with them playfully bickering.\n\nBut it’s strange. I wonder if I should bemoan the writing, or the translation. I’m not talking about the spelling errors here, I’m talking about the small, personal, and private moments. The moments where your heart is supposed to flutter, and your eyes are glued to the screen, on your gorgeous male moe blob as he finally comes in closer... and closer...!\n\nYeah. Those moments… fall soooooooooo flat in English.\n\nI’m trying to understand why… and I wonder, more than any other part of the game, is that a place that needs solid writing. Not just solid scenarios or solid characters. It’s a place where you breach into the sensual realm, of touch and smell. Where word choice is powerful. “He put his arm around me” is worlds away from “His arm slid around my shoulders, cupping me gently.”\n\nReaders of VN’s and Romance… People who have enjoyed games like Katawa Shojou, Royal Trap, and Magical Diary, or hell, the brief little tastes of Persona 3&4's romantic moments. you know what I’m talking about, right? There's a kind of writing that can make you melt into a gooey puddle of YES, even if the guy/gal isnt your prepackaged "type". There's some powerful stuff in Dandelion's plot that can reduce you to a quivering pile. But the smaller the scene, and the further from the main plot it is, the higher chance the entire moment will be ruined by the flat and simple text.\n\nBesides that, it’s easy to get knocked of the cute moeness by Bad Relationship Flags. Oh, it’s not a game mechanic. It’s occasional character moments that are played up as desirable or adorable, but in the real world are indicators of some SERIOUS bad juju, run from that relationship right now! The biggest problems I had were with "bad boy" Jisoo... I dont care what kind of situation you're in, man! Getting instant ragegasms for STANDING next to another guy is NOT. COOL.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid game with solid art, solid characters, solid scenarios… Pandery, cutesy moe pap, sure. But some serious story and writing flaws really get in the way of really enjoying that pap for all it could be.","December 15, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here’s why:\n\nIn terms of art, music, and story, I think this game has done a good job focusing on all these aspects.\n\nThe art is consistant, anatomy is fine, colors are bright and CGs are all different yet, suiting. Giving you a reason to collect them all. Character designs are also lovely and suit with their personality and voices nicely, with the animals having 2 types of clothes, the modern one and fantasy one is also a very good call.\n\nThe music is nice no matter where you're at, and it doesn't get annoying (IMO the best would be the opening and ending songs of course).\n\nNow the story, were do I being? Originally when I saw the game I was expecting a thick headed happy-go-lucky kind of protagonist, but nope! Heejung (The protagonist) is not only smart, down to earth, and caring; she also carries in herself a short of dark past. The game is constantly giving out new surprises throughout the story, and is excellent at pulling heartstrings. I even found myself going through all the good and bad endings (Something I don't do if the stories/endings are too similar or predictable). I also love how most events also bring in some of the other characters in the game. Certain otome games(dating simulations/visual novels) tend to isolate the main character and the love interest, but in many routes, there's still interaction between them and the rest of the characters.\n\nNow for secrets and bonus content. Other than just the usual 'get cgs throughout the route', the game also includes an amusing minigame that allows you to collect stamps of a certain character and unlock a bonus cg and the concept sketches. Another thing I liked is that the actual ending is after the beautiful credits, and the fact the credits would show all the CGs previously seen for that route, making it worth watching~\n\nThe only one thing I didn't like much was that the bonus was 'voice only', meaning to say since I didn't understand korean (in case you didn't know the game is voice and originally was in korean) I didn't understand what they were saying.  However, for those that just enjoy hearing the voices of the characters, this is a perfect treat.","October 25, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some suggested themes throughout the game but nothing explicit or mature ever happens however. This is a visual novel though and except the stat rising you are mostly reading, so if you crave action then this game might not be for you though.\n\nThe story seems pretty simple, Hee-jung finds a basket with animals in her room one morning and ends up taking care of them, and after some time it turns out the animals are really humans, or well humans with adorable cat and rabbit ears, and you get to choose which guy she will end up with. But the story is quite dark despite how it appears at first glance, the main character Hee-jung has a very real and relatable background and each of the guys have their own story that are all heartbreaking in their own right that has shaped them into what they are in the game and it makes it hard to settle for just one favourite.\n\nThe game often had me laughing out loud, especially the guys interractions with or without Hee-jung nearby, only to take a 180 turn and give you a sad or straight out heartbreaking scene. The art work really complements the game well, the character models, the adorable chibis and the locations are all very well done and I eagerly awaited the scenes that would give me a CG.\n\nThere are five routes to play through, with each guy having a different personality and a captivating story but if you play through all the routes you get to see that there is a bigger story behind it all and there is even sixth route available that gives some interesting insight in the plot of the game.\n\nAlmost every character also have a bad ending, most are not too bad but I recommend trying to get Jisoo's good ending before his bad end, seriously it's for the best. If you are worried about getting a bad ending then I recommend playing Jieun's route first since he has no bad ending. However it is still good to play Jihae's route before Jieun's since they are connected and the story really plays out better when doing Jihae first.\n\nThe text is in English or Korean and the audio is Korean, and the person that picked out the actors did an amazing job. Every character has a perfect voice in my opinion and it really makes it easier to relate and get immersed in the game, I especially like that even Hee-jung gets a voice, it's rare to have the female lead in an otome game to have a voice but in my opinion that makes everything better. The music is really good and fits the mood, there's not too much variation but it's always good music, not too much but just enough for you to notice it.\n\nThere are a lot of spelling mistakes though, even places where character names is switched by mistake and some might get thrown off by it, personally I didn't find it too distracting but for almost 30€ some proofreading before release would have been appreciated.\n\nOverall this game was funny, heartbreaking, embarassing and filled with relatable feelings and moments that really makes it hard to pick out a favourite character, my favourite is Jisoo but I can not rank the remaining five so they share a second place. I generally don't play otome games or dating games but this one I really recommend.","April 13, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here’s why:\n\nIn terms of art, music, and story, I think this game has done a good job focusing on all these aspects.\n\nThe art is consistant, anatomy is fine, colors are bright and CGs are all different yet, suiting. Giving you a reason to collect them all. Character designs are also lovely and suit with their personality and voices nicely, with the animals having 2 types of clothes, the modern one and fantasy one is also a very good call.\n\nThe music is nice no matter where you're at, and it doesn't get annoying (IMO the best would be the opening and ending songs of course).\n\nNow the story, were do I being? Originally when I saw the game I was expecting a thick headed happy-go-lucky kind of protagonist, but nope! Heejung (The protagonist) is not only smart, down to earth, and caring; she also carries in herself a short of dark past. The game is constantly giving out new surprises throughout the story, and is excellent at pulling heartstrings. I even found myself going through all the good and bad endings (Something I don't do if the stories/endings are too similar or predictable). I also love how most events also bring in some of the other characters in the game. Certain otome games(dating simulations/visual novels) tend to isolate the main character and the love interest, but in many routes, there's still interaction between them and the rest of the characters.\n\nNow for secrets and bonus content. Other than just the usual 'get cgs throughout the route', the game also includes an amusing minigame that allows you to collect stamps of a certain character and unlock a bonus cg and the concept sketches. Another thing I liked is that the actual ending is after the beautiful credits, and the fact the credits would show all the CGs previously seen for that route, making it worth watching~\n\nThe only one thing I didn't like much was that the bonus was 'voice only', meaning to say since I didn't understand korean (in case you didn't know the game is voice and originally was in korean) I didn't understand what they were saying.  However, for those that just enjoy hearing the voices of the characters, this is a perfect treat.","October 25, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork was stunning and I enjoyed all the crazy, loveable characters, as well as their rather interesting backgrounds.\nI've played quite a few games like this one, and it's definitely one of the best. I found myself really enjoying getting to learn more about all of the boys' pasts, and there were definitely a lot of things that surprised me, especially with a certain orange tabby. Although there were a few little typos here and there, the translations were pretty good from what I could tell.

Which means you play as a girl (named Heejung), and can choose on of several attractive males as your partner – yes, males, because the men in Heejung’s life start out as animals. Or, if you like, as trans-dimensional animal-men, who keep their fluffy ears even as humans.\n\nGameplay\n\nDandelion is not a pure visual novel and has a decent amount of stat management. You have to raise three positive stats through different activities while avoiding to max out two negative stats, and raise affection with your chosen partner. There is also a hidden-item mini game, which unlocks additional pictures of the characters.\nSadly, Dandelion once again demonstrats why I prefer pure visual novels to stat-raising games. Stat-raising is semi-interesting in the first playthrough when you still figure things out and experiment, but gets more and more repetitive on subsequent playthroughs. And in otome games, you will very likely play through each character’s route, which makes about five playthoughs in Dandelion – more, if you don’t get the best endings on your first try.\nA New Game+ feature would be a very nice addition and save you from clicking through the same fluff text again and again and again.\nAlso, let’s be honest here, stat-raising (and the hidden-item minigame) just ends in reloading until you get exactly the character interaction you wanted or find the item you were looking for. And that’s rather boring.\n\nStoryline\n\nYou play as Heejung, a stressed and lonely university student with an extremely overbearing mother. One day, a basket full of animals – two cats and three rabbits – myteriously appears in her room. Said animals soon turn into attractive men with cute ears and a lot of baggage, from the butler-like angora rabbit to the bad boy black cat.\nAnd let’s not forget that Heejung herself has a lot of baggage. Actually, Heejung’s anxieties were a big draw for me. She feels much more like a realized character than most blank slate otome protagonists.\nHeejung grows as a character in each route, and even better, the male characters’ arcs mirror Heejung’s own development, which is really cool. It’s really satisfying when both parties change and grow.\nPrepare for many a tear-jerking moment along each route – and for bitter-sweet endings.\n\nAs a warning: There is some problematic stuff in some of the romances, like physical violence and one character strays dangerously close to a shotacon (an absolute no-go for me).\n\nArtwork\n\nCertainly one of the game’s high points. Each and every one of the characters looks gorgeous both ingame and in CGs and has a lot of different facial reactions – including cute ear movements. Special mention to Jisoo’s drooping ears when he sulks and Jieun’s surprised expression when you wear your facial mask…\n\nConclusion\n\nDo I recommend the game? Absolutely. The gameplay might not be the most fascinating, but both storyline and artwork make up for it – steam says I played for about 40 hours, which I guess speaks for itself.","October 26, 2014","true","44.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aseret99/recommended/321290/","aseret99","Aseret99","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aseret99/","4 products in account","Dandelion ~Wishes Brought to You~ is an otome game created by Cheritz. It's priced at around $30 and I found this to be well worth the price, it's seriously such a steal. I bought the game when it was first released back at the end of 2012 and I was so happy to see that it got greenlit on steam. That's why you don't see that I played that many hours on steam. It's because I've played the whole game in the version that was directly from Cheritz. I've probably spent more than 40 hours on this game and I still keep coming back to it, replaying my favourite scenes from the memories gallery - even to this day. I can't believe it's already been 2 years and this game still has such a big impact on me.\n\nDandelion completely blew me away. So what are you waiting for?? Go buy the game NOW. But you can play the demo and read my review first. Either way, just buy it, it'll be the best 30 bucks you've ever spent ;)\n\nGenerally spoiler-free review below:\n\nDon't let the initial synopsis fool you into thinking this will be a "fun silly game where you date animals". I've heard people say that way too many times. Sure Dandelion can be absolutely fun to play, but it's also SO much more than that. And it comes with a LOT OF FEELS. Dandelion's an immersive story that feels like it’s from another world. Yet, at the same time, it’s incredibly realistic. It addresses many themes such as self-worth, acceptance, sacrifice and more. Cheritz handles these themes with utmost care and it delivers to the audience. I’m sure anyone can relate to at least one thing in this game and feel touched.\n\nWRITING:\nThe story was very well written. There were many hilarious scenes that I had to take breaks simply from laughing too hard. There were also many feel-inducing moments, which I also absolutely loved. I adore how each route is part of an overarching plot and you need to complete them in order to discover the truth and reason for everything that was going on.\n\nART:\nThe art is absolutely stunning. The colours are bright and vibrant. The characters all stand out and are very diverse in their appearances. I must admit, the visuals were the first thing that caught my attention. Both the sprites and CGs were very well done. It's just so breath-taking and beautiful. I'm a huge fan of the artist and I'm really impressed with her talent.\n\nSTAT RAISING:\nWhile at first, the stat raising in the game was fun and cute. Over time, it became repetitive and tiring to do for all the routes. Tip: Save and Load frequently! It's important to raise the affection of the guy you're going after, and be sure that you focus on only one guy each playthrough if you can. The little store where you can buy items to make the star raising easier and the gifts you can buy for the guys too were cute little additions. Still, the stat raising may drive you crazy. Although, the pain of it all will be completely worth it for the characters and story! Trust me :)\n\nVOICE ACTING:\nI really have to applaud the voice actors in this game. The voice acting was incredible and all the voice actors portrayed each character amazingly. They displayed a wide variety of emotions for every scene. I really felt the character’s personalities shone through their voicesl. I also really liked how Heejung was voiced too. Personally, I like when the MC/heroine is voiced as well as everyone else since it adds more dimension and life to their characters.\n\nMUSIC:\nAgain, I really have to praise Cheritz on their music. The OP is brilliant and perfectly suits the video. The OST is just gorgeous and every time I listen to a certain track, I get Dandelion feels all over again. The different character songs suit their respective characters and some make me laugh too. Moreover, the music plays at the most perfect moments. It tugs at my heartstrings every single time. The OST is simply beautiful.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nI loved every single character in this game. They all had their own strengths and quirks that were so unique to them. Of course everyone is flawed as well, but seeing their characters grow as their routes progressed was SO great to see!\n\nEach guy was vastly different from each other and I ended up falling in love with them all. Though, I must admit, Jiwoo ended up being my personal bias from the game. I couldn't resist that adorable tsun-bunny <3 The interactions between the guys themselves was very fun to watch. I love their little disagreements, especially in the beginning of the game xD They all have such different personalities, so when put together, it results in some hilarious antics.\n\nHeejung grows as a person in every route, and while the guys change her, she changes them for the better at the same time as well. The relationships in the story have a rather equal dynamic as a result. It was a nice balance and seeing them grow together was really sweet. Heejung was a fantastic heroine. She is kind and caring, but has a teasing snarky side to her at the same time. Due to the experiences she's gone through her life, she is a very mature individual. I also really liked how relateable she was. She tries so hard to meet her mom's expectations and wants her mom to acknowledge her for her accomplishments. It's nice to see how she develops throughout the game and how she comes to terms with her inner battles.\n\nOVERALL:\nThis review is rather long, but there are so many things to say about this amazing game, I couldn’t help myself! Dandelion is a wonderful visual novel. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone out there who wants to experience a beautiful story with intriguing characters.\n\nDespite only releasing two games (Nameless is their other one, which I highly recommend as well), they’ve already established themselves to be my favourite otome game company. Can’t wait for future releases from Cheritz!","October 26, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I knew very little of this game before I bought it and was blow away by it.\n\nThe story deals with relatable, realistic problems; though there are some cliché elements. The story is completely character-driven, which is something I like. The narration is well done, though there are typos. There are five routes plus one Bad End for four of the routes, making a total of nine times you’ll have to play the game at least in order to complete everything. However if you mess up and don’t get enough stamps to unlock some of the extras, you may find yourself playing routes over. The good thing about this game is that it doesn’t take itself too seriously, yet can still make you sympathetic towards the characters.\n\nThe art work is fantastic. The artist did a great job at keeping a theme with the coloring and style. There is a background in almost all the CGs –the ones that don’t seem fine without. Only critic is that some CGs would have looked better if drawn from a different angle.\n\nThe background music does a good job at music setting the mood. I liked the soundtrack, however if you don’t you can simply set the BGM to off and still hear the characters beautiful voices. The voice actors are what bring the characters to life. All the voice actors are talented and display their characters perfectly.\n\nEach character has a different backstory and character development that is believable and well-written.\n\nHeejung makes a great main character because she is someone easy to relate to or at least one the player will be able to sympathize with. Cheritz did the right thing by not making her a blank-insert for the player. It’s better to have a relatable character than an insert for a story so character-driven.\n\nI have mixed feelings for Jisoo; I liked him in every route but his own. He is a “big-brother” type character. I have a similar opinion of Jihae; I liked him, but hated his route. Jiyeon was my least favorite; I found him to be rather selfish, didn’t enjoy his route either. Jiwoo was, to my surprise, my second favorite; he’s silly but also serious at times. I think he was the one best suited for Heejung. Jieun was my favorite; his route is the happiest one in my opinion.\n\nFor the other characters there is not much to say: The wizard makes an interesting sort of “villain.” I can’t say more without spoilers. Other minor characters, such as classmates and Heejung’s mother, serve their purpose.\n\nLastly there are a few things that should be mentioned: I’d recommend playing the demo first. It is a stat-based game, which I love but I know other otome gamers despise. Everyone has personal opinions, so you may hate or love most of the characters. Many people complain about the price of the game, however it is long and you are likely to replay it and it is nowhere near some of the prices of otome games from Japan.

There are some suggested themes throughout the game but nothing explicit or mature ever happens however. This is a visual novel though and except the stat rising you are mostly reading, so if you crave action then this game might not be for you though.\n\nThe story seems pretty simple, Hee-jung finds a basket with animals in her room one morning and ends up taking care of them, and after some time it turns out the animals are really humans, or well humans with adorable cat and rabbit ears, and you get to choose which guy she will end up with. But the story is quite dark despite how it appears at first glance, the main character Hee-jung has a very real and relatable background and each of the guys have their own story that are all heartbreaking in their own right that has shaped them into what they are in the game and it makes it hard to settle for just one favourite.\n\nThe game often had me laughing out loud, especially the guys interractions with or without Hee-jung nearby, only to take a 180 turn and give you a sad or straight out heartbreaking scene. The art work really complements the game well, the character models, the adorable chibis and the locations are all very well done and I eagerly awaited the scenes that would give me a CG.\n\nThere are five routes to play through, with each guy having a different personality and a captivating story but if you play through all the routes you get to see that there is a bigger story behind it all and there is even sixth route available that gives some interesting insight in the plot of the game.\n\nAlmost every character also have a bad ending, most are not too bad but I recommend trying to get Jisoo's good ending before his bad end, seriously it's for the best. If you are worried about getting a bad ending then I recommend playing Jieun's route first since he has no bad ending. However it is still good to play Jihae's route before Jieun's since they are connected and the story really plays out better when doing Jihae first.\n\nThe text is in English or Korean and the audio is Korean, and the person that picked out the actors did an amazing job. Every character has a perfect voice in my opinion and it really makes it easier to relate and get immersed in the game, I especially like that even Hee-jung gets a voice, it's rare to have the female lead in an otome game to have a voice but in my opinion that makes everything better. The music is really good and fits the mood, there's not too much variation but it's always good music, not too much but just enough for you to notice it.\n\nThere are a lot of spelling mistakes though, even places where character names is switched by mistake and some might get thrown off by it, personally I didn't find it too distracting but for almost 30€ some proofreading before release would have been appreciated.\n\nOverall this game was funny, heartbreaking, embarassing and filled with relatable feelings and moments that really makes it hard to pick out a favourite character, my favourite is Jisoo but I can not rank the remaining five so they share a second place. I generally don't play otome games or dating games but this one I really recommend.","April 13, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What else could you ask for?\n\nThis game offers fairly in-depth characters that actually develop as the story progresses. They're not just quickly drawn pretty boys, they have reasons for how they act and why. For men in animal ears, they're pretty realistic in terms of behaviour. (except falling for this clueless MC, ofc) The music is beautiful, art's well made. The GC's are quite breathtaking.\n\nThe game takes you along for an emotional ride, and you'll notice yourself getting attached to the characters. Each new playthrough with a new guy felt like a betrayal every time. Until I accepted the fact I just need to touch all of their butts or I won't be happy! The game play gets repetitive quite fast though, with the stat raising and waiting for the days to pass to get to the good parts. For a completionist like me, who needs to get all the bad endings, good endings and extras, after a couple playthroughs it's not that fun anymore. The character dialogue and GC's are deffo worth it though, and skip function for the heavy story parts ftw.\n\nThem speaking Korean caught me off guard first as it was the first time I ever heard the language, but you get used to it! So don't let that be the reason you'll miss out on this game. The voice acting is actually really good once you get used to the new language (although I admit, I still think they'd sound better in japanese) and their voices suit them well!

What can I say about this game? Fluffy? Oh yeah it's got fluff. But it also has darker moments, sad moments, and the endings will tug at your heart making you want to cry with the MC. But those kind of things won't help ya understand what this game can be like. This game has so much to offer and a few things I wasn't too fond of. So let's get started.\n\nCONS: Honestly I really really dislike the stat raising. Don't get me wrong I have seen that others like it but for me it made avoiding the worst of the bad endings {I'm sorry but that nerd from art class getting the girl 4 times while I was chasing Jisoo drove me nsane.} Trying to avoid bad endings in this game is like trying to avoid a cold during winter, its damn near impossible. However the personal bad endings have much more to them than I could ever describe. I honestly only got one person's bad ending {twice.....} but it still made me cry and want to punch the person..... Yeah I am pretty mean.\n\nThe Mc is one of my other problems. While she is what most would think of when playing a game like this, quiet and shy, she doesn't have much of a back bone against the guys. When Jisoo, or Jiwoo even, are rude she doesn't get defensive, doesn't stand up for herself.  Yes I understand that most people wanna see the shy cute girl win the man at the end but she takes a lot of verbal abuse in this game.\n\nTranslation/spelling errors...... I saw a couple, not many worth noting, though I did have a glitch with Jiwoo that had him repeating the same thing three times and another with Jihae that did something similar. Not sure if it was a glitch or if that was translation errors. They didn't ruin the game really but it can mess up the flow if you don't expect it.\n\nPROS: The story line. Ok first, and this has to be said, play as many times as you can. Play everyone. Like seriously the more you play, the more you will see as you romance each of the guys.\n\nTHE WIZARD! Seriously I love this dude. Like he is in the pro list even if no one else likes him. Watching the bonus story for him, which you do have to get all five good endings so good luck, is so touching yet so messed up. I adored him when I first saw him. I was crepped by his voice in the beginning but as each playthrough progressed I started to love his characters, his part in the game, so much more.\n\nThe characters in general are so much fun to watch during the game. *Spoilers ahead*\nJisoo I think has one of the most touching storylines yet also has a much darker personality.  His possessive streak can be a bit much for anyone who has dealt with abusive people who are that possessive but that actually fades away eventually. That fading away allows you to see the real him, the side that is sweet, caring, and just so damned adorable.  Even though I joke to friends he is a perv, which he really is, he is much more than that.\n\nJihae..... oh what I can I say about this poor man. His story will make you wish you can just hug him tight. His bad ending will make you freak out while crying because of his abandonment. OUt of all of the guys I think he is the one I feel needs the character most.\n\nJiyeon.... Just a warning this cat boy is not all he seems and you will find that out about mid way through the game. He and at least one other character leave for a time, though this allows you to get your meters raised as well as your stats. Jihae, Jiyeon and the other character{who I can not remember off the top of my head} have the best bet of raising stats to acceptable levels while you wait for days you can talk to them.\n\nJiwoo ..... Seriously this bunny ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off at first. He is a typical tsundere with a chip on his shoulder and a superiority complex. But he has his own soft side and when it shows you might just forgive him for how often he calls you stupid.\n\nOh the baby bunny Jieon....... This is why I put the spoilers..... This kid is amazing. FIrst he starts growing up enough to realize he can't keep letting Jihae baby him. Then he starts showing more and more amazing strength hidden under that cute visage. And finally the way he drops that bomb about the Wizard not getting the girl.... PRICELESS. I adored this kid after I finished his playthrough. I mean seriously the little bunny became a badass by his ending and actually grew up really handsome to boot. It was amazing.\n\nHonestly this game has more than I could tell without completely ruining the game for anyone reading this. You need to play it to see all of the touching moments, all the scary or painful ones, and all the ones that will make you cry.","June 8, 2015","true","79.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've always been easy-going and tend to give any game/any genre a try. Otomes are fun because of how relaxing they feel compared to say....playing through a Silent Hill. It's a nice game I can kick back and chill through.\n\nThat said, Dandelion definitely exceeds those standards for Otome. This game is so damn cute it's almost overwhelming. Admittedly, I went the Jisoo route to start (duh, he resembles my husband wayyy to much, so it was like gravity really choosing him).\n\nBut, I even found myself liking the character (poor little Jieun) who I thought would be the most uninteresting out of the group. All the story lines have classic "K-drama" style sad back stories. The main character is also sweet and honest, which makes her much more enjoyable than other female leads in other Otomes. But, I wanted her to stand up for herself a little more! But, it wouldn't have worked for the story...so I have to give her more credit. Admittedly, I liked Hakouki's female lead much more. BUT, this game gets +1000000 brownie points for the OUTstanding Korean voice acting! Yay Korean! As woman married into a Korean family, I feel COMPELLED to support a game like this.\n\nIt's totally worth your time. It had me laughing out loud and crying at points too.\n\nOnly down side, is on repeat play-throughs to get the other character's storylines, the stat raising can get really repetitive. But, I think you know that going into a game like this. . .Still totally worth it to see Jiwoo get annoyed every time I touch his paws or Jisoo randomly get distracted by informercials mid-conversation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LorenaFA/recommended/321290/","LorenaFA",".:|:Lorena:|:Ray:|:.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LorenaFA/","133 products in account","This is hands down one of the best Otome games in my opinion.\n\nOverall my review on this is 8.5/10\n\nVisuals/Graphics: The character artwork is phenomenal. As I've come to expect in Cheritz' games, the artwork in this game is beautiful in regards to the characters. All of the CGI's were well done, and the stories are dynamic and engaging. The bonus content is a great system and gave the MC a bonus on dates with the guy/s of her choice and gives the player a goal to collect the stamps for each of the boys.\n\nGameplay: This is where my 1.5 negative comes down off of the overall score of the game. My reasoning for this is that some of the negative paths are unbearably difficult and specific, namely Jiwoo's path. His bad ending is extremely difficult to enact, and I won't spoil it as there are really good walkthroughs that explain how to get it, but yes. Also It is difficult at times to actually find the character you're trying to engage in the house, so quick saving is a must for certain characters, especially Jiyeon, and Jiwoo. It isn't unbearable by any means but it does require a lot of time to engage specific characters when others may also be triggered by doing said action.\n\nThat said, the actual stat building in this game is remarkably easy to do, although getting stress and pressure down is hard in the beginning of the game, towards the end assuming you don't wish to unlock activities it makes the game a cakewalk. I loved the story in this game and that there was no real NEED to buy the characters gifts although it does add some extra text options, it made it optional. It was also very easy to make money, and I found it nice that I didn't need to build a huge schedule around going to work or school in order to achieve something. I loved actually sitting down and getting the paths fully completed and I also love that Cheritz was generous enough to offer free steam keys to patrons that paid for the game pre-move to steam. The steam client works wonderfully as long as the game is updated and you're not in "sharing" mode on your account.\n\nMusic/Voice/Audio: This was really well acted. I loved Jisoo's voice acting. I will say though that the fake meows were annoying as hell, but aside from that the music and voices were beautiful and I didn't get sick of listening to either. I also really love the opening song and video for this game. It's really well done. Also I liked that each character has a specific ending song and movie. It added a bit more depth to the game, and it really is worth it.\n\nIf you don't like stat building Otome games, this isn't for you, however If you do enjoy stat building you'll enjoy it quite a bit. The UI can be a bit "ugly" at times and the text could use a bit of work, however - it all runs smoothly and there were no bugs that I noticed which is more than I can say for some VN's/Stat builders out there. It's in my opinion very much worth the expense and The bonus content again is hilarious and awesome. Also I loved the individualized Christmas cards which you can read in the extra's as well.\n\nIt's a really good purchase, and I don't regret getting this at all. If you like VN's, Otome games, Usagimimi's/Nekomimi's/Catboys/Bunnyboys you'll enjoy this quite a bit.\n\nIt's got many cute things in it and moments that made me smile.  This was the first game I purchased from Cheritz' that made me a loyal customer in the future. I hope that they make many more games and add them to steam in the future. I really enjoyed this game and Nameless as well. Both are great. :) Thank you Cheritz' and the translation team for translating the game into English for those of us that only understand Hangul or English. :D","June 17, 2015","true","69.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a well-developed backstory for our protagonist and she's relatable and quite ordinary - in the best way possible.   It plunges you into the storyline quickly, so you don't get bored waiting for the game to "start".  The art is gorgeous.  Both animals and humans are insanely adorable visually, and (especially a certain spotted one that captured my heart immediately) insanely adorable emotionally/behaviorally.  :>  They all have their own personalities and quirks that add to their charm, and if the route I played through is any indication, they likely all have backstories worth learning.  I'm certainly satisfied with my choice of romance and experiencing his story.  Honestly, I rather fell in love with him and the protagonist as a pair - they had similar heartbreaks in their pasts and seemed a natural fit together, both able to empathize with and support the other.  I hope the other routes are as fulfilling (although secretly, in my experience the first romance is always the best, otome game or other, since you gravitate toward the one that speaks to you, not the protagonist per se).  That ending, though... ye olde heartstrings be pulled, aye.\n\nOne thing I wasn't aware of when I first started playing was that various scenes have Korean voice acting!  Which was an interesting surprise for me, since I'm extremely familiar with Japanese, but extremely unfamiliar with Korean.  Had to train myself to pause a second before furthering the dialog in a voiced scene, just in case there was just a pause in the sentence and not a full stop.  XD\n\nWord to the wise: save often and don't let the pressure get to you.  >:)  Have fun!  I'm sure you'll love it.  <3","July 8, 2015","true","113.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I truly enjoyed every aspect of it. I found myself binge-playing compulsively until I cmpleted every single character's story arc - hang in there so you can see the cool, extra story-line about the villain of the game!\n\nSome of the character storylines are stronger than others, of course. Sometimes you have to just accept guys being borderline aggressive with the female lead character, for example, which is a bit hard to take when the goal is for you, the player, to like the guy you picked and to desire to progress a romance with him. However, there are plenty of funny and cute moments that are very rewarding and enjoyable.\n\nI also found some of the stat-building components to be very addictive. I enjoyed unlocking various activities around the house after filling the heart gauge, too. There isn't much of a tutorial for the game, it just throws you right into the thick of the action, so I would recommend looking at walkthroughs online or watching something like Dodger's fantastic Let's Play of this game (she's PressHearttoContinue on YouTube).\n","July 14, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was way better than I expected! It was interesting, sad and a very good plot.\n(On the side note, I like how it connetcts  to ''Cheritz'' other game  ''Nameless'' that I also likes. )\n\nI also like the voiceacting! The characters really comes to life with their voices. Its very well done!\n\nEven if I love this game there is ..\nalthough the art were wonderful most of the time, did I not quite like one of the main characters poses.. And the friend at school is oddly shaded and drawn without care compared to the others, which make him stand out of place .. But that is about it!\n\nI liked all the music except for one melody, cause it sounded funny and did not fit in at all. xD\n\nSomething that I thougt was a bit bothersome were the days between the cut scenes! The could sometimes feel endless..... D:\nBut it was worth it to get to know these characters.  Since the all had intressting reasons etc.<3\nAnyway, when these days go on and on waiting for the story to continue.. And sometimes all of a sudden you got a bad ending... Which also made me insecure to save at times.. Since if you save close to a bad ending without knowing, than its hard to continue ..And noticning that, I saved most  when the first requirments were fullfilled, and the next one started.\n\nAnd last, sometimes did the game disconnect to the server, but I did not have that much of a problem to reconnect. And I do not see this as a hindrence to play... but that may differ I do not know.\n\nOverall, I really loved this game, I will probably play through the endless days just for the characters! And their stories. <3  And also for the art!\nSince I got quite attached to the game, and do not regret it. xD\n\nI give this game a half eaten broccoli and 11/10.\nDon´t worry I have apples. <3","October 8, 2015","true","49.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(not going to spoill it... just don't judge a book by its cover...)\n\nAll-in-all, Dandelion- Wishes Broght to you is such a wonderful game.

The game might be $30 but everything else in the game is just priceless. To you, the game might seem too expensive, but with all of the effort put in this game, the game is worth a mesly $30.

Not only do the men you choose from have personality but so does Heejung, and even though she is her own person I still feel that I am her or she is a version of me if I lived in her shoes. So far I've only played Jiwoo's route, and got the good ending I believe, but I'm more than excited to get every possible combination and unravel this story.

Once I had finished all routes and unlocked the “true ending”, my mind was BLOWN.  For days and days afterward, my head was absolutely consumed with only thoughts of the Wizard, swimming with all sorts of thoughts, and it wasn’t until now that I think I have found a platform on which to share said thoughts.  So here goes….  (Sorry, it gets long-winded.)\n\n\n\n\nAlright, I’m going to come out and say it.  As mentally unstable the Wizard is, he is my favorite suitor, with dark horse* (note: not an actual horse) Jieun coming in at a close second.  That’s right.  Baby bunny FTW, you know, if the Wizard didn’t exist and all.\n\nIn order to understand what a crazy puppetmaster and schemer the Wizard is, let’s first take a look at our suitors and their motivations for being in The Game.\n\nBossy, opinionated Jiwoo doesn’t give a ♥♥♥♥ about romancing your ♥♥♥.  In fact, the only reason he’s playing The Game is because he wants to run away from his old life.  I know, technically he wants revenge on his “family”, but eventually, he changes that to wanting a fresh start.  If he happens to lose his memories, painful as they are, so much the better.  As for serious contenders, Jiwoo is pretty down there on the bottom of the list.\n\nMuch like Jiwoo, Jiyeon (that ♥♥♥♥ing heartbreaker…. all the tears I cried for him) wants revenge and/or a fresh start since his world no longer holds anything he cares about.  He’d be going home to an empty life.  If you don’t play his route, he seems perfectly happy; if you can take the abuse of chasing him down, then yeah, eventually he’ll be happy and all, but really I think he just wants to be left alone.\n\nBeautiful Jihae also doesn’t give a ♥♥♥♥ about romancing your ♥♥♥.  He’s too hung up on his past lady and being uber depressed about her to even notice you have boobs.  In fact, the only reason he’s playing The Game is because Jieun is making him!  Does he care if he wins the heart of a new lady love?  No.  He had already surrendered to his depressingly overwhelming need to be needed, dedicating (tenfold) his life to caring for Prince Jieun.  So, not a contender.\n\nThe rabbit prince, while my darling, also has no desire to actually win your heart, or the game.  He wants Jihae (”Eddy”) to be happy, and so the two are each wishing the other would win, but never striving to win themselves.\nFor all four of these characters, it isn’t until you start trying to win them over that they take notice of you.  But pay attention to the phrasing there: You win them over.  YOU.  WIN.  Not them.  They are still pretty much inactive players in The Game.\n\nWhich brings us to Jisoo, the only player of The Game who is actually trying to win.  Even in routes outside of his own, Jisoo tries to appeal to Heejung, whether it’s as the big brother “please depend on me” type, a confidant, or an outright rival to the suitor in question, and this is because he is the ONLY ONE with something to lose if he does not win.  If he does not win, his sister will die.  End of story.  So yeah, he tries real hard, whether you notice him doing so or not because you’re making moony eyes over some other dude is irrelephant.  Even the Wizard himself had said that Jisoo had been his choice to win the game, but stick a pin in that and we’ll come back to it.\n\nAs gorgeous and mostly dependable as he is, Jisoo is not without his flaws.  He has a violent jealous streak that is frightening under normal circumstances, and CRAZY TERRIFYING when he finally snaps (see the bad ending OMG).\n\nEnter the Wizard.  (My husbando.)  So far we have 4 not-entirely-committed players, and one must-win player with a history of violence, who has been hand-picked as the prize-horse* (note: not actual horse) by the Game organizer.  Naturally, The Wizard must have known about Jisoo’s violent temper and jealousy, and therefore knew he was a ticking time bomb. He must have hoped that he would win so that Jisoo’s relationship with Heejung would eventually become so abusive that Heejung would have a desperate wish, and then, FINALLY, meet The Wizard (possibly again?), and he can step in and save her.\n\nThe Wizard is really such a tragic character, constantly being denied his own happiness, it’s no wonder why he’s so twisted.  I really wished that he had his own “after” route that we could play through.  He sacrificed everything he was just to be with Heejung, not even fully knowing if it would work.  Since he wished, he probably lost his memories, but you know what?  I think that’s okay.  He would wake up without the pain and bitterness that twisted his personality like it did, next to the one he loved so much.  Granted, he wouldn’t remember that either, but, this way they could start off and build a real, true, lasting love.  That’s a story I want to play.","December 31, 2015","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Suddenly I have a creepy set of eyes on me and a whiny plea to let me be their woman.  In some games I've played this is undesirable, but ok.  Here in Dandelion you have plea after plea until "BAD END" appears in stark red text over a black background.  Somehow even the game realizes that your friend is only a friend, and anything else is uncomfortable or even creepy, let alone his promises of you being a kept woman under his family's chicken business.  When the eyes peek beyond the glasses, you know its too late and your cute boys are forever lost to you.  Unless you made a handy save spot past most of the beginning and as desired bonds were forming.\n\nYou're a girl struggling to find her identity and escape a life of pure pressure and stress to just study and succeed under the standards set by others.  Suddenly this new responsibility literally dropped on you over night seems to give you new purpose and open your eyes to other options in life and the pursuits of happiness.  You're surrounded by cute animals and depending how you play it, they can all develop feelings and care for you.  Then they turn into a bunch of boys, and all that closeness does seem lost.  You can keep getting points, but you don't seem to get any closer.  They're boys now, which means one of you has to keep the other at bay.  If you don't find the balance in activities and learn the items that will provide you with the needed effects, you'll fall under pressure and have chicken boy not taking no for an answer.\n\nFun game, despite some days feeling a bit repititious (especially if you are seeking someone that likes doing a lot of the same thing). Minor frustration when you get a gift and that ends the day, but the exchanging of gifts does say a lot of the bond being formed and makes up for the time lost.  I prefer games where you can choose a couple of activities in a day, but oh well.  There's a lot of things that subtly present a lot of options and variety to the interactions had and you have to start learning (like many sim games, but this one seems to take it to a higher level than most) what the guys like, what activities they want to do with you, and what you can bond over.  Otherwise you don't get cat or bunny, the game gives you the bird instead.","December 1, 2015","true","29.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played it together with a friend once before  but I REALLY wanted to buy it for myself to support the wonderful Cheritz.\n\nAll stories are wonderful and the overarching story makes this really heartfelt. Dandelion is a story for the heart, a true keeper for me.\n\nMC. For me, MCs in otome HAVE to have strong presence, be full characters with a personality and story to tell. I HATE  empty vessel-like MCs that  make you emptily self-insert that some otome, particularly mobile ones,  seem to have.  I want MCs I can care for and I trully care for Heejung. I love it when a game like Dandelion comes along that has a full  Main Character, with flaws but also potential for growth and change. I love the fact I can see her, know her and care for her, I love the fact she has a strong, touching backstory, that she is a wholesome person I care for and can ship with the other characters. I love Heejung, she is lovely, personnable and has her own story to tell.  Main character Heejung is one of my top favourite female heroines in an otome game ever. She has a strong presence, feels complete as a human with her flaws and insecurities and also her kindness. I really love her.  Her dynamic with the group that comes to live with her is aweome, the relations are very fun and touching. The interactions are lively.\n\nThe endings are all validated and not even the true ending invalidates them. I love it that way, it tells many stories plus one more you don't expect at first and everything is concrete enough for me to let me imagine a very happy conclusion. I really loved how all ending happened in this game, it was very well done, and I have a sense they could all happen and none of them are ever undermined and it's perfect.  My favourite endings...well it's difficult.. since the premise of the story actually makes it very difficult to have favourites. Some of the characters really have a LOT to lose if you don't choose them. It's heart rending.  Well even so my favourite endings are Ji Hye, then Ji Eun and Ji Soo and...one more, the OTHER, special ending.  It's, above all, a story of a certain desperate quest... I really love the ideas that went into this story and I came to love all characters but I can;t highlight enough how glad I am that endings are what they are and I can be happy with each of them.  I really think the game was clever with endings and  made me happy with all of them.\n\n\nThis is a stat-raising game. Stat raising is closely connected with Heejung's development and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I enjoy stat raising games and I particularly enjoyed stat raising in Dandelion, it wasn't tiresome for me and there were many random events that made it so much more fun. Also there is a sense of progress as you raise stats. Things actually happen to the group that comes to live with Heejung...and also  stats you raise and which character you interact with from the beginning is very important. The game essentially divdes into a common route where you play until you chose one character you focus on and then, after a certain key event, the route of that charatcer begins. I love that, because it gave me a sense of progress.\n\nArt...The CGs are all absolutely stunning!!!! I love the art in this game very much and I have at least three CGS that are my top favourites ever, from any game. The artist did a wonderful job on all of them, I adore them.\n\nI am VERY grateful to my friend for showng me this game and playing it with me and I am happy I can finally buy Dandelion for myself....it's a true keeper for me, a senstive story that tells many stories (PLUS unxpectdly one more!) and it touches the heart.  thanks Cheritz, so much!  The art, the stories, the characters are all  ggreat for me. I am EXTREMELY pleased with how the story was layered and structured and how endings were kept separate and all were valid.  Characters are flawed, speak to the heart, the endings for me are concrete enough and validated.","November 29, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Weeee!!! Otome games are my version of romance novels. I can't say how well this game works for folks who like to roleplay as the MC, since I don't play them that way, but I found it very enjoyable. I've only plalyed Jisoo's route so far, but the story is interesting, characters likable, and artwork is beautiful. I had wanted to play this game for a long time now. When I want a quick otome fix I'll jump into a fluffy Voltage mobile game, but it can be hard to find an English voiced/subtitled well-developed otome at times when I want more depth. It has a different feel, but I think in quality and development of this game is on par with Queen of Darkness: The Second Reproduction. That's saying a lot, considering that otome is my all time favorite. Jisoo's route was entertaining, though he's not typically the character archeype I go for I was surprised by the layers beneath his gruff, and a bit posessive, exterior. I won't say more for spoilers. I have enjoyed this game so far and am looking forward to the other routes, which should be easier/less micro-managy and even plan on checking out Jisoo's bad route. About the only thing I would say detracted from the game is the stats system. I kind of knew from the demo, and based on its existence in general, that the game would be a bit grindy, but as a person who seriously dislikes grindy games  it was the only thing that truly bugged me. To be fair, I also have never played a stats otome, favoring decision based story progression otomes in comparison. That said, would still give this game an 8/10.

I've always been easy-going and tend to give any game/any genre a try. Otomes are fun because of how relaxing they feel compared to say....playing through a Silent Hill. It's a nice game I can kick back and chill through.\n\nThat said, Dandelion definitely exceeds those standards for Otome. This game is so damn cute it's almost overwhelming. Admittedly, I went the Jisoo route to start (duh, he resembles my husband wayyy to much, so it was like gravity really choosing him).\n\nBut, I even found myself liking the character (poor little Jieun) who I thought would be the most uninteresting out of the group. All the story lines have classic "K-drama" style sad back stories. The main character is also sweet and honest, which makes her much more enjoyable than other female leads in other Otomes. But, I wanted her to stand up for herself a little more! But, it wouldn't have worked for the story...so I have to give her more credit. Admittedly, I liked Hakouki's female lead much more. BUT, this game gets +1000000 brownie points for the OUTstanding Korean voice acting! Yay Korean! As woman married into a Korean family, I feel COMPELLED to support a game like this.\n\nIt's totally worth your time. It had me laughing out loud and crying at points too.\n\nOnly down side, is on repeat play-throughs to get the other character's storylines, the stat raising can get really repetitive. But, I think you know that going into a game like this. . .Still totally worth it to see Jiwoo get annoyed every time I touch his paws or Jisoo randomly get distracted by informercials mid-conversation.

Once I had finished all routes and unlocked the “true ending”, my mind was BLOWN.  For days and days afterward, my head was absolutely consumed with only thoughts of the Wizard, swimming with all sorts of thoughts, and it wasn’t until now that I think I have found a platform on which to share said thoughts.  So here goes….  (Sorry, it gets long-winded.)\n\n\n\n\nAlright, I’m going to come out and say it.  As mentally unstable the Wizard is, he is my favorite suitor, with dark horse* (note: not an actual horse) Jieun coming in at a close second.  That’s right.  Baby bunny FTW, you know, if the Wizard didn’t exist and all.\n\nIn order to understand what a crazy puppetmaster and schemer the Wizard is, let’s first take a look at our suitors and their motivations for being in The Game.\n\nBossy, opinionated Jiwoo doesn’t give a ♥♥♥♥ about romancing your ♥♥♥.  In fact, the only reason he’s playing The Game is because he wants to run away from his old life.  I know, technically he wants revenge on his “family”, but eventually, he changes that to wanting a fresh start.  If he happens to lose his memories, painful as they are, so much the better.  As for serious contenders, Jiwoo is pretty down there on the bottom of the list.\n\nMuch like Jiwoo, Jiyeon (that ♥♥♥♥ing heartbreaker…. all the tears I cried for him) wants revenge and/or a fresh start since his world no longer holds anything he cares about.  He’d be going home to an empty life.  If you don’t play his route, he seems perfectly happy; if you can take the abuse of chasing him down, then yeah, eventually he’ll be happy and all, but really I think he just wants to be left alone.\n\nBeautiful Jihae also doesn’t give a ♥♥♥♥ about romancing your ♥♥♥.  He’s too hung up on his past lady and being uber depressed about her to even notice you have boobs.  In fact, the only reason he’s playing The Game is because Jieun is making him!  Does he care if he wins the heart of a new lady love?  No.  He had already surrendered to his depressingly overwhelming need to be needed, dedicating (tenfold) his life to caring for Prince Jieun.  So, not a contender.\n\nThe rabbit prince, while my darling, also has no desire to actually win your heart, or the game.  He wants Jihae (”Eddy”) to be happy, and so the two are each wishing the other would win, but never striving to win themselves.\nFor all four of these characters, it isn’t until you start trying to win them over that they take notice of you.  But pay attention to the phrasing there: You win them over.  YOU.  WIN.  Not them.  They are still pretty much inactive players in The Game.\n\nWhich brings us to Jisoo, the only player of The Game who is actually trying to win.  Even in routes outside of his own, Jisoo tries to appeal to Heejung, whether it’s as the big brother “please depend on me” type, a confidant, or an outright rival to the suitor in question, and this is because he is the ONLY ONE with something to lose if he does not win.  If he does not win, his sister will die.  End of story.  So yeah, he tries real hard, whether you notice him doing so or not because you’re making moony eyes over some other dude is irrelephant.  Even the Wizard himself had said that Jisoo had been his choice to win the game, but stick a pin in that and we’ll come back to it.\n\nAs gorgeous and mostly dependable as he is, Jisoo is not without his flaws.  He has a violent jealous streak that is frightening under normal circumstances, and CRAZY TERRIFYING when he finally snaps (see the bad ending OMG).\n\nEnter the Wizard.  (My husbando.)  So far we have 4 not-entirely-committed players, and one must-win player with a history of violence, who has been hand-picked as the prize-horse* (note: not actual horse) by the Game organizer.  Naturally, The Wizard must have known about Jisoo’s violent temper and jealousy, and therefore knew he was a ticking time bomb. He must have hoped that he would win so that Jisoo’s relationship with Heejung would eventually become so abusive that Heejung would have a desperate wish, and then, FINALLY, meet The Wizard (possibly again?), and he can step in and save her.\n\nThe Wizard is really such a tragic character, constantly being denied his own happiness, it’s no wonder why he’s so twisted.  I really wished that he had his own “after” route that we could play through.  He sacrificed everything he was just to be with Heejung, not even fully knowing if it would work.  Since he wished, he probably lost his memories, but you know what?  I think that’s okay.  He would wake up without the pain and bitterness that twisted his personality like it did, next to the one he loved so much.  Granted, he wouldn’t remember that either, but, this way they could start off and build a real, true, lasting love.  That’s a story I want to play.","December 31, 2015","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most simulation dating games either focus to much on meaningless stats and tasks or on the story with maybe a few options here and there. Dandelion combines both of these elements well, and even has me engrossed in the story along with its characters (including the MC!). Not only do the men you choose from have personality but so does Heejung, and even though she is her own person I still feel that I am her or she is a version of me if I lived in her shoes. So far I've only played Jiwoo's route, and got the good ending I believe, but I'm more than excited to get every possible combination and unravel this story. The only thing that could have been done better would be more chances to interact with the men and perhaps story options mid cutscene instead of just during gameplay when it only causes minor changes to relationship status.","November 28, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once I had finished all routes and unlocked the “true ending”, my mind was BLOWN.  For days and days afterward, my head was absolutely consumed with only thoughts of the Wizard, swimming with all sorts of thoughts, and it wasn’t until now that I think I have found a platform on which to share said thoughts.  So here goes….  (Sorry, it gets long-winded.)\n\n\n\n\nAlright, I’m going to come out and say it.  As mentally unstable the Wizard is, he is my favorite suitor, with dark horse* (note: not an actual horse) Jieun coming in at a close second.  That’s right.  Baby bunny FTW, you know, if the Wizard didn’t exist and all.\n\nIn order to understand what a crazy puppetmaster and schemer the Wizard is, let’s first take a look at our suitors and their motivations for being in The Game.\n\nBossy, opinionated Jiwoo doesn’t give a ♥♥♥♥ about romancing your ♥♥♥.  In fact, the only reason he’s playing The Game is because he wants to run away from his old life.  I know, technically he wants revenge on his “family”, but eventually, he changes that to wanting a fresh start.  If he happens to lose his memories, painful as they are, so much the better.  As for serious contenders, Jiwoo is pretty down there on the bottom of the list.\n\nMuch like Jiwoo, Jiyeon (that ♥♥♥♥ing heartbreaker…. all the tears I cried for him) wants revenge and/or a fresh start since his world no longer holds anything he cares about.  He’d be going home to an empty life.  If you don’t play his route, he seems perfectly happy; if you can take the abuse of chasing him down, then yeah, eventually he’ll be happy and all, but really I think he just wants to be left alone.\n\nBeautiful Jihae also doesn’t give a ♥♥♥♥ about romancing your ♥♥♥.  He’s too hung up on his past lady and being uber depressed about her to even notice you have boobs.  In fact, the only reason he’s playing The Game is because Jieun is making him!  Does he care if he wins the heart of a new lady love?  No.  He had already surrendered to his depressingly overwhelming need to be needed, dedicating (tenfold) his life to caring for Prince Jieun.  So, not a contender.\n\nThe rabbit prince, while my darling, also has no desire to actually win your heart, or the game.  He wants Jihae (”Eddy”) to be happy, and so the two are each wishing the other would win, but never striving to win themselves.\nFor all four of these characters, it isn’t until you start trying to win them over that they take notice of you.  But pay attention to the phrasing there: You win them over.  YOU.  WIN.  Not them.  They are still pretty much inactive players in The Game.\n\nWhich brings us to Jisoo, the only player of The Game who is actually trying to win.  Even in routes outside of his own, Jisoo tries to appeal to Heejung, whether it’s as the big brother “please depend on me” type, a confidant, or an outright rival to the suitor in question, and this is because he is the ONLY ONE with something to lose if he does not win.  If he does not win, his sister will die.  End of story.  So yeah, he tries real hard, whether you notice him doing so or not because you’re making moony eyes over some other dude is irrelephant.  Even the Wizard himself had said that Jisoo had been his choice to win the game, but stick a pin in that and we’ll come back to it.\n\nAs gorgeous and mostly dependable as he is, Jisoo is not without his flaws.  He has a violent jealous streak that is frightening under normal circumstances, and CRAZY TERRIFYING when he finally snaps (see the bad ending OMG).\n\nEnter the Wizard.  (My husbando.)  So far we have 4 not-entirely-committed players, and one must-win player with a history of violence, who has been hand-picked as the prize-horse* (note: not actual horse) by the Game organizer.  Naturally, The Wizard must have known about Jisoo’s violent temper and jealousy, and therefore knew he was a ticking time bomb. He must have hoped that he would win so that Jisoo’s relationship with Heejung would eventually become so abusive that Heejung would have a desperate wish, and then, FINALLY, meet The Wizard (possibly again?), and he can step in and save her.\n\nThe Wizard is really such a tragic character, constantly being denied his own happiness, it’s no wonder why he’s so twisted.  I really wished that he had his own “after” route that we could play through.  He sacrificed everything he was just to be with Heejung, not even fully knowing if it would work.  Since he wished, he probably lost his memories, but you know what?  I think that’s okay.  He would wake up without the pain and bitterness that twisted his personality like it did, next to the one he loved so much.  Granted, he wouldn’t remember that either, but, this way they could start off and build a real, true, lasting love.  That’s a story I want to play.","December 31, 2015","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adamhateseve/recommended/321290/","adamhateseve","Savvi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adamhateseve/","69 products in account","Allow me to preface this with a confession. Dating sims are my one true guilty pleasure, and when I say guilty, I mean lock the door, wear headphones, how do I keep people from seeing how many hours I've clocked in with this, it's time to make a salt circle amounts of guilt. That said, most of my enjoyment for the genre comes from a purely cynical place -- I play them because the one dimensional characters, insufferably girly and dense main protagonists, cliche plots and belittling premise of the vast majority of dating sims is utterly hilarious to me. I have a good time of playing them, either with a friend or by myself, and tearing into the faults or pointing out the ridiculousness of them. And I thought I was going to get that here, too. At first glance, this game appears to be a completely unorthodox concept -- touch the butts of your cats and rabbits that are actually hunky guys. I really looked forward to getting a laugh out this -- play it for a bit, then drop it when I couldn't stand it anymore.\n\nThat was not the case. 'Dandelion, Wishes Brought to You;, is a game with an unorthodox premise that is, without a doubt, one of the most unique and intriguing twists to the dating sim genre that I have ever seen. I immediately became engrossed with the story and characters, who unlike the ilk featured in other products, are well thought out, well rounded, and diverse. I fell in love with every character after only a short time, even the main protagonist (who I believe to be the hardest thing for dating sims to get right). I caught myself on the edge of my seat numerous times, waiting for the next piece of the story to fall into place, and damned if my anticipation wasn't rewarded with every small unveiling to a character's back story, or the plot itself (which has such a shocking climax and reveal that my head is still whirling). For that alone, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. Not cynically, either. I recommend this game because its story and characters make it stand out as a masterpiece among other dating sims. I've completed several different routes, seen some amazing endings, and know that I haven't even scratched the surface yet.\n\nThat said, the game does have its faults. The fact that the game must always be online is a particular fault that's been beaten to death by other reviewers, so I won't go too in depth on the subject, other than to say that I understand why it's necessary. Cheritz it's a small company (with only two games currently under its belt, I believe) based out of South Korea, where the problem with internet piracy is extremely severe. I want this company to succeed, after seeing what they're capable of, and if that means I have to play the game with a decent internet connection, that's fine with me. I support the decision, as difficult as that is to say (Error: 37, never forget), but here it isn't just some dumb move by some CEO that doesn't understand how games or gamers' work. Cheritz has this in place because they need to make sure they can make money off their game, and not be ruined by internet piracy. Even if it's a bit frustrating.\nOther complaints range between repeating yourself quite a bit while you play -- the utter monotony is divided well between interactions with the boys and cut scenes, I think, and once you're in the flow of things, bouncing between your choice of animal boy, doing laundry, drawing, and taking a bubble bath (to name a few) becomes so second nature you don't really get bothered by it. I can see how this could be a major problem to some players -- the 'you get to do one thing today, because logically it'll take you the whole day to talk to the plants or arrange your 'meaties and veggies' thing is a bit frustrating, but a familiar mechanic in this sort of game. You also have to maintain levels of femininity, beauty and art skill (with the intention of being suitable for your suiter, which I've always found to be a bit of BS) along with balancing your stress and pressure. Personally, I enjoyed having to monitor stress and pressure -- it added an appreciated level of difficulty, as having these stats go too high has consequence (from the dreaded chicken to watching "boring normal guy" desperately try to get some booty), but if you didn't come here to juggle stats, you may be less than thrilled.\nAaaaand the translation errors. I thought them pretty endearing a first, but as the game went on, I found myself more and more annoyed by the grammatical, html and other text errors, especially when they dare show up during a scene that was meant to have some emotional weight. However, all and all, my experience was never flat out ruined by this -- I merely wished there was more polish at times, especially during serious or somber moments.\n\nOh, the somber moments. Those are what sold this to me, to be honest. This isn't a game where you pick a guy to touch butts with and then go to prom. There's a dark dark cloud lingering over ever interaction. I won't spoil anything, but needless to say, you'll reach a point while playing where you'll get hit, and hit hard. If you prepare to die in Dark Souls, than be prepared to cry in Dandelion. It's a simple interface, with simple design, but damn it if it doesn't know how to tell a story that will get you right in the feels.","May 28, 2015","true","67.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to say I did feel the wizard and his character/plot didn't really get that developed but he was cool/creepy enough either way.\n\nRight after finishing this I bought their game 'Nameless' and I can't wait to start playing it as I'm sure it's just as good if not better than this which is hard to imagine.","February 16, 2015","true","61.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one seems to have it all, great story, lovable characters (even the "villian"), beautiful art and music. This game will warm your heart one minute and break it the next. My only complaint is that it was very slow with story progression. I would often become bored with the stat raising in between scenes. Though in the end it was worth it for the overall experience!","May 12","true","40.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I decided to give it a try when I saw Dodger and Cry play it on her Youtube channel. The storylines of all the characters were great, which made it easy to fall in love with every one of them. The art was also very nice and pleasing to the eye. The only thing that put me off was the large amount of grinding. Doing the same thing over and over again gets boring after a while, but if you really enjoy romance, I would recommend this game.","June 3","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
