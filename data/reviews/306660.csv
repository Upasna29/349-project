I say 'little' because the core game is the Battle for Gettysburg (of course) drawn out over 5 or 6 different scenarios. But, this is an indie game, and a great one at that, and if this doesn't sound like much, the devil is in the details.\n\nContent-wise, UG:G is quality over quantity. This may annoy some people, but for those that appreciate variation on a theme, the game offers a lot of replayability and it's clear that the developers have done as much as they can to offer as much replayability as possible within the constraints of the game. Firstly, you can play as either the Union or Confederates. Secondly, you can choose 9 or so different enemy AI types which all change the decision making process for the enemy on the field. Lastly, your actions and achievements in each scenario affect the way the game plays out, allowing you to choose from a number of concurrent scenarios that change depending on whether or not you managed to fulfill the goals of the mission before. Multiply all these options together, and for the price you get a decent amount of gameplay.\n\nThe control scheme is ingenious and the method with which you relay orders to your units allows for a great deal of finesse and control on the battlefield. Instead of clicking on each point you want your units to walk in a straight line to, you draw the path you want them to take, and the units follow said path. You can flank, withdraw, shift focus, push forward, and more all with one smooth swipe of the mouse, and it allows for a great deal of tactical control without you having to monitor every individual step the units take. I've seen some complaints about orders not working or unit AI performing incorrectly, but I've never had any such experience.\n\nThe topography of the map is fantastic - Gettysburg is accurately represented, and the cover-rating for your units changes dynamically as they move from open grass, to forest, to hedges, to homesteads. This cover rating is essential to survival (as in real life), and it all makes sense - when you move into an area that you think should give you cover, it does, and vice versa. You'll find the enemy responds to your attempts to flank them, and you'll want to watch you don't overextend yourself, or the enemy will exploit your failures. Your frontline will ebb and flow as the balance of power changes in particular areas, and you're rewarded realistically for pressing your advantages, and punished with a stalemate, or worse, if you fail to take the opportunities you get.\n\nI feel that this game would have benefitted from covering a larger part of the civil war, and one criticism I could level at it is that it's indeed constrained by its focus on one single battle. In saying that, I only want more because it's so enjoyable, and I think that in focussing their attention, the development team have managed to perfect their game mechanics, which makes for a much more solid and refined product, so perhaps it's not really a criticism after all?\n\nThe other point I'd make is that whilst the mechanics that are in place all work well and feel very fresh, there isn't a whole lot of tactical depth in terms of the commands you can issue to the units. Your command extends as far as telling them where to go, who to attack, when to charge, and when to stop. While this all works well and provides a fun experience, there isn't a lot of variation amongst the commands, that again might have led to the game feeling fuller. But, all that said, I don't feel shortchanged, only like I want to play more and more and more. I haven't played multiplayer as of yet, so I'm dying to try the game out against a human opponent.\n\nUG:G is one of the most innovative and entertaining tactical RTS games I've ever played, and I highly recommend it to any strategy fan.","December 31, 2014","true","3.3"," 177 of 193 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","177","193","3","4"

And he's turned us all into gluttonous brats named Augustus Gloop. His games all exude a simple charm that has the tendency to steal hours from a person's life and become evidence "exhibit A" in about every other divorce court in the country. None of his games are exempt, from his Railroad Tycoon games to his maddeningly "just one more turn" addictive Civilization games. I remember playing his Sid Meier's Gettysburg! in 1998 and thinking it was the best civil war strategy game to ever grace the PC. I stumbled upon my old Gettysburg! disk the other day, but unfortunately, the game has aged terribly. Father Time has watered down and diluted Meier's twinkling charm. Oh, Father Time, you great and terrible killjoy!\n\nEnter Ultimate General:Gettysburg. Created by a modder named Darth who specializes in Creative Assembly's venerable Total War series, Darth has pretty much recrafted Sid's wonderful software toy and fashioned it into a trip down memory lane, only better! The graphics are updated, the AI is a force to be reckoned with, and the game even has its own ambient flare, reverse zoom and you see the fancy wooden trim of the dining room table you are in fact playing a living board game on. Covering the Battle of Gettysburg in its four day entirety, the game bleeds history, and branches of alternate history depending upon the decisions you make regarding your generals. The gameplay mechanics are not quite grognard level, but they're well beyond Facebook Farmville antics. Mouse lassoing of units, and point and click movement orders, troop movements dictated by drag and drop strategy lines, it's all here. I loaded the game up just to check it out, and I spent a weekend playing through the whole campaign on both sides. It's not often a game gets its hooks in me like that, but I love when it does. It's these times I'm truly honored to be a PC gamer.\n\nThe cartoonlike artstyle of the board, and the soldiers which are actually sprites, (and do admittedly leave a longing for the ability to zoom down one more notch for a closer look) are crafted as lovingly as even the bold sinewy text of the location names. In another reference to the wonderful Roald Dahl, remember the sign in the school in Matilda's class that Ms. Trunchbull had erected, "If you're having fun, then you're not learning!"? Well, this game proves that notion a simple fallacy because UGG not only proves that you can learn history by playing a computer game, but also that you can have a grandiose good time while doing so.","October 16, 2014","true","24.0"," 210 of 236 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","210","236","14","8"

Hold your ground and wait for reinforcements? Even better yet, is that your troops and their stats are carried over from each stage.

For those who want an American Civil War (ACW) stratagy game, here it is.\nThe game is centered around the battle of Gettysburg July 1-3(4) 1863. In the main mode (Main Menu-Start new battle) you can fight the battle of Gettysburg as the Union or Confederacy, and choose your opponent AI (9 types of AI: Adds a lot to replay value). The battle is fought in Scenarios, each one being triggered one after the other depending on what you accomplished in the last one you fought. There are more scenarios than I can count honestly. You keep fighting through scenario's untill you fully defeat the enemy, of you run out of time. You can also end up fighting battles on July 4, which is interesting because this never happend in history. All of the possible scenarios are playable in the "Custom battle" section of the main menu. Multiplayer is also fun to do, but there are not nearly as many scenario's as there are in single player, which can be good or bad, depending on your view point. But here is a list of pro's and con's.\n\nPros: Helpful and thorough tutorial videos.\nCombat is easy to learn and master.\nBrigades are historically numbered.\nCorps and Brigades have historical commanders (Archer,Pender,John Reynolds, Richard S. Ewell, Ect.)\nArtillery has been fixed with the hotfixes.\nArt. is ballanced so it isn't devestating with casualties, but does lots of morale damage.\nGood map design and elevation.\nTONS of replay value with harder AI and (probably) over 30 scenarios.\nMultiplayer-compatible\nNo scenario is completley impossible.\n\nCONS: All units look the same (Iron bridage doesn't wear black hats)\nNo steam workshop\nArtillery can sometimes not fire even though they are looking over a field from a hill.\nThe "Texas brigade", supposedly one of the best southern brigades, has terrible morale.\nGame can freeze (this issue is being dealt with by developers)\nReinforcements will come earlier for the enemy than they will when you play as them.\nNOTE: I personally think that it would have been better to include more battles in this game, like Antietam, Second Manasas, Shiloh, ect. If not that, at least a map/battle editor so we could make those battles. A steam workshop would also be really nice.\nOVERALL: 9.5/10. Awesome game. Would definatly reccomend it for people if they asked. I wish these people would make more games like this, so here are some ideas. Ultimate General: Waterloo, Ultimate General: The American Civil War, Ultimate General: Napoleon (battles of Napoleonic era). And why stop there? The possibilities are endless.\n\nEDIT: +1.5 for the addition of Night battles and artillery limbering.","November 30, 2014","true","35.6"," 89 of 97 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","89","97","2","0"

I recognize that no game, no matter how well written would be able to capture 100% the reality of that, but this game lacks all of those elements and for me fails on so many levels and makes the game unable to hold my interests.\n\nThe game does offer much as a strategy game and I do acknowledge the many good things about this game which the vast majority of reviewers have already pointed out, but I must provide a negative review in order to provide balance to others considering purchasing the game.\n\nThe game touts itself a a simulation of Gettysburg and as such I would expect it to use as much of the real commands and tactics as possible for a game, a goal that Sid Meier's Gettysburg better achieved, although that game had many short comings as well.\n\nTo make this an effective civil war startegy game I should be able to issue commands to units that real commanders would issue.  There is too much automation in the way the troops behave and act.  It seems that the only thing I can tell the troops is where to go.  I can not make a decision on how to form, single battle line, double  battle line, etc.  These were critical decisions a commander would make deciding where he needed strength (double line) and where he needed to guard the flanks (single line)  I might even want to order a unit to "dig in"  I really only have once choice for forming my units and they are made for me,\n\nIf I have a brigade arriving to the rear, I might want to position them in a certain location to be ready to reinforce my line, but as soon as I do that they move from colomn formation to a line formation.  In fact, if I even order a unit to halt, they will move from column to battle line.  This denies me the tactical decision to leave a brigade in the faster moving column formation until I decide to move them into a battle line.  I can't order my calvary to mount or dismount,  Gamble's skirmishers remain skirmishers.  In reality, once the infantry arrived, I would order them to mount up and guard the flanks or scout the north or west, but  I can't do that again denying me important tactical decisions.  I can't order my artillary to limber up or un-limber and the artillary seems to move the same regardless taking away another important decision that can make or break a battle.     When I order a unit to "Fall Back" an experience unit would accept this to mean a slow withdrawl while fighting a delaying action an orderly process to tactically reposition the troops.  Instead it looks more like a retreat, even with high morale units.\n\nAll too often, units  are automatically moving to "face the enemy" again denying me the tactical decision to maintain my line unless I specifically remember to tell them to hold.  In reallity they should hold the line unless they are told to skirmish.  A unit in real life would never make a move like that.  This often creates units with their flanks in the air when my intentions was to have their flanks anchored by other units or natural obstacles.   It seems I have a whole army of Dan Sickles.\n\nLooking in the release notes I see there is work pending on group commands and obliques but not sure if these pending additions will significantly improve these limitations.   I also wished there was more granularity in the units as primarily I can only control at the brigade level.  It would be nice if I could issue orders at either the regimental or brigade level.  For civil war history buffs the role of regiments is of high interest and a good civil war game that fails to recognize the regiment falls short of satisfying a civil war enthusist.  Players should be able to control both the regimental and brigade level units.  For example, order a brigade to form a double battle line, but during the battle, order a specific regiment in that line to move to a single battle line at the end of the brigade to guard the flank.  I should be able to order a single regiment for form a skirmish line in front of the brigade or order the regiment at the end of the brigade to wheel right or left to avoid having my flank in the air.  While having division and corps commanders in the game adds historical interest and recognizes these hostoric figures I agree that the way the are implented in the game is correct.  Since these roles were more strategic and administative there is not need for tactical commands at the division or corps level.  I do look forward to the addition of divisional commander characters to add depth to the game.  But the lack of regimental/brigade level tactical commands is a big dissapointment.  Ideally, I should be able to issue commands to those units like a real commander would and they would react based on how experienced and well drilled they are.  For example. ordering a unit to form a double battle line might be done quickly and smartly for a well drilled and experienced unit but a little slower for a new unit.  To me it appears that the developers lack a deep understanding of civil war tactics and army procedures.  Even little things like the fact that I issue a "run" command instead of a "double time" command.  Nitpicking for sure and an easy fix, but perhaps a symptom of how far off this game is from being a true civil war strategy and tactics game.\n\nSo bottom line, a lot of hard work went into this game.  The map is beatiful and the game is playable as a basic, simple, strategy game, but as a game claiming to be a civil war strategy game, it lacks sufficient depth at this time to be a rich and satisfying game of civil war strategy and tactics.  In a toss up between this game and Sid Meir's Gettysburg, Sid would win.  While I hope there is substantial improvement between the early access and final release I can not recommend the game at this time.  However, at the early access price of only $9.99 it is worth a look by any strategy game fan and I hope that our early support and honest feedback will encourage the developers to improve on the game and help it to rise to the level of one of the best civil war strategy games ever.\n\nGood luck.","June 14, 2014","false","5.7"," 757 of 1,056 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","757","1","4","51"

The arcade-style battles and simplified gameplay experience? If so, you are in the same boat as me. Been watching the development of this game for some time and now that it's released all I have to say is good things about it. The combat is excellent, AI is smart, even on the lowest level.. The grandiose strategy of it will give the most experienced strategy gamer a challenge as you are commanding tens of thousands of troops. The complex morale system forces you to be wary of how your batallions are faring against the enemy forces. This adds a new level of strategic planning by having to sub in reserve batallions to support your exhausted and morale stricken ones.\n\nThe only thing I'd like to see is a multiplayer feature. I feel this game would be excellent in a 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or even 4v4 gameplay mode considering how many troops you are in command of. It's almost overwhelming at times when it gets to the pinnacle of the battle. It would be a nice feature if each player commanded a corps of the army and joined in the battle at set time limits pertaining to historical accuracy.\n\nThus, I rate it a 10/10 and hope to see further add ons and features.

In other games like this *Cough*Total War*Chough* when one attempts to make the game more difficult, the computer simply gains ridiculous advantages over the human as the difficulty goes up, for instance, militia units who normally run at the first sign of the enemy, miraculously turn into the Cold Stream Guards in terms of resilience and fighting ability. In Ultimate General: Gettysburg, the computer gets no advantages, it simply out plays you. It notices weaknesses that you have not seen, it flanks, it charges, it hammers you with ungodly amounts of artillery. Simply put, this AI should be able to give any skill level player a run for their money.\nAnd the final Pro is that the game makers actually listen to the community. As someone who has had early access since the open beta, I can tell you that they have made many changes to the game based off of the testers comments.\n\nCons:\nAs of right now there is not a thriving multiplayer community, so most if not all of my games occur against the AI. Now, that should change as it has just been released to the Steam store so as more people buy it, it should be much easier to get a multiplayer matchup.\nYou may encounter a rare glitch in the game where troops move the wrong way or you take losses without being fired upon, however, these are quite rare as most if not 99.99% of such glitches having been removed and fixed already. If it does happen, report it through the in-game bug reporter tool or on the forums and it will get fixed quickly.\n\nOverall:\nThis is one outstanding game. Neither side is overpowered, both having their own advantages and disadvantages.

It's absolutely one of my favorites and I'll definitely be playing it for a long time.\n\nIt's hard to describe, but it's a game about managing your territory vs your strength. Each 'game' is essentially a single long battle that is punctuated by short breaks, so unit statistics carry all the way through. Morale and Condition of your troops are only restored a little bit between phases of battle, so they're a precious resource.\n\nBecause of this the whole game has a fascinating flow to it where you have directed the whole campaign, as it escalates gradually into a massive battle.

Have been looking for a civil war strategy game for a long time that is not a mod. It being an indie game is not bad. It reminds me of sids civil war game back in like 2000. Needs more work done definetly. It would be great to see the devs allow full control and placement of your troops like other rts games. Do definetly enjoy this game so far and hope it goes into further depth in unit control. Maybe a lil high priced for the restrictions of unit control. (update) I've put some more time into the game especially after the most current update and I have to say kudos!!! The game is really starting to feel rts now, given I am a person who prefers RTS over almost any other game, from the fist C&C to Startcraft, Warcraft, Shogun TW, Sid meier's civil war (look it up), all these titles I've enjoyed. Now this game is starting to feel like it should. One thing that would make the setting more right would be uniforms. For the union maybe add some regiments with red pants for custom battles but for the campaign definetly would be great to see a mix for rebel uniforms for we all know not all the rebs had decent military uniforms. That would be the next thing I would recommend on possibly doing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/recommended/306660/","bloodravensid","Blood Ravens - AWAY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/","926 products in account","The GameA great game that demonstrates about the battles of Gettysburg, that allows we to change history, by altering strategies, and creating new opportunities. The game is played on real-time. There is no base building in this game, or unit building in this game, in this game you get new units/reinforcements as in history, thus this game have no unit building at all.\n\nThe Mechanics of RTSWhat is quite different with regular RTS is that this game have few types of units : infantry, skirmishers, cavalry, and artillery. There is only few differences between Union and Confederates units, the Confederates are better at charging, where the Union are better at shooting. This game use "truesight", which the shooting range of a unit is defined by whether it can see its enemies or not, and unit on elevated/higher position can shot farther than units at lower position. Also, hills and terrain contours play a lot of effect in this game, as ridges and hills could afford a defensible place to shot down, and units could also take cover behind the hills from pounding artillery or from other units. Aside from elevation, terrain also play a key, units located on wooded terrain will be protected better from enemy fire.\n\nUnits fight by firing each other, and get to melee/hand-to-hand combat. Because of the similarities of unit statistics, the important thing is not the units itself, but how the player positions the units. Some units do have "veteran" status, like the Union Iron Brigade, but the most important thing is where you place the unit.\n\nPros    This game have no political correctness. This game properly displays the Confederate flag as it is, as in history and as in facts that has happened and can't be changed again.\nAllows change the tide of history. This game is separated into few battles : the first day, the second day, etc. If the Union didn't manage to slow the Confederates advance to Seminary Hill on day one (which they did in history) the Union position on the next battle will be more pressed towards Culp's Hill. If Union manages to counter-attack and capture McPherson Ridge, the Confederates will lose a strategic hill to position their artillery on the next battle. After each battle, you are given a choice on what to do. As a Union who has successfuly delay the Confederates, do you wish to counter-attack and try to regain McPherson Ridge? Or counter-attack to the North East? Or fortify your position with "fish-hook" position on Cemetery Hill? So much option.\nUI is good. The UI clearly show how your units is doing, and what type of units that is. Though the UI could gain improvement by giving out small details on what is cover or what is this thing or that thing.\nQuite accurate historically. The brigades, division, and corps name are named as they did in history. The name of places also accurate enough, complete with elevation, contour, terrain, etc.\nGraphic is great. I really love the "arrow" you made when you order your units to move somewhere. The overall "drawing" really appeals to me.\nCons    This game have no clear tutorial. The tutorial are only bunch of videos which are not clear enough.\nYou can't deploy your units according to your will. After each battle, though you can choose your strategy, you can't place your units by yourself. If your Cutler Brigade is somewhere east, they begin the battle in the east, though you prefer them to be in the west.\nLack of content. This is a minor gripe. After playing and replaying the game for some time, I get bored and wishes for more battles.\nThis game is very recommended for RTS players, most notably people who are interested in American Civil War and gunpowder era.","November 1, 2015","true","8.6"," 76 of 108 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","76","108","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/306660/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Chances are, you’ve never played a real-time strategy game with a narrow focus on the Battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War. Sid Meier’s Gettysburg! in 1997 was in my mind last good game to center itself around this battle, and many would consider it the “gold standard” in wargaming during the Civil War, but it’s been far too long since that game. Nick Thomadis, creator of the DarthMod for the Total War series is taking his shot at the major historical battle as Game Labs, by recreating Gettysburg with interesting freedom of choice with Ultimate General: Gettysburg.\n\nGettysburg, Pennsylvania is where the South’s advances to invade the North were stopped. The Confederate Army had suffered substantial losses, as did The Union. The grand total of losses between both sides made it the most casualties recorded in all of American history. The strategies involved from both sides made great use of the terrain, manpower, and efficiency. With only three achievements, it is clear the focus of the game is not about performing specific feats or reaching arbitrary goals, it’s all about strategy.\n\nUltimate General: Gettysburg is historically lenient, allowing you to play both sides and potentially emerge the victor even if historically they did not record The Confederates as winning. But the game allows for this to happen should you do enough to use your army of larger numbers to great effect. What if Cemetery Hill couldn’t be defended and was overran? What if on the third day the Confederates were not repulsed, and the battle continued into a fourth and final day? The game explores these “what if” scenarios to great detail and, feels natural. Even if you go wildly outside the textbooks, the game manages to be fun, tense, and completely engaging from beginning to end.\n\nThere are only tutorial videos to show you the basics, as there isn’t anything in-game to transition you into the game, proper. Thanks to Ultimate General: Gettysburg‘s clean UI, and there’s no base building, tech trees, or even producing units. It sounds simplified, but it’s anything but. The game’s difficulty is dictated by nine personality traits that will serve as the difficulty of the game. This gives you a customization of how you want the opposition to think and react to your decisions. For instance, you can set the difficulty to “easy”, but also make the opposition aggressive. You’ll be often charged and attacked frequently, but they are easy to repel. So there’s a balance and a sense of being overcome, but if you’re not that good of a strategist, you may normally lose. Here it gives just the right amount of challenge.\n\nThe controls are simple enough, simply click on a unit and drag towards where you want them to go. An arrow will be painting on the screen to show you where they are headed, and will remain on screen till they arrive at their destination. The only downside I didn’t like to this method was sometimes it seems to work against you if you try to loop back. Like say you have an artillery unit and you want to make it turn once it is in place to face the enemy. I found trying to do a small turn will make it try to undo the path as the game thinks you are trying to erase the line. Otherwise the controls work well enough. There are buttons on the side to halt, fall back, or tell the troops to hold the position.\n\nThe map is incredibly well recreated, most history fans should be pleased in that regard. little points on the map representing farms and such can be used as cover by your troops. Troops also have to reload, and get tired after marching a long distance. You’ll be at a disadvantage if you march your units halfway across the map and engaged with a foe that has been waiting for you. It also takes into account elevation regarding aim. You can use the M key to toggle very helpful elevation lines. I loved using the elevation lines to find the highest points to place my artillery to bombard the enemies.\n\nThe graphics are fairly plain, however, with the units being simple (and somewhat tiny) sprites, though I do feel they suit the game. Once I got into it I wasn’t too concerned on how things looked. There was just too much going on. The game sounds great for what it is, occasionally hearing the Calvary charge playing or the sounds of the gunfire. After a battle the ground will be littered with little tiny corpses.\n\nMorale and condition come into effect, working in conjunction with one another. Simply having more units does not make for a decisive victory in an engagement. Your condition can be lessened by running too often or even walking too far. And being too far away from reinforcements can be costly. The artificial intelligence driving both sides are incredibly smart. Units will rout, withdrawing from the ensuing battle and will not let themselves succumb to being slaughtered. Retreating units cannot be selected. It’s laughable to see that in their minds, “all is lost” and they have to gather themselves before re-entering the battle.\n\nThe real Battle of Gettysburg lasted three days. The way the game handles this, is by sundown the day is over. There’s a green timer that spans the day, and even dispatches units at the exact time of day they are believed to be sent. If a battle is delayed by charging or being engaged in some other manner, a red timer runs its course. Once fully expired, the tug-of-war battle is stopped. You then enter an intermission screen, appearing in a faux-war room to determine the next course of action. And it is here that you maintain historical accuracy, or choose to deviate and even prevent losses or turn the tide of battle quicker. And once the next day begins, depending on your choices, your units will be fresh and placed where they are supposed to be. In order to be successful, “Victory Points” are historically relevant and are essential to winning – a term that is used loosely when talking about Gettysburg.\n\nEach game is different every time you play, and makes replayability even on the one map feel completely different from one another. And being able to play both sides really adds depth, and a show of compassion to the North and South of the Civil War.\n\nUltimate General: Gettysburg lives up to the name, making you feel as if you were actually a general, where important command decisions can be made, whether historically real or ficticious. This is a wargamer’s dreams realized. Even if Gettysburg isn’t your historical battle of choice, it is one you should not miss playing. Game Labs’ vision of Gettysburg a blueprint for the future of the Ultimate General series to succeed going forward, and presents the RTS genre with new and exciting ways to play that I enjoyed so thoroughly.","April 7","true","12.5"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","31","34","2","2"

Perhaps the best game on the Battle of Gettysburg, was Sid Meiers'; and it was great for it's day.  But technology has progressed much since then and for me at least, there was a desire to have a game based on the Battle of Gettysburg, using the latest programming techniques.  This game, Ultimate General: Gettysburg seems to take advantage of that.\nThe game is easy to get into, with the AI controlling not only the opponent in single player, but your unattended units as well.  Commands, either by keyboard keys, or mouse clicks are easy to remember and not complicated at all.  Objectives are clearly presented before each battle, so there's an opportunity to plan your attack before entering the battle.  And with over 160 battles (Union and Conferderates combined, including the difficulty levels), there's plenty of "play" in this title, making if well worth the $15 (USD).\nWhat would make this title even more interesting is if the developer were to inclued a "sandbox" mode in SP, where one could create their own order of battles.

You move your regiments in an elegant way, allowing you to make swinging flanking manuevers or try a blitz attacks on the center or create choke points that limits the enemy's movement or whatever crazy idea you can come up with.\n\nDue to the slower pace of the game, your mistakes won't be immediatly noticable. You might be running your regiments into a death trap and you'll only find out 5 mins later, when it's too late to still salvage the situation, or is it? If you're a genius, maybe you can still turn things in your favour (i have yet to find out :p).\n\n\nIn terms of content the game is somewhat limited.\nYou only get to fight gettysburg, but it is split up into multiple battles spanning 3 to 4 days, with a few battles per day. So one campaign usually involves around 10 battles, but it varies.\nWhile this is limited, it does have a lot of replayability. Your success or failure on the battlefield will affect the next battles, so not one campaign will have the same outcome.\nOn top of that there are 9 AI settings which can give you a different kind of opponent to fight which in turn can affect the way your campaign goes.\nAnd offcourse you can fight with either the Union or the Confederates giving you 2 different campaigns.\n\n\nAnyway, i think i've typed more than enough already.\nIf you're a strategy fan then this is a must buy.\nMaybe you will like it, maybe you wont, but at 12€ you can't really go wrong.\nEven if you don't really like the game, i'm sure as a strategy fan you will appreciate what these developers have created.\nI eagerly await to see which campaign will be featured in the next ultimate general game.","October 19, 2014","true","15.7"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","1"

Rather than simply saying "Easy, Normal or Hard" The AI can be set to aggressive, passive, intelligent or bumbling and makes mistakes that feel so human. Defeat feels natural considering the battle enters "phases" of reformation. Playing with different styles makes it feel original without just giving the army unfair boons to make it more difficult. (I'm looking at you, Rome Total War 2.) The ebb and flow of battle really helps you understand how Gettysburg actually played out.\n\nNot convinced on buying this game yet? I'll run you through one of my scenarios. I'm running a pretty standard defensive set, sliding back, getting the high ground and letting the confederates smash their faces into my cannons. Feels good. On July 2nd I'm given an option to hold tight or extend the right flank to Benner's Hill. I'm winning pretty well on the right, so I go for it and win resoundingly. Reform the lines, and suddenly a confederate cavalry swings around and absolutely destroys my right. I overextended and bad, lost thousands and the retreat was sloppy. Had night not fallen I may have lost Cemetary Hill and the whole battle.

At times I would have regiments have to walk to within 20-30 feet of enemy regiments on the same level in order for them to start firing (and of course the entire time that they're walking up, the enemy regiment is shooting them to bits).\n-Morale is broken for the campaign. I don't know why they wouldn't have your troops get a morale boost inbetween engagements. The amount of times I started a battle with troops already about to rout was ridiculous. And then of course your reinforcements come in and are all ready to rout as well. No reason morale shouldn't be at 50% minimum at the start of a new engagement as opposed to 10-15%, particularly if you've had nonstop victories before.\n-Speaking of routing troops, this game suffers a major Total War flaw in that when one of your regiments breaks, they don't always retreat back towards you. I've seen countless regiments of mine break and proceed to run straight into the enemy army and just get annihilated. I just had an engagement where one regiment broke at 850 men and then proceeded to run around in circles in an open field why enemy artillery just destroyed them until they were down to 250 men and stopped retreating for some reason.\n-Charging seems to be broken. I tried it twice and both times my regiment charging engaged the first enemy regiment and then just kept walking through the first regiment to try and fight the ones behind it all at the same time. Maybe it was just some weird glitch for me but I quit trying after I basically lost two separate 1,000 man regiments from them doing that.\n-For some reason, having my troops on an elevated position and firing downhill at an enemy regiment results in my men taking more casualties regularly (I recall at least four separate occasions where I had 1,000+ man regiments with high morale and only facing one enemy regiment had this happen to them). I'm not sure I understand that logic.\n-The amount of time in engagements is pretty short. You can't ever wait to setup your forces before attacking because you'll have no time to actually capture your objectives.\n-The fact that I did a campaign as the CSA and had three different maps where I captured both Round Top and Little Round Top is just stupid, no more explanation needed.\n-What constitutes a victory/defeat is pretty inexplicable. I'll have a map where I inflict more than 8,000 casualties on the enemy than my own casualties and capture all but one of the control points and have it say a draw.\n-It also seems that the casualties don't actually matter much from past engagements. The AI always has several thousand more troops than you every engagement, regardless of how many you killed the previous one.\n\n\nThis game is fun for about an hour or two before you want to just break your computer after all of these things add up. It has a lot of good ideas that just weren't executed well. The fact that troops don't get a morale boost inbetween engagements is inexplicible, particularly when you go to the next day. Line of sight is broken for the most part. I know this seems completely negative and that's mainly because most of the top reviews already outline all the positives from the game so I don't feel like doing the same. Like I said, it's fun for an hour or two and I do enjoy it. There are just a lot of small things that seem like they could be easily fixed but aren't.","May 2","true","5.0"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikec81/recommended/306660/","mikec81","mikec_81","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikec81/","96 products in account","This is probably one of the best historic ACW realtime strategy games out there.  Anyone with any interest in the American Civil War will want to have a copy of this and it is well worth the 15 dollars being charged for the game.  The games does a very good job balancing historical accuracy with playability and the visual presentation is stunning.\n\nAt its core, this is an American Civil War tactics game with the brigade being the primary building block.  The battle of Gettysburg is represented as a series of scenarios  which represent significant engagements fought by the 2 armies.  Each brigade is modeled historically in terms of size and performance based on how they did at Gettysburg historically and their reputation throughout the war.  Each scenario sees the player commanding 8-10 brigades on average with accompanying artillery modeled as seperate units that take 30 minutes to an hour to complete.\n\nThe primary gameplay is derived from testing the player on executing and making decisions using ACW linear tactics and  trying to present to the player an idea of problems that require solving by Division, Corps and Army level commanders during the Battle of Gettysburg.  This includes selecting good terrain that affords units  good cover and holding elevated positions as well as forming a coherent battle line which is not easily enveloped by flanking manouvers.  Learning when to hold reserves, where to hold them and how to attack positions are simulated and the decisions asked of the player reflect reasonably on historical tactics from the time period.  Morale management is also a serious consideration as units which are sent in on their own against overwhelming odds will break very quickly and become useless to the player in battle.\n\nThe highlights of the game include the saving of unit casualties and position during the campaign as you shift from scenario to scenario.  Poor performance and excessive casualties earlier in the battle may come back to haunt the player as a subsequent engagment may have the player using depleted and exhausted brigades in later maps in the scenario.  This emphasises the need to preserve troops under player control as asking the player to balance between a potentially more costly victory in the immediate scenario and risk having shattered and demoralized troops  in later scenarios.\n\nIn between each scenario, the player gets to make a strategic decision as to what the overall battle strategy should be employed which brings the player to the next scenario and map.  Completing a well executed campaign while minimizing casualties is very satisfying and there is great replayability in attempting to replicate historic decisions made by executing the battleplan better than your historical counter parts, or by "what if scenarioes" by selecting different strategies than the one actually taken historically (ie.  What if Euwell attacked Cemetary Hill on Day 1 instead of being cautious).  An overall order of battle listing at the end of each scenario gives the player easy to understand reports.\n\nMovement and control is both well executed and at times frustrating.  Moving units involves a simple system where you draw a movement path for each individual brigade you wish to move.  It is intuitive and easy to learn but the some more precise manouvers require you to either be able to visualise exactly how a brigade will form up out of march or require some tinkering to maximize use of cover which is very important to the game.\n\nFlaws in the game range from minor inconviences to omisions that should have been dealt with before release.  The most pressing problem is that this game is lacking on a good tutorial.  The one presently in the game is rather barebones and doesn't explain key concepts well to brand new players.\n\nThose players with a background with "battle simulators" whether they be from the aracadish Total War series or the more rigid and historical offerings such as Civil War Generals 2 or the Close Combat series will adapt quickly as will anyone with a solid background in ACW or Napolenoic linear tactics.\n\nFor those who are not well versed in historical tactics or are used to Command and Conquer / Starcraft style gameplay will be in for a shock and there have been frequent forum posts by such players not understanding core mechanics.  A good tutorial will go a long way to resolving the issue.\n\nLine of sight obstruction is another inconviences as the game does not relay easy to read information and lines of fire can be obstructed by things which are not always obvious.  A player set up a position he thinks is advantageous only to find his units do not have line of sight covering areas he expects to be covered as enemy troops come up.   Similarly, areas where the thinks he is obscured from line of sight may unexepectedly be open.\n\nOthers may find historical inaccuracies jarring though in my opinion as a historic gamer, the developers have made a decent trade off between playability and historic representation.  For example there is a vocal player in Early Access that has continually stated that artillery is anachronistically to powerful.  I personally have not found it to be so and in most battles the game sims out, artillery casualties are well within line of the 8-10% casualties caused as accepted by most historians.\n\nOverall this is not a perfect product but it is a very enjoyable one and for 15 dollars, its is a steal.","November 2, 2014","true","105.7"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","0"

Forewarning this review is exclusively of my experiences with the single player, the multiplayer may have been fantastic, but i'll never know.\n\nI'll start of by saying I'm quite a fan of RTS games. But this game absolutely wastes its potential in my mind, through a bunch of frustrating issues, that for me obviously were deal breakers.\n\nThe AI.\n\nThe issue isn't so much the enemy AI, altough it completely does broken crap all the time, as your own unit's AI being absolutely frustrating. Please explain to me how a 1000 strong unit can't destroy an exposed enemy artillery unit, or as to why it doesn't take literal seconds.\n\nAttack commands don't work as you would expect. Move commands also don't work as expected.\n\nEnemy AI routing is stupid. I've encircled you with the entirety of my army. Spent the billion minutes it takes in game to take the long way round your army with a sizeable handful of troops and a few cannons. I've decidedly turned the battle into my favour. Not only have your men realised how screwed they are, but now you're men have fled, and quite rightly so. The day is mine. Watch them flee!\n\nThen take hardly any damage. AS THEY LITERALLY RUN THROUGH YOUR LINES! No matter they've fled the battlefield? Apart from they bloody didn't. They've gone a 100 meters past your line. Decided that they day isn't quite lost and turned around to now shoot your exposed back. In a wonderous example of turning the battle now into their favour. This is futher compounded as more and more troops "rout" en masse to this new superb position, taking less casualties than if they had been ordered too. To now decimate the men you've sent to encircle them.\n\nRouting a cannon unit means they rout with the cannon. Why? Because when fleeing the enemy the first thing you do is hook up you cannon, load up your equipment, and ride away into the game equivalent of a sunset (which as previously mentioned is most likely your exposed flank)\n\nYour cannon's will not hit anything. That 2000 strong infantry unit? Nope. Might as well ask them to hit the moon. They will however happily destroy the ground around them. Remember how decimating an accurate cannon shot was in total war? Well these are nothing like that.\n\nFlanking.\n\nWhy bother? Attacking an infantry's flank in this game provides you with no discernible advantage. No massive drop in moral or men. They just fight on like they normally would and usually get the advantage of you having not fired on them while you took the effort to flank. Just don't.\n\nGraphics and UI.\nQuite fine. The units are more like sprites with their unit strength above. If you were expecting men individually rendered you'll be dissappointed.\n\nThe topological map is a nice touch. However due to the camera angle it can be visually hard to judge whether you are sitting in a defilade or not.\n\nIllogical crap.\n\nCan't for the life of me work out how to target enemy generals. They just stand there around their dying men then retreat to their other soldiers like they're trotting through a rose garden.\n\nThe Default controls are some of the worse I've ever seen. Why is everything a group move. WHY CAN'T I TARGET THAT UNIT? I CAN SEE IT. I JUST CAN'T CLICK ON IT. STOP TARGETING THE INFANTRYMEN TARGET THE CANNONS. I'm pretty sure if i was a real general i'd have shot whoever commands half these units. Some difficulty ordering a charge to ordering a ranged attack. I gave up trying in the end.\n\nConclusion.\nFor me this game is incredibly frustrating and unrewarding. However if you are quite a fan of battles that take place during civil war era, you might be willing to discover the nuances required to play around your men's ineptitudes.","September 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 134 of 227 people (59%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","59","134","227","23","8"

It gives an impression of a large battlefield, while still showing enough detail. Everything is clear and crisp, with the smoke and explosions looking great, and the battlefield getting littered with dead bodies. The landscape is a beautiful rendition of the land around Gettysburg, and you will easily pick out all the historical spots, like the Cemetery, The Peach Orchard, Devil's Den, The Round Tops, The Angle, etc.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe battles are fluid and smooth. You can either play individual battles, or play the full 3-4 day Battle of Gettysburg campaign. Factors like morale and casualties carry over to the next battles, so managing your soldiers is important, and fresh reserves are valuable. The game is relatively balanced between the two sides, with each side having its own advantages. The battles give fairly realistic casualty results, and the battle lines ebb and flow as soldiers push forward or fall back. The AI is probably the best I've ever seen in an RTS game like this, and on the hardest difficulties provides a formidable challenge most of the time. The AI will fall back, use its reserves, launch assaults and flanking maneuvers, etc. The game is very replayable, with the campaign having many different branching outcomes based on your decisions and performance in battles, and you can play against different AI personalities who have very different playstyles, giving a different experience every time.\n\nSound:\n\ngood. The cannons and muskets and rifles sound great, and give a good ambiance to the battles. You hear the men shouting, guns firing, trumpets sounding, and it gives a great feeling of the intensity of the fighting going on.\nThe music in the game is decent. Not outstanding, but it is acceptable.\n\nRealism:\n\nOverall, the game is a fairly realistic representation of the Battle of Gettysburg, with three large exceptions:\n1) the performance of cavalry. Cavalry in the game are way more powerful and influential than they ever were during the American Civil War. In the early battles, the fictional "Vidette" units are capable of wiping out artillery batteries and are more resilient to getting shot than they should be. In the later battles, when the Union and Confederate Cavalry divisions arrive, they are able to cause massive casualties in melee. The cavalry are simply not historically accurate in the game.\n2) artillery. In the game, artillery units show men rolling around cannons. They move very slowly, and are quite resilient against gunfire, leading to the possibility of using artillery units like tanks to push forward into the enemy. They also tend to inflict more casualties than they did historically. Historically, ACW artillery had horses and limbers that allowed them to limber and move around the battlefield quickly, even faster than infantry marching. This prominent feature is notably missing from the game. In short, artillery should be more mobile, but also more vulnerable to casualties.\n3) entrenchments and breastworks: historically, infantry entrenchments and breastworks were a pivotal part of the American Civil War, particularly at Gettysburg. While cover (like forests, fences, rocks, etc) do give a sizable cover bonus to infantry, there is no feature simulating how infantry holding a position for an extended time would dig in and fortify it, making it very hard for the enemy to push them off (see Culp's Hill).\n\nControls:\n\nControls are very easy and fast. Extremely intuitive. The way you can give movement orders by dragging a path is perfect.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThis is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it. It is very fun, sports top-notch AI, and is a very unique game. While it has some serious historical inaccuracies, it is still a good game. I personally hope that the devs introduce some modding support eventually, so that players can fix those inaccuracies themselves. I am looking forward to future sequels and expansions, as well as future patches to the game.\n\nOh, and I wish they would work on an Android version, and not just one for iPad.","October 17, 2014","true","75.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

You feel like you are really in command and can move your troops about easily with a few clicks. No vertigo inducing flights back and forth across the battle field to micro manage each unit\n\nTerrain matters especially for artillery but you soon learn how to position your batteries to the best effect and the ability to show elevation on the maps helps a lot.\n\nMaybe its just me but I think the sound effects/design on his game deserves special mention. The overall sounds of battle and the cannon/musket fire in volleys and  when poor old Will becomes the target are brilliantly done.\n\nI really recommend this game for amateur generals and judging from other reviews the West Point graduates like it as well","June 18, 2015","true","21.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Since it was written for the (very) first version of early access UG:Gettysburg, quite a lot of changes have been made in the meantime. For example, a terrain/elevation-overlay has been added. However, I think that my main critique, which touches some fundamental/design issues (delay of orders, no proper information/uncertainties/fog of war-system, etc.) are still valid.]\n\nMy negative vote or this game surely is an individual decision, and I can also understand that other people give positive reviews. It certainly depends on what type of player you are and what kind of game you expect. Even though the game is still in early access stadium, it's highly unlikely that the game will be changed so much as to cater for a different player-type.\n\nIf you're searching for a historically inspired, light weight and uncomplicated tactical game, you're spot on with Ultimate General. The presentation is its strongest asset: the map has a very nice and addictive art style, the little smoke clouds and flying bullets that your soldiers' muskets produce are just adorable and the sound effects are great. It really feels like a table top game come alive. Another strong-point for me are the controls which feel very slender and streamlined, and "painting" movement-path-arrows on the map gives you the proper general-feeling. There are still some issues that will hopefully be improved (terrain-elevation-overlay is desperately needed, e.g.).\n\nAs for the actual game-mechanics, they're certainly successfull in providing you with a lot of back and forth and indeed there is a certain dynamic in the battles. However, if you're trying to look a bit deeper, my experience was that you don't really have to make a lot of interesting tactical decisions. The scenarios, albeit or rather because they're using historical setups, feel very restricted. In fact I sometimes get the feeling that all I can do in the game is to move my preset army towards the opponent/objectives and react ad hoc on whatever happens. There is no need for planning. Although the game is set on a grand tactical level (the standard units are brigades, not battalions), the game imho fails to deliver the tactical depth that this scale could offer. This is partly due to the restricted scenarios that don't give you enough space and time (to do anything else than just straight out attacking/defending) and partly due to the lack of the most important aspects of warfare: information and communication. There is a line-of-sight feature implemented in this game, but you can instantly see everything that any of your units can see. It's a problem that besets most "mainstreamy" tactical games (unlike, e.g. Scourge of War, or the Combat Mission series for WWII), that do not want to exchange visual appeal with tactical depth: instant satellite view. There cannot be any wargame or "simulation" if there is instant satellite view. Another important factor is that there are no delays of orders whatsoever. Taken together, instant reaction and instant information lead to a gaming experience that has no "simulation"-character whatsoever, and is focused on (fast) clicking and ad-hoc reaction rather than carefull thinking, planning, anticipation. I fear that this aspect will be even more perceptible in multiplayer battles (not yet in the game).\n\nSo, if you'd describe yourself as a die-hard grognard and if you're looking for a wargame/tactical SIMULATION, Ultimate General might not be to your liking, or at least it won't be the game you were expecting. But for the current price, you can't really go wrong either. To me it's a nice, slender and light-weight game with a minor tactical appeal that doesn't really force the player to do a lot of brainwork. The AI seems to do okay most of the time (I can't really share the euphoria in other reviews though), which is probably partly due to the fact that there are not too many important tactical variables to be taken into consideration, and also because the game pace is very fast (the player can't have his eyes everywhere, the AI can!).\n\nSo, for my personal taste, the game is not "simulationist" enough. It has not distanced itself enough from "arcadey" (i.e. fast click, don't think!) mainstream games like the Total War series. I would have wished for a game more inspired by actual wargames, in which you have to make lots of important decisions, deal with uncertainties, anticipate.","June 19, 2014","false","15.5"," 75 of 126 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","75","126","0","8"

The unit combat 'feels' authentic with reasonable casualty numbers resulting from the different sorts of fire. The scenario-to-scenario system owrks really well and allows for lots of different 'what if' scenarios to emerge from your gameplay.

I appreciate what the developer is trying to do, but it hasn't gotten there. It is supposed to focus on in depth management of terrain and other mechanics for h-core tactical simulators, but it doesnt come close to that. Terrain is not nearly exact or detailed enough. Ability to fine tune deployments is severely wanting, and unit AI (of friendly units) is erratic and low. I've had many units just wander out into the open passed cover and get demolished while I was on the other end of the map doing something else (often trying to get units back into position lol). Hey Union Jack, care to take a stroll out beyond the stone wall whilst Pickett gets his charge underway? Bad idea? I guess you're right, cause now you're dead. I see that this game is trying create both a user friendly casual gamer interface and in depth tactics. Unfortunately it does not succeed in the compromise. It comes off as a causal RTS gamer's stab at the civil war genre, rather than a serious civil war era tactical sim. If you want the latter, look elsewhere, though, obviously, the choices are slim. I haven't played this genre in a while. After trying this out I have a civil war bug again, and to scratch that itch to Much better satisfaction, Im going back a decade and reinstalling Take Command: 2nd Manassass.\nKeep working dev, I'd like to try this out again after a serious overhaul.

Unfortunatly its not on GoG either, so its gonna be harder with mutli core 64 bit systems) from playing it. This game is good, the AI is challenging, could be better, but its not terrible and will keep you interested.

Your casualties carry over from each time period, so use your Iron Brigade wisely in the first part...\n\nIts interesting, its a good homage I would call it rather than a clone of SM:G; this is like a game that has been missed since the late '90s...Recommended.","December 4, 2014","true","17.7"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/306660/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","My first impression of this game was graphically it looked very appealing. Upon further playing it, I found odd simplistic qualities that somehow was able to grasp my attention and keep it. I easily spent an hour in this game my first time before realizing how much time went by. This can be a good strategy game for some while others may find it extremely boring. This game will either appeal to you or it simply won't.\n\nUltimate General : Gettysbourg throws the gamer in a room staring at soldiers on a battlefield that sits comfortably on some table. The story follows the American civil war between the Union and the Confederates. The difference here is that history can potentially re-write itself and that battles can carry on for days. The gameplay itself is actually quite simplistic and very easy to use. The challenge is how to approach each situation (like any game right)? In this particular game, one does not simply produce units out of a factory or thin air. Rather, units every so often may come as reinforcements. Depending on the battle, reinforcements may not come at all or very late in the game. I'm not a huge American civil war buff so I cannot comment on the accuracy of everything historical in-game. I can mention, however that there are a lot of facts and a timer that will try to accurately end the battle. The battle can obviously go longer than expected but going too far over the original clock will stop the game. Everything seems as accurate as can be to me.\n\nThere are different units that have different abilities in game. Union units are more technologically advance while Confederate units excel at close quarter combat. Skirmishers are basic units that do not have too much range but are obviously meant for close combat. Archers have a longer range but aren't as efficient in close quarters. Artillery is a cool unit type that the player can use to decisively manipulate the outcome of the game. Artillery is able to choose between shell, canister and solid shot. Shell is mid-range and will hit units in the target impact area. Solid shot is used from afar but cannot take out as many units as shell does. Canister is sort of a rapid fire feature that can take out many soldiers in one go. Issue here is that the artillery has to be in pretty close range to reach the units. Grabbing any random unit and watching them follow the arrow you've so nicely drawn out on the map is satisfying. Selecting individual units can be done by simply clicking them. To select more than one group of units, click and hold the left mouse button and freely draw a circle, encircling the units that you want to pick. I find this to be a neat feature that others games should perhaps follow. Choosing exactly who you want is a lot more powerful that picking specific units with a square.\n\nThe AI is definitely no push over. They will react in real time to whatever movements you make on the battle field. They can also get extremely annoying (in a good way) with their artillery that'll blast you from afar. Troops owned by the player also have a mind of their own. If they are getting bombarded and completely destroyed they will retreat on their own will. It can be annoying watching troops run away from a fight but they can come back and support when they calm down. Orders that could be given to units is move, run, fallback, hold and charge. Charge will have your units engage in hand to hand combat with the opponent. The Confederates have the advantage here as they are given a more aggressive stance.\n\nThe visuals are appealing and are done decently well. You cannot zoom in all the way to see the blast effects but smoke/gun effects are all there. The HUD contains some useful (and colorful) information for the player. These four categories are quite important : morale (green), condition (blue), cover (yellow) and reload (red). The higher morale means the better your troops will perform. Conditions allows for you to choose the "run" option to move quicker on the battlefield but depletes the longer the displacement. Cover is an especially important one as it will definitely give you a leg up on the opponent. If you're not in some woods or on a ridge be extremely careful as your troops are extremely vulnerable. Reload obviously indicates when the troops are ready to fire. Points are awarded for certain points being captured which is made extremely evident without disturbing the eyes. Sounds are decent and are suitable to the game. It would be nice to hear some in-game dialogue or more explosive effects.\n\nOverall, not a bad game but I would certainly say this is not recommended for everyone. It is somewhat of a simplistic RTS that sometimes will not demand too much micro-management. This isn't necessarily true at all times but some people that have tried the game seem to think so. I think a little bit more could have been done to immerse the player by giving them more of a immersive role in the game rather than simply planning everything. If this was the goal to simply be a planner, then the game succeeded in it's role.\n\n\nRATING : 6.95/10\n\n\nGameplay	C+	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C+\n\nScreenShots :\n\nA nice view\n\nThese lines are not drawn strategically","April 29","true","4.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

It knows how to render your charge useless by making it's unit pull back the micro-second before yours can engage it in hand to hand combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nottiler/recommended/306660/","nottiler","Tiler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nottiler/","400 products in account","This isn't a bad game. However, its a game that very much seems to resent being played.\n\nFirstly, if you want to play this game, you must read this guide written by a dev ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=533709146 ). It details some of the mechanics that are not covered well, or at all, in the ingame tutorial, or guide. or otherwise conveyed in any way by the game interface.\n\nThis game plays very similarly to Sid Meier's Gettysburg, and can be thought of as a spiritual successor. If you had played that game and enjoyed it, then you will probably find something to enjoy from this game as well. The game is a single "battle" that takes place over several engagements; battle setups are generally pre-arranged scenarios with some variance depending on what occurred in previous stages, and what stages are available later depends on what "victory points" are controlled by what side at the end of an engagement. Reinforcements are also scripted, with some variance on their arrival times; their actual arrival times and locations are not told to you, which can lead to your army being suddenly flanked if you're unlucky.\n\nThe AI is fairly competent, and benefits from the mechanics of the game being fairly forgiving towards the occasional boneheaded move that the AI is wont to try to do; units are fairly resilient, preferring to rout rather than die, and as the battle takes place over a series of "engagements" with escalating troop counts, earlier loses become irrelevant, as even when the AI loses over half its total forces, it will still easily match or outnumber your forces. However, even though the AI is frequently a selling point, its capacity to provide a challenge comes more from the nature of game mechanics than the AI being terribly clever. The AI also has a propensity to "know" gameplay rules that players are forced to guess at (the AI will never have difficulty managing its cannons, for instance, and is also able to "guess" where it can position its forces perfectly to avoid your own guns) and to know when, for instance, it will win a charge, when yet again, a player must estimate.\n\nThe AI gets to avoid much of the frustrations with a very fickle "Cover" mechanic, where a player must yet again guess at which terrain and facing will result in high cover based on the often tiny features on the map; a minute distance can result in a huge drop in unit cover, and the game's control scheme, based on drawing movement lines on a map, are deeply unsuited for these tiny adjustments you must make for each one of your units. Map features can also block LOS, which can at least be deduced by clicking on your unit, but a problem arises where a unit can fail to have a firing line while still having a clear LOS, leaving you deeply confused why a unit or cannon battery "refuses" to fire. There is no feature on the interface that tells you when or why this happens.\n\nThe AI also does not have to cope with one of the game's selling points, the "Unit Self Awareness", that causes your own units to move and act on their own, often to your great disadvantage. Although the idea of removing "micromanagement" is an attractive one, this "helpful" feature (than cannot be disabled except via a very limited "Hold" command) means that your units will often move on their own, often out of cover and into great danger, for a variety of undocumented reasons. Ironically, this means that, compared to games such as the Total War series, you will be forced to actively micromanage your units to a far greater degree, lest they decide to wander down your own battle lines while under fire, blocking the rest of your troops from shooting. Your units also very stubbornly will refuse to change targets once this "Self Awareness" AI decides what they are to shoot at.\n\nMuch of the game mechanics must be guessed at; knowing, for instance, what contributes to a units morale dropping (a incredibly critical feature) is not documented, only hinted at in a frustratingly coy manner. The advice from the development team seemed based on the idea that their game is highly realistic and much of their mechanics are "common sense"; suffice to say, I do not agree with this viewpoint, and much of the difficulty of the games involved coming to grips with unintuitive and undocumented elements, leading to an incredibly grating experience when things fail to behave as you'd expect, and leads to a huge "trial and error" element; given that the battles are so slow paced, combined with the strictness of the battle time limit, means having things go horribly wrong due to factors you can only guess at is rather unforgivable.\n\nThis is the primary reason I cannot recommend this game in good faith; although there is much to praise about this game, even in comparison to more popular titles, the constant issues of coping with a variety of frustrating design decisions and defects taints much of the experience, even in comparison to the game it borrows so much of its mechanics from, Sid Meier's Gettysburg. If you are willing to put with with a lot of frustration, there is a good tactical wargame worth playing here. But this is a game that does very, very little to win itself over in comparison to other series.","January 9","false","24.4"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","0"

The basic idea of the game is you either control the Union or Confederate army during the Battle of Gettysburg. The campaign lets you make choices before each battle which can greatly change how the campaign plays out as the "maps" you play on and the unit layout will change. (i.e. Attack their flank or stay back and defend a ridge will lead to different battles). The controls may be simplified but because of this, it makes the game greatly enjoyable. To move units, you select them and trace their movement path with your mouse. There is no unit formation selection or anything like that which lets you focus on your overall tactics. The game is very easy to get into but difficult to master since you must learn to use the terrain to your advantage. In terms of difficulty, you have a great way of selecting the AI as you select your difficulty on a graph chart. You can select an AI that is careful but smart, an aggressive idiot, or some form of combo (you have 9 different choices).

RIGHT NOW.\n\nNow then... Ive had this game since it was in a state of human vs AI only, and it was suggested by a clan leader and friend of mine whom i saw play quite frequently. He told me the features and i was pretty psyched to say the least. Just so i dont make this review paragraph based, let me number off the pros and cons and info.\n\nPro's:\n\n1. The Dev and The AI Behavior\n\nThis game was made by a popular Mod developer for the total war series, more specifficaly, the Darth Mod series. yes, same guy. And please take very good note of this, THE AI WILL KICK YOUR ♥♥♥. Im VERY suprised CA hasnt hired this guy for the Total War series yet for thier new A.I. behavior manager! The Computer acts just like a human in some if not all instances depending on the way you want it to act, its VERY releiving to see a compinant AI smashing a human player. If you buy this game, thinking that its just another game that youll steam roll the AI in, your wrong. Period.\n\n2. Genuine BattleField terrain and locations\n\nI live in mid Michigan, and the Gettysburg battlefield is roughly 300 miles away. I am also a dedicated Civil War reenactor, and historian, and i have been to Gettysburg and other battle sites multiple times. I must say, the developer has really put time into making the battlefield map as authentic as possible. By doing so, he has the terrian set just right, theres ALOT of small locations like the Penn. College, and several small areas like family houses, mansions and farmhouses with titles signifying the property. This really adds to your sence of thinking, like instead of thinking, 'Gotta hold that house' or 'Hold that hill' your more in a state of mind saying 'Hold the Henery House Property', 'Hold Oak Ridge', 'Defend the Unsbruck road'. It all makes you feel like more of a gerneral than most offical game companies for RTS and frontline action.\n\n3. Realistic Chain of Command and Regiments\n\nInstead of Regimental numbers and which state their from, theres titles to mark each regiment, or birgade by their colonel, core leader, or the actual nick name they had during the war. Like the Iron Birgade, The Texan Birgade, Bucktail Birgade, Irish Birgade, Kelly's Birgade, and thats just to name a few of the nick named. Other more common units are named after historical regimental commanders and birgadier generals who were present at the battle. THAT is true dedication to the games authenticity :)\n\n4. A very high sence of carnage and urgency\n\nMost people dont mindor think about this, but i beleive every war game should have sound effects of not only weapons, but voices and screaming and other things to give a more sence of the heat of battle. Whenever i engage the enemy, the new sounds of battle erupt and i feel like im more rushed or needed of concentration just to see it through. Plus, bodies stay where they lie, and it makes the feild more littered with the dead to give a better sence of war horror and chaos. One time, me and a freind playing online (explained later) fought over a wheat feild for nearly 20 minutes, and in that time, it switched posetion between us nearly 17 times! It was grusome!\n\n5. Simple but very robust multiplayer\n\nDont expect this game to have a server or host list, but instead it has a mainly matchmaking based mulitplayer system. better yet, it even ranks your person and you can even select avatars! Though theyre only portraits of generals from both the Union and Confederacy, and nothing much else, which is a little dissapointing.\n\n6. WHERES THE REINFORCMENTS!?\n\nThroughout the 3 days at the battle of Gettysburg, both armies were conjured in a day or so by the arrival of reinforcements from different roads in order to manifest their armies into a whole. Reinforcemnets, are DEPENDED upon in this game to ensure victory for either side, and its very nerve racking to wait for their arrival. They even come in various sizes, types, and diractions to the feild of battle. So it really dicates where they can help most immediately, or spend time to get to another area.\n\n7. The enemy army is breaking camp, let us do the same...\n\nDuring a human vs AI battle, the fight can last to a max of 4 days or so. You only have so much time in a day to capture all objective locations or to route the enemy army until both sides being too exhausted to fight and break camp for the next day fallowing. Whats even more cool is that the gains or losses you make in one day can influence the lines of battle for the day fallowing, THAT is awsome and i cant even beleive no RTS game developer companies have even considered making that system an element in their games yet without making it for the prupose of cinimatic.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The line of sight for cannons\n\nCannons were a must have in both armies during the period, but in this game, it takes alot to get them operating effeicantly. Cannons must be set up with a proper line of fire in order to fire on the enemy, so youll be CONSTANTLY checking your artilleries line of fire. It also sucks that the Ai cant even automatically deploy them to a favored postion after being ordered to attack a certian enemy. I even had a battery of cannons on a hill overlooking an open feild in which the enemy were crossing, and they didnt even open fire! The enemy was completely exposed as well, and it even cost me the battle because they didnt open fire even though they were overlooking a hill. Be aware, the LOF for artillery peices, are VERY picky.\n\n2. Poor/Slow morale recharge and gain\n\nIn game, Southern armies have more of a moral boost because historically, they were mostly made of volunteers willing to fight, whislt most of the Northern armies have lower moral sicne alot where drafties and didnt even want to be in the army in the first place. However, once moral is depelted for a unit, its over for them. They might as well leave the feild because theyll be so useless. I had a birgade of 1280 southern men, and after being repulsed, they automatically got behind the lines to safety, but the moral was jacked. i checked on them and their morale seemed fine enough to get back into the action, but as soon as they get near the fight, theyre morale was depleted, and mind you none of them were even fired upon when that happened. Even on the Northern side more especially, if a units morale goes below 20%, its over for them. They wont have the will to fight anymore. This needs to have at least a curtiosy balance or fix to be more acceptable.\n\n3. Once more into the breech men!... men!?...\n\nCharging the enemy is a needed factor in the game, but it needs to be a little tweaked. The Confederate armies have the benifit of actually fallowing through a charge but the Union wont even charge at all. Theyll hold their ground with great dediction, but a charge, even against the smallest units, just kills the moral of the Union units and they all run away before a charge even commences. It somewhat defeats the purpose of have a charge option while playing as the Union.\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nThis game came out of the blue, and it wasnt another board game based civil war game nor a mod for a half ♥♥♥♥♥ RTS. Ultimate General is a slight arcade like game but its a mus thave for all RTS fans and those of 'frontline' combat. Like i said however, some tweaking might have to be done here and there, but the Pro's far outway the Con's.\n\nI give this game, a 7/10 in its current state.\n\n8/10 if your a Civil War history fanatic or an RTS fanatic for that matter, AND if the developer tweaks the strengths and weaknesses and morale of both sides.\n\nThis game DESERVES to be a series, not only that for JUST the Civil War era, but maybe Napoleonic Wars, 1700 Wars, Crimean War; it DOES have great potential! And i encourage the dev to keep up dedicated work!","November 2, 2014","true","59.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

When it comes to allowing the player to recreate the battle of Gettysburg, this game is terrible. One of the biggest complaints people had with some of the total war games, was that it was too hard to place your units where you wanted them. By comparison, this game makes all the total war games seems amazing. Changing unit position is almost impossible while in battle, and the UI, while very clean, is completley useless.

Brigade control is somewhat less intuitive than necessary, and leads to micromanagement of regiments and generals. Artillery are a great deal smarter than SMG, and an additional shot type in the form of shells has been added (halfway between solid shot and cannister, with qualities of each). The abilaity to draw in marching paths is tremendously useful, and allows you to set an entire flank's orders and focus your attention elsewhere confident your regiments will end up in the correct formation in due course. Overall it plays much quicker, and due to this fact, gameplay is somewhat limited in duration.

Having encountered forward elements of Lee's Confederate Army, my Colonel deployed his skirmishing units to blunt the forward movement of the enemy thus giving the "Iron Brigade" and the other line units of I Corp time to come up. The enemy countered with a sledgehammer style assault on the weak points in the skirmishing line driving back Devin's and Gamble's units to McPherson Ridge. I ordered my cannon to fall farther back to give them time to set up again. We can hear the pipers of the "Iron Brigade" and are well aware of their stature on the battlefield. The enemy is surely aware of this as well, and I think they can expect a hot welcome of fire and shot when they arrive.  My Colonel has trained his cavalry well but has reservations about the quality of the commanders he has been given. However our Detached infantry units have performed admirably in their mission of delaying the enemy's advance.\n\n10:13 am. Davis' brigade has suffered terribly as they tried to cross the valley floor and the enemy center is considerably weakened. Our line held at McPherson's Ridge only because Pettigrew and Heth's Skirmishers elected to take the comparatively  minor Oak Hill. The "Iron Brigade" has arrived and is busy in the south pushing Brockenbrough back towards the Confederates gun positions. As General Buford seems to have things in hand in the north, especially with the arrival of the remainder of I Corp the General has decided to push the right end of the line north, in an effort to accurately gauge the strength of Pettigrews brigade. Our cavalry has done some very good scouting and we are fairly confident of the locations of the artillery and hope to move on them soon. Orders from the Colonel are to leave our guns on Oak Ridge as a deterrent to Pettigrew and the light forces with him. We should be getting artillery reinforcements at any time now, and several more Brigades.\n\n10:38 The Rebs have regrouped and have forced the light units off McPherson Ridge. The General has pulled all the units back to Oak Ridge, there to wait until Cutler and the others are able to come up. There was bloody and savage fighting by the light units in the valley as they screened the other Brigades repositioning, but they have taken minimal losses and are still a bright beacon of Valour for the rest of the Army. The General plans to visit those men tonight.\n\n11:00 am. Our enemy has nothing more to throw into this fight and we are slowly but surely pushing him back. The Iron Brigade has done the impossible and taken Herr Ridge from the weakened and demoralised Rebs. The damned cannon continue to harass us though as it was deemed more important to take the strong point at Herr Ridge and deny the enemy a vital point of contact with the main body.\n\n11:45 am The fighting has been horrendous at the bridge near Spanglers farm but Baxter and Paul have inflicted a serious bloodletting on the enemies III Corp, driving them back and killing them mercilessly. The "Iron Brigade'" occupation of  Herr Ridge seems to have thrown the enemy into confusion and forced Heth, and Pettigrew to move off Oak Hill, which now has our scouts on it, observing the enemies movements. The General has begun telling his subordinates to push the Rebs hard and give them no respite. If we can trap them in the valley we can inflict awful casualties on them in that dead ground.\n\nWould I recommend this game? HELLZ YA! A good replacement for Meyer's Gettysburg. However, it is not that game, so try to give it a shot on its own merits. There are some things wrong with it. For example. Why on the next phase of the battle does the computer move my units from where they were on the previous map? After I had carefully positoned them for maximum effect. AND in some undesirable locations.  The map is hard to get used to but with patience it can be read. I thoroughly enjoyed my first couple of tries. I  still like the random General selector button. Haven't used anything else really. Got my @SS handed to me a few times before I got the hang of it. I like that you can save at any time. SAVE OFTEN!!! The controls are easy to use after you get the hang of them, and the tutorial video set up is a great initial learning tool.  Nice Work DarthMod and Team. RECOMMENDED for gamers. But gonna downgrade this from a 8.0/10 to a 7.5/10\n\n++++++++ I would like to commend the Developers for the ongoing community involvement in this game. The latest patch just hit, and I am very excited by some of the changes. I have not played with the new patch but will be doing so shortly. This game is worth every cent I paid for it and I have great hopes for the future of this game and hopefully others of equally high caliber will follow.+++++++++++","October 17, 2014","true","70.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

US president Abraham Lincoln orders General George Meade of the army of the Potomac  to stop him.\nIn Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you are given command of either of two armies in this great battle during the American\nCivil War\nThe gameplay is generally based on stragetically moving regiments of infantry, artillery, cavalry and your general staff.\nto assault and capture, or defend objective points on the map that have a visible score.\nThe idea of the game is to capture the challenge a general faces when commanding entire armies during battle.\nThis is done by forcing the player to react to certian challenges such as forestry for cover, high ground for artillery,\nand advancing your infantry over rivers, not under enemy fire.\nIn the single player, you're given the opportunity to fight the computer through a series of divided up skirmishes during the battle of Gettysburg.\nThe controls are somewhat difficult to grasp at first, you have to click and drag a circle around specific units you want to move, the tab key makes sure they will arrive in formation.\nEverything is micro managed, as is typical in a strategy game, you have to order each regiment to run and if you're commanding artillery, they have to switch ammunition from solid shot, to shell shot or cannister shot, manually.\n\nThis makes the battles challenging. As in multiplayer, you must keep your eyes on all parts of the battlefield, making the large scale maps a little stressful for the inexperienced player.\nUltimate General: Gettysburg has okay sounds with no music during gameplay but a loop of battle sounds similar to what would be heard at the time.\nI would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of American history and 19th century warfare.\n","January 17","true","6.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

Although you might think it looks too pretty to be a serious wargame, don't let the graphics fool you.  On the other hand, the command structure is simple and intuitive enough that you don't necessarily need to be a hardcore grognard to appreciate the game.\n\nSome basic knowledge of military tactics and terminology is helpful, however.\n\nFrom a structure standpoint, the game's campaign breaks down the 3-day Battle of Gettysburg into smaller scenarios (that still can be fairly large), which are fought in pauseable real time utilizing graphical units in accurate formations -- basically, it's all in the style of the Total War series.  A helpful arrow shows you where a selected unit is heading, which is accomplished by clicking and dragging the unit.  Multiple units can be moved (in formation) by using the "General" in charge of them.   A minor nitpick:  the game isn't always entirely clear on line-of-sight restrictions for units, and it's sometimes difficult to judge terrain height, which is a critical factor in placing your artillery (as it is in reality).\n\nThe AI generals have "personalities" that can be selected before the game using a 9x9 grid of types.  Want a more conservative, cautious opponent?  Or a reckless gambler?  Your choice.\n\nAll in all it's a really enjoyable game, especially coming from a first-time developer.

It's early access so there are a few bugs, but it's beautiful to play and very thematic.\n\nI've been following the development of this game for a while having been a fan of DarthMod for total war (it's the same developer).  I'm not a big fan of early access, but with the first patch out and the game looking great in YouTube videos I was more than happy to drop a tenner to give it a go.\n\nGraphics and UI\nThe map is beautiful and being hand drawn has a tabletop war game feel to it.  The units are sprites but for the level of zoom available are more than enough and the animation is very smooth and polished.  The UI looks like it has been designed for touch screens and something you could use on a tablet, but is very playable with mouse and keyboard, especially once you start using the hotkeys.  I love the history channel style movement arrows.  Menus are simple but they work.  There is no menu art although that's something that can be added later in development and for me is a low priority.\n\nSound\nVery atmospheric, there is a background track of drums and musket fire on top of which is added cannons, muskets and bugles for fighting units.  I found the sound to be subtle, which added to the tabletop war game feel.\n\nAI\nVery good with 3 levels of intelligence and 3 levels of aggressiveness giving you 9 different options for the AI.  Over all I found the AI to be sensible and able to react to my moves on the battlefield.\n\nGameplay\nSo as the name suggests the game focuses on the 4 day battle of Gettysburg, with the battle split into phases.  The campaign starts you off on the first day and on completing the first phase you are given various options, depending on your performance.  Each phase lasts 30 minutes or so, so you can easily fit in a game when you have the free time. The next phase then starts with unit position and strength caring over from the previous phase.  This branching approach to the campaign adds some replay value even with the limited map.\nIn addition there are custom battles where you can play what if scenarios, however these must be unlocked via the campaign game.\n\nMultiplayer should be coming in a later update which could make for a very fun and enjoyable game/\n","June 20, 2014","true","86.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

A lot of developers get tunnel vision.  A tutorial level would help your game.  I also understand most of your points about the civil war.  You are correct, but all games can be found on this fulcrum between sim and game.  Too me what you guys were going for was on the game side.  There are far better civil war 'sims' out there that simulate realistic command structures.\n\nI get frustrated though because the game world probably work better without the bad controls.  Controls are a choice made by the developer and the medium.  A real general can speak.  I have to input commands and I have a limited number of commands.  There were positions no company commander would ever take that my troops would assume because i was inputting commands into a PC and not giving simple orders.  I was restrained.

The game make the moral very sensitive and that can take a short while to get used to, while feeling believable. Very few troops will stay in line, while half of there man are dying, in the middle of a field under musket and artilery fire as it should be.\n\nThis game current flaw is that it's very focused in terms of campaign to Gettysburg. Since Gettysburg is the entire point of the game, it's justifiably so. On the other hand, if the battle system of this game was mixed with a grand scale strategy game such as Victoria II or even something as simple as Risk with a multiplayer element added as well. This game, game mechanic would have an enormous potential of endless entertainement.\n\nWe can only hope that this is a prototype game that will lead to the developpement of something greater in the future.\n\nSo I indeed recommend peoples to buy this game, it's a lot of fun for a low price and it will make you happy for a while.","June 30, 2014","true","42.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I don't normally write reviews on here, but I just had to take the time for UG:G becasue it's such a well designed game, and such a breath of fresh air for the strategy genre.\n\nI won't bore you with multiple long paragraphs on how great the game is, but I will say this: if anything about this game sparks your interest, from a trailer, to a gameplay video, to a recommendation, then GET IT. $15 is an amazing price for this game. I normally wait for games to go on sale beforte purchasing them, but I bought UG:G at full price, and have absolutely no regrets about doing so.\n\nCombat *seems* simple, and for the most part it is, yet there is such a depth and complexity to it that you'll still be mastering new techniques dozens of hours into the game. Gameplay is fun and engaging, and you're never left feeling like you've been cheated by the AI. Speaking of which, both individual units' AI, and the the enemy general's AI are extraordinary. There are nine different diffuculty settings for AI matches/campaigns, each with differing strategies and characteristics, so there's massive replay value, even for purely offline play.\n\nUltimate General: Gettysburg is the first of hopefully many Ultimate General games. I'm happy to show my support for  UG:G, and I'm excited to see what's next.\n\nGod be with you, General!","October 20, 2015","true","179.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","0"

I followed the developments of this game in greenlight and was as giddy as a school boy when released. Having gone above and beyond a sane persons playing time on Empire and Napoleon T/W (3200hrs) with Darth's MODs i might add i've finally found a new addiction to satisfy my 18/19th century warfare. Being a student of military science and history i find this game pretty through in its portrayal and historical accuracies.  The game play is smooth(1 crash on record) along with the controls and at some points it feels like the game plays itself without any direction. The infantry is truly the queen of battle and the homewrecker here. Theres only been a few circumstances where  where i've scratched my head and wondered what a brigade was doing after i ordered it to do something else. Now for the hair puller, ARTILLERY. The king of battle, is not the king of battle in this game. True it does have some good times where they kind of act like they know what their doing but for the most part they are completely lost. Ive seen battery's stand there and do nothing while the brigade directly in front of it is getting its butt handed to them by another infantry unit or AI arty unit and then all of a sudden they'll start firing at a target half way across the map! There is no targeting at all, not like the infantry units. I've noticed 50 guns will all of a sudden start shootin at a retreating enemy with 9 men half way across the map while engaged in support role or counter battery fire. The AI's counter battery fire is accurate and can wipe whole batterys in one shoot. For the most part arty units just stand there and do nothing unless i place them up the butt of an infantry unit and of course they immediately start taking rifle fire and  begin dwindling away rapidly. And theres no quarentee even then that they'll open fire however they may be brave and instead start advancing through the infantry to set up and get slaughtered wholesale. Infantry will charge them and they may not fire even if loaded. Cannister fire by several arty units or more will stop an infantry attack and will cause significant caulalties but not necessarily in the game and the medium range shrapnel shot/cannister will devastate units while behind good cover. Also long range cannon fire seems quite useless as it does not produce any  significant loss in men or condition. I've observed long range fire might kill 1 man in 2 or 3 shoots. Lets see, what else. Oh, if i choose the ammo selection other than  auto it usually results in more lollygagging. I think that about covers the artillery but i might be forgetting something. The cavalry units dont really play a big role they can cause some serious havoc if handled properly. Im not really sure what the corps staff are suppose to do other than mark the general area of a corps and get in the way. I know your suppose to be able to move your corps with them but usually it just moves half leaving the rest. Cosidering the fact that they are the brass and suppose to have some kind of aspiring leadership qualities It would be great if we could use them as morale boosters for faltering units or reconditioning units resting. The sharp shooters dont really do much either except retreat rather quickly and they never rack up any decent number of kills. A lot of times they'll get caught between 2 brigades and just get decimated instead of staying on the flanks.  Still with all these little quirks i'll continue playing the game and enjoying it immensely. Hopefully some of those arty problems can get sorted out??","December 31, 2014","true","264.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And for this game is even better than many strategy games in the markets thanks to smart AI from both our side and enemy side. They react to incoming fire or movement, you don't have to babysit them all the time unlike other games. Also troops did not run away from the battlefiled when they were routed, they will run out of combat and take some rest. Every consequence you made will affect your next battle, if your army was devastated in the previous battle you will have a really hard time to fight the next one. Please do alwasys think thoughtfully before sending your army into the battle, otherwise they will die in vain.\n\nIt's a really decent game for the early access better than any early access games I had played before, it didn't come with a ton of bugs. Anyway, it's not the perfect game at this moment because it still have some bugs that really drive me insane such as enemy skirmishers and calvaries ran into my line formation, they suppose to flank and harass not to run into directly, or I can't see the height of the terrain, so I cannot find a good spot for my artilleries.\n\n\nI recommend this game to every commander out there to play is game. It's only $10 atm, and the price will go higher when the final release come!\n\n10/10","June 17, 2014","true","21.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You can choose from one of them or have the game randomly pick for you and be surprised.\n- I was also pleasantly surprised at the strategic choice of how to continue the fight after my first victory: I got to pick from three distinct strategies that were possible after the outcome of the battle. Too bad there was no map (as far as I could tell) to review the battlefield in advance of this choice, it was just plain text. A small gripe though..\n- The game models arty like it should be modelled: hard hitting guns with solid shot, explosive shells and cannister shot, each with their own ranges. The enemy bunches up for an assault, you have seconds to reload the guns with cannister, your heart is pounding as the enemy line approaches... BOOM.. dozens of men fall victim to your shot. But will the battery survive the onslaught? Amazing stuff.\n- The damage dealt by charges, particularly on routing units by cavalry or in the flank, could use a small damage boost I think. Again a small gripe to what is otherwise a very, very nice early access title.\n\nThe game at the moment of this review isn't done. A lot is still to be implemented. But for what is there, at 7,50 euro, you get a very new, already very complete battlefield experience.\n\nScores 9/10 for me!\n\n","June 13, 2014","true","1.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Gameplay is fluid while not being too fast or slow. It is fast to learn and hard to master. A must have for strategists and ACW experts.\nThe campaign can be played from either side, each side is unique in their gameplay style. With the confederacy being weaker alone but their commanders are much more effective at raising morale. The Union troops are much more disiciplined and well trained.\nThe campaign is dynamic with each battle taking place in one day. At the end of each battle you get choices as to what to do next depending on the objectives you were able to take in that day. This includes many what if scenarios aswell as the historical ones.\nThe graphics are beautiful, personally I am a big fan of sprites and this is a perfect example of how they can look good even in this day and age. The map is geographically and historically accurate while being living up to the artstyle of the rest of the game.\nThe only downpoint at the moment, is the single battle in the game which is at the name suggests Gettysburg, however browsing of any of the forums shows you that the developers have big plans for this game, including other battles and time periods.\nIt's a yes from me!","June 19, 2014","true","6.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

If your tired of strategy games with dumb@$$ AI, then buy this game. I played my first battle against the "balanced" AI, which is about average difficulty.  The AI made me pay dearly for my mistakes.  It didnt cheat, it exploited oppurtunities I had left open for it. Each side of the conflict has pro's and con's.  And you must use them to your advantage.  This game really will force you to think carefully about each order you give and I love that.  It was awesome to see that the dev's wanted the game to be historically accurate.  The battlefield is amazing and recreated to look like it did in the real Battle of Gettysburg.  So far I havent encountered any bugs, but as I said, I'm only like an hour into the game.  If some do happen to occur I am confident they will be fixed.  On a side note, anyone who has played any of the Darth mod's for the Total War series will be familiar with the lead dev.  Having played the mod for Empire:Total War, buying this game was a must for me.  Do yourself a favor and get into this game now, while its in early access.

With Ultimate General: Gettysburg (made up subtitle: 50 Shades of Gray and Blue), you can bust out all the clever flanks, quick marches, and brave hilltop stands that your little 19th century heart desires. I won't go over the same ground everyone else has trod a hundred times, so if you want to see about tactics, history, or cute little pointer arrows, see the other reviews.\n\nWhat I want to talk about is fun. The game is fun. Period. Like many people who are both reading this and over 30, I enjoyed several copies of Sid Meier's Gettysburg until they wore out and/or technology made it obscenely difficult to play, unless you download these 14 programs and employ a wizard. Along comes this game, which has apparently been dubbed "UGG" by people who are bad at thinking things through (seriously guys?).\n\nThe playability is easy to learn and more importantly easy to work under pressure. So you'll have plenty of time to watch closely for attacks, counter attacks, feints, troop movement, and all the swirling of mayhem and chaos that is a Civil War era battlefield. As well as plenty of time to scream at your troops to  "MOVE DAMMIT! The Rebs are coming!". Just like a REAL general.\n\nMultiplayer is a growing and fun experience as long as you plan to play before 9pm PST, because apparently everyone else is asleep after that. Perhaps dreaming of more charges and attacks. Maybe even dreaming of wrenching the controls from the esteemed Historical Gamer, so that maybe his division will face the right freaking direction at some point in the battle. Either way, matching wits against a fellow time displaced tactical thinker is always a treat, from the most nail biting battle of wits to the "Oh for the love of God he just rolled right over me with two divisions and a light cavalry."\n\nIt's worth playing. It's being improved constantly. It's growing. It's a ton of fun and a great mental exercise for the person who missed out on the ability to send tens of thousands of young men to their deaths for glory, honor, country, duty, and about 10 cents a day. Just play the damned game. And seriously Von Gilsa!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamchromium/recommended/306660/","iamchromium","Nancy Drew, Girl Detective","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamchromium/","438 products in account","This game in a nutshell: super ♥♥♥♥ing fun.\n\nThe action is fast-paced, but you can pause at any time to get a little more control over frantic situations; the scenarios are well-managed, and your mistakes in a single battle can and will haunt you for the rest of the campaign. The challenge is real, but highly customizable thanks to the game's fantastic tunable AI.\n\nThe AI -- oh, man, the AI. It feels like you're playing against a human. I can't make a single mistake, leave a single gap in my lines, leave a single high ground unoccupied without the AI punishing me for it. It takes advantage of opportunities, cuts its losses when it's outmatched, reinforces its weaknesses as soon as it's pressed. It hides its units behind hills and ambushes you when you advance. It's murderous.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws; unless you tell your units to hold, they have a tendency to wander (and even just telling your units to ROTATE loses their hold order). Unit selection is finicky, and a single click often selects three or four units (if they're closely bunched together). Sometimes, enemy units walk right through my lines in a heated battle (!) and start attacking my artillery (!!), then rout into my rear (!!!), reactivate, and run around capturing territory (!!!!!). I even once had a group of Confederates become invincible, so that no amount of my men could even hurt them. Thankfully, all those flaws are rarely game-ending, though it'd be nice if they were fixed.\n\nMost importantly, though, this game FEELS like Gettysburg. I remember playing Sid Meier's Gettysburg all the time when I was a kid. It's what got me into Civil War history. As many Americans suffered and died on the fields of this little Pennsylvanian town as did in the Vietnam war, all in the space of three summer days. Capturing that feeling -- a desperate, hard-fought struggle, rivers of blood running across idyllic pastures, the nation's fate resting on the outcome -- is difficult for anyone to achieve. This game totally gets it.","June 26, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ultimate General: Gettysburg is great mix of realism and fun, combined with a user friendly interface and simple, but perfect, game mechanics.\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg\nThe setting of the game is centered, as the name implies, around only one battle: the battle of Gettysburg. One of the pivotal moments of American Civil War history.\n\nThis was the battle in which General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, after a series of victories over the northern armies launched his second attack/invasion in Union territory. All preparations had been made to assemble as many men as the south could muster to decisively defeat the Union army in the north on their own soil just prior to the US presidential elections. The rationale behind this invasion of the south was to destroy Union morale and cause President Abraham Lincoln to not be re-elected for another term, opening the door for peace. Alternatively, if things would go extremely well, the objective would be to take Washington D.C. and thereby end the war almost immediately.\n\nOn the 1st of July 1863, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the Union Army of the Potomac met each other near the town of Gettysburg. The battle that would follow would be the largest of the entire conflict, ultimately resulting in a decisive Union victory. The game puts you in charge of the entire Union or Confederate Army from the earliest moments of the first day right through the entire multi-day battle that would be Gettysburg.\n\nFirst Impressions\nFrom the start you can choose to fight as the Confederates or as the Union, you start from the 1st of July when the first elements of both armies met each other at McPherson's Ridge. From then on it is you, the player, who decides how the battle will progress. The battle map has a unique art style that is very appealing to the eye. People that familiar to for example Total War games might feel that the graphics of this game are inferior. The difference is that where Total war puts emphasis on graphics and more lighter, arcadish entertainment, this game puts more emphasis on the more realistic tactical and strategic part of a battle. The graphics are therefore of lesser importance, but that does not mean that they are bad. As a matter of fact I very much liked these graphics as I think they are functional and allow the player to have a good impression on what is happening on the battlefield.\n\nBattle Phases and Map\nThe aim of the entire game is of course to win the battle, either as the Confederates or the Union. However, in order to win, the entire battle is divided in a number of days/phases as are many battles throughout history. You start out on day 1 with mostly a skirmish between the elements of both armies for control of the western ridges of the town of Gettysburg. On the map each objective has victory points. These are the points one needs to capture in order to win that phase of the battle. The amount of time in which you can achieve this is limited usually to half a day, which progresses quite slow in comparison to other games on the market. This game therefore actually feels much more realistic and gives you way more time to think over your tactical strategies. During each phase you might get reinforcements as they approached the field at certain time during the real battle. Your handling of the situation finally determines the how the battle will progress. For example, if you capture more key objectives, such as Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill as the Conferates, during the first day of the battle this might result in an early victory. Between each phase of the battle you will have multiple tactical decisional options available that can be historical or not, depending on how the battle went thus far. Units that were in battle earlier and  that suffered losses or are on low morale or exhausted, which is abstracted by a unit morale and condition parameter, will inherit this status to the next phase. This gives much more tactical depth to your decisions. Do you push hard and capture key objectives early on with many losses or play more conservative with the risk of losing momentum? Do not forget: enemy reinforcements could still turn the battle even when you are already celebrating victory or in despair. It is these details that make this game stand out from many other strategy games I have played over the years.\n\nUnits\nUnit commands are simple, yet effective. You simply click a unit and drag and drop a line along which they can move. You can also group multiple units and move them together and units will automatically form up formations depending on how far they need to move. If they need to march a long distance they form a column and form a line when getting closer to combat or their final destination. You can have units walk or run, though running will reduce their condition, thereby making them less effective in a fight and letting them rout more easy. Also units can be forced to hold, which will force them to stay at their location and only move then either ordered or routed. Objects on the map, such as woods, houses or stone walls will give units cover, which is calculated by the cover parameter. High cover reduces the chance of getting hit, which can be vital to give your units the edge over the enemy in firefights. Units can also be ordered to charge, though the outcome can be unpredictable. Charging towards cannister shot loaded cannons might not be such a smart thing. However charging with rested troops into weakened enemy troops holding a position can be a great way to quickly take an objective and gain ground. Here the key is to do the right stuff at the right time and moment. An all out charge with all troops will likely result in a defeat, so picking your battles even within a battle is vital to success.\n\nThe AI\nWhen you start a new game you can choose the opposing general's attitude. You can pick many different attitudes, which are distributed in two ways: difficulty and aggressiveness. You can thus have for example a difficult defensive opponent or a balanced one. On the field you can notice the difference between these attitudes. This therefore means that the Union will not always be on the defense only, as was mostly the case in the historical battle under the risk-avoiding Union general Meade. The same goes if playing for the Union, though the Confederates will always attack on the first days, the attitude can matter on how aggressive an opponent is. More difficult opponents tend to flank more and more aggressive opponents tend to charge more often or place their guns closer to the front line. The AI is therefore a welcome surprise and you will find the AI not a pushover, though as a human I must admit I tend to finally win, though individual phases of the battle can be lost.\n\nClosing Comments\nUltimate General: Gettysburg, is a great game that is still being developed as we speak. It combines excellent tactical decision making with realism all coated with decent graphics and art. The sound effects of the game are functional, but not special. The simple handling of units works well and the slower pace of the this game compared to other tactical war games allows for easy control of the units and a very to-the-point system. The AI is good and the different attitudes that can be set, combined with your own different handling of the battle, gives the game more replayability. The multiple battle phases/days and dynamic tactical options between each phase allows for more freedom of choice and again adds to replayabilty and depth to the game.\n\nThough only as of now, one battle, this battle was been implemented the most user friendly and best way I have ever seen from a game. I hope the team that makes this game will continue to add battles in future. I would say for strategy fans, this game is a must buy.","July 20, 2014","true","16.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Now that it is finally out I can say that it lives up to the hype I set for it in my mind. You can play as either side and it's really immersive with a fine variety of sounds and enough game to keep me going for the considerable future. Despite how amazing i have found it keep in mind I am a History fanatic and enjoy anything to do with the American Civil War. It still needs some work. A total war style campaign is a hope, but not a necessity. The ability to have different formations is something this game could benefit from greatly. A large mob is not exactly what I want all the time, sure there are formations that they form themselves in but I'd feel much more immersed if i could command them to do such things. Other than some minor bugs and a few little quirks this game is definitely worth a purchase even if you are only mildly interested. So much to offer so early in it's release. This is a early access game i hope turns into a full-release success. Buy it now.","August 1, 2014","true","5.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Had lots of time in, so it's not an opinion with zero merit.  Cannot understand the negative reviews here.  This ought to be a self-selecting audience. Anyone playing this likes Civil War History, and/or strategy games.  For those seeking some hysterically complex game with 70,000 hexes and 500,000 units, I would say you won't find it here.  But if you are looking for a great, fast-paced, fun to play strategy game, this fills the bill perfectly.  There are plenty of units, great animations, and the field of dead is rewarding, at the end of a battle.  There are a few tweaks necessary for line of sight stuff, but often your own troops and geographic features are legitimately blocking the artillery - usually can be remedied by moving it around.  When you DO find a good spot for your artillery, it is devastatingly effective.  I just had a great game, with an 'Epic Victory' at Cemetery Hill.  As the Confederates, I won the high ground on Culps Hill and a Hill just south of the battle area, and moved my artillery up fast.  The battle ended with me having 6500 dead to the Union 10,000 dead, and I had Cemetery Hill.  It was glorious.  My only real complaint is that it is difficult sometimes to perceive your position on a hill, relative to the enemy (and between your own units).  A rotating oblique view/camera might help address the positioning issues.  I am not sure if the developer reads these reviews, but I would love to have a replay feature.  Not sure if it would be too much of a nod/copy of SMG, but a replay feature would be great, or some mechanism to review one's performance after a battle.  The battles are tense, and demand some concentration. There is not really time to look around (except a snapshot on pause), and it would be great to review how things went, at a more leisurely pace when the battle is done.  I have played through a dozen or two full campaigns of several battles, and find it interesting and engaging each time.  The ground is familar, but trying new tactics or taking different chances keeps things perpetually fresh.  Great game.","August 6, 2014","true","114.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You all are definatly showing your impressive chops with this submission. As not only a gamer of 3+ decades but also an avid historian this Gettysburg ... I guess the word is expected to be "Simulation", but that can hardly do it justice at all. I personally see this as more of a virtual re-enactment game. Case in point I have read this product to be rather over compared to Sid Meirs Gettysburg from nearly a decade and half ago. I can not agree with that assessment at all. Apples and oranges. I have played that game on a Win. 98 pc and an emulator very recently. If that era is classical Greece. This game is Victorian England. Pax Britainia may lack the unity and tradition of it's predicessor however the one thing it has in spades is adaptability. In it's present form this title has about three great innovations going for it and about 5 that are heinously broken. Three of which I think will get smoothed out in time.\n\nPro's:\n\n#1 The graphics are atleast as fluidic as the gameplay. To some this may be a no-brainer but as I have noticed over the decades. Games that look awesome often play like crap. Tweak report: Better zooming in and out. Overlay FMV scenes for special events. (I.E devils den, little round top.)\n\n#2 Commanders and regiments are not only diverse in character but also manage to perform true to the peroid specific level of technology. (In english that all means that instead of rapid fire shoot and scoot, we are getting an almost 'real-time' 3 shots a minute line of battle.) In previous game's of this era you could easily creep toward the enemy and push them away. If you try that with this game you're likely to get half your regiment shot up. Very true to form indeed. Kudos. Tweak report: Please don't take this as a critism but command units, especial cavalry, of the post napolionic era were attached to there units. Litteraly could not go more than about 50 yards away from the captain or Major in line of battle. If they did NOBODY had orders or knew what direction to go. It was all done by a rather rediculous web of riders, runners and couriers. Through out the civil war walkie talkies could have saved THOUSANDS of lives. In game terms. The little horse command units that tend to wander all over Pennsylvania until a skirmish unit kills them are about as usefull as titts on a bull unless directly attached to something dependant on moral. The exception to this is of course Artillary. They did not have upper ranking officers. The were drawn by individual division commanders.\n\n#3 Objective points that are actually worth fighting for rather than just over-running on the way to destroying the enemy. Straight forward, basic and to the point. The difference between an educational game and a fun one is in the details. Finally a game where you can really get a feel for making the opponate "Pay for the same real estate twice" as G. Patton would say.\n\nCons: As of my writing this, these are the bugs and glitches that I personaly feel need the most attention. I will try to by pass the ones that have already been brought up by others.\n\n#1 Stick-man-mania. Most all RTS games have had this problem in one form or another since the dawn of Pong. In battle, troops DO NOT move as one no matter how well deciplined they are made out to be. Some stop and stand in place. Some fall down and stand back up. Others soil them selves and run off screaming like there sister. A formation of 'soldiers' that is prone to be a block with a hit point rating is VERY easy to manipulate into doing whatever the heck you want it to do all the time. A phenominon that has happened in battle pretty much... NEVER. And even worse tends to lose it's fun value. Tweak report: Perhaps incorporate a chaos responce matrix into individual regiments. No more or less than 13% will react to something like being green battle fatigue or of course the rebel yell. Johny reb was not as well fed and would have less stamina but more likely to make a stand against a larger force. Billy Yank has the mini-ball and more acurate at range but also went into Gettysburg with annoying little problems like alarmingly poor morale and a language barrier.\n\n#2 Terrain perspective confusion. This may have just been me doing something wrong... But I had a regiment on one side of a grove of tree's trading shots with an enemy on the other side of the grove of trees and I'll be darned if both sides were not getting shot to hell. Rivers / streams seem about as hindering as roads. Buildings can be walked through as though they are not there... etc.\n\n#3 No capture or bayonete melee. I imagine this will be on the top of the list to fix, however I just wanted to add the idea that their seems to be a charging, routing then they turn and fire at you thing going on... ALOT!\n\nAll just my respective two cents. Looking forward to coutless hours of fun with this. Hoping to see such expansions as Antietem, Fredricksburg, Vicksburg to name a few.\n\nJim\n","June 16, 2014","true","18.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I know i will play it much more though as it is a fantastic game. You know Rome 2 and the absolute horrible AI? Well this game is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE in a way that is hard to describe. I wouldn't say it is like fighting some other person, that is a bit of a stretch, but it is amazing. It seems as though it "adapts" to the situation at hand and it always provides a challenge. While the game is only a few segments long (depending how good you are) it has quite a bit of replayability in it. Did i mention the graphics? While not phenominal, i do quite like the scale and "smallness" of the units and bulidings on a huge map. The only gripes i have are probably the uselessness of cavalry as they seem to run away from everything, the game seems to be semi-fast and is kind of hard to keep control of, and the fact that some battles can seem to drag out forever because of the semi-broken morale system that seems to make people run away at random (or atleast, in my experience). Also there will be multiplayer in APPROXIMATLEY 2 weeks (at the time of writing) which sounds very fun and i can't wait.

Did you also hate the awful controls that made managing your units a chore? Ultimate General is the polar opposite of that. Writing this, I have only played for a short while, but already the battles are much more enjoyable and challenging than Empire/Napoleon Total War ever was.\n\nAfter spending years fixing Creative Assembly's mess, Nick Thomadis, the creator of the Darth Mod for various Total War games, decided to make his own game and the result is this.\n\nThe ai is intelligent and fights hard and your own units manage just fine without you micro managing them. Leaving you to take care of the larger plan. The controls are streamlined, in a good way, instead of having to micro manage your unit's formation and making sure that they won't die the moment you move away, you give more general commands and the ai figures out the rest intelligently. I never had to tell my troops what to attack specifically, only where to go. They made good choices on their own.\nThat doesn't mean you just sit and watch the battle unfold. You still have to make sure that your troops are in the right places to ensure victory. The game does allow some micro management but it is often not needed.\n\nGame is still in early access, but already it is a lot of fun.

The developers did not include much in the way of a game guide or tutorial, however Dartis actually has an awesome tactical guide on steam. You can find it  at this link .\n\nIf anyone is having trouble with this game, or finds it to be flawed I highly recommend reading this guide. It goes into detail about things like condition and morale, which play a huge role in charges, retreating, etc. Once you know these concepts god damn does this game become fun! The past 10 hours (as of now) since the first hour I played has been only enjoyable.\n\nIt is tactical, brutal, tense..the ground in front of you changes hands six times, canister shot after canister shot being poured into the lines. makes me excited just thinking about it.\n\nThis is a game of patience and maneuvering. It is a fair amount of stand and fire, fallback and replace the line with reserves, and so on, just like the actual civil war. However a cunning, opportune massed charge or flank attack can break through and roll up the enemies line. The important thing is being able to utlize this advantage, which in the actual civil war was sometimes not taken advantage of (as in, a charge that broke through had no real plan for afterward and would be repulsed).\n\nSo it is purely a strategy game. What will you do after breaking through? Do you have reserves to follow up? Are you going to/have you created a salient? This game reminds me of chess in some ways, in that each move must have a larger plan, must have something it is following up, and you must be ready to counter any move the opposition may make.\n\nNo game is perfect but in terms of pure, straight-forward strategy with a fantastic historical flair,  Ultimate General: Gettysburg  comes pretty dang close.","February 25","true","19.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This Ultimate General improves on only one aspect of the game over the Firaxis version: the AI. But here is the problem, in order to increase the difficulty, the AI does not get better, instead, the enemy units simply become more effective at killing on average. When the game is set to high difficulty, the disparity becomes absurd as weak Union units on the AI side deal damage at twice the rate of strong Confederate units when both are on open, flat ground.\n\nThis would all be manageable if utilizing terrain was straight forward, but it's not. Some forests are better than others and it's impossible to tell which ones are better until you bring a unit into them. Then, when artillery are supposedly under 100% cover, enemy artillery are still able to rout them in only 5 or 6 salvos of solid shot from half a mile. No 3 inch ball fired half a mile is going to reliably hit its target especially if it is fired unsighted.\n\nUnless you memorize this game front and back, when playing at high difficult, be prepared to be surprised at how much damage you take and how little you can dole out. This is coming from someone who has won decisive and triumphant victories. It all makes the game incredibly unsatisfying.","February 1","false","149.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

The positioning of the units has to be thought out well. Even the strongest brigade will route at some point when it's getting attacked in the flank. And a general always has to ask himself if his troops are able to perform the given orders or if he demanded too much and sent them on an impossible mission.

The game's menus are simplistic and easily read and understood.  The graphics are simple, yet clean and fitting for a game like this.  Terrain plays a proper factor in battle.  Troop movement, for the most part, works how it should, and tactical decisions seem to have an impact on the battle.\n\nOn the other hand this game has a few flaws.  Ive been able to completely push Union forces beyond the edges of the map without having a quicker, more decisive victory.  I have to maintain a certain distance from the edge of the map, in order to kill the forces more effectively.  Also the Confederate troops seem to retreat an awful lot in close quarters and during charges, despite having greater numbers than the defending units being fought.  General Davis' troops, in particular, seem to retreat almost every time I send them into battle.\n\nOverall the game is great, but with a few various AI flaws.

Again, this game has the potential to be the best and it looks like the makers of this game are constantly improving it.\n\n<h2>Pros:</h2>\n\n<b>Ease of Gameplay/Movement</b>\n\nI was able to start playing this game from the moment I downloaded it. There was little to no learning curve at all.  They have made the controls so easy, a caveman could do it. Its very easy to move troops around and position them where you want them to be.\n\n<b>No Limber & Unlimber</b>\n\nLimbering and unlimbering your artillery makes for a more realistic gameplay. That is something artillery really had to do. However, when you're in the heat of battle and being overrun by a charge, its redundant and annoying to have to keep doing that to every artillery brigade. I forgot to do it sometimes in past games.  This is a detail that I am glad they left out. The AI just does it for you. It still takes a little time for them to get going but you don't have to press a button for them to do it.\n\n<b> Multiple Scenarios, Both Historical and What If </b>\n\nThis is something most Civil War games have but it seems like this one has more "what if" options available. I have been to Gettysburg twice and know the layout well. Never heard of Benner's Hill. So I got to learn something new.\n\n<b> Accurate </b>\n\nAll of the names, Generals and locations are accurate to the letter.  Impressive when you consider the developers are all from Eastern Europe. You can tell they spent hours doing their homework on even seemingly insignificant details.  Even the farms are labeled by their proper game.\n\n<b> Fun Gameplay...At Least Initially</b>\n\nIf I were to give the gameplay a fun rating from 1-10, I would give this one a 6. Despite some faults that I will point out in a minute that annoyed me as I got into it, this is an overall fun game to play, at least for the first couple hours.\n\n<h2> Cons </h2>\n\nHere are some things that I think definitely needs to be fixed for this game to be great. They were not apparent during the first few hours but as time went by, got really annoying.\n\n<b> Confederate Army Has Obvious Advantage </b>\n\nThis is a complaint that some other players have said and after playing with both armies, I totally agree. The CSA has a distinct advantage over the Union.\n\n<em>Background: Sorry if its long but I think it needs to be said. At the start of the war, the CSA had a distinct advantage in generals and quality of soldiers. Many of the generals had experience with the Mexican War 13+ years back and the men who made up southern army handling guns from the time they could walk. What's more, people from rural backgrounds will most likely be able to handle the rigors of long marches, lack of food, lack of adequate shelter and stress much better than their city counterparts.</em>\n\n\n<em>Having said that, as the war drew on, this advantage disappeared. For one, many of the best southern generals were killed and the northern soldiers were catching up. By the summer of 1863, the quality of soldiers from the Union was pretty close to their southern counterparts.  The reason the Army of the Potomac was losing battles had nothing to do with its soldiers. From all accounts, the men who were present at Fredericksburg, 2nd Manassas and Chancellorsville were as brave as you can be. It was the successive appointments of unqualified and incapable Major Generals (many of whom got their position by their connections in Washington) that were responsible for blunder after blunder after blunder.</em>\n\nNow...back the the game. The Confederate troops are unrealistically better than the Union.  Its overblow to an obvious level that gets frustrating quickly. They can withstand the worst of situations (very low moral and condition) while the Union troops seem to run at the first volley that gets fired at them.\n\nEvery charge done by the CSA ends in a route for them. Pressing "charge" for any Union unit is a complete waste of time b/c it never works. They always loose the melee. The Iron Brigade and Vincent's Brigade were not the only decent units at Gettysburg.\n\n<b> Infinite Artillery </b>\n\nThere should be a limit to the amount of shells each artillery unit has. They either need to run out until the next battle or have to resupply.\n\nThe only advantage the Union army has is its superior artillery. It seems to have more artillery most of the time and can be better concentrated because of the compact interior. You can really mass artillery units together to help make up for your poor quality troops.\n\n<em>However, the amount of artillery available is also relevant to the battle.  Some may call me nitpicking but this has a HUGE IMPACT on the battle. The CSA had enough cannons but couldn't resupply them as fast as the Union. This could never be more true than during Pickett's Charge. The whole plan of General Lee was to bombard the center into smithereens and then send 15,000 into a softened center. Problem is, they ran out of artillery ammo shortly before the charge started and couldn't support the army. While they were charging on the 3rd day, the Union shooting everything you can imagine into their ranks while their guns were silent.</em>\n\nIn essence, I'm saying that if you're going to make the Confederate soldiers so much better than the Union then you need to make the Union's artillery advantage equally better than the Confederate.\n\nAs the game stands, the Union has a small advantage in this department but not enough. In this game the CSA wins the 3rd day with too much ease. The Union artillery doesn't do enough to break their ranks up and the Union soldiers crack.\n\nWhen I'm doing Pickett's Charge as the CSA, I can put the troops on autopilot. I told every brigade to charge towards the center and won with ease. Main reason: the Unions primary advantage on this day is high mitigated.\n\nNote: I know the 3rd day is hard to replicate because no Gettysburg game has gotten it right. Sid Meier's....same thing. The artillery of the Union, as programmed, can't do enough damage and their soldiers can be easy overwhelmed.\n\n<b> Seminary Ridge Needs To Be Further From Cemetery Hill<b>\n\nThey are way too close. They need to be distanced. One of the reasons why the 3rd day is so unrealistic is because they CSA seems to only have to charge a couple feet to get to the center line. This make the 2nd con I just mentioned more pronounced because the the Union gets a 1-3 good shoots before the Confederates are upon them.\n\n<b> Calvery </b>\n\nIt seems awfully easy for Stuart's cavalry to to flank me from behind on the 3rd day. Custer's men don't put up much of a fight (even though they win a battle one day later) and the southern cavalry easily charges through massed volleys. I find myself having to divert an insane number of men and artillery to keep him at bay. No matter what his casualties are when I do this, he regroups after a couple minutes and charges at me again. Unrealistic! Harass. Maybe. Attack supply lines. Yes. Disrupt. Yes. Maybe I'm wrong but I never remember horse cavalry attacking the main army in massed formation like that. Bufford could be used to counter my argument but he was doing more a delaying action that anything and they were dismounted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","September 1, 2014","true","50.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Crush the dastardly Yankees at Gettysburg and secure victory for the Southern people!\n\nAn RTS, Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a really well made game. Players are given predetermined troops who must seize certain objectives on the battlefield. The landscape is beautifully rendered in a clean, vibrant style. At the end of the battle's time limit (which may be delayed for certain reseans), scores are tallied to determine the victor. Casulties (I believe) are carried over into the next battle. The Iron Brigade was crushed in the first battle and practically ceased to exist (take that Lincolnites!). Before the next battle, the player is given two option to choose from on the overall goal of the next battle (seize Seminary Ridge, hold Culp's Hill, etc). Even as such a short game, this creates a lot of replayability. First time I played (Dixians of course) I narrowly lost. Second time round was an epic victory with 37,000 Yankee casulties to the South's 25,000. "Field promotions all around! President Davis will be most pleased."\nI really hope this same system spawns sequels.

As someone who has nearly passed the Gettysburg Liscensed Battlefield Guide exam, missing the cut by three quetions, I can say that this game is a real treat for the historian as well as a casual gamer.  This game mixes historically accurate scenarios with the always wonderful what ifs.  The playing field is wonderfully detailed, included much lesser known landmarks than your traditional game would have included.  Ultimate General Gettysburg takes me back to the days of playing Sid Meirer's Gettysburg.  The two have quite a lot of similarities, so if you are familiar with Sid's version you can see how this game plays.  The only draw backs to this game that I have come across are two things.  One: you only get brigade command and not individual regimental commands, so the tactical command in battle is kind of simplistic.  Two: the brigades aren't historically accurate to the condition of the troops.  In several scenarios, Brockenbrough's brigade, which in real life was poorly lead and filled with lesser quality troops, but in this game they will stand and fight almost to the last man; meanwhile crack units will retreat after the first volley they receive.  Other than those picky critiques this game in extremely entertaining and is a pleasure to play.","July 10, 2014","true","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its complexity is just brilliant. You have to think of everything, morale, condition, terrain positioning, cover, line of sight...There are some bugs, such as: artillery sometimes won't fire for some reason, even if you put them on hill where they can see everything, or on open plains; Cavalry usually won't charge when you command them. I managed to make them charge artillery only once. But bugs are expected since this is early access game.","August 10, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I mean in terms of battles of course, not strategic level.\nIn contrast to TW series about XVIII-XIX century what Ultimate General has? Firstly, it has really nice enemy Al which can adapt to changing situation on the battlefield( but don't worry it's not so hard, you just don't feel like you're playing with a ♥♥♥♥♥). Secondly your units Al, you don't have to watch after every of yours units because you afraid that they make something stupid. For example - artillery units don't shoot through allied units (gods, I hate that in E:TW, moment of inattention and your art is ripping through your infantry units because they stand too close). Next good thing is 2D graphic, but it is only my opinion. I don't need beatifull 3D graphic in strategy game. Of course it's nice feature for a game, but you admire your pretty 3D soldiers only for 5 minutes and after that you're playing in max zoom out mode. In addition to these things these game just got multiplayer patch ( just 2 maps by now, but playing with human is always better than with a machine).\nAnd these all fine features and many more cost only 7,49 euro. It is really admirable that people from Game Labs don't charge full price for game in early acces.","August 17, 2014","true","51.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I never thought I'd get this many hours out of one three day battle, but I honestly feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. I only have two complaints, 1) I wish you could play out the entire battle in a multiplayer, instead of just individual little battles. 2) Sometimes your troops do dumb things, like can't shoot down a hill at an enemy right at the foot of the hill, or break and run towards the enemy, instead of away from them. But I'm sure those issues will be fixed in future updates. I'd be interested to see maybe something like Ultimate General: Somme, or maybe something really ambitious like the entire Civil War or maybe World War One, Hopefully, if the developer decides to do something like that, they have the sense to stay well away from World War Two, as that's honestly way too overdone. Anyway, I really recommend this game to any fan of wargames, or RTS's.

It reminds me of the old Sid Meier's Gettysburg. You control one side or another and the branching battle structure will put you in new positions depending on how you did in the previous battle. The basics of a simpler, but still complex enough to be fun, wargame are all here. It doesn't take long to learn but it might take a while to master. It's attractive and fun while staying true to the largest conflict ever on US soil.\n\nSo if you're looking for a wargame that doesn't take 30 hours to learn and will be fun right off the bat, this is it.

I supposed I can say that I do like it, even love it, up to a point.  That point occurs when play stops, and the next phase of the battle begins.\n\nAfter the reset and start of the next pahse my troops are generally nowhere near where they were before the reset.  Why on Earth should I continue to play, using my own tactics when the @#$%%@$ game is just going to reset and put my troops where General Lee's troops were at that particular point in the battle?  What is the point of fighting based on General Lee's decisions?  He lost the battle.  I am playing to win, not to follow a set piece of failed tactics and improper use of terrain and concetration of force.\n\nLike I said, while the game is playing it is great, but dare to succeed where the ANV failed and the game will remind you that the CSA lost this one, and you are not meant to have an orginal thought in your head.  Instead of wasting time putting inputs in to the game, it should play out like a movie or just have a bunch of prompts to tell you where you can and can't go based on the upcoming reset.\n\nI had my HQ inside of Gettyburg and had the Yankees nearly completely enevolped under crushing concetrated artillery.

Graphically it doesn't compete with any games of it's type really, but the strategy and thought that goes into it is just what Total War lacks. Ultimate General is a very diverse tactical game, where your mission is to pick either Confederate or Union, and win the battle of Gettysburg, which ultimatly saw the fall of the Confederate States. I am a Confederate supporter, so I always play Confederate. I am good at strategy games, but I am yet to win a Battle as the CSA. I came so very close, but their troops just aren't as devastasing as that of the Union. This game is very realistic, and it takes unit positioning into account well. A silly mistake could cost you a flank, and the AI has the intelligence to seek this opportunity. Confederate Units don't generally take as much of a beating, I have noticed. I have used 2 v 1 on good Union units such as the Iron Brigade, and only just won. Moral is a problem for the CSA, and I notice they are happier to run generally, than take a beating.\n\nI haven't yet found a tactic that works, it is a very challenging game. Where you place your units, height, cover etc, really matters, and judging it wrong will cost you, most likely.\n\nI really like this game, and it get's very intense towards the end just because of the sheer amount of units on the field. The battle is broken up into parts, and sometimes you have to take the decision to push on a certain position of he union army, seperatly from the full scale battle. Afterwards, you may be taken back onto the full battlefield with all of your armies, and all of the enemy against you, and you have to crush them ultimatly. I do find the time limits a problem, as I am not a very agressive player, and last time I was winning as CSA slowly, but the game ended as I ran out of time.\n\n\nIt really takes a lot of practice, it is NOT an easy game to play, but it is fun. I reccomend it 100%, especially to those that like the game type, or the era. 10/10, the CSA will win some day...I am trying.","February 28","true","5.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

So it's nice to be able to dive into a fairly decent Civil War game again and bring the Rebs another win over the Union.\n\nPro's:\n\n- Solid infantry battles and line movement, important to keep your troops connected, you really feel the heat if you\ndon't keep your army in formation or a section of your line breaks\n- Solid sound effects help bring home the ambiance of the battlefield without overdoing it and the graphics are just right\n- Smooth game-pace which is fluid and engaging throughout the battle, you will be paying attention and having to make efforts to either take the offense or "hold the line", you control how much territory you want to hold or defend, or advance on\n- Variety of AI settings (although I have not tried them all) which help you create the kind of game dynamic you're looking for on the battlefield (some people like a defensive AI where others prefer to attack)...I believe there are 9 different options to choose from\n\nCon's:\n\n- Finding the range, elevation and line-of-sight of your troops can be frustrating, once you figure it out it's not as bad and although there is a tool to help you, it still feels quite non-user-friendly, so you will spend time fussing with this\n- Infantry units seem to break at odd times and have a strange pathing when they do, it's a bit unpredictable how they'll react at times, it should be easier to take a quick glance at moral without having to look at each unit or making them hold\n- It's not a full-game in the sense of a large drawn out campaign, but for the money it's well-done and the system works well with the style..after all it's called Gettysburg, it's not just the name of the game but honestly you may not even notice as it feels like a series of different battles based on your performance\n\nIt's not a AAA title, but if you enjoy Civil War strategy games, I doubt you'll be disappointed. There's not a lot of bells and whistles here, with options and imaginative or breath-taking graphics, but it's what you expect from a Civil War game and it's a good buy if you're just looking to spend a few hours or more on the Civil War battlefield.\n\n\n","October 24, 2014","true","8.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Artillery is kind of fickle in terms of being in a position to fire and LOS doesn't always seem to be respected. I placed a brigade on the downside of a hill to 'ambush' an enemy coming over the crest but instead they just shot at each other through the top of the hill.

I have always been really into the history of the American Civil War, although I am not from the States. As a 9 years old child I had been playing a simple game called Civil War on one of my very first PCs in the 1990s. Than for years I have been playing Sierra's Civil War 2 Generals. And now besides AGEOD'S Civil War games this is my favourite game from this era.\n\nI have just beaten the AI on "Determined" level with the Confederacy.\nThe game is dinamic and feels very alive. It responds to the player's decisions very well. The AI can be adjusted to your taste very easily. The game captures the historical settings very well, but the progress and the outcome of the battle depends on your tactics. I really like the modelling of morale and how generals can influence the behavior of your troops.\nIf you are a Civil War fanatic just like me, this is your game.","January 6, 2015","true","40.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are absolutely intuitive and address most of the problems I've had with similar grand strategy games (namely, pathfinding is not an issue in Ultimate General: Gettysburg).  I was surprised by how competent the AI was, and how differently you have to play in order to beat each one--so far I've played three different iterations of the battle against three different AI opponents, and it resulted in radically different outcomes each time.  The historical detail is also astonishing.\n\nThat said, the game isn't perfect.  My main criticism is in the way different kinds of units are handled.  You'll primarily be using infantry--which is to be expected, since it is the Civil War--but I haven't gotten much mileage out of the artillery or videttes (mounted cavalry) you have access to in this game.  Soldier for soldier, infantry is much more effective and everything else seems kind of useless.  Some of the battles end pretty quickly, too; I had one end before the reinforcements I got halfway through could make it to my line.\n\nStill, this is a very good tactical strategy game, and as a bonus will definitely satisfy Civil War buffs who have gone without a good representation of the period since the Sid Meier games or the Civil War Generals series.","January 3, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am not that good of general, but I am able to crush this game everytime even with the AI boost on.\n\nThere are also many frustrating oddities.\n- Iron Brigade is decimated by my fire, loses over a 1,000 men and marches through five Confederate units on its way to take Herr Ridge - really?\n- I targetted two of my units to attack 1 union unit.  All three intermingle but there no losses on either side.  The units just stand there. Very weird.\n- I flanked the left side of the union army, and one of my units is routed. Instead of fleeing away from the Union line, it flees toward it and then turns Northward to run down the entire union line, losing over 1,000 men in the process.\n- Game seems slight tilted toward Union, making it easier to play Union side. When I am on the verge of taking an objective as the Union, the game will delay the end of battle several times.  However, when I play as Confederate, the battle is not delayed even though the objective is being contested.  Also playing on the Confederate side, I have decimated the Union forces only to be told at the end of the scenario that I received a crushing defeat.  Two rounds later I have pushed the Union forces from the map, which I feel is a sweeping victory, but instead I am told it is a minor victory even though I have 6,000 fewer casualties and control  of the entire map.\n\nIt is a fun game, and worth the money.

And now besides AGEOD'S Civil War games this is my favourite game from this era.\n\nI have just beaten the AI on "Determined" level with the Confederacy.\nThe game is dinamic and feels very alive. It responds to the player's decisions very well. The AI can be adjusted to your taste very easily. The game captures the historical settings very well, but the progress and the outcome of the battle depends on your tactics. I really like the modelling of morale and how generals can influence the behavior of your troops.\nIf you are a Civil War fanatic just like me, this is your game.","January 6, 2015","true","40.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are absolutely intuitive and address most of the problems I've had with similar grand strategy games (namely, pathfinding is not an issue in Ultimate General: Gettysburg).  I was surprised by how competent the AI was, and how differently you have to play in order to beat each one--so far I've played three different iterations of the battle against three different AI opponents, and it resulted in radically different outcomes each time.  The historical detail is also astonishing.\n\nThat said, the game isn't perfect.  My main criticism is in the way different kinds of units are handled.  You'll primarily be using infantry--which is to be expected, since it is the Civil War--but I haven't gotten much mileage out of the artillery or videttes (mounted cavalry) you have access to in this game.  Soldier for soldier, infantry is much more effective and everything else seems kind of useless.  Some of the battles end pretty quickly, too; I had one end before the reinforcements I got halfway through could make it to my line.\n\nStill, this is a very good tactical strategy game, and as a bonus will definitely satisfy Civil War buffs who have gone without a good representation of the period since the Sid Meier games or the Civil War Generals series.","January 3, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The dynamics are completely different, and not in a bad way. I really bought this because I'm working in the Unity Engine myself and wanted to see what some other folks have done. And.... it really astonished me!\n\nAt first I was looking at the looping tutorial videos, and the fairly-stock Unity interface buttons and stuff (that does need a bit of polish. Couldn't you guy have customized it so that it fits the theme?) and so I expected a fairly standard indie game. Especially when I saw that its actually Sprite Based.\n\nI figured I'd play a level or two... but thenI found myself playing many levels. Probably 6 or 8. (I can't even keep track, see?) Its engrossing, engaging, challenging AI... just... a masterpiece really.\n\nThat said: there are some things that could use improvement. Get rid of the stock Unity GUI boxes. 3D instead of Sprites would have been nice. More levels, or at least some DLCs for additional battles. Was calary really so unimportant?

While you do not have as much control as you did in SM: Gettysburg, the controls are a lot easier. Instead of having to move every regiment individually, you now control brigades.

It is quite difficult! This isn't a game that will hold your hand and give you an easy ride. It has some rough spots - the fact that you don't get any information on the relative strengths/weaknesses of your units is a problem. Hint: skirmishers are awful at melee combat. Once you get over that hump though, the battle itself is involving and challenging. You will endure heavy losses to your troops and strategy plays a big part - terrain, positioning, and timing of attacks as well as smart use of units all factor heavily in your chances of prevailing.\n\nA lot is made of the controls being simple - I don't have that much experience with the genre so my comments are specific to UG:G. I don't like that you need the CTRL key so much in order to position your units facing the correct direction. I think this could have been done better. The grouping of units is also not ideal - grouping them is easy but again the CTRL function of a grouped unit seems flawed with units often crossing paths to reach their positions.\n\nStill, definitely recommended.","January 3, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is pretty shallow for an RTS.You mostly just order your units where to go and watch them kill each other. There isn't enough strategy or choices that you can make to turn the tide in battle.\n\n-No way to rally routing units or inspire units.\n\n-No period formation options for units.\n\n-Lacks music. I'd like to some music in the game. At least some period fife and drums for infantry. The game has no music apart from the main menu.\n\n-Cavalry are a joke. They play like cowardly infantry on horses. No option to charge in close with sabers.\n\nIn the future I'd like to see more Civil war battles besides Gettysburg. I feel they need to add more to the gameplay first though.\n\nI was able to beat two medium AI opponents with both sides and get all the achievements in 9 hours. The AI only defeated me on one day of the battle. That was because he had over double the amount of men I had. It wasn't very hard for the most part. I could try the hard AI's or Multiplayer.

Gameplay is extremely fluid and terrific UI makes it quite easy to control even the largest battles without any frustration. Although UGG lacks the extreme realism of Scourge Of War games, for example, it definitely makes it up with the enjoyable frustration free gameplay rarely seen on any RTS game withi similar scope. Don't get me wrong, gameplay isn't overly simplistic. This is just one of those games that is easy to learn but hard to master. There are quite a lot options for your troops but all actions are beautifully integrated to the one of the best UIs of RTS genre. In addition to that, AI does good job and developers are improving the game with patches, so for the price and all in all, this is a must buy.","January 31, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You take command of brigades from either the Army of the Potomac or Army of Northern Virginia in this mostly tactics base  combat game.\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was a chance meeting of two large armies in Pennsyvania and everything was up for grabs.  If the Confederates destroy the Army of the Potomac, the road is open to Washington and indpendance.  If the Union destroys or al least repulses the enemy here, they can secure Pennsylvania and take the war back to Virginia.\n\nYou are in command of brigades in this battle and you will face a lot of the challenges the leaders really did face.  Will you be conservative, taking and holding good ground that offers cover yet surrendering the initiative?  Or will you be daring by attacking and forcing the other side to match your moves, possibly making a mistake?\n\nYour brigades are affected by a number of things.  Their morale is based on real examples but is affected by whether a general is placed nearby, whether they are in the open, how many men have been killed, how many men  they  have killed, and how bad they are being pummelled by enemy artillery.\n\nThe gameplay is simplisitic with easy to use controls.  Simply clicking a unit and dragging where you want it to go is all you have to do.  To change alignment, simply click the middle mouse button and rotate.  There are other commands but those are the basics.\n\nThe graphics are simple yet detailed.  The map itself is simply beautiful, showing real locations of hills, ridges, farms, and roads.  The farms even have the names labeled and I have used that to research those buildings.  By hitting the M button you can bring up a topographical map that will help you place your infantry and artillery in the most advantageous positon.\n\nThe campiagn can be played as either side and the effects of one phase of the battle effects the next.  If you get your Iron Brigade slaughtered in the morning they will not be as affective later that day if they are needed.  You are also given options that are not historically accurate to change the way the battle of fought based on your decisions.  For example, do you want your Union forces to fall back midday on the 1st day to Cemetery Hill or do you want to hold Seminary ridge?\n\nThe sound is decent but I wouldnt say I ever marveled at how great it is.  The sounds of artillery and rifled musket fire are distinct, as well as the bugles and yelling when troops charge.  What I would like to hear is the rebel yell when the Confederates attack.  It was a shrill yelping/screaming sound that is said to give you a feeling of dread as you await attack.\n\nOverall, I love this game.  There is the campaign and invidual scenerios you can take part in, as well as multiplayer.  I haven't tried multiplayer so I cannot comment on it.  The game to me is very stable and I have had no issues running it at 60FPS at 1920x1080.  I also have never had a freeze or crash.  I saw crashes talked about but I think those are older versions.\n\n9/10 Buy this game!  Hopefully they will contemplate an Ultimate General:Shiloh, Chickamauga, Antietam, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Mobile, Petersburg, Chancellorsville, Second Manasses, Atlanta, or Charleston!","January 21, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every battle has reinforcements and these reinforcements usually have to move quite a bit to reach a conflict zone. This makes this game quite unique.\n\nHere, for example, a commander can ambush and stall such reinforements by infiltrating a small force behind the enemy lines. To do that, You can use a terrain features that break the line of sight of enemy. Forests, hills, riverbeds will provide such cover.\n\nI wish we could have a similar "battle simulator" for WW2 era battles.\n\nThe only downside of this game is that sometimes battle outcome is evaluated in a very strage way. I had once a whole union army encircled and broken, and it was only a matter of time for them to be completely annihilated - they had no place to retreat and regain strength and cohesion. But the game decided that battle is over and it is a "tie".\n\nAnyway - this is a Yes from me, and every strategist will enjoy this game.","January 24, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is quite difficult! This isn't a game that will hold your hand and give you an easy ride. It has some rough spots - the fact that you don't get any information on the relative strengths/weaknesses of your units is a problem. Hint: skirmishers are awful at melee combat. Once you get over that hump though, the battle itself is involving and challenging. You will endure heavy losses to your troops and strategy plays a big part - terrain, positioning, and timing of attacks as well as smart use of units all factor heavily in your chances of prevailing.\n\nA lot is made of the controls being simple - I don't have that much experience with the genre so my comments are specific to UG:G. I don't like that you need the CTRL key so much in order to position your units facing the correct direction. I think this could have been done better. The grouping of units is also not ideal - grouping them is easy but again the CTRL function of a grouped unit seems flawed with units often crossing paths to reach their positions.\n\nStill, definitely recommended.","January 3, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead of trying to match unit types against each other- sending cavalry against archers, axemen against spearmen, etc- the key to winning is to control the high ground and preserve units' morale and conditioning.\n\nThe two sides have different strengths. The Confederates have high morale, which means they can charge harder and stand longer before running. The Union has superior firepower, so they can butcher anything that stands in front of them for too long. Different overall strategies are required for each, with the Confederates trying to headbutt and flank their way through Union lines while the Union cuts them down and tries to repel them.\n\nI can't wait to see more from this developer.","January 14, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its literally one battle in what was a five year war  - once you have played it, you only have the option of playing the Confederate side..or going onto MUltiplayer..and as we know, MP is great whne a game is new...try going there a year later...the servers are generally empty.

You are limited to this one battle over a period of the few days the battle was fought.\nYou are given divisions, battalions, and arty to command.  The game gives you objectives for your army to take, capture points or value points are given for the objectives taken.  You have to pay attention to moral, movement, terrian, etc.\nI like that you can save your progress in case you want to re-think your stragety.  The game seems to replicate pretty  well how battles were fought and how soldiers might react.  So keep the officers close to boost moral.\nWhat I don't like is doing real well in capturing, (like Culp's Hill). and then the next game I have to do it again. It re-sets back to the historical settings of the battle fought that day.  Any one who's familiar w/ the history of the battle will know that if the confederates had taken a few key hills at Gettysburg, the Civil War and our history would be different.\nI finally won playing the confederates. The game, or campaign feels like it didn't take a very long time to play.

I will sum up my review (i wont go into too much depth on specific units, locations etc as my civil war jargons a bit rusty) in the one battle i played last night and it lasted simply one hour. Being the cockyish rts gamer experienced in many hardcore strategy games i picked a custom battle, chose devils den as the location and put the ai on the hardest most aggressive difficulty with the ai boost (whichever one was in the bottom right for difficulty selection).\n\nOn the first match which lasted all but 15 minutes the csa made me believe that i had won our first engagement, it was a tough 5min firefight and i was still learning the controls but the csa soon retreated. Feeling overconfident in my perceived strategic prowess i sent all my forces in to not only route but ahnillate the csa forces. To my horror i not only had sent my men into the main artillery brigade of the csa forces but was soon enveloped in what i would say was a near perfectambushing maneuveur that surrounded and then routed my forces. Mouth agape, and pride wounded, i went for round two. This time i used every trick i had.\n\nI formed a tight defensive perimeter focusing on holdingwhatever high ground or structured positions and keeping my flanks secured to the point where i was nestled in the upper right hand corner of the map. I slowly advanced with sharpshooters acting as scouts and marking where batteries and battalions etc were. as the first forces of the csa began to engage (quite effectively) with both musket and artillery, whilst my artillery was out of range, I quickly ended the skirmish and fell back to the upper left corner. As the confederates advanced toward the treeline and farm (again i dont remember the exact names) down from there position of the high ground they soon came under range of my artillery. The main bulk of the confederate forces began to sweep down to my right flank and using scattered forces harrassed my main line and left flank. Their artillery effectively pushed my main force back as far as i could allow. all the while I was cycling fresh troops in with those who had been fighting and taking heavy losses. The fight was at a dead heap with losses pilling on both sides.\n\nThe csa forces then recieved reinforcements and proceded to attack my left flank which was already slim as I had moved almost half of them to fortify the rigth flank. I sent two artillery batteries within close rang of these attacking forces and with the excelsior and iron brigades as the last defense for the left flank. The csa forces soon went in for an all out charge on the left flank whilst the right flank was still in a dead heap and the main line exchanging light musket fire, with the majority being harrassing from various artillery on both sides. Just in time the V corp (i believe) came in to reinforce the left flank which was now routed. My main line at this point was in danger of being flanked from behind, simultaneously the csa forces engaging my main line went in for an all out charge in an attempt to route my entire III, and II Corp (again i dont know which was which at this point). In a last ditch effort to buy time I put my previous danger close batteries set to canister shot to fire relentlessly at the charging confederates, the csa only mistake at this point was rerouting its troops that were still in a pitched fight with my right flank to join the main attack.\n\nI quickly but at great risk moved my fresh V corp to the right flank (i did have a plan). At this point my left flank was broken my main line was all but enveloped. If it were not for those two batteries that were preventing the confederates from maneuvering completely around im certain 75% of my forces woudve been wiped out or routed. Im hectically recycling routed troops with semi routed ones, units that had 1800 men were down to 600, the iron brigade had all but 200 men left. As i said earlier the csa main mistake was all but abandoning the right flank, with my fresh V corp and semi-battered reminince of the I believe IV corp I swept up in almost a semi circle taking heavy fire from csa batteries and routing the small remaining csa forces guarding the right flank. The bulk of my now IV and V corp swept up and I saw my chance. A chance which im sure the ai saw as well. My IV and V corp formerly the right flank swept up and semi enveloped the now mob consisting of my shattered left flank and near routed main line and the bulk of csa forces who it seems as the victory bar (bar in the upper right corner) were about 75% to my 25%.\n\nHowever since they maneuvered their right flank to try and brank my left flank, and theire main force was in hand to hand with mine, the only defense their rear had was a couple of batteries (not to be taken lightly) but not within range of canister shot. The ai attempted to secure its now completely open rear but its attempt at routing my left flank earlier in the battle had left their forces too battered and simply too far to defend itself in time. As i began to envelope them one by one they began to route, csa batllte flags began to flash white (except for the texas brigade they didnt give a sh!t that they were completely surrounded) and just as it had begun it was over. I was absolutely ecstatic at seeing that I had procured a hard fought major victory for the union I hadn't felt tht accomplished with a game in years. I lost roughly 10,000 men to their 9,000 losses, though i was outnumbered, in the end though I was not outmaneuvered. I had my ego realigned and reminded myself the reason I had so much confidence in my abilities was simply because of hard fought and as my first game showed me hard lost battles like these. So to end this long story I learned three things.\n\nOne this is not sid meiers civil war, it is something, different, it is more chaotic, and like chess you win or lose in the first moves of the match.\n\nTwo the Texas brigade has to be wiped out, dont think you can route them, dont waste your time trying to, trust me.\n\nThird if youve stuck around long enough to read this whole thing and if any of this sounds appealing, BUY IT. I know ive only played this game for an hour but ive played enough of these and i consider rts, and simulations to be my bread and butter for gaming and i can tell right away that it is worth the fifteen bucks.\n\nThank you Game-Labs I look forward to your future projects,\n\n5 out of 5","June 27, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's difficult to quantify, but the "feel" reminds me of great table top miniature games.  Which, personally, is a good thing. And it really gives you the impression of being in command of a large, multi-core army, with tens of thousands of troops.\n\nPROs\nSolid presentation and "look and feel" including subtle yet immersive sound effects.\nRight level of player input for this size of battle.  It's up to you to distribute your forces and decide when to attack, hold and withdraw, but the detail is up to your units.  This makes fighting even huge engagements with tens of thousands of soldiers per side manageable and fun.  Unlike when playing large TW battles, it doesn’t feel hectic or like you need to be pausing every 5 seconds.\nGreat intro to the Civil War. I was never particularly interested in this period, but the game inspired me to research Gettysburg, Civil War tactics, etc.\nMulti-scenario, dynamic campaign makes the battle feel alive, while maintaining a sense of what’s going on and why on the larger scale.\nCONs\nHigh level of abstraction may be a negative for players looking for details.\nHigh level of abstraction means that there’s not much to “do” in the game, other than move forces around.  There are no formations, special orders or other timing based commands.  Even artillery is typically better off just left on Auto (from my experiments)\nUI is very Spartan, which means it’s easy to miss certain details, like accidentally leaving your Brigades on “Run”, or not noticing that a unit is fighting with 0 condition.\nOne battle only.  It’s large, multiday and has lots of scenarios, but it’s still just one battle. I’m not sure how many times I’ll feel like replaying it.\nOverall, it’s a fine choice for anyone looking to play some great historicals.\n","June 28, 2015","true","36.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have a couple of suggestions, but who would listen to me anyway?  I like the concept of the game (It really reminds me of a Civil War History book I used to own that had these beautiful birds eye view renderings of the important battle fields, with scaled down units fighting at the different hotspots over the maps) and it plays fluidly.  THe scenarios seem to mesh very well into one another based on the outcome of the previous scenario, which is nice.  This game also brings to mind a classic: Sid Meyer's Gettysburg.  If anyone of you out there played and loved that game, you will like this.\nAs for the downsides (in my opinion) the game plays a -little- too fast and has a sort of...oh I dunno...Arena style feel to it.  This is probably what the creator intended and if that is the way he wanted to go with it, far be it from me to judge.  I say slow it down just a tad and you have a real winner.  Also, I would like to see more unit info, like which units are in the brigades, what losses the regiments are taking, and the state of their equipment.  Do not get me wrong, I kind of like playing at the Brigade level, but still, I'd like to -see- the suborniate units.  Anyway, a good game, a good work in progress.

It's simple yet focused and does everything it sets out to do. Who needs to zoom in and watch individual units fighting close combat when commanding? It's an unnecessary distraction if you ask me. The reason I love this game is large scale strategy, map control, and how my performance in one battle has an effect on the next. Ultimate General: Gettysburg immersed me as much, if not more, than any total war game.

Definitely worth purchasing.  Very challenging and realistic within each 6 hour time period, but Southern forces are moved back from taken objectives after each 6 hour time period change.  If you can live with that frustration, it is a great game.\n\nPROS\n\nVery accessible, intuitive controls, adequate graphics, realistic movement, tactics, morale, cover and elevation advantages.\n\nAI is fully adjustable from very cautious to risk taking.\n\nThe individual time period slices are great fun to replay to try different moves etc.\n\nI saw no glaring bugs or performance issues, it ran very smoothly and glitch free.\n\nIt is fun to play as the South and try for a different from history outcome.\n\nCONS\n\nThere is one glaring problem.  Southern units are moved back from taken objectives every time the 6 hour time portion changes.\n\n\nThe 3 day battle is chopped up into 6 hour portions.  During each portion you have complete freedom to implement your tactics and try various what if approaches to how the South Attacked.  This yields a great deal of re-playability.\n\nThe problem is that when the game changes to the next 6 hour period, it completely repositions the South's forces far back from the objectives they previously had achieved.  Hundreds of yards, not just a few feet.  Example:  By 6pm the first day my rebels were able to capture Culps hill.  When the time period runs out and jumps to the next one,  Souther forces are moved north about a mile and the Union again is in control of Culps Hill.\n\nThe only thing that remains constant between time slices is each sides casualties and troop count.  Heavy losses are carried over to the next time slice.\n\nIn a nutshell the South can kill more Northern units than historical, but it is very difficult to take objectives since the time slices forfeits them over and over.","May 22, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though the controls are easy. The 2 demensional map is fairly dynamic with available cover and topography bonuses/disadvantages. You are at the mercy of the moral of the troops, which adds a great deal to the accuracy of warfare. The graphics and sounds are fun. Once everyone starts shooting at eachother it is pretty fun to watch. But I havent had one satisfying ending to any battles...\n\nI'm on the fence whether or not to recommend it because of one thing. The battles are designed to take forever but it gives you a short time limit. I'm talking 15 minutes tops for a lot of battles. By the time each battle starts getting interesting the time ends, and I lose because I have fewer troops than the enemy, which is how the battle started anyway. The rate that casualties are inflicted is not accounted for in the time allowed. It is driving me crazy! Let me kill my enemy!\n\nI have not found a way to get rid of the time limit.

A single game covering the entire war would be amazing.\n\nAlso note that through the entire Early Access period this game received many improvements to both the base game and the AI.

I will sum up my review (i wont go into too much depth on specific units, locations etc as my civil war jargons a bit rusty) in the one battle i played last night and it lasted simply one hour. Being the cockyish rts gamer experienced in many hardcore strategy games i picked a custom battle, chose devils den as the location and put the ai on the hardest most aggressive difficulty with the ai boost (whichever one was in the bottom right for difficulty selection).\n\nOn the first match which lasted all but 15 minutes the csa made me believe that i had won our first engagement, it was a tough 5min firefight and i was still learning the controls but the csa soon retreated. Feeling overconfident in my perceived strategic prowess i sent all my forces in to not only route but ahnillate the csa forces. To my horror i not only had sent my men into the main artillery brigade of the csa forces but was soon enveloped in what i would say was a near perfectambushing maneuveur that surrounded and then routed my forces. Mouth agape, and pride wounded, i went for round two. This time i used every trick i had.\n\nI formed a tight defensive perimeter focusing on holdingwhatever high ground or structured positions and keeping my flanks secured to the point where i was nestled in the upper right hand corner of the map. I slowly advanced with sharpshooters acting as scouts and marking where batteries and battalions etc were. as the first forces of the csa began to engage (quite effectively) with both musket and artillery, whilst my artillery was out of range, I quickly ended the skirmish and fell back to the upper left corner. As the confederates advanced toward the treeline and farm (again i dont remember the exact names) down from there position of the high ground they soon came under range of my artillery. The main bulk of the confederate forces began to sweep down to my right flank and using scattered forces harrassed my main line and left flank. Their artillery effectively pushed my main force back as far as i could allow. all the while I was cycling fresh troops in with those who had been fighting and taking heavy losses. The fight was at a dead heap with losses pilling on both sides.\n\nThe csa forces then recieved reinforcements and proceded to attack my left flank which was already slim as I had moved almost half of them to fortify the rigth flank. I sent two artillery batteries within close rang of these attacking forces and with the excelsior and iron brigades as the last defense for the left flank. The csa forces soon went in for an all out charge on the left flank whilst the right flank was still in a dead heap and the main line exchanging light musket fire, with the majority being harrassing from various artillery on both sides. Just in time the V corp (i believe) came in to reinforce the left flank which was now routed. My main line at this point was in danger of being flanked from behind, simultaneously the csa forces engaging my main line went in for an all out charge in an attempt to route my entire III, and II Corp (again i dont know which was which at this point). In a last ditch effort to buy time I put my previous danger close batteries set to canister shot to fire relentlessly at the charging confederates, the csa only mistake at this point was rerouting its troops that were still in a pitched fight with my right flank to join the main attack.\n\nI quickly but at great risk moved my fresh V corp to the right flank (i did have a plan). At this point my left flank was broken my main line was all but enveloped. If it were not for those two batteries that were preventing the confederates from maneuvering completely around im certain 75% of my forces woudve been wiped out or routed. Im hectically recycling routed troops with semi routed ones, units that had 1800 men were down to 600, the iron brigade had all but 200 men left. As i said earlier the csa main mistake was all but abandoning the right flank, with my fresh V corp and semi-battered reminince of the I believe IV corp I swept up in almost a semi circle taking heavy fire from csa batteries and routing the small remaining csa forces guarding the right flank. The bulk of my now IV and V corp swept up and I saw my chance. A chance which im sure the ai saw as well. My IV and V corp formerly the right flank swept up and semi enveloped the now mob consisting of my shattered left flank and near routed main line and the bulk of csa forces who it seems as the victory bar (bar in the upper right corner) were about 75% to my 25%.\n\nHowever since they maneuvered their right flank to try and brank my left flank, and theire main force was in hand to hand with mine, the only defense their rear had was a couple of batteries (not to be taken lightly) but not within range of canister shot. The ai attempted to secure its now completely open rear but its attempt at routing my left flank earlier in the battle had left their forces too battered and simply too far to defend itself in time. As i began to envelope them one by one they began to route, csa batllte flags began to flash white (except for the texas brigade they didnt give a sh!t that they were completely surrounded) and just as it had begun it was over. I was absolutely ecstatic at seeing that I had procured a hard fought major victory for the union I hadn't felt tht accomplished with a game in years. I lost roughly 10,000 men to their 9,000 losses, though i was outnumbered, in the end though I was not outmaneuvered. I had my ego realigned and reminded myself the reason I had so much confidence in my abilities was simply because of hard fought and as my first game showed me hard lost battles like these. So to end this long story I learned three things.\n\nOne this is not sid meiers civil war, it is something, different, it is more chaotic, and like chess you win or lose in the first moves of the match.\n\nTwo the Texas brigade has to be wiped out, dont think you can route them, dont waste your time trying to, trust me.\n\nThird if youve stuck around long enough to read this whole thing and if any of this sounds appealing, BUY IT. I know ive only played this game for an hour but ive played enough of these and i consider rts, and simulations to be my bread and butter for gaming and i can tell right away that it is worth the fifteen bucks.\n\nThank you Game-Labs I look forward to your future projects,\n\n5 out of 5","June 27, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's difficult to quantify, but the "feel" reminds me of great table top miniature games.  Which, personally, is a good thing. And it really gives you the impression of being in command of a large, multi-core army, with tens of thousands of troops.\n\nPROs\nSolid presentation and "look and feel" including subtle yet immersive sound effects.\nRight level of player input for this size of battle.  It's up to you to distribute your forces and decide when to attack, hold and withdraw, but the detail is up to your units.  This makes fighting even huge engagements with tens of thousands of soldiers per side manageable and fun.  Unlike when playing large TW battles, it doesn’t feel hectic or like you need to be pausing every 5 seconds.\nGreat intro to the Civil War. I was never particularly interested in this period, but the game inspired me to research Gettysburg, Civil War tactics, etc.\nMulti-scenario, dynamic campaign makes the battle feel alive, while maintaining a sense of what’s going on and why on the larger scale.\nCONs\nHigh level of abstraction may be a negative for players looking for details.\nHigh level of abstraction means that there’s not much to “do” in the game, other than move forces around.  There are no formations, special orders or other timing based commands.  Even artillery is typically better off just left on Auto (from my experiments)\nUI is very Spartan, which means it’s easy to miss certain details, like accidentally leaving your Brigades on “Run”, or not noticing that a unit is fighting with 0 condition.\nOne battle only.  It’s large, multiday and has lots of scenarios, but it’s still just one battle. I’m not sure how many times I’ll feel like replaying it.\nOverall, it’s a fine choice for anyone looking to play some great historicals.\n","June 28, 2015","true","36.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have a couple of suggestions, but who would listen to me anyway?  I like the concept of the game (It really reminds me of a Civil War History book I used to own that had these beautiful birds eye view renderings of the important battle fields, with scaled down units fighting at the different hotspots over the maps) and it plays fluidly.  THe scenarios seem to mesh very well into one another based on the outcome of the previous scenario, which is nice.  This game also brings to mind a classic: Sid Meyer's Gettysburg.  If anyone of you out there played and loved that game, you will like this.\nAs for the downsides (in my opinion) the game plays a -little- too fast and has a sort of...oh I dunno...Arena style feel to it.  This is probably what the creator intended and if that is the way he wanted to go with it, far be it from me to judge.  I say slow it down just a tad and you have a real winner.  Also, I would like to see more unit info, like which units are in the brigades, what losses the regiments are taking, and the state of their equipment.  Do not get me wrong, I kind of like playing at the Brigade level, but still, I'd like to -see- the suborniate units.  Anyway, a good game, a good work in progress.

I won't get into the details of the graphics and such, which so many other reviews do so well, but I will say that if you are looking for a US Civil War game this is the one to get. I cannot wait to see what the developers do next, and add to this game, as it has so many possibilities for future time frames and aspects of the US Civil War. A single game covering the entire war would be amazing.\n\nAlso note that through the entire Early Access period this game received many improvements to both the base game and the AI. It was very nice to see a game do Early Access right, and respond to the users suggestions. The games full release to steam with no extra BS, just a good working game, is to be applauded.","October 19, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Uninformative UI, unexplained and unresponsive unit behaviour. Somewhat graphically lacking. Might give it another try later on..\n\nI know that reviews with as little time behind them as mine are somewhat unreasonable and are considered the bane of humankind and all that, but comparing the negative sides of this game to the positive ones, there is nothing that would keep me playing for more than this 1.5 hours, during which I finished two matches and took a glance at the other features.\n\nI expected the game to be similar to Cossacks 2, which might've had a part in why I was disappointed. After all, I spent hundreds of hours scouring through its singleplayer and expected something remotely similar. An intuitive historic real time strategy game.\n\nI played a few campaign matches, but the tutorial animations were tedious and left some presumably important things like troop morale and behaviour -especially for artillery and cavalry- unexplained. The UI has several icons whose meaning never opened to me. After those few matches where my troops didn't respond to my poorly inputted commands with strange input key choices I'm not motivated enough to invest the time needed to understand the mechanics that weren't explained to me in the tutorial. With my troops scattered and lands lost I leave this battlefield.","January 2","false","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The pacing of the game is great. Individual firefights can last a long time which I mean as a compliment compared to some other "wargames" where everyone rushes in and one side dies very quickly. There is plenty do (adjusting your men, trying to flank, bringing up reserrves etc) and I never felt the need for an accelerate time button. After each battle there is a brief summary of how then battle went and depending on the outcome you get to decide a broad strategy for the next battle which can vary the map and placement of units. I found the end of battle summary text a little disconnected from the battle that I thought I had fought but this is a small gripe. I suspect the replayability is not as high as I would like as it is based around one major battle. However, I am guessing there will be many mods or battle packs in the future.","August 20, 2014","true","228.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They have a LOT on their todo list, so I'm excited to see some of it added in.  There is a good bit missing that someone that plays strategy games would expect, but if you check out the known issue link, you'll see they are aware of it and plan to add to the functionality.  That being said, the game plays great for me and has a solid base for them to continue developing on.\n\nThe only thing that worries me is their projected timeframe.  I've only seen one or two games do as much as they say they have to in that kind of time frame.

Flanking plays a big part in this game, both in trying to flank the ememy while being very aware of being flanked yourself.\n\nThis game also forces you to consider issues of concentration of force- you want to exert enough force at a point to make a difference, but not so much where the high density of troops causes more casualties because of cannon fire.\n\nLast, this game really forces you to consider the placement and use of your troops. Do you move more troops to point A to try to gain a strategic point? And if so, where do you pull them from? If you pull them from point B, you may become very vunerable to an unforseen attack in that area. If you use your reserve troops from another area  in the attack, you won't have any fresh troops to stem the ememy attack in another area later in the game.\n\nTo sum it up, this game presents the gamer with a lot of strategic issues that you have to resolve. Do well, and you live to see another day. Otherwise....\n\n","August 9, 2014","true","183.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It needs improvements.\n\nThe graphics are good and the sound is ok...though I do wonder about the "jungle drums" that randomly play in the background.  The AI can pull off good maneuvers, but it can also fail miserably.\n\nThe mechanics are overly simple to the point that they can cause problems.\n\nExamples:\n\nMorale...your grizzled veterans (blue or gray) often have morale swings similar to American teenage girls having mood swings while watching Twilight.  Your men can stand in the open with no cover and have so much enthusiasm that it puts cheerleaders to shame.  You can also put them in a very good position and find that they are so depressed that they might need a psychiatrist and a smiley face balloon.\n\nThe combat capability of a unit is dependent on whether its commander has a PhD in Motivational Speaking (inspiring) or if he is lactose intolerant and boring.  If he is the latter and isn't worth his milk, your soldiers will forget how to load their weapons and will shoot very slowly, even if they are veterans who have fought in 10+ battles.\n\nArtillery can shoot straight through some of the hills.  Its effects are very random.  The enemy once fired about 8 cannons, in total, at one of my brigades a half mile away (directly to the front of the cannons).  My unit lost 350 out of 800 men.  I don't remember anyone having laser-guided bombs in the 1800s.\n\nI am convinced that my soldiers are actually Canadians because they are so polite; if you move one of your brigades too close to another brigade, one group of chaps will politely step out of the way.  The problem is that when they do so, they can go straight at the enemy and get shot to pieces.\n\nInfantry will only fire volleys.  The developers took the time to allow cannons to fire different types of ammunition, but they were somehow unable to give you the option to tell your infantry to either fire a volley or fire at will.  Firing a volley at the beginning of combat is good, but most of the time you would want your men to load and fire as fast as they can afterwards.\n\nVictory...capturing certain pieces of ground is the primary objective.  Your men could be completely surrounded on a hill and cut off from supplies, but it matters not.  I once had the highest level of victory at the highest difficulty setting because I used my entire army as cannon fodder to take objectives.  The game didn't care that I had almost completely destroyed the ability of my Confederate army to defend a single tree from a handful of rabid squirrels.\n\nHistorically speaking, the developers seem to have left out a number of Union units that were in the battle, so they end up being short thousands of men (I am especially looking at your troops, Generals Meredith & Cutler).  If it was a dozen here and there, that's a margin of error and is perfectly fine; when it's thousands, it's Abraham Lincoln's carriage sitting on concrete blocks without wheels in front of the White House.\n\nI used to do volunteer work at the battlefield with park rangers, so I know more about the battle than many.  I do not expect the developers to read a dozen books on the battle, though a couple short emails to the National Park Service at Gettysburg to verify information and proof-read would have been helpful.","December 26, 2015","false","36.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It responds dynamically and will punish you for making mistakes or leaving a unit exposed. Effective use of artillery and skirmishers. I was initially highly discouraged from aggressive, risky action with flanking maneuvers due to this.\n\n- Entertaining campaign. The battle campaign is quite long, and there is tremendous replay value due to the effects of your battles having permanent effects (controlled terrain, casualties, etc.) carrying over to each mission, and so the missions can become quite ahistorical depending on what you have accomplished.\n\n- A pleasant art style, good sound effects, satisfying immersion. The battalions move convincingly, with smoke and rifle crack.\n\n- Morale is modelled well, as is training and experience levels of units.\n\nOverall,  a very entertaining game with which you can kill 10-20 hours easily.

Thank God for Indie Devs.  The graphics are fairly simple but don't let this put you off as the AI is what you need in a strategy title.  This game delivers with a variety of different difficulty settings and a genuine foe that is always throwin a spanner into the works of your overall master plan by attacking your rear with cavalry and out flanking you or rushing exposed guns.  With a fairly simple control system it allows you to scroll ur way around the map and direct units into the required positions.

For exa; building fortifications, digging in, nothing like that is in this game whatsoever.  Fortifying was made an option in the mobile version, yet was left completely out for the original.\n\nMany can say "UGG has great AI" or "UGG has fair AI" however both of these are wrong to an extent.  The AI will always get a boost in casualty rate, no matter your choice for playing as the Confederates or the Union.  Selecting a more difficult AI type only results in more casualties for you, despite this AI using the same strategy/tactics as the AI below it.  The AI as a whole is capable of effectively attacking or defending, making it smart, yet higher leveled AI only seems to rely on higher casualty rates, nothing else.\n\nBugs are terrible in UGG, from artillery disobeying your orders and switching to a different target despite it being in range of the target you wanted it to hit, or infantry not firing, etc.  These are common and should be fixed, they probably won't unfortunately.\n\nThe game does a great job in accurately depicting brigades, generals, positions, how the units look, etc.\n\nOverall this an above average game, and I would recommend it if you can get past some of its faults and know anything about the history of the Civil War, or Gettysburg, but for the average person, I do not recommend this game.\n\n","May 24","false","72.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Also, rivers and other terrain impact the game to little with cannons able to set up in the river and cross rivers without using bridges and so on..

The game is a lot of fun, blending historic names and locations with alternate courses of events that keep games fresh and exciting. While it might not be concerned enough with its historic accuracy to please those most interested in a history lesson, it’s a game that should be on the radar of anyone with a passing interest in the RTS genre.\n\nUltimate General: Gettysburg handles the flow of its campaign extremely well. Obviously Gettysburg, being a real battle in a real war, had a distinct outcome- the Union defeated the Confederacy on the third day. It’d be pretty boring if players were tied to the ebb and flow of the real battle, but the game instead plays like a choose your own adventure novel. The first battle always starts out the same (except for your choice of playing as the North or South), then after that, depending on how the battle goes, you’re given a few choices on what you want to do next based on how much damage and land each side took in the previous confrontation. You can decide to make your next objective taking over a location to earn Victory Points (basically just number for how strategically valuable different locales are to the overall battle), to protect a certain front, etc. Additionally, unit losses carry over from one campaign battle to the next, meaning that even if you’re dominating there’s still reason to be careful. Thinning out your larger brigade at the end just to finish a little quicker may seem like a good idea, but it’s going to come back to bite you in the next round when the opponents get lots of reinforcements and you’re suddenly overpowered. These combined to make each of the three campaign playthroughs I tried vastly different, which was great.\n\nUnlike some strategy games, most forms of resource management aren’t something you’ll have to worry about in Ultimate General: Gettysburg. You won’t have to try to be a careful spender, keep track of research trees or raise combatants’ stat points, etc. You don’t even have to worry about what units to produce. In fact, the entire management side is really quite simple. There are only two things you need to keep track of among your soldier groups: morale and condition. Morale is what you’d expect- the willingness to fight.\n\nUltimate General: Gettysburg does a great job of being simple enough for anyone to learn in a short sitting, but deep enough to keep you learning and perfecting your tactics deep into subsequent playthroughs.","February 22","true","9.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Its simple, engaging and fun.\n\nMY ONLY COMPLAINT:\nLine of Sight or "LoS" is a huge part of this game. If your units have no line of sight, they won't fire on an enemy even if they are in range. The higher your ground, the better your LoS, so this game is all about capturing the high ground and ridges. Unfortunately, it's not intuitive as to which areas will give you good LoS. I'll fight for the highest ground on the map for half an hour, move my cannons to the top (they are epically slow), ready to blow up evrything in sight and once they get there, for some reason have worse LoS then when they were in their original position. So that can become annoying. I do wish there was a way of "scouting" out a position before sending your entire army up a hill and realizing it has no LoS advantage whatsoever. I can't tell if this system is slightly broken or if it's just mastery of incredibly minute movements that get you good LoS once on top of a hill.\n\noverall fun game, worth every penny.","October 26, 2014","true","8.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Otherwise, stay away... it has some aggravating issues.\nThe propaganda says "no more babysitting your units", untrue.  I found that I absolutely have to micromanage because the AI does such a poor job of handling my units.  Some examples:\n\nI've found units with their backs to the enemy (and not facing another enemy unit, nor had I previously issued any facing instructions to this unit).  One time, I watched one of these units to see how long it would remain facing away; it did so until it routed.\n\nSometimes units will go into what I call "Night Rider" mode where they constantly change their facing, thus never actually firing on any nearby enemies.\n\nI have ordered artillary to fire on units which are in range and in LOS, only to have the artillary advance toward the enemy unit, rather than firing from its current position.\n\nI have found artillary firing at distant skirmishers in cover, rather than a nice juicy unit in line formation begging for a dose of cannister.\n\nBottom line, if you can get it cheap, do it.

I find Ultimate General: Gettysburg to be historically accurate concerning the units involved and their positions on the Gettysburg battlefield.  I find this game quite enjoyable and easy to learn, while at the same time offering a challenge.\n\nThe mechanics of Ultimate General: Gettysburg make for a fun and easy-to-learn/hard-to-master game.  The difficulty selection allows for a player to choose between a variety of AI opponent playstyles, from Cautious Defender to Ambitious Attacker.  The user interface is easy to learn and frees the player to focus on strategic concerns.  The AI are smart and will take advantage of weaknesses in player strategy.  Artistically, UG:G gives the player the feeling that they are the supreme commander of their army looking at their battlemap.\n\nThis game is definitely not for everyone.  Persons who are not interested in strategy will not enjoy this game.  Persons who are more interested in graphics and visual entertainment will not enjoy this game.  Strategy gamers interested more in realistic tactics than graphics will enjoy this game.\n\nIn conclusion, I give this game a rating of 8 out of 10.

I saw it while surfing on steam and i bought it a few gameplay videos later.\nWhat a beauty, not just because of its look also and especially because of its simplicity. There are not fifty buttons to push, not a complicate camera to handle with, you just have to concentrate on the battle. I miss that consequense in many big strategy titles nowadays. Reading the terrain, placing your troops in a good tactical position and then striking the enemy are the most important things in Ultimate General. And with that innovative steering feature it works so well.\nNot to mention what a great AI this game has. Normally, i suck at online multiplayer, but here i have done two matches, lost the first one very tight and won my second match against much more expierencend players (four and five stars). So the game rewards you for a good tactical performance and the brilliant AI trains you very well in it.\nSure, there could be a better tutorial for beginners and more multiplayer maps. It is also obvious, that the placement of troops on hills look a little curious sometimes. But i think, the team will fix this in the next time.\nOverall a great title and for me one of the best games this year. Thanks to Nick Thomadis and his team for such a great gaming experience. Can't wait to see more things to come for Ultimate General!","October 31, 2014","true","156.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Especially since they are saying it's just 70% done.\n\nLove:\n1. I love the clear unit control. Really well done here. I feel like I have all the control I could possibly need. I really didn't feel like a needed grouping and group formations with all that I was given.\n2. The condition + moral meters. This is huge. A unit may have high moral, but if their condition is low and they are worn out they're going to get it in the face pretty quick. I really enjoyed that mechanic and balancing the reseverse with the main attack. I'm impressed.\n3. The scenarios are well paced to me. Really interesting with one scenario taking up from the next. It never really feels overwhelming. And sure you may lose ground on day one, but you've made them pay in blood which will be felt later in the scenarios. Love it.\n\nImprovements:\n1. Need a quick movement and fire tutorial. Possibly in the form of a little drilling minigame. Went several scenarios without realizing I could rotate troops without using the movement arrow. (admittedly I probably should have looked on the forum which I did later, but still, it would be a nice improvement)\n2. Minimap. I've had small holding actions on one front turn into something bigger by accident as the AI decides to press the advantage while my attentenion is diverted. Meaning that that unit soon gets surrounded and shredded. Then again I guess that did happen back then so yeah, but it would be nice to have a full picture at a quick glance.\n\nHate:\n1. Artillery sight lines. I had a lot of trouble trying to position my artillery with proper sight lines. I routinely moved them to places that I thought should be perfect and I ended up not being able to see the front at a crucial time.\n2. Artillery targeting. I felt like I couldn't really command artillery to focus fire properly either. I wanted to weaken up a flank or keep some troops pinned down, but I never felt fully in control of the artillery fire.\n\nOther than that I'm really shocked how good this game is so far. Well done. $10 well spent in my opinion.","June 17, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I find Ultimate General: Gettysburg to be historically accurate concerning the units involved and their positions on the Gettysburg battlefield.  I find this game quite enjoyable and easy to learn, while at the same time offering a challenge.\n\nThe mechanics of Ultimate General: Gettysburg make for a fun and easy-to-learn/hard-to-master game.  The difficulty selection allows for a player to choose between a variety of AI opponent playstyles, from Cautious Defender to Ambitious Attacker.  The user interface is easy to learn and frees the player to focus on strategic concerns.  The AI are smart and will take advantage of weaknesses in player strategy.  Artistically, UG:G gives the player the feeling that they are the supreme commander of their army looking at their battlemap.\n\nThis game is definitely not for everyone.  Persons who are not interested in strategy will not enjoy this game.  Persons who are more interested in graphics and visual entertainment will not enjoy this game.  Strategy gamers interested more in realistic tactics than graphics will enjoy this game.\n\nIn conclusion, I give this game a rating of 8 out of 10.  My reason for dropping 2 points is that I would like to see more battles than just Gettysburg.

I've had small holding actions on one front turn into something bigger by accident as the AI decides to press the advantage while my attentenion is diverted. Meaning that that unit soon gets surrounded and shredded. Then again I guess that did happen back then so yeah, but it would be nice to have a full picture at a quick glance.\n\nHate:\n1. Artillery sight lines. I had a lot of trouble trying to position my artillery with proper sight lines. I routinely moved them to places that I thought should be perfect and I ended up not being able to see the front at a crucial time.\n2. Artillery targeting. I felt like I couldn't really command artillery to focus fire properly either. I wanted to weaken up a flank or keep some troops pinned down, but I never felt fully in control of the artillery fire.\n\nOther than that I'm really shocked how good this game is so far. Well done. $10 well spent in my opinion.","June 17, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The developers have certainly revolutionised some key elements of strategic games, most importantly the way you can command and position your units to make use of strategic advantages provided by terrain (cover, elevation, line of sight, ...). Other aspects such as unit condition and unit morale, which have also been implemented, play a key role in planning your moves as well. If you order a brigade to stay in combat for too long, its condition will slowly diminish, giving you a severe disadvantage in prolonged engagements. If morale gets too low, your units will be easily routed through cavalry attacks and bayonet charges, causing them to retreat in disarray, disobeying your commands. So you need to really take care of your units as you go, especially since they will reappear in later stages of the battle.\nAs you go and make your decisions, lose or win single engagements, the Battle of Gettysburg will always take different courses. So even though the battle itself lasts a maximum of five days in the game, the gaming experience will never be entirely the same.\nThe AI of your opponent is pretty good. You can select different types of AI commanders when you start the battle based on difficulty and aggressiveness. A defensive computer player will try to position itself on the high ground, pounding your positions with artillery barrages until the arrival of fresh reinforcements encourages him to attack your weakened positions. An aggressive opponent, on the other hand, will try to spot weaknesses in your formation, attacking these positions vigorously and without fear.\n\nAll in all, this is a must for any person who loves strategy games, in particular those who are interested in the American Civil War.\n\nChaaaarge!","April 25, 2015","true","201.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I find Ultimate General: Gettysburg to be historically accurate concerning the units involved and their positions on the Gettysburg battlefield.  I find this game quite enjoyable and easy to learn, while at the same time offering a challenge.\n\nThe mechanics of Ultimate General: Gettysburg make for a fun and easy-to-learn/hard-to-master game.  The difficulty selection allows for a player to choose between a variety of AI opponent playstyles, from Cautious Defender to Ambitious Attacker.  The user interface is easy to learn and frees the player to focus on strategic concerns.  The AI are smart and will take advantage of weaknesses in player strategy.  Artistically, UG:G gives the player the feeling that they are the supreme commander of their army looking at their battlemap.\n\nThis game is definitely not for everyone.  Persons who are not interested in strategy will not enjoy this game.  Persons who are more interested in graphics and visual entertainment will not enjoy this game.  Strategy gamers interested more in realistic tactics than graphics will enjoy this game.\n\nIn conclusion, I give this game a rating of 8 out of 10.  My reason for dropping 2 points is that I would like to see more battles than just Gettysburg.  Perhaps in future updates the developers could add more historic battles.","June 20, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Looking at it at first glance it seems overly simple but honestly there is a lot to consider when playing.  The beauty to me is that the UI is so clean and out of the way.  It is so refreshing to have a strategy game that allows me to direct my troops without having to drill thru a thousand and one levels to do so or pull me out of the game with and overly complex UI.   I very much hope to see other battles covered both from this and other wars.  As much of a Paradox fan as I am and enjoy grand strategies, sometimes it is refreshing to have a strategy game like Ultimate General: Gettysburg where you can just sit back and plan the battles and not have to overly worry about the logistics.

The developers have certainly revolutionised some key elements of strategic games, most importantly the way you can command and position your units to make use of strategic advantages provided by terrain (cover, elevation, line of sight, ...). Other aspects such as unit condition and unit morale, which have also been implemented, play a key role in planning your moves as well. If you order a brigade to stay in combat for too long, its condition will slowly diminish, giving you a severe disadvantage in prolonged engagements. If morale gets too low, your units will be easily routed through cavalry attacks and bayonet charges, causing them to retreat in disarray, disobeying your commands. So you need to really take care of your units as you go, especially since they will reappear in later stages of the battle.\nAs you go and make your decisions, lose or win single engagements, the Battle of Gettysburg will always take different courses. So even though the battle itself lasts a maximum of five days in the game, the gaming experience will never be entirely the same.\nThe AI of your opponent is pretty good. You can select different types of AI commanders when you start the battle based on difficulty and aggressiveness. A defensive computer player will try to position itself on the high ground, pounding your positions with artillery barrages until the arrival of fresh reinforcements encourages him to attack your weakened positions. An aggressive opponent, on the other hand, will try to spot weaknesses in your formation, attacking these positions vigorously and without fear.\n\nAll in all, this is a must for any person who loves strategy games, in particular those who are interested in the American Civil War.\n\nChaaaarge!","April 25, 2015","true","201.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The problems are difficult to describe as well, because they are not consistent.  Everything seems to be fine, and then it all stops making sense.\n\nFor somebody considering making a purchase, I would make these general warnings:\n\n1.  Units are not placed properly.  In the vast majority of the battles where the campaign manager places the units, you will commonly find brigades belonging to the same division and even corps. spread far apart.  This has implications for effectively using your units to work together.  If you do take the time to identify the various units and give them movement orders to get together, they will spend that time under fire and be all shot to hell by the time they finally get in proper formation.  If you just accept the placement and adjust the lines, they will suffer badly from morale penalties.\n\n2.  Artillery simply does not follow orders.  Don't even try.\n\n3.  The strength of units is wildly inconsistent.  Brigades are commanded by generals with a start system where more stars means a generally tougher unit.  The problem is the wide disparity between the reliability of the one-star brigades, which most of the Union brigades are.  (Most of the CSA brigades are much much stronger.)  I've seen two one-star brigades do just fine defending in cover with their corps. commander nearby.  I have also seen the entire Union III corps. run from cover when taking fire from two (2!) CSA brigades.  They fire one volley and run.  In cover, tightly linked, with corps commander nearby.  There isn't much more you can do to "encourage" them.  When 4500 guys run from 1500, I really do have to call fail.\n\nIN general, it's just realy mystifying on how to properly command Union troops effectively.  (I haven't tried CSA.)  Just when you think you have it figured out, they find some mysterious reason to break, run or just plain start walking around.\n\nWhat makes this even more frustrating is that it isn't like this all the time.  Most of the time, things are fine, but when they stop working, they really stop working.  And you don't know why.  Whatever mystery is embedded in the AI that makes your troops fickle isn't documented, either.\n\nThe game was designed by a well-known TW modder.  I think we can safely say there is a big difference between modding a working game and designing a working game.\n\nI tried.  But this game just doesn't make any damn sense.","April 13","false","103.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Too many problems: you can´t manage formations, you don´t know differences between the unities, you don´t really know how and where the troops are moving and finally the unity selection system that is really awfull.\nThe word that best describes all is UNFAIR, your troops fall back really fast and against less number of troops, I know the troops behaviour depends on so many stats but it is not true, more than a time with more moral, cover and condition falling back seems to be the best for them. This fact makes you exit from the experience and then the game becomes unplayable.\nMy recommendation is that if you wanna play a well executed strategy game based on that period give a chance to any of the two Total War saga, Napopleon or Empire, those are better than this one.","March 5","false","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Seeing the reviews (which I now know are just a giant ♥♥♥♥ apple circlejerk) I was excited for this game as total war like strategy games from indie developers are few and far between. Then I actually played the game. God where to begin with the problems with this game. The mechanics are horribly flawed, the ui is garbage, and the controls are annoying.\nSummary of the main ♥♥♥♥ wrong with this broken game\nI didnt even know you could use control and right mouse button to move your units instead of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ inaccurate drag technique for like 10 hours into the game. Its not in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial they provide.\nunit movement is annoying as most of the time they will refuse to stay in formation and have to form back up because the front of the formation has to turn around and come back to the rest of the trooops\nthe ui is 2005 level basic. No effort whatsoever was put into it and if there was any, it was in vain.\nthe game gives a 2-3 sentence explanation of your armies and strengths and weaknesses. Thats it. No unit explanations, not that there are hardly any units anyway, but you'll have to find out their capabilities on the battlefield for yourself as the game provides no information at all.\nmechanics aren't explained at all. Many times your artillery won't be firing due to one reason or another and you'll have no clue as to why they are just sitting there with their thumbs up their asses. Nothing is explained to the player and any information you want is going to have to be found online.\nMelee combat in this game makes absolute no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. In the first mission, if you play as the confederates, and at the beginnign you have a huge advantage in numbers and supposedly your troops are better at melee. Surefire win right? wrong. As you charge the union skirmishers, they run away slowly. losing only about a one man per second in melee "combat". The enemy skirmishers will lose a third of their unit but not really care as they just keep slowly jogging off the battlefield. Eventually, your troops will become exhausted and have to stop, and it is then when the skirmishers will turn around and fire on you like nothing has happened, causing your units to flee.\n\nThis game could've been a very good, creative game but unfortunately it lacks the polish that is necessary for a good game. Instead, this game falls pretty flat and is easily forgettable as a mediore, lackluster title. If you're really interested maybe get it on sale for >$2.50 but other than that I wouldn't pick this one up.\n","August 2, 2015","false","13.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

I really, really did.\n\nAs once-upon-a-time veteran of the ages old Firaxis game, Gettysburg!, the predecessor that this game OH SO CLEARLY rips off, and seeing the good reviews for this one, I snapped it up as soon as I learned it existed.\n\nMistake. See last two paragraphs for TL;DR\n\nThe AI is good...I guess. But the controls and responses of individual units are clunky as hell and uninspired. Cripplingly so, in fact. I can barely even make it past the first battle without something random happening to my units that isn't my fault. I'm not talking about morale breaking (get to that pile of bullcrap in a second), I'm talking about painstakingly arranging my lines to have them deform and shift for no apparent reason, and in this game, that kind of nonsense loses battles.\n\nExample 1: Skirmishers and the Vidette's on the Union side act like garbage. You'd think mounted ranged cavalry and light foot marksmen would know how to chase down a marching enemy and shoot them on the move. Apparently not. Told three groups of skirmishers and two groups of videttes to engage a regiment marching for Oak Hill.\n\nNot one of them fired a single shot. They all just faffed about, well within firing range, jitterbugging around. Morale fine, reload fine, LOS fine, I paused and I checked to confirm. This is not the first time this has happened.\n\nIn fact, the unit handling seems to generally just be ♥♥♥♥. And that's putting it kindly. Where the AI brigades will turn and wheel snapily, my brigades sluggishly pivot, not firing, as the AI jukes, maneuvers, and out flanks me with ease because their soldiers aren't acting like sea-slugs with chronic narcolepsy.\n\nExample 2: Not firing at greybacks marching up your ♥♥♥ seems to be favorite thing of Union soldiers. They will often refuse to automatically engage enemy brigades coming into range. Posted on highground, in cover, I was micromanaging some other group and saw three whole brigades in line on one of the ridges just standing there, jaws slack, as Confederates shot them off by the score. Also multiple incidents that caused immediate, critical defeats.\n\nExample 3: Upon arriving at their destination, brigades will often change their positioning for no reason at all, resulting in horribly skewed firing lanes that, in turn, result in crap along the lines of Example 2. It's not a morale issue, it's like they say, "well. Now that we're here, let's face that river for no reason instead of facing the massive army of rebels coming right at us!" Multiple incidents.\n\nIt also seems like there is a terrible imbalance to the Confederates. I'm not talking about historically accurate numbers and the order of battle, I'm talking about the fact that 1 much larger regiment of 3 star (max efficiency) line infantry on the Union side are supposed to be way better than the rebels in sustained ranged combat.\n\nIf that's true, then why did they lose to a regiment a third of their size that was standing in an open field down hill? My soldiers had 60% cover behind a stone wall, 100% morale, and 80% condition with their general just behind them. 15 seconds later, they're barrelling off down the opposite side of the hill, totally routed.\n\nReally?\n\nMeanwhile, Confederate AI gets practically unbreakable morale short of a double flank sticking minie balls and/or bayonets in their ears and  up their asses.\n\nExample 4: Sudden unit slaughter and charges. Lost a group of 90/130 cavalry for no reason. Number of men alive dropped extremely rapidly as they were chasing a single, routing enemy with no one firing at them. When I say rapidly, think immediate death of 90 cav in a single second with no source. As for the charges, units seem to be impetuous with no clear reason??? I keep having soldiers cease fire to just...march to the enemy. Not a charge. They just stop what they're doing and start marching to them instead of them attacking. No movement arrow. It's like they've run out of ammo but are noncommitally trying to decide to fix bayonets like men or maybe just commit assisted suicide.\n\nThe latter is the only result I've ever seen thus far.\n\nExample 5: Finally, on the subject of "the AI not cheating," I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Switched sides, charged 2000 Conf. into a single brigade of 750 skirmishers to test morale mechanics.\n\nConfederates broke morale FROM MAXIMUM and ran, their morale deserting them faster than Kim Kardashian did Kris Humphries.\n\nWHAT?\n\nAs Union, the exact same Conf regiment charged and killed all three of the Union skirmish groups as they were all firing down into them. They crossed a river, a forest, and ran uphill.\n\n/end bug examples (adding more every time I try and play this garbage in order to find some redeeming factor)\n\nTime to talk about the stuff that is mechanically functional, but still doesn't actually work.\n\nThe game has no idea what elevation is when it comes to units and knows nothing about stacking. Units behind one another can still fire on a target, regardless of elevation and whether or not friendly fire would occur.\n\nIn regards to the stacking, as far as I've been able to tell, feel free to clump all your units in one giant glob of flesh and musket. From what little testing I've done of this aspect (can hardly get past all the nonsense), doing so will only result in damage of individual target units. For example, AI clumps together three brigades. Canister shot? No problem! Damage only done to one unit in the clump! The one I'm targeting! Have fun micro-managing your cannons, thus adding to this game's 0/10 ridiculousness. Cover planning is also a joke. Historically, all sorts of cover was utilized during the battle, yet it seems as if very little save forests actually matter. It's also impossible to tell what kind of terrain offers any sort of arbitrary cover. From fences to stone walls to rock outcroppings, the Union utilized their strong defensive positioning at every turn. It's impossible to effectively do that here.\n\nWould write more, but I think I've spent more time hating this absolute kick in my nostalgia-balls than I have actually slogging through it.\n\nTL;DR Controls and unit responses are game ruiningly clunky; poor balancing in terms of faction perks; unspeakably glitchy in bizarre, unsettling ways; absurdly unintuitive compared to nearly isometric line warfare games that already exist. It's like Goat Simulator: 1863 except the bugs aren't SUPPOSED to be there.\n\nI genuinely cannot comprehend what anyone sees in this carnival freak show of a game; will not buy any of their future abortions.","November 27, 2015","false","3.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","5"

The only game in my collection that was bought at retail. This game is awesome, whenever i read a new book on the civil war i always study those diagrams of movements and tactics. This game is laid out exactly like those pictures, except you control it! The gameplay feels smooth, and can cause you to exceute some pretty advanced offensive strategies by accident just because it feels natural(pincers, flanking, oblique attacks). The graphics are good and so is the art style. I wish there were more maps, but that might be stupid of me since the game has Gettysburg in the title. I hear people say its 10 bucks for one level, well, one battle that can be played 8 million ways so its up to you if you like that. $10 is a lot for me to spend on a game, but since it is an indie dev i was more than happy too.

A great game!\n\nThis is basically Sid Meier's Gettysburg! updated in to modern day. Wonderful tactical simulator with great, informative graphics, easy to use interface and great AI.\n\nThe campaign is a bit odd, as it doesn't take in to account your positions/success in previous battle as well as I would have hoped it to. Doesn't really matter much if you can get past the fact that you sometimes lose terrain you fought hardly for.\n\nWhile AI is great in this game, the morale etc. doesn't seem to work all that logically. I have had few occations with my units standing next to each other, having taken similar casualties etc. with the other being near 0% morale while the other constantly staying at 100%. But apart from that, the AI - depending on how you set it - can be damn devious and cunning giving a great challenge.\n\nWhat I would mostly hope for is clearer line of sight and enhanced visuals for height of the map. Even when contour lines are on, it can be difficult to judge if your men can see the enemy in their front or not. This also causes problems with the artillery, sometimes you think you've got excellent positions but they don't actually see much. I would also love to modulate the speed a little, right now the game feels a bit too fast and hectic for me sometimes, as I would like to see my tactics play out a bit slower, allowing me to micro manage more.\n\nIn the end, it's a great game well worth the money, well executed, beautiful graphics and fun to play. I highly recommend this, if you are looking for an ACW game like Sid Meier's Gettysburg!, but in modern day graphics. This doesn't compete with games like Scourge of war in the same category, so owning both of them is alright!","November 8, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I will say I recommend it and its absolutely something to look at. My frustration with Total War games has always been the absolute poor lack of scale of the size of battles fought. I mean major Napoleonic battles with armies of 5k on each. side is laughable. I guess they wanted to show off the blood of the fighting man on the ground or to zoom and see each and every dude you put down but it means that they sacrificed the actual use of tactics of that age. Napoleon you didn't just hold one hill with your entire army and wait for the enemy to meander his way up you held that hill, the ravine between, the next hill over till you hit river or something defendable enough to anchor your line, and this game gets it. You don't want to just stretch your line as far as possible to get that flanking bonus like in TW you actually want a reserve. Also the entire battle doesn't play out in a day. You get to watch in your first engagement with Hill turns from a skirmish of a couple thousand men to the almost claustrophobic panic of engagements of 20k on each side contantsly jostle and throwing themselves and testing than falling back. Also the movement system is a really good idea. Instead of just pressing on the terrain where you want your units to go you glide you plot their movement with a swipe of your mouse its quick and effective.\n\nEDIT:\nAlot of the bad stuff in my orginal review has been corrected with the positive stuff staying intact. So I'll say what's still wrong with the game at this point. The map while being very carefully and lovingly designed is still a pain and worse I fear that they have no intention of making it a 3d map. While the artillary and it's strange line of sight issues has been fixed the 2d map makes it impossible to perfectly realize the idea they had with line of sight and artillary and such. Judging if one hill is taller than the next hill over is harder than it should be. The town of Gettysburg itself as well suffers from this since it isn't as much of a obstacle as it should be in the heat of a battle, beyond again Line of sight issues. Units that are sent though the town should have to either break up their lines and become ineffective or avoid going through the town entirely, instead they simply glide through as if there are no buildings in the way and even get a significant cover. I still don't know and don't think that walls or the railroad ditch (which should function as a trench) adds to your cover and if it infact doesn't than it REALLY should.\n\nI've been noticing some people are complaining about the lack of complexity to the game and I honestly don't think  that should be a issue. Complexity and Depth are not the same thing after all and this game is truly deep. The first engagement I've played many times from both sides and its never the same engagement twice. As the Union i've held my line before and even took the objectives of the confederates while other times I've almost been dislodged from my primary objective and taken more of a whipping on the defensive than I dished out. This isn't to say its because theres a random unfair factor, its simply because same approaches have different results against different AI opponents. Archers 1200 man brigades internal numbers don't change just how the AI uses him. I in turn have to change my tactics because of this. I will have to pause the game consider that if I weaken my quiet but already battered left flank to support the center turning to the enemys saliant on my right can I break through it before my battered but quiet left gets routed which in turn makes my center turned in the opposite direction open to 2 or more entire volleys being shot in their rear and opens my artillary up as well which is a disaster. That's depth and that situation will not be the same twice. Are the game mechanics complex that made that situation possible, not really but what complexity is there is enough to be used in so many different ways to make a wide varity of different decisions possible with the same tools and thats depth. In contrast a rube goldburg machine is complex but its not deep because after all its bells, whistles and moving parts it still only cracks a single egg and thats all it can ever do.","June 14, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has that same abstract quality to it. Unlike Total War's battles, which try to give you a cinematic view of the fight, UG:G gives you the a more abstract view of the fight.\n\nThe visual style is what makes this game, for me. The map itself is gorgeous, and I wonder if a high-res .jpg is available as a wallpaper. The wording, drawing right onto the map, the tiny 3D buldings, the trees, it all contributes to the feeling of seeing a miniature battle played out on a 3D map. (This is helped by the fact that at the edges of the map, you can see the table it rests upon!) The tiny little soldiers are animated, but not overly so. The smoke effects are subtle yet clear.\n\nAs far as sound goes, the game's battle sounds much like you would expect it to, if you were hovering overhead. Gunfire is muffled but distinct, as are the drums. I can only hope that as development continues, musical cues are added.\n\nAI is another strong point, here. Unit will withdraw if pushed upon too hard, but unlike in Total War, where they go from fighting to total retreat, soldiers here will back off and regroup. The AI seems more realistic than in TW, and absent any player's orders, the units will move on their own and adjust to the situation. There is less control here than in TW. You can't dictate the length and depths of firing lines, or even their facing, really. You click on their unit flag, and drag their route across the battlefield, making turns and flanking maneuvers as needed. The unit does the rest, deciding where to direct their fire. Here, you are truly a general. You can only point, and hope your officers carry out their orders. No micro-managing here, and that makes for a more laid back, contemplative approach,\n\nYou'll note I have not gone into any depth on content. It's all there, all the various battles that make up Gettysburg, as well the option to create custom battles. But really, for me anyway, the selling point was the visuals and audio. It's Fields of Glory all over again!\n\nThis game is $10. If it never saw another added feature, I would still consider this game well worth the money. As it is, the developer has far more to come, and I expect nothing but excellence from him.\n\nThis game is well worth your money!","June 12, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This brings a much more historically accurate gameplay experience. You will slowly advance and try to flank and out flank the enemy to capture key "Victory Points" on the map. However, it won't be easy. The AI is very well done and will react to your moves.\n\nThe game reminds me of an early 2000's game called "Austerlitz, Napoleon's Greatest Victory" except much more polished because of the victory point system.\n\nDepending on how well you do in a scenario you will unlock a set of strategies for the next part of the battle. Will you try to keep Oak Hill or fall back?\n\nKeep in mind this game is in early access mode. That means the game is unfinished and some of the text unwritten. The worst complaint I have so far is the clunky artillery controls. Is it going to stay and fire or run head first into the enemy lines? However I do believe the dev team in Ukraine will address this issue and the other issues. Don't let this turn you off from purchasing. I had to really knit-pick this complaint.\n\nIf you enjoyed Empire Total War or Napoleon Total War battles and want a more realistic battle experience this game is for you.","June 13, 2014","true","56.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

More "experienced" gameers may remember a game called "Fields of Glory," in which you played the role of Napoleon through the Waterloo Campaign. Those who don't may remember "Sid Meier's Gettysburg." Ultimate General: Gettysburg combines many of the things that made both of those oldies fantastic wargames for people like me, who don't really like desktop-style wargames. The stress builds during the realtime play, whether or not you pause the action. That map is one of the most beautiful  and original strategy game maps I've seen since Civ V. All for an incredibly low price!\n\nThe game does still need polish. charges seem ineffectual, the units move too quickly, expecially in rough terrain. I think cover needs tuning, and most importantly, You should be able to kill a general who puts himself in harms way, just as several generals and more than 20 regimental commanders were killed in the actual battle.\n\nBut these are small concerns that I'm betting the dev will iron out.

This game has you fighting a huge battle not just on one front, but 2-3 different sides on the map (as Union). Acting quickly and timing your actions are essential to winning battles, that is why there is a pause button which helps tremendously. I love planning out my actions before hand, and then the anticipation and tension when the battle plays out.\n\nThe A.I. is intelligent and it constantly anticipates my movement on the map, unlike the total war games where sometimes the units actually ignore you or chase you alone. The computer is very aggressive and can be passive. In order to win battles I actually had to take advantage of the terrain, and capture some key parts of the map. For example, there was a small hill on my left flank, so I secured it with skirmishers, then sat my artillery there, and the battle became much easier (but still intense) since I had a huge advantage. In many games, capturing 'strategic points' hold no tacitcal advantage whatsoever, but in this game, the territories you're supposed to hold are usually Hills, ridges, and areas with vegitation (gives units cover). So you aren't uselessly capturing a territory because the game makes it seem important, you're doing it because it gives significant advantages.\n\nEven with all those good positions I had on the map it was still hard to manage because your men's condition and morale will plummet if they fight too long. I actually like that. There was tension when my left and right flanks faltered because they were routing, and just in time I had some fresh reinforcements on the map. That's not the only reason why I like the morale/condition system, but also the fact that rotating your men regularly (and having reserves) greatly rewards you for your micromanagement and effort.\n\nAnd as much as people might say graphics aren't important. They do add an element to gameplay, and it is clear which is high ground and which are forests, though some terrain isn't as quite clear. The fog of war and sight range for units adds a unique element and it makes scouting crucial, since units can't aim or attack if there enemy is out of sight. It's a very simplistic style that really works with the game and the time setting it takes place.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, if you love strategy games. There is a whole lot more to the micromanagement than just massing up forces and throwing them at the enemy (like most rts games). But be warned, this is a thinking man's game, the pause button is your friend, and you have to figure some things out yourself. It will become frustrating if you don't think about your actions or take a look at the stats of your men.","June 17, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One of the most unique things about this game is that there are 9 total difficult levels with varying levels of aggressiveness and skill. For example, you can set the AI to be aggressive but not skilled, and vice versa. Or you can set it to be both aggressive and skilled if you enjoy losing. But even on the least skilled and least aggressive setting (which I call the McClellan AI) it still puts up a considerable fight, which is unique in an era where it's not uncommon to be able to steamroll a game's AI even at the highest setting.\nThe gameplay is still in early development, but one of my favorite features is the ability to easily draw your own unit routes. In many strategy games, the only way to get your units to follow a specific route is to set various waypoints, which can be time-consuming and tough for the path-finding AI to deal with. In this game, you just drag the mouse where you want the unit to go and it will follow that path. It's a great tool that makes it easier to flank your enemies and increases the mobility of your army.\nEven though this game is still in early access, it's well worth the 10 dollars.

I say almost because i love it, but it has many shortcommings, some of which can be ironed out in the early access process.\nPros:\nIt looks beautiful and has a fantastic atmoshphere\nvery dynamic, your success each day determines the next days events\neasy to learn and use, which can also be a downside, but ill get that in abit.\nmorale is realistic compared to other games like total war, units retreat, but form up once safe\nfatigue is crap, just like real life, there is a lot of stress on pilling troops back and replacing them, which in turn makes you keep reserve troops. but thats a good thing\nafter every battle, you have multiple options on what to do next, be it a counter attack, or to rest, attack the center or the flank, its up to you.\nfan-flippin-tastic AI that counters everything you do intelegently most of the time\nmultiple personalties you can choose for the AI to use.\n\nCons:\nsometimes when a unit routs, it doesnt actually run away, it just sits there and i watch a thousand man brigade get torn apart just beacuse it won't run\nsome of the between mission text does not load, the part that describes your posible actions.\nI dont think cannons are near as powerfull as they should be.\nranges are a bit short, or the units need to be downsized.\nunits turn to face the enemy and brake from cover on their own which is frustrating\nthe game is not polished, you can tell its not a completed game at this point, but hopefully that will be worked out\n\nSummary:\nGreat for what it is, an early access game, as long as darth finishes it up nicely, it will be great.

This game provides the deep tactical gameplay you would come to expect playing a Darthmod title. It is also worth mentioning that the graphics themselves give the game a nice flavour. Lastly the AI... It is a true challenge to defeat the computer in a battle, which is refreshing in itself. The computer will respond to your tactics in realistic ways, this makes exploiting the AI very difficult to do. However, being that this is an early access game I have only been able to face the AI in one of the scenarios. I have no idea how it will act in later battles, if it is anything like the first battle though you will be in for a challenging yet enjoyable experience.\n\nNegatives:  The game is very solid, even in its early stages. However, there are a couple of things I found lacking in it. First of all is the controls. The buttons on the bottom right seem to work fine, but the way you must move your troops does take a bit of getting used to. You must click on the unit and then drag it to the place  you want them to move to. This doesn't sound like a very big deal until you realize that there is no way to order your troops to stand in a specific spot or line up in a specific way. It really negatively affected the gameplay in my opinion. The only other issue I found was your own troops AI... I say this because, your own troops will auto adjust their lines according to enemy positioning. This usually is very affective at cutting down the amount of micro-managing you would expect in a game like this. Although in certain situations your troops will auto adjust even when told not to. I've even run into situations where my men will just turn around when fired upon only to expose their back to the hot lead volley of musket fire that ensues. These are things that really take you out of the experience.\n\nFinal Verdict:  My final opinion on this game is an 8/10.

Battles can range from a few thousand to over 60,000 soldiers fighting for victory.  Unlike most strategy games though you are not looking to destroy every opposing soldier.  You have objectives for each battle that you want to accomplish, and so do they.  Your goal could be to defend your current position and only fall back once you are about to be overrun.  You, might actually lose ground, but you inflicted more casualties to the other side which will carry over to the next battle.  Then,  your next battle objective will be to take two new positions with the reinforcements that have come on the next day.\n\nHow you control your armies is very simple and streamlined.  You select a brigade, drag your mouse on the path you want the unit to take and off it goes.  Also, the arrows stay, so you know where you have commanded your units to go.  Now, things can get quite chaotic on such a large battlefield, so you have the option to pause and to reassess your strategies.  Sometimes, it is wise to pause every once in a while to check out the morale and condition of your troops, so you know where to send in your reserves.\n\nProbably, the best part of the game is when your well planned strategy earns you a victory.  I was the Union and the Confederacy was steady pushing my soldiers back as they had a slight numerical advantage. I believe 28,000-25,000.  I could have held the lines for far more casualties, but I kept some brigades back in a safe area to keep them fresh for when I saw the opportunity to strike.  Plus, I knew I was going to get 10,000+ reinforcements soon.  As the Confederacy kept pushing my lines back, I finally send 4,000 fresh troops and then  6,000 of my reinforcement troops that had just joined the battle while retreating with the tired soldiers that were engaged.  My new force devastated their advance and forced them to retreat back to the hill that I was tasked in taking over.  Their stand was short as my soldiers pushed them off the hill quickly and they retreated even further back.  The battle ended short after, with only a "minor victory", but I had broken the morale and spirit of the majority of their troops which will carry over to the next battle.\n\nI would totally recommend to anyone a fan of strategy, war, or historical games. 9/10.","June 20, 2014","true","27.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I read any books or movies I could get on it and I played most of the video games. The first being Robert E. Lee Civil War General the hex game back in 1996, and some time later Sid Meier's Gettysburg, I even played Gettysburg mod for Starcraft because of its awesomeness. So of course I have ridiculous standards, I won't deny that, I will not say this is a bad game, for me it makes me want to go back and play my old favorites. I will just say for a game on this subject I cared about so much to get the thumbs up from me, it would need to give me something more. I feel the developer wanted to take an approach for realism, but this for me has been done, with games like Sid Meires, and better. I loved the unit progression in some of the older titles, where you actually got to upgrade your guns between battles, maybe even some stats for generals.\n\nPros\n+ Progression - after every engagment your casualties carry over to the next one\n+ Progression - again the game focuses on one battle, but its not just the lineral historical route of the battle, you get to make choices after every engagment, many strategies were never implemented in the actual battle, but here if you for example win you can chose to hold the hills on the outskirts of town instead of falling back the ridge behind it.\n\nMix\n\n-+ Multiplayer - There is a multiplayer, can't complain about that, its balanced in ways FPS are, its skill based; can't complain about that either! Its just nothing like the predecesors, its 1v1.. When I think of civil war I think of multiplayer, before there were 'clans' in video games there were very well organized armies in games like Sid Meires that put almost any form on online groups to shame these days. We do not get the 3v3's we use to have back in the day, not much community here.\n\n-+ Realism - I always loved realism in games, In this game the units will do what they want, and the choice to have them unpredictable was a choice by the developer to add realism or in his words: frustration (since thats what actually happend in the civil war, your subordinates didnt always listen to you) I sort of think a better choice would be the ability to give your leaders overall stance orders, like aggressive, or defensive. This would let them do what they want, yet not do something ridiculous like a rouge brigade charging down a hill you wanted them to defend.\n\nCon\n\n- Graphics - They are functional and look good, but the terrain is 2D, the units are sprites,\n\n- Line of Sight - I think this needs some work, its very difficult to figure out where your artillary can actually fire, since half the time if you actually check their LOS they wont actually be firing at units within its range, the best thing to do is to find 1 arty unit that is firing, then put all your artillery on that spot, which is a bit crazy in terms of historical strategy.\n\n\n\n\nI am basically giving it the thumbs up for if its on sale, its not a bad buy at all.","January 28, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Game-labs, the creator of this game is the creator of Darthmod for Total War series, and the experience gained modding Total War clearly shows in this game!\n\nThe graphics are obivously not Total War graphics, but it`s not even the purpose. It`s there to make you feel like you are in a tent 3 km from the front line looking at a map of the battle, and getting reports about troop movements. As a seasoned gamer my conclussion has been that in these days when even simple graphics can look good and fill a purpose, who need the flashy animations of Total War games? The graphics of Ultimate General: Gettysburg is indeed simple, but beutiful, and gives the player the opportunity of feeling like master general, drawing out lines of attack on a map.\n\nSo it`s pretty much established that it`s the feeling and gameplay emersion that trumps good graphics in most cases. At least in my opinion. In terms of gameplay, I do really recognise some things from the Empire & Napoleon games from Creative Assembly, that reflects the creator`s previous work. But I have the feeling of everything having been improved upon and well thought about. How you have to place your troops, when you move them, and how to engage is basically about looking at the surroundings in the map and at units stats moreso  than in previously mentioned games. It`s noticable that Game-Labs have improved on many things from Total War, and created a far more historically accurate battle simulation. There are really stuff here that Creative Assembly would be wise to consider if going back to the Empire franschise of the Total War series.\n\nSince this game obviously is about one battle, the game is not like Total War, were one battle is one major set-piece battle that takes 15- 45 minutes, and that`s it. In Total War this fills a purpose, given that you also play a grand strategy game on a large map filled with several battles. Instead Game-labs focused on one batte and came up with something really clever;  You don`t really fight the battle of Gettysburg all at once. You fight larger skirmishes as a part of the bigger, several days long battle. The campaign is non-linear, and how you fight the campaign depends much on your overall strategy decisions in and between battles, since you carry all your troops with you from different battles. In between battles you have options; Shall I reinforce flanks? Should I hold the line no matter what? Should I do tactical retreat? All these decisions make each playthrough unique. Especially since you can decide how your AI opponent should behave. This has made me come back to the game a couple times and realized that I`m not fighting the same battles, and I can suddenly find myself pushed up against the wall by something unanticipated. This makes the relatively short campaign really interesting and replayable.\n\nUltimate General: Gettysburg is unique game, that the RTS and history nerds defintely will enjoy!! I`m falling into both of those categories, and I did! :) I recommend it for anyone who enjoys tactical battle games set in historical settings. For the sequel under development, I would only ask a few things of Game-labs, and that is to include more than one battle and perhaps make som of the details stand out as 3D in the otherwise 2D landscape, such as houses, towns treas and ridges. Otherwise it`s a great game as it is!","February 22","true","9.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(Arrival at gettysburg) as the Union, I was stoked that I won the battle.\n\nThis games takes a sharp mind, a lot of thinking, and not messing up. You can never win a battle with your initial men. In the first battle I did, I had some skirmishers, and cannons. Not much to defend, but it probably was enough to hold until reinforcements arrive. I did some stupid mistakes, and lost an entire unit.\n\nGoing off track on that a little, you learn more while you play. I learned that putting stuff on higher ground DOES indeed help, not putting them on the lower ground. You can change what you where doing before instantly. Doing the same mistake the Union did at Gettysburg without knowing it, and before it's almsot to late you recover and send those confederates packing? You can do that.\n\nIt may seem like a small game, but just a single battle can show you how amazing it is.\n\nWhether you love history, love strat. games, or both, I highly recommend this to you.\n\nWord of warning though, you're probably not going to do very well in a battle without first going through the tutorials.\n\nGood luck if you get it!","January 1, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not clear exactly how detailed some of the mechanics behind elements like morale and condition are, but they appear fairly simplified - it would be good to see some added detail in that area, and possibly the inclusion of supply & ammunition.\n\nWhile the game saves when you exit, there's no ability to save/load at arbitrary points. You also can't resume at the beginning of a phase of the battle, so replay is limited to starting again.\n\nUltimately, the game is still under development, so some of these negatives can be taken with a grain of salt. The game is enjoyable, and shaping up well.","June 22, 2014","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I cannot recommend this game since it is plagued with extremely slow gameplay and unresponive units - units also have a delay before they adhere to a command and less than 10% of the time cannon units actually respond to the commands and fire. Furthermore, at times the units just stand there and will not fire back even when the enemy is firing at them. Trying to get your units in formation, or trying to move them around or re-orient them is a chore in this game and often times impossible to do when in battle. Since the gameplay is so unresponsive and troubled the game is very frustrating. The sound, music, and graphics are all very nicely done but all of that is overshadowed by the dull and poor gameplay. Lastly, it would also help if there was a mini-map of some sort to quickly jump around the battlefield and also give keyboard commands/shortcuts to units.","May 8","false","1.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

On one hand the game is sorta cool from a historical stand point, but on the other the historical factor faded away, and this game shows its true colors. The men miss for absolutely no reason when in point blank range, and the cannons completely sucks if they miss their intended targets (they will definitely miss) and hit the guys behind them, but nothing happened !!!! something really needs to be done to them. The confederates are impossible to beat when they get their reinforcement, and the men always fight to a stalemate, because you cannot brake trough their lines at all. The damn horses are completely worthless when it comes to combating skirmisher or any units for that matter. the union rout for absolutely no reason, and the hand to hand combat is stupid you don't even have a chance to beat back the attackers once engaged, and on top of that you don’t even know if you’re winning the damn battle because it doesn’t event tell you the total amount of kill in game when you pause.

The AI seems pretty good, and I like the different settings laid out in a grid for difficulty and aggressiveness. You play tactical battles, making decisions in between portions of the battle as to what your next move will be. I enjoyed this aspect of it as your decisions drive the next portion of the battle with your results from previous battles carrying over to the next (I think).\n\nOverall I highly recommend this to anyone. It is a fun, quick play, with a lot of potential for replayability and could be picked up by noob and grognard alike.","October 16, 2014","true","16.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I like it and despite some of the negative reviews I bought the game, and I'm glad I did!  AI seems good against you, it seems to try to flank when your weak on the ends or outnumbered.  That said, if you've ever play Sid Meiers Gettysburg, for some reason it has the same AI thinking problem as that game.  If they rush up to your line and they get shot back, the line will continuously fall back and charge over and over, even when they should obviously fall back, regroup or retreat.  Meaning, AI decisions still have some pathing choices to be programmed in....but, I still like playing this in between other games, and its early access, so it probably improve more.  And, one important note, every other day or so, I see the developers updating this game.  I can't tell you how important that is.  If you purchased early access before you know some of these games clearly don't support their own games.","October 29, 2014","true","9.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It looks like what you had to imagine in your head playing Sid Meier's Gettysburg back in the days, and it relives those sweet memories in an entirely new way.\n\nHaving said that, the recommendation comes with a few points of criticism.\nThe major downside of this game is that playtime is TOO SHORT. The game will not grant you enough time to conduct a decent military operation, although that is what it expects you to do. It puts your units in a sloppy position to begin with, and subsequently expects you to fight a battle of Gettysburg scenario in about 15 minutes of playing time. That's not only impossible and unhistorical, it's frustrating, because by the time you manage to get your lines organized and your operation gains momentum, the clock says "battle is over" and puts an end to your efforts, just when you begun to taste victory.\n\nIt's also a bit of a shame that you cannot put your troops in marching column. There is no "marching column" command, no "advance" command, and no "dig in" command. Artillery handling is awkward, and needs a lot of repositioning before your artillery units are willing to start shooting at something.\n\nNevertheless, the graphics are great, the sounds are great and this game still reminds you of the glorious days of Sid Meier's Gettysburg. With all its (temporary?) shortcomings, this game is a true achievement and well worth your money.\n\n","October 30, 2014","true","33.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

I played Sid Miere Gettysburg back in the day--and this is as good as it gets if youre like me and have been wishing someone would update that game for current computers and make it look a little nicer.  If that is something you desire, then Ultimate General is your game.\n\nIts fun, it looks nice, it plays alot like Sid Meier's.  The Battle of Gettysburg flows nicely as you play through it.  It did a good job of capturing the feel of the Gettysburg book I just read, and definately scratched that Civil War itch.  In short, its just a fun game.\n\nMy only complaint would be amount of content.  For $9.99 you definately get enough content.  The Battle of Gettysburg itself is pretty robust and plays out in interesting ways with a fair amount of replayability--but I want more.  Its got a custom battle setup, but it needs to be a little more robust.  Would really like a proper, random battle option--where you could pick battle size, and it places victory points randomly on map, and randomizes troops involved, troop starting location, and randomized reinforcement and map entry.\n\nAs far as Early Access goes--It feels like a full release to me for the most part.  I wouldn't realize it was an Early Access if it didn't say so on the store page.  I spotted some very minor issues--at one point I pushed an enemy brigade literally off the map, and yet some of my cannons kept trying to fire at this off map enemy--with the cannons landing at map edge and either having no effect or hitting my own troops trying to pass through that way.  This only occued one time, and is a very unique situation.\n\nSo I recommend it.  At 9.99 it is a no-brainer.  If they have added a more robust custom/random battle system by release time--this game would easily be worth 20.00-25.00 dollars.  Really hoping to see more like this.","October 7, 2014","true","21.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The art style is impressive and beautiful, and feels very uniquely Civil War era-ish. Gameplay mechanics are typical RTS fare, and it is reminiscent of many classics like Cossacks II. Graphics look dated, but it suits the game's art style very well; and especially for a first major release from this developer.\n\nI've only played under an hour, but I'm addicted as is. The AI is challenging, and it is perhaps one of the best indie games I've bought this year.

Instead there's a sort of barebone summary of orders and a hidden skeleton tree campaign.\n\nEnoyable nonetheless but if the game had a bigger budget and more people working on it, it could be an obvious area of improvement.\n\nOn a last note I should also say that the AI is suprisingly good with multiple personality types to match what you choose.\n\nSo I highly recommend if you're fan of strategy games in general and have an interest in the Civil War period.

A few issues that I will point out.\n\na.)  Units taking fire to the front (even in less than 20% cover, take no casualties, whereas fire from the flank causes catastrophic losses).  Sure, I understand that flank fire would cause more damage, but not 10-20x as much.\n\nb.)  Cavalry is useless.  I click charge, the unit literally runs halfway across the map in the other direction.\n\nc.)  Artillery does not unlimber.  It sits there and gets shot at for five minutes while I try to figure out how to get it to unlimber (because there is no button?  why?)\n\nd.)  Same charge issues with infantry...how do unlimbered (ie, pushed) guns run away from my charging troops?  Explain please.\n\nUltimately, what I have found playing back and forth is that the defender wins 90% of the time.  Units set in defense fire, units attacking are often bugged and do not fire, so they just stand there and get shot at.  Because of the bad charge mechanics, the Confederates advantage in morale and skill (ie, hand to hand) is basically null and void.  Similarly, if trying to push guns forward to support an advance, you lose all of your guns because they bug and won't unlimber for four or five minutes (I timed this, actually).\n\nBecause of this, I view this game as being pretty much unplayable.  It's no fun playing a strategy game when your strategy won't work because of bugs or flawed mechanics.  It makes no sense that when I order a bayonet charge, my troops just mill around in a big mass, neither attacking nor retreating.  It also makes no sense that units route in one or two volleys.\n\nIf you want a good recreation of Gettysburg, maybe you should have modded Shogun 2 or another Total War game.  At least their units actually charge.  Also, I find the morale mechanics in Total War to actually be more realistic, as opposed to the units that run away when the enemy sneezes at them, or when they are sitting in an open field not even close to the fighting.","September 16, 2015","false","8.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Its hard to micro manage units since it just contanstly refuses to let me unclick units and you have to drag and click all the time using their bad positioning style which i havent seen in a few years since a free moba i played. Basically the game is 1 battle with no storyline or campaign that lets you play along with what happenned in history basically all you do is choose union or confederate, use the same units to try and beat what ever play style your opponent is using, each sides get some kind of benefit.

If you're thinking of buying this game because you remember how awesome the Sid Meiers/Fireaxis games were, STOP! This doesn't come close. I don't remember when those games came out ('97, '98?) but the graphics were about the same (or better, in the case of unit detail) as Ultimate General: Gettyburg ('14!).\n\nWhile the game has its moments and can be fun at times, you have no fine control over your units. For example you can't have a line wheel left or right, you can't order skirmishers to run. Furthermore this game is unreliable at best when it comes to saving your campaign. I've been able to save/resume/complete campaigns but as often as not I've returned to the game and found no trace of my saved or the autosaved progress.\n\nIf this game was a $5 app on an iPad I'd recommend it highly. $15 bucks though for this...?

And that game it's desperately trying to be is Sid Meier's Gettysburg, the old and apparently peerless classic. Unfortunately, where Sid Meier's game shone, this game seems lackluster.\n\nThe pacing of Ultimate General is too fast, depriving the battles of any kind of tension as crises are resolved too quickly one way or another. Where SMG was a rising crescendo of fury, with pitched battles raging back and forth as you and the AI threw more and more regiments into the fray, UGG is a sharp, brief clash where one side suddenly buckles under fire and before you can say "boo!" all of the losing troops are on the run. What could be a slow, considered, developing battle is instead turned into a click-fest as you scramble back and forth between the two wings of your line pushing bridages back into formations.\n\nThe developer claims to have an advanced, challenging AI, which is patently untrue. At no point in any of the battles (and I've played the game on highest difficulty from both sides) had I felt that the fight was going to turn dangerously against me. He is easy to outmaneuver, nor does he guard flanks or give up a forward position to establish better lines with reserves farther back. Only the speed of the game manages to mask the inabilities of the AI, as most breakthroughs occur because you were busy managing your line elsewhere. This isn't AI brilliance, it's just frustrating. One brigade will fall back 50 yards out of range of fire, while the adjoining brigades stay online and get hammered for their trouble. If you don't catch your unit falling back and hold them by the hand and drag them back into line, your line is liable to fail.\n\nWhat the game does get right is the "individual battles within a battle" method of progressing Gettysburg (which, I might add, is straight out of SMG) through the 3 days of fighting. It provides a realistic ebb and flow of combat as the sides rest and resupply between phases of battle. Where UGG misses on this count, however, is that you can give the Yankees a crushing defeat, taking Seminary, Oak, and Cemetary Ridges all in the same battle, and with the blue-bellies routing before you and victory in sight, the battle will end and in the next phase you find yourself fighting over the same piece of battlefield. It makes you wonder why you even bothered fighting so hard. On the other side of the coin, a brilliant defense on the first day as the Union will still see you inexplicably falling back to Cemetary Hill.\n\nThe big #1 miss of this entire game is that there in no multiplayer support. The fairly even-strength fighting in this battle is perfectly suited for multiplayer action. There is no current comperable title to UGG. Another ACW offering, Gettysburg: Scourge of War has a multiplay option, but the game is incredibly dense and sports a learning curve that means new players will be massacred failry easily. UGG's simple, elegant design lends itself easily to buy-and-play multiplay where a new player will be competent in a few sessions. Without any similiar offerings on Steam, UGG could potentially corner the American Civil War mulitplayer market - and it would be a great multiplayer game.\n\nFinal words: UGG is an okay game - almost a tablet game in the way it looks and handles. If you're into face-value easy to play, easy to master RTS, this game could your next favourite. If you're more like me and you prefer deep strategy like Hearts of Iron, Europa Universalis and so on, you might want to give this one a miss.","July 15, 2014","false","11.7"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","1"

Also, I was exited to see the game these devs would come up with. Unfortunatly, it's my opinion that this game is extremely unsatisfying and also difficult to master. The closest comparison to UG: Gettysburg is probably Empire: Total War although this game lacks meny of the features that made Empire a great game. Here's a couple:\n\n1. The controls don't give you much of a toolbox to lead the battle. Because of these bad controls (and the fast pace of the battles) you won't have time (or the tools) to form proper defensive/offensive lines because you have to control each unit individually.\n2. Because of the morale feature and the controls being like they are, I've spent most of the battle time repeatingly dragging each unit towards the front as they pull back every chance they get (you have to command them to "HOLD" after they arrive at each location, but no player (or real commander) can be everywhere at once. This just takes away every satisfaction I would normally get when playing a game of this sort becaus I have to spend all my time doing things a general shouldn't have to do.\n3. The terrain is hard to read as everything looks flat. Being about the battle of Gettysburg, everything should really be about defense/attack on high ground. In a way it is, because the ridges are victory point, but there doesn't seem to be any difference between fighting in the open or on top of a hill. I can't say whether or not the terrain gives any kind of bonus/penalty like getting a bonus when on high ground. What I can say, is that it sure doesn't feel like it. The things I thought would be important in a game like this (like digging in and defending a hilltop or setting up defences along rivers and other obstacles) doesn't seem to have any effect at all.\n\nIn short, I just don't see the point of playing this game and I'm quite disappointed in the results.

I played the battle on average difficulty settings and found it to be fairly boring.  This is coming from someone who liked battles in Empire: Total War, which were total ♥♥♥♥♥hows.  Actually, comparing this to ETW could work.  The battle in this game is very similar to many in ETW, complete with puzzling AI decisions and disappointing cavalry charges.\n\nThe game's aesthetic appealed to me from the photos, but seeing it in action was disappointing.  The tilt shift effect is cool, but they seem to use to gloss over how poor the battlefield/city looks. It looks like one of those carpets for kids to play town on.  Buildings look drawn on with confused perspectives.  It's 2014, you can do better than this. If they tried to stylize it, they did it poorly.\n\nI wanted to like this game, because I love the period and the idea, as well as the genre.  In the end I was bored and spent more time wondering what went wrong with the battlefield map than with the AI.\n\nI'd say just play DarthMod for Empire, but that mod doesn't do anything either.","November 9, 2014","false","1.2"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","11","28","0","0"

Everything looked so fluid on the battelfield, even the little lines indicating troop marching direction. The little sounds of trumpets and drums were cool too.\n\nI finished the first battle, "hell yea" I thought, "I am the ultimate General". The men celebrated our victory, proposing toasts to their heroic leader. "To the next battle" I declared. Upon loading the second battle I was rather confused... I had just fought this battlefield, why am I back here... after a momemnts confusion I went back to the main menu and reloaded the second battle. YET AGAIN SAME BATTLEFIELD.... 'Okay', I thought, '♥♥♥♥ this ill get one of my friends to buy it so we can play MP. Surely thats better'\n\nMy friend fortunately bought the game and we commenced our first battle. I thought to myself that this would be an easy victory, considering I was the ultimate general, and he was but a mere plebian forced into command. He began by charging in his troops, all at the same time, up a hill towards me. HA, i thought, he does not truely understand how valuable it is to have the higher ground, and has no true understanding of flanking. "FIRE" I called to all my musketmen... there was a pause, "FIRE GODDAMIT, FIRE", he was getting closer... "WHY WONT YOU FIRE YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S", he was now almost in contact with all my muskets. Within a few meters of them interacting all my man began to flee. Wtf is going on, i thought to myself... how could this be... Not a single one of my troops faced the oncomming charge, but instead, fled for the lives. THIS MADE NO SENSE. Next battle, I have cav, charge cav, they run, everything runs, everyone is a ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game. I figured the way to win is to simply put all your troops on charge and charge right into the heart of the enemy, GG.\n\ntl;dr ♥♥♥♥ game, dont buy.

I was hoping for that game that would really demonstrate what I hear everyone always say about gettysburg and the early civil war in general, if the Union had some decent commanders they would have won every battle they went into. and in gettysburg for knowlegde of the battle you could play the confederates and avoid the mistakes Lee made.\n\nthis is a maybe review could be something you're looking for but its just not for me.","June 29, 2014","false","5.2"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","11","29","0","0"

For example, you have to control click to select multiple units instead of shift click, selecting multiple units is done by *drawing* a circle around them (what is this an iPad game?), rotating units is unnecessarily difficult as the direction for them to face does not snap to where your cursor is so you will end up spinning the direction box around a couple of times before you get it right.  The biggest thing for me is that there is no way to tell units to move to a certain position and face a certain direction - you have to tell them to move and then when they get there turn them around, why?  No idea but its a pain in the ♥♥♥ when you have 10+ units moving which you have to babysit because they will end up facing wherever the ♥♥♥♥ they want.\n\nThe game could be fun but you will literally spend 99% of the gameplay fiddling with your units trying to get them to form a line.

The unit cohesion is very similar as well as the over all appearance, but all similarities stop there.\n\nFirst there is no regimental command level.  You can not break up a brigade to send out a regiment of skirmishers.  which leads me to my second dissapointment.\n\nThere is no way to change a units formation.  You can not put a unit into column, skirmishers, or refuse a line.  There are "skirmishers" within the game but they are stuck as such.\n\nWhat good are cavalry?  I understand the over all lack of fighting ability of cavalry against infantry, but seriously, some skirmishing power would be nice.  Also, if cavalry runs down a battery of guns guess who ends up running.  You certainly can not capture them.\n\nI am also not sure what the metrics are for flanking.  I had an enemy bridage flanked and fought them off when they charged yet they continued to hang around and be a nuisance when they should have been completely routed.  I know the rout is possible because I have had some of my own brigades break.\n\nOver all if you are looking for the second coming of the classic Sid Meiers then this is not it.

The generals at Gettysburg itself were not as knowledgeable in the concepts as they should have been.

You wont be pulling a Victorian Caesar (Hammer and Anvil) here; rather you will be engaging the enemy, pushing them back a bit but not crushing their units. Breakthroughs don't occur in the video game sense, but rather in the realistic sense.\nThe game also has a tendency to crash just when you're starting to feel proud of yourself, forcing you to completely restart the single battle scenario that you bought for £6.\n\nI personally don't like it, it's not punchy and decisive enough, but if you enjoy the Darthmod style of combat then I'd say you should pick this game up when it's £2.99 at most. If you're more into smashing your enemies as in vanilla Total War then you may as well skip this or buy it when it's £1.99 or less.","July 30, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

This hasn't been fixed in almost a month. Something like this should be hot fixed and not require us to wait for a full patch.\n\nSecond, various things in the game just don't make sense. I had 2,000 troops charge into one cannon unit of 100 men, and they didn't wipe it out. Literally 2,000 men surrounding an artillery unit and they don't wipe it out. They didn't even wipe out 10% of them. That makes no sense. Artillery caught out in the open by 2,000 men are just dead. There is no hail mary save for them. They are D-E-A-D. Not in this game though. I took more damage then they did. Makes no sense. It was at that point I stopped playing. I honestly have no idea why this game gets all these awesome reviews.

The union army have better shooting moral and cannons. The game is highly unbalanced and even from a realism aspect confederate troops at this stage of the war were less likely to run in combat than their union counterparts. Far better shots and their cannon fire was still very effective. I watched 7 cannon batteries of 70+ unload point blank into a union formation and it only ticked 10 units off. Meanwhile. 1 union battery took out over 500 men from one unit with shell fire. I expected more from the creator of darthmod. If there was a way to get my money back I would take it. oh and yes i played the union side of it as well and the above comments remain true.","October 19, 2014","false","17.5"," 6 of 25 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","6","25","0","1"

I did flanking manuvers. one in front, two comming in at the  back sides. on every enemy  unit.   it should be shooting fish in a barrel. but noooo. he just stood there, took it all with minimum casualties.  took out 1/3 of my units. and retreated.  and then we did it all over again. I even tried to hold the high ground while flanking. same result.\nand my cannons ... ah.. yes. they did nothing,. one of his units stood for half the duration in the bombardment and he hardly noiced it when it came to casualties.\nwhen all was said and done. I ended up with a minor defeat, even tho i had managed to take out 1000 more troops than he had. and  held the points on the map that I was supposed to...\nif you like a game that is bloody unfair. or you somehow got some magic tactics brain that comes up with strategys don't involve flanking. then  go for it, its not very expencive. but  its not realy worth it, even if you are somekind of rainman with tactics.","June 25, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 25 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","25","0","0"

Made by Darth, the guy who made vanilla AI in Total War games much, much smarter.\n\nThis game gives you the option of choosing what type of enemy commander you want to face and its strategies will actually end up suprising you.Several times now, I've had unexpected reinforcements pop up suddenly or dissappearing into the fog of war only to reappear on my vulnerable flanks when and where I least expect them.\n\nThe graphics are great; certainly not of the level of a Total War game, but more like a 21st century update for Sid Meier's Gettysburg. There's no music and the sounds are mostly limited to shouting men, shooting guns and drums, so that could probably still use some work.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an early access game, so there are bound to be bugs, crashes and weird behaviour, but overall; I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a challenging historical wargame.","June 16, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
