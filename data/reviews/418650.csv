So incredibly immersive and I feel so pumped up when the music really gets going. Though, I am still clearly terrible in comparison to some of the leaders.\n\nIf you have a Vive, this game is one to get and play with your friends. 100% recommend.

Never have I felt total spacial awareness in a game before, to where I was able to defend the left side of my body with a shield without even having to look in that direction. It is incredible, a real Geometry Wars type of "one more time" feel for VR. I can't recommend it enough.","April 9","true","1.9"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

You'll pretty much manage to do everything there is within the game within the first couple of minutes.\n\nBeyond that, it's fun to compete with friends.\n\nWEAPONS\nThe weapons are kind of cool, but I wish I had more choice. You just have a pistol at the moment, but it has different firing types.\n\nSingle Shot: This is just your standard pistol, but you have a laser sight (In fact, it's currently the only one with a laser sight).\n\nTriple Shot: You no longer have the laser sight, but you do have 3 shots fired in rapid succession when you pull the trigger. In order to fire again, you'll need to release and pull the trigger again.\n\nRapid Fire: All you need to do is hold the trigger to fire an endless supply of shots. The only problem is that the longer you hold the trigger, the slower the rate of fire.\n\nCharge Shot: Hold down the trigger to charge it up, and released it to do a shot that will pretty much always destroy your target. The problem is, you have to be accurate to make use of it. Your sight will turn green when you're about to make a kill shot, so looking down the sights is pretty handy.\n\nLaser: Fire a low powered laser from your gun. When you hit your target, they'll usually be stunned and start to fall. After a constant stream of shots, they'll blow up, but it's the slowest way of destroying the drones. HOWEVER! You if you equip a laser in both hands and cross the beams, you form a very powerful laser beam. This does massive damage, but of course, limits you to one direction of attack, and no defense.\n\nDEFENSE\nYou start the match with 3 lives. So that's 3 shots and you're out! Even rapid fire from behind will end your match pretty quickly, but the game slows down when you're close to an enemy laser. It creates this pretty amazing Matrix feeling. I'm not sure if you gain lives after X number of waves, but I have a feeling that's the case. Usually I'm too busy fighting to count how many lives I have left.\n\nReach to your back and your gun is replaced with a shield. This can reflect shots back, and with a bit of luck, can actually reflect them back to your attacker. On top of this, pull the trigger to charge up and release a powerful shock wave. This can not only force your attackers back, but can also deflect shots.\n\nLEVELS\nThere's currently just the one level... it's pretty nice to look around, and you'll mainly be attacked from the front and sides, but there's no variety.\n\nENEMIES\nBeyond colours, I'm not sure what else there is. I understand there'll be boss fights soon, but at the moment you'll just be dealing with floating sphere drones. The look cool, and sound cool... but essentially repetitive.\n\nMUSIC AND SOUND\nThis is subjective, but I get a lot of excitement from it. Fast paced drum and bass, and a great beat makes you feel pretty powerful and unstoppable... that is until you hear a drone charge up and shoot you in the back.\n\nThe guns sound awesome, and suitable. Nothing seems out of place or underpowered.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt has the potential to be a great game. At the moment it's fun and easy to drop in and out of, but don't expect too much at this time.\n\nHopefully we'll have a greater selection of weapons in the future (shotgun, please!), and a story mode would be pretty cool. It has a nice level of polish, and I look forward to seeing what we get in the future.\n\nYes, I'd recommend, even at this current level.","April 27","true","2.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Totally amazing.\n\nIt's kinda simple, so I'm not sure how much staying power it has, but as a way to show off VR to people and to just have fun yourself, it's a great option!\n\nI have encountered a few issues with the weapon-setting display being hidden by the controllers, or the controllers not actually responding in the game after returning from the system overlay screen, but I saw that in The Lab as well so I'm assuming that's more an issue with the Vive and not this game.

What it lacks in depth it makes up for with pure exhilerating fun. Defend your landing platform from endless waves of merciless drones with the space pistols of the future. 5 different shooting modes plus a shield gives you a lot of different ways to fight.\n\nIf you ever enjoyed light gun shooters at the pizza place, this game is going to blow your mind.

And you practically have to rip the headset off their face to get them to stop.\n\nIt's a simple game in the same way Galaga or Asteroids was simple.

Everything is much more polished, the enemies are smarter and more interesting, the leaderboards are infuriating and keep you coming back, and it just feels like a complete experience. At the $15 price point for this game, you really can't pass it up.

At its core, Space Pirate Trainer is a game where you shoot robots with two pistols that have multiple firing modes. It would be extremely boring if it was a desktop game, and I don't know that I'd even pay $5 for it. But you can't adequately describe how it feels to see shots flying by your face in slow motion while you do a 90 degree bullet dodge bend to avoid a shot, or diving to the floor while raising your shield in the same motion to fend off a barrage of bullets. Space Pirate Trainer went from "that game that looks kind of dull on the store page" to "the game I show off to everyone who comes around wanting to see my Vive" in just a few minutes of playing.","April 27","true","1.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Dodging around while swinging laser blasters in arcs to blast small robotic ships is satisfying while leaving you feeling pretty awesome at the same time.

The music is also stellar and really helps amp you up. Though as you creep into later waves you really start to feel how repetitive the game is. Both in gameplay and music.

Let's face it, this game doesn't change. The scenery is the same, the droids are the same... the waves are (just about) the same. So this game should be pretty boring, really.\n\nExcept it's not. Because this game is about changing you. Changing you from the useless lump of putty you were into a ruthless droid destroying space pirate.\n\nAnd it works. No more do I hide behind a shield whilst firing aimlessly into the air, hitting nothing. No more do I stand there, like a potato, letting the droids destroy me.\n\nNow my ears listen out for their warm up noises. I know the bullet is coming, and I know where it's coming from. I dodge it without even bothering to look. I'm too busy. I aim at a droid, and I pull the triggers. Boom. I aim at the next one, pull the triggers... boom. One after another they fall. I don't miss, even as I duck and weave and dodge my way around the platform.\n\nThen I start missing. There's too many of them. They're coming from all over now, and I've lost my cool. One hits me, then another... and then it's too late.\n\nI put down the guns, admitting defeat.

I've only spent 0.2 hours with this so far (I can't believe it's only been 20 minutes), and can't wait to get back in after work today.\n\nBeing shot at from several directions, stepping out of their line of fire, and counterattacking with a sideways held pistol while crouching IRL - this is the future. The future is here. And it is glorious!\n\nFor me, this is as close to being in The Matrix as I've ever dared imagine. Time slows, and you can bend your body to avoid the incoming fire, watching the individual laser beams pass right by in front of your face.

After playing several VR games and thinking "Wow, this is cool!", I finally tried Space Pirate Trainer and actually discovered what good VR looked like. Merely standing in the menu made me giddy. So for $15, do you get your VR hype rocket-ship? You most certainly do.\n\nHowever, for $15, do you get a good game? Well, maybe. As with all early-access games, SPT has potential for greatness. Swapping each hand between a shield and guns and assigning each gun a different shooting style while going TRON-Rambo is great fun.\n\nEventually, you ask "When do the enemies get harder?". Much to your chagrin, they don't; just more of them spawn. The core gameplay gets a little stale once you've been fighting increasingly larger waves of the same two drones for 20 minutes. If this game were not VR, it would not be very engaging at all.\n\nAs it stands, SPT holds itself up on a temporary VR crutch. Over time, it will likely evolve into a great game, as the developers clearly understand what VR should encompass. As for the time being, it's certainly worth trying out.","May 22","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only immediate concern that i feel needs to be addressed before any of the add-ons and buttons/whistle updates is a more seamless transistion between second gun and shield.

If you like games like Galaga or Space Invaders, where there is very little variety and the game just gets faster and harder, you will like SPT. However, my problem with SPT, is that there is very little variety. You get the same robots coming at you round after round. There are more robots, they get faster, and they surround you. This game needs different robots, a variance of difficulty on each level, and reasons to use different weapons. Personally, I can barely make it to round 10, and by the time I get there, I'm frustrated and ready to play a different game. As I said, it is fun, but it gets too frantic too quickly. And without any variety, it just becomes an exercise in complete frustration and boredom. Add different robots, vary the difficulty between levels (i.e. not every level NEEDS to be harder than the last level) and this will be a winner. I'm recommending this game with the above conditions, hoping the developer will improve the game.","May 21","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first couple times you play it, it's fun, but you say to yourself "I don't see what the fuss is about."  The next time you have a VR gaming session, you select it thinking "I can beat that last high score I bet."  And then it is over.  That music gets stuck in your head and you sit around all day at work or whatever it is you do all day, thinking about how you're going to get past that next wave or how you're going to string robot kills together to eek out a few more points next time.\n\nIt brings me back to old 80's and 90's arcade games where you finished your game and saw you were in 27th place and saw that the guy in 26th was named "♥♥♥" and was only 50 points ahead of you, so you dropped a couple more dollars in quarters in the game attempting to get above him in the rankings, and the guy at #1 had a score so high you knew for certain he was cheating somehow because there's no way you can be that good at this.  Next time you're at the arcade, you dump 5 bucks in that machine and get in the top ten and realize it's possible.  And every time you're at that arcade or a place that has that game, you dump money in that machine and use the skills you've gained to top the leaderboard....\n\n....with SPT you get all that for the cost of about 4 sessions worth of quarters in an arcade, with a global leaderboard and a leaderboard for just your Steam friends, and you don't have to leave the house.","May 29","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm sure there are comparable games out there for Vive right now, but this is the one I played and I had lots of fun with it.\n\nAs far as I can tell there are several ways to play this. One is the gun+shield way, which is what I'm most comfortable with right now (not quite confident in fast roomscale movements yet). Shooting around the shield, taking cover, ducking with your shield above your head, etc are all very thrilling and immersive. It makes you feel like a total badass.\n\nThe second is dual guns, which really requires you to move around to dodge all the incoming shots. I'm not quite there yet (still a bit afraid of slamming into tables or walls) but this should provide a much more physical experience.\n\nOnly downside is that, as far as I could tell, there's only really one enemy type. Would be great if there were some sort of variation: minibosses, other kinds of enemies, maybe splash damage or other kinds of area weapons, obstacles, etc.\n\nStrongly recommend for anyone with a Vive!","April 9","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/recommended/418650/","thelonesoldier","Cyrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/","188 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSpace Pirate Trainer is definitely enjoyable, although it certainly isn't everything it could be. It's definitely fun and can be pretty addicting, although some of that addictiveness comes from the "arcade" balancing (which I'll get to in a moment).\n\nThere isn't much to the game. You are standing on a landing attached to a building far above the city. Hover drones fly around and shoot at you, and you dodge their shots and shoot back. There are two types of hoverdrones, one that's white and one that's red. I still haven't figured out the difference between them, but I think the red ones fire more shots at once? You have access to several different weapons and can change them at any time, but in practice that feels like window dressing and I expect most people will pick one weapon type they like and never use anything else.\n\nThis game makes good use of the space around you, in that the drones will be flying all over the place in the 180 degree arc in front of you, and occasionally above your head. This adds a fair amount of excitement and challenge but at the same time is perhaps SPT's biggest flaw. The drones fire at random intervals, which can extremely luck-based - if two drones happen to fire at you from opposite directions, you will have a hell of a time dodging both of them. You start out with 3 health and never regenerate any - once you've taken three hits, you die. Every time I die is because a drone shot me from behind - usually while another one is shooting at me from in front, but ocassionally just because I missed the audio cue in all of the commotion. Sometimes I'll sail through several waves with ease because no pair of drones happens to fire simultaneously, while other times I only make it a few waves because they seem committed to synchronized fire. I never seem to make it past wave 10, which represents only a few minutes of play, and that's why I say this is "arcade" balanced. This game 100% feels like it is expecting you to spend quarters on it, like it's designed to hook you in and then kill you unfairly as soon as you really start getting into it. Every time I die I half expect a menu to pop up trying to sell me a Continue.\n\nYou do have the option of replacing one or both of your weapons with shields at any time, and to a certain extent this allows you to block fire from one direction while shooting targets in a different direction. Even so, the shield has a limited size, and sometimes it's not possible to completely deflect the fire from a drone unless you're looking directly at it. Because the Vive will wiggle on your head if you turn too fast, you are limited to how fast you can whip around to face that drone that's shooting you in the back, and it seems like nearly every game I get into a no-win situation.\n\nIt may be there are tactics I haven't picked up on yet, or it may be that the game is designed for a bigger play area than I have and the solution is to run four feet away from where you were standing every time you hear a drone about to shoot, but as it is now I feel like I have too little control over my survival. Of course, the arcadey nature can make the game addicting - if you die in 90 seconds, you want to try again, and since every try is so short you don't realize how much time you're spending on it. However, I feel that this wears thin over time and addiction mutates into frustration.\n\nI want to compare the game to Holopoint, which has very similar core gameplay but with a bow and arrow instead of guns. In Holopoint, the enemies fire less frequently and fewer projectiles; even when things get crazy you are much less likely to get shot at from two directions at once, and your health is reset to 2 at the end of each wave so if a lucky shot hits you in the back, you aren't permanently crippled. Even without a shield, it feels much more "fair" than SPT.\n\nOf course, SPT is still in Early Access, so I hope the game balance will be refined somewhat and there will be less dying from sheer bad luck.","April 14","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is something in this game that let you feel like you are still playing in 2D.\n2) Control - good, the various gun types are well thought and the shield is well made too - there is a tactile feedback that let you feel in the controller the ennemy shots hitting your shield.\n3) Gameplay - ok at first, but awful after a short period : player has 3 lives at the beginning - however, ennemies are shooting rifles with barely 1/10th of second between each shot, and each of these shot will take one life. As a result, you find yourself playing, you have your 3 lives, all is well and suddenly 1/2 of second later, the game is over because there was an ennemy behind you that took your 3 lives all at same time.\n\nThat makes the game interesting at first, but the problem mentionned above will turn gameplay into a boring routine : play a few waves (about 10 minutes), then lose all 3 lives at same time and begin again.

For that reason, the dodge mechanics become very important.\n\nHolopoint requires a fairly significant amount of dodging.  Part of what makes that possible is the single shots coming from bad guys that don't track your movement.  Something shoots, I see it, and move out of the way.  Eventually too many things shoot and I die, but the single shot mechanics "work" for me and keep me active.\n\nWith SPT, I find myself standing still, and just blocking incoming streams of fire with my shield.  I dodge slightly, but because the fire stream tracks my movements, I eventually have a line of fire that intersects with my head no matter where I move.  I suppose I could continually try to avoid that line, but I'm either too lazy or not coordinated enough to do that.  So, I stand, shoot, and block.  and eventually die.  Less fun for me, probably not worth purchasing unless your goal is to exercise 1 arm.\n\nIf there was a way to make incoming fire shoot single shots, I'd probably play a lot more and recommend the game to others.","May 29","false","1.0"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","2"

The dev sure hasn't shown anything off that I'm aware of...) If it gets better, I'll revisit the review.\n\nAs it stands, this game is a monumental rip-off at $15, for the actual content you get. It's the minimum of effort in what a game could be, a tech demo that could be replicated in a week by one person. For 2 to 5 bucks, it might be OK, but when I can buy Jeeboman, which is nearly identical in play style, but is an actual game with progression, checkpoints, variety, balance, and gobs more fun than this yet only costs 10 bucks, why would I bother?\n\nThe weapons are unbalanced to the point of being useless. You'd think the single shot would be more powerful that a shot from the machinegun... but it isn't. So why the heck would I choose single shot, then, when machine gun is far more effective? the same goes for the 3-shot burst mode. Again, no more powerful, why would I use it? Because I'm stupid? The powerup shot that must be charged by holding the trigger is even more of a joke. It's just as hard to hit anything with it, and yet it takes multiple seconds to load each shot. If you want to die quickly, choose this. Ultimately, that leaves the laser beam and the machinegun... but it's easier to hit with the instant laser beam, so again, why would you use machinegun when there is a better option?\n\nAnd to stress again, as it stands on the day I write this, there is NOTHING TO THIS GAME. Die, and you start all the way over with the incredibly boring first waves again, and again, and again. There is one enemy with texture alterations making three of them. There is one gun model that doesn't change based on type of firepower. The shield doesn't work right in the heat of combat, either sticking on or not coming up when you try to deploy it, costing you time, or more likely, your game for your effort of using it.\n\nI remember seeing the demo of this game months and months ago and thinking it looked cool... and now when the Vive launches, the release version is that exact same demo, no changes. The developer has done NOTHING to the game in months and months, and calls it early access. I'd like to believe they'll continue, especially based on the faith Valve seemed to put in them as a featured developer, but I have to judge based on their output right now, and right now it's lazy, simplistic, and above all, boring. Avoid. Holopoint and Jeeboman are far better, and cost less.\n\nBen","April 30","false","1.8"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","1"

Technically it's awesome and a lot of fun at first. Blocking and the weapons all really feel good. But there is really not much content or diversity in it for the money. It's always the same robots and there is only one weapon for achieving high scores. It has some missing audio clues for enemies and you'll probably always die from one volley behind your back and have to restart over.\n\nIt would be unfair to give a negative review, because the developer definitely deserves to be supported.

In my hands are two large pistol shaped weapons which will serve as my means to destroying robot hordes. Each weapon is able to cycle through different firing modes using the touch pads  such as single shot, burst fire, stream or charged shots. In front of me is a large holographic board that displays information such as high scores and other game information.\n\nI start things off by shooting the "lets rock" logo on the holographic menu, everything clears  away and im left standing in the bay alone and vulnerable. I take a quick look around before things start and notice a large spaceship behind me which I can only assume belongs to me, everything about this place feels exactly how you think it should in terms of future space ports. Floating billboards, huge sky full of beautiful stars it really sucks you in on the immersion factor.\n\nI am suddenly greeted by a small orb type robot that flys randomly around in flanking maneuvers but doesn't seem interested in shooting me just yet. I decide not to wait around to see him shoot, I take aim and fire. A solid stream of orange electrified energy spews from both guns into the star filled sky causing a direct hit on the robot and a fiery explosion.\n\nIt feels good, the explosion was awesome and i'm feeling pretty confident with my new guns, bring on wave 2. This time I get a few more bots, I discover that raising my arm over my head causes me to pull out a clear riot shield that is able to deflect incoming enemy fire. The robots fly around me trying to surround and flank. I hear a beeping sound as one of the eyes of the robots lights up and fires. As the lasers approach me time slows down and i'm able to effectively move out of the way or block them with my shield.  After a dance around my space I am able to block and shoot down all the remaining bots.\n\nA few waves later i'm now around 9 or 10 things are getting very tense as the robots are getting smarter and more versatile. They fly under the platform i'm standing on to hide from view then pop up firing when i'm busy with others. I dash, jump crouch and do something close to a matrix dodge but bad enough that Morpheus would facepalm. Finally the bots are able to form an effective circle and all fire at once, I desperately attempt to dodge the incoming attacks but am defeated by rounds to the chest and back.\n\n==================================================\n\n** Graphics/Audio **\n\nEverything in this game is very top notch in the graphics department the detailed flashes from explosions and the clean cut edges of outgoing and incoming lasers just look fantastic.\nThe environment is very well detailed and gives you a true feeling of standing on a platform in space. The lighting on the billboards and animations of the guns all come together perfectly for a stunning combo of arcade like action.\n\nThe audio is also very well done, The heavy sci fi electro beats put you in an almost dancing like state while you shoot, i found myself almost shooting robots to the beat of the music after awhile. That combined with the high quality sound effects of laser fire and robot explosion really put you in the mood for this title.\n\n==================================================\n\n**VR/Comfort**\n\nVery smooth experience and very immersive, I found myself getting right into it within only a few seconds of playing. The fact that your dodging projectiles and constantly re-accessing your environment doesn't really give you a chance to realize that its not reality. Your brain gets tricked into thinking.. ok we have a threat we need to destroy save us now!\n\nI never had any tracking issues and nothing in this game so far has caused any sense of motion sickness very comfortable experience all around.\n\n==================================================\n\n**My Wishlist**\n\nMy only real wishes for this title would to add more weapon selections, the mode fire types are cool but id love to have different modeled gun types as well perhaps that will be coming in future versions.\n\nI think it would be a cool add on to be able to change the color of your blaster fire to a custom choice just for fun.\n\nI would also like to have maybe more levels to choose from and a more variety of enemies to fight. Now this is all stuff i'm sure will be coming in future versions but its definitely something that will be required to keep the audiences fresh with novel content.\n\n==================================================","May 1","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dodge incoming weapons-fire from free flying target drones while trying to dish out your own style of hurt using a multi-mode pistol or a reflective vortex shield in any/either/both hand.

For instance, since my off hand has weaker aim I use the slower pistol with a laser sight to help aim and main hand an incredibly powerful auto-pistol.\n\nCons:\n-Lack of content.

Another short experience but a fun one, and if you are just looking for functional and short fun games, add this to your library!","May 19","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything about it is solid: The UI, visuals, mechanics, options, and gameplay.\nSince it's in early access, I'll mention some improvements that the game could really use.\n\nDifferent types of enemies, and even bosses, would make it MUCH more interesting. There are currently only 2 kinds of enemies, distinguishable by their colors. There could be a boss on one level that, when you deal enough damage to it's main body, it splits up into smaller drones or something.\n\nA way to lock-in your gun and shield-config would be helpful. I've found that I accidentally switch to a gun I don't want, or accidentally bring up a shield in my right hand.\n\nPowerups would be nice, and make people want to spend more time in the game.\n\nIt might be a stretch, but multiplayer would be so so cool. Battling other players would be very fun.\n\nDiffernet environments would be welcome. Right now, there is only one.\n\nDuring gameplay, your crashed ship is parked behind you. It would take a lot of time to implement, but if the player could interact with the ship in some way, it would make gameplay feel more varied. For example, the player could gain a resource after every wave (like 'scrap metal'), and when the player has enough 'scrap metal', they can repair one of the ship's turrets. This turret could then fire at enemies for the next round (or time limit), giving the player an edge.\n\n--------------------------------------------\nThose are just some improvements that I think could be made. I still definitley reccomend this game! It's fair for the price, and very polished.","May 20","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find myself coming back to this game almost every day. Best enjoyed when you have a couple friends with a Vive that you can challenge each other's scores on. The community is also very nice!","June 5","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love it. Seriously, one of the first "wow" experiences I had in VR.
