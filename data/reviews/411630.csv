Running around scaring people can be quite fun. It's not complicated, just gleeful destruction.\n\n\nSo here's the breakdown\nPros:\nEnjoyable mild humor. Very chuckle worthy referenses sprinkled throughout.\n\nLots of growth potential. (see below)\n\nSo-sos:\nThe visuals. Think slightly melted wax Halloween figures. Everything kind of translucent over bright base white forms. Cute but a tad creepy. I like it and think it's pretty, but many won't.\n\nGame play is quite fun.\n\nThere is no voice acting. Slates with dialog and thought bubbles only.\n\nCons:\nClunky controls. Flying is akward. Your aim is shetchy. Between the two a lot of fun depleation carries over as you continue to play.\n\nLittle current available content. Seriously... An easy level, 2 hard levels, and a insane levels are all this game comes with. You'll note my gameplay time. Well that's all it took to play all of the three first levels 3 times through each and try the final level twice (it's just not a fun level and I saw no reason to continue to try and beat it).\n\nThe 3 mapping fails that you run into durring play. One shouldn't usually be able to run through solid objects or fly and fall under the ground. It an anoying glitch that should have been fixed in the programing stage.\n\nThe set up of "I was acused of this. So I'll become this!" plot is just imature nonsense.\n\nThe music gets carinval annoying after a couple mins.\n\nOnly 3 spells given. Which is surprising since within your house there a two huge spell shelves yet all one ever fills is 3 tiny slots on one.\n\n\nBasically overall I get the feeling the game was rushed to completion and lots of content either never made it or is waiting somewhere in the wings.\n\nI'd love to see more levels added and more spells available. Or course I'd love to kick the familair (such an anoying cat) to the moon as well, one does have hopes...\n\nOverall I'd give the game a 6.5 out of 10. I give it a higher number. If I knew for certain more game content was forthcomming or if it had a cheeper price.  There's a lot potentical fun here. A few tweaks (a solid objects are solid!) patch- that's a hint devs). Or just some added content is all it would take to make this a true winner.\n\n\n\nInterested in more reviews like this : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation","February 23","true","1.0"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","25","25","0","0"

The way the characters follow  your cursor with their heads and eyes,  I had them  nodding in time to the music for a few minutes  before I realized I was actually not playing the  game.\n\nThe Cons\n~Still Some glitches with basic things, no sound effects in the opening parts of the game just music... Maybe there is not supposed to be?\n~Unclear on what awards 1,2,or 3 pumpkin completion.\n~I had a major issue with Jumping.  The main one being when you jump right before you decent from the apex of the jump, you just instantly end up on the ground, it makes jumping something you really do not want to do.\n~Developer assumes people have a brain and do not need more instruction.  For those of us that are Undead or simply don't have a brain, or forgot to put it in our heads when we woke up, some simple instructions on how to change spells, etc would be nice.  Although it is pretty easy to figure out Mouse Wheel up or Down or just use the numbers on your keyboard.\n~Would also be nice to have a legend that you can look at to see what keys do what.\n~It is a little unclear on how you get new spells, they just seem to appear.  It would be nice to have to work for them, or to have to achieve certain sub objectives to unlock them, and perhaps there is,  but if so, that is also unclear.\n~To much up time on Broom flying makes it easy to exploit what is mainly ground enemies.\n~All spells are unlimted and do not have a CD. Unlimited ammo would be fine, so would no CD on spells, but when you combine those 2  the game becomes a little easy not having to manage your resources you can just spam everything.\n\nOverall\nWicked Witches is a really fun and refreshing title, It's not to hard, even the hard missions, but it does get challenging.  I really like it when a developer makes something that is "their" game, and they do not try and make it compete with an already over saturated market.   This game definitely feels like something personal to someone, and that alone makes it a great experience.  Who ever came up with the Consept is probably someone I would like to go to a Halloween party , or just hang out in a graveyard with.\n\nThis game is well worth the 10 dollars, If you are not hooked by the time you get to the Salem Mission you'll be hooked once you become notorious and have to defend your own home.\n\nLooking forward to seeing more from Ectoplasm Studio.\n\n~Undead Aaron\nyoutube.com/winterhaltermedia","November 27, 2015","true","7.3"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","24","38","0","0"

It has flavour, aesthetic and enjoyable game play mechanics with childrens fairy tales from a sinister perspective.\n\nHowever, it feels very unpolished for being released, there is a lot of UI bugs, multiple grammatical errors in scripting (Grammer nazis be warned) and the narrative plot seems very.... bare. Quite simply, it has a quick and understandable backstory, but a lot of the plot feels more like "I don't like this, destroy that", but this game is about vengeance aganinst the world so why not destroy everything.\n\nTo Praise:\n- well thought out environment features, destructible buildings and morphable environments\n- fun character & weapon design\n- every little detail the game devs worked on\n\nThings of note:\n- again, UI errors, some grammer issues in script...\n- some effects like the building destruction fire can cause serious lag when enmasse, AKA The Witch of Bellechasse level with three towns, lots of destroyed buildings fires = lots of CPU used creating lag\n- unit damage ratios and health, it's usually easy to die, implementing a difficulty setting that affects health and damage ratios wouldn't hurt the game for different player types.\n\nOverall, this game gets a praise from me as it was just plain silly fun and I had a blast playing through destroying the peasant rabble. Definantly worth a play for gamers that like the reverse role and want to see the world BURN!!!\n\nSee how we did here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5IMBmwI3bM","November 27, 2015","true","4.3"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

Besides the fact that this game has a lot of ideas that appeal to me, I wanted to support a game that is so clearly an underdog.\n\nThis game has some terrific concepts, fun ideas, and charm. Except there's one issue with it: it's not finished.\nI think the devs have some great ideas and a solid foundation to build something extraodinary on. "flawed but fun" is a very very generous way to describe this game. It's easy. There's no challenge. Spells have no cooldowns, enemies have no weaknesses/strengths to adapt to - so just pick wichever spell you want to, and spam it until everything's dead. Chances are, you won't die in the process.\n\nBugs. Bugs galore. Enemies getting stuck in things. Floating enemies running on the spot continuously. flying and randomly getting stick in a tree that visually wasn't there a second ago. scream points that won't collect (spoiler: they need to be collected) movement and jump animations look broken. Granted, the controls are pretty tight, but everything still looks disjointed.\n\nThat this game has so few reviews but most of them are positive, is highly suspect.\n\nOne look at the forum, and seeing the complete lack of response from the devs from questions tells me one thing: this game is as it is and won't be any more than that. Which is a SHAME because with a bit more polish, balance, and detail, this could have been great.\n\nBut I honestly don't feel it's fair to sell this as a completed game when it so clearly isn't. There are good ideas here, and while the execution isn't poor, it's not finished. And honestly, who wants to play a game where your dominant thought is "what could have been..." instead of enjoying the actual game you're playing. I pay for a product, not potential. And I write this with the consumer in mind.\n\nI will be refunding this. in a few months or so, if they've updated and fixed this game at all, I'd consider purchasing it again. But something tells me this game will stay as it is. I hope I'm proven wrong.","January 3","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076346059/recommended/411630/","76561198076346059","inside_joke","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076346059/","168 products in account","Wicked Witches, developed by Ectoplasm Studios, is a third-person shooter in which players take on the role of a witch (obviously). After being falsely accused of witchcraft, our heroine is banished from her village. In retaliation, she decides to become a REAL witch, heart-set on stealing the lives from those who stole hers. On paper, this sounds like a promising concept.  It isn’t often we get to rewrite some of history’s oldest fairy tales. Only this time, you’re the villain.\n\nHowever, despite the appealing premise, I had built up some general expectations. It’s clearly intended for younger audiences, but that doesn’t give ANY game the excuse for poor quality. For example, look at the first LEGO games. Whether you’re ten or thirty-two, it can be enjoyed by anyone. So, pandering to a demographic that isn’t my own doesn’t give this game the benefit of the doubt, at least not in this case.\n\nWe’ll start with graphics. I’d call them mediocre at best. It’s got this odd design I can only compare to papier-mâché.  Thankfully, this game is flushed with colors (for the most part), which makes up for the… uncomfortable character models. They aren’t bad, just… uncomfortable. It’s really the best way I can describe it. Looking at them for too long makes me fidget in my seat.\n\nBut, as you probably know, video games aren’t worth a bucket of warm spit without proper gameplay, and my first impressions of Wicked Witches weren’t half bad. You’re primary goal is to kill as many villagers as possible as you complete your various objectives. It plays like a horde shoot em’ up, and it’s a pretty satisfying experience… at first.\n\nThere's are multiple spells to unlock, different abilities to master, and to top it off, you can even fly about on your broomstick! Raining fiery meteors of destruction down on fleeing villagers really instills a feeling of power. You’re also capable of “enchanting” certain objects throughout each level. These vary from trees to graveyards to unicorns. Whatever the player enchants will help them on the battlefield. Building up an army of monstrous trees and undead skeletons is pretty cool.\n\nSo, after all this praise, you might be wondering why I’m giving this game and thumbs down. Well, here’s why. Despite its achievements, Wicked Witches is tremendously flawed. All the gameplay mechanics mentioned previously are repeated throughout the entirety of this game. You’ll be spamming the left mouse button for the duration of each level, wiping out mindless waves of enemies in a cycle that has no end. Spells hardly vary from one another, as they all work identically; whether it’s exploding pumpkins, cauldrons or meteors, they all provide the same damage and outcome.\n\nClipping is a serious issue. Enemy projectiles will soar directly through structures, and same goes for your own projectiles. Hell, if you really want to, hop on your broomstick and faze through just about anything! It’s INCREDIBLY lazy game design.\n\nLastly, I want to talk about the writing, and oh my god, you will cringe like you’ve never cringed before. It’s one of those things you’ll have to see to believe. I’ll spare you the details, but the term “LOL” is used quite often. Yeah, it’s THAT bad.\n\nIf you’re over the age of twelve and plan on buying Wicked Witches for your own amusement, I say pass. There are a lot more enjoyable things you can do with your time. If you’re looking for a game to give your kid, this isn’t the worst choice, but trust me, you’re kid deserves better.","May 27","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
