Upon it's launch, it was apparent that the Total War series had something different to offer to fans of Turn Based Grand Strategy games. In time, it would become known as one of, if not, the best Total War games ever made. You might ask yourself why out of all the newer Total War games is Rome the best? Well, there's several simple reasons.\n\nPros:\n- Simple design, as it is one of the first TW games\n- Large, sprawling cities to battle in, but not too detailed so as to distract the player.\n- The single best Soundtrack you will find in any TW game.\n- Large map, but not on a ludacris scale such as Rome II.\n- Great choice of factions\n- Campaign and battle map look beautiful\n- This game can be played smoothly at its highest settings on any modern computer\n- Massive replay value\n\nCons:\n- [post suggestions in the comment area]\n\nOverall:\nRome is a nice and simple, beautifully crafted game. It is what CA was praised for in the Total War series. Rome II is way more technical with a great deal more to learn Honestly, the inlons about this game. Just as I have, almost all major and indie critics have given this game a 9/10, 95%, 4.5/5, etc. This was also given "14th Greatest Game of All Time" apparently and I do think it deserves it.\n\n10/10","June 3, 2015","true","202.6"," 159 of 168 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","159","168","6","19"

I am part of the Glorious Roman Republic, sharing with three other factions; the blue Scorpios (I think) who have decided to take a couple of islands and then the big parts of Africa. The green Brutii, who decided that looking ridiculous would best show the Greeks what's what. And I, wearing fantastically imperial red, who was tasked with sorting out the dirty Gauls.\n\nI quickly began a conquest that would put the Black Templars to shame, sending out army after army, conquering town after town. They tried to resist, but my men were worth two of theirs, and my men outnumbered their three to one. As we came, we took most of them slaves, built up my core towns, built as many temples to convince more people to shag as possible, and continued on our merry murdering way.\n\nOccasionally, the Guals or Brittony or Germans would manage to scrape together an entire army of 2000 people. These were the battles I, and my family, were born for. We smashed together, blood and sword and sinew, as my Velites threw their spears overhead, and cavalry quickly hit them from behind. Few enemies died facing us in the north, many ran and most died with sword wounds in their backs rather than face us.\n\nWe tried peace once, and we paid the price with roman lives. When they begged for our mercy, they found only our gladius. We heard the lamentations of their women as they were taken back to mighty Arretium, our capital city. And how it had grown; on the back of slaves and the glory of our men, we raised great arenas and temples to show our glory! We raised great barracks to train our men! We grew the greatest of men to enforce our will! And the north of Europe was stained red with blood; the map of Europe was stained red with our flags.\n\nWe found that land ran out quickly; Europa gave way before our bloodlust did, and we turned to look back. We were disgusted with what we saw. Corruption. Weakness. Our supposed equals made peace with the savages, our supposed superiors hide behind the walls of Rome. They whispered of treachery, but we knew weakness and corruption when we saw it. The spineless Scorpios had no trouble gaining the favour of the Senate; spending more time on their knees in glorious Rome than sword in hand over Carthage. The Brutii failed to live up to their brutish name; content with a paltry pile of sand, growing fat and lazy as we had grown lean and numerous in both flesh and glory.\n\nWe recalled our armies to home, to the swell of the crowds. They chanted our name, and spat at the mentions of the Senate. All had been united under our banner; did not the Celts and Gauls and Germans and Thrycians alike not bend the knee to the glorious Romans, all beneath the bloody red banner of the Julii? Mars had made his favour clear; he doesn't favour cowards, and Jupiter didn't let the weak rule. We built temples in His Name, and spread his name further than even the diplomats know. All that was left was to follow the glory given to us, under the gaze of the gods and cheers of the people, we marched the final path.\n\nAll roads lead to Rome.","December 11, 2015","true","25.8"," 106 of 110 people (96%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","96","106","110","39","0"

So, the battle graphics are not as crisp as newer titles, the historicity of some units is sketchy (or just made up), and it seems that multiplayer is not smooth in Steam.  Fortunately, none of these mean a thing to me.  The heart of the game is in the grand strategy and the personal narrative.\n\nWith over a hundred regions in which to play, the strategic game is where RTW shines. You need to plan where you will expand and where you will defend... and then be ready to adapt when the AI does not do what you expect. You may be the pawn of the Senate and serve at their beck and call.  You might try to expand against the weak.  You can follow the trade routes to gain riches through conquest.  You will find yourself occupying regions merely to stymie your enemies (and your allies). Or you might work your way towards all seven Wonders to reap their benefits.\n\nThe twenty factions all fall into one of the major religio/cultural groupings. Some conquered peoples will not like your religion, but a few might. Some conquered peoples will happily accept you as overlord because you share the same cultural values... and the Spanish clans just don't like anyone. Some factions have great infantry, some have cavalry, and some do many things well.  Yet, you can usually find mercenaries (disgruntled locals, rival tribes, or thugs) who might fill the holes in your army.\n\nYes, most negative reviews harp on about the lag in multiplayer and the poor graphics in battles.  If you need gratuitous violence or managing pixels in a free for all, then watch Mad Max: Fury Road or play League of Legends. If you want to make decisions that will impact your dominion fifty turns down the road, then this game can give it to you.  What kind of temples will you build in each region... or should you let the people keep their native religion?  Will a town become a recruiting station or a cash cow?  When you conquer a region, you'll have to decide to either just incorporate it into your lands as is, relocating half the people by enslaving them, or just slaughtering most of the inhabitants and stealing their goods.... and you'll find yourself using each throughout the campaign, because one size does not fit all.\n\nAnd guess what?  I don't fight the battles.  If I did, I'd never finish a campaign.  I hit the auto calculation button every time.  Why?  Well... there are a number of positions which you will fulfill in a game.  Benevolent multi-generational spirit guiding your family, governor of a province, Commander in Chief, general of an army, and captain of a unit. Playing all of these breaks the narrative for me... I play the macro game, i.e. the big picture.  I plot and scheme, I build cities, and recruit armies.  Then I send them out into the field.  How they do is up to them.  If they win... great! I must be a genius.  If they lose... nuts. Back to the drawing board.\n\nTwo friends of mine, let's call them Doc and Bro, played RTW like this... Doc played the campaign map, i.e. he decided what units were built and where the battles were fought, but Bro fought all the battles.  Doc was the CinC and Bro was the General.  They played two campaigns in three years, but they remember both as epic stories of their teamwork.\n\nIn addition to the war... campaign strategy, building armies, transportation of armies, theatres of conflict, fog of war, etc... you'll have to deal with natural disasters, (In one game, a young woman of my family married a promising young fellow, but he died a year later in an earthquake.), piracy, rebellions, brigands, bribery attempts upon your armies, old age, death in battle, adoptions, plagues (stupid unwashed barbarians), and assassination. (In one game, the youngest son of my German leader was sent to subdue Gaul and Hispania. This gave him a command of 10.  I marched him and his elite German veterans across the Alps to conquer Rome... but the Romans assassinated him.  With my hordes leaderless, the Romans proceeded to sieze Gaul and invade Germania.) All of these additional factors help create a unique narrative for each game.\n\nOh, and when you play as a Roman faction, you'll need to keep an eye upon the Senate... how they view you, how the plebs (the masses) view you, Senatorial missions, and the official Senatorial stance with every other faction. For instance, you may have a great trade agreement with the Egyptians and a low standing with the Senate, but the Sentate demands that you attack Egypt... attacking Egypt will hurt your income considerably, but offending the Senate may cause them to label you as a rebel... what will you do?\n\nCertain events always happen... Aetna erupts and the plague breaks out in Macedonia, but certain other events happen only when certain triggers occur (the Marian reforms), while others, such as floods, are random.  But the big event for Roman players is the Civil War.  At some point the plebs will want you to deal with the Senate and/or at some point the Senate will either have enough of you or become paranoid of your growing power that they'll demand the head of your family to commit suicide.  If you agree, they'll do it every turn until your family ceases to exist.  If you're not ready for war, then you can comply with the Senate for a few years (and prune your family tree of bad apples in the process), but at some point you'll have to stand up to the Senate... at which point you go to war with all other Romans.  Talk about raising your anxiety.... sheesh!\n\nAll of your characters really flesh out the narrative... the story of your family.  Spies, diplomats, assassins, admirals, generals, and governors all have character traits that make them who they are.  Some will be drunkards, perverts, and ne'er do wells, while some will be loyal, moral, and cunning.  They'll also tend to generate a following of hangers on, freeloaders, men of honor, mistresses, etc...  For instance, a son might come of age in your family with a command of 3... a natural born general... but on his way to the frontier to defeat the Dacians, his inner circle grows to include a Drunken Uncle and an Actor and they decrease his command ability by 3... Ouch!  He's now a zero...\n\nIn the first two Total War games, Shogun and Medieval, you had family members, but not nearly as many as Rome.  So to help you manage them (and for the sheer fun of telling a story), RTW includes a family tree.\n\nThe game's not perfect.  The legendary/semi-mythological units can be frustrating and the Egyptians were certainly not using chariots in the second century BC. Naval combat results can make you scratch your head.  Negative income numbers on the campaign map are definitely misleading. There is always the point at which you know you've won even though you may only be forty to seventy percent of the way to the finish... but that's true of a lot of games.\n\nThere may be other games out there that have made improvements to the grand strategy game, but I've always found this one to be fun to return to.","July 18, 2015","true","197.6"," 90 of 92 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","90","92","9","0"

For it's time, it was without a doubt one of, if not the greatest, strategy games of all time. However, comparing it to newer Total Wars,(except for ROME II, that is something else entirely) it lacks in several things, notably historical accuracy, diplomacy, and managing your government. For one, in historical accuracy, there are multiple nations(like Gaul, Spain, Greece, etc.) that are unified nations even though in real life they were a divided people, with seperate clans, city states, etc. but for some reason CA mashed a lot of city states and tribes together to form unified nations, which is complete bogus. Also, in historical accuracy, Egypt is not Hellenistic at ALL. They still have traditional Egyptian Paganism as their religion, and their units are traditional Egypitan ones, even though Egypt was now practically a Middle Eastern copy of Greece thanks to Alexander the Great. In diplomacy, there are very few options(some examples are trade rights, allaince,  map info, etc.) and, therefore, made diplomacy lose it's immersion. Finnaly, there is governemnt. For Roman factions, the Republic government is fairly adequately displayed, but in general, there really is no "government system" like in Empire Total War, although there is a family tree where you can set the faction heir, adding a bit of spice to government. If we put those those things aside, you will find a true classic of a strategy game-and I'm pretty sure most people here would agree with me. In a time where graphics made people look like horrible mutants, AI was as smart as your neighborhood stray dog, and strategy games lacked a lot of actual strategy, this game was revolutionary. The graphics, although considered inferior to today's games, probably looked really great to a lot of players back in 2004.  The jump from the previous Total War, Medieval, to Rome's graphics was absoultely stunning. The AI (which, to be honest, is not very much smarter than the neighborhood stray)  is competent despite occasional errors. Diplomacy, while lacking in true immersion, added a new level of strategy to games, as a system with more than just basic alliance/trade/war was pretty much only used in previous Total Wars and a few other grand strategy games, and even then it was really basic. And government, while being very basic, also adds to the strategy of the game, as you scramble to find a sutiable heir for your glorious (or, more often than not, not-so-glorious) empire. Speaking of empires, there are 20 factions, with about half of them playable, half not playable. Technically, there is a 21st faction, the Rebels. The rebels not only represent actual rebels, which I am perfectley ok with, but they also represent "minor factions" that CA left out of the game, which is kinda sloppy to me. However, all-in-all, the campaign is sound, if perhaps a tad disappointing to modern gamers. Now..on to battles. It is not possible to manage a nation without going to war, and this game certainly does not oppose that fact. You will end up in countless battles, usually with random weaklings who think they are better than you, but you will often find yourself matched against a worthy foe. If it is a land battle, you can do one of three things-Fight the battle out on a battle map, have the computer auto resolve the battle, or retreat. For naval battles, you only have the auto resolve option. For the battle map, you and everyone involved-whheter or not they are on your side-will command various units that can be trained in cities if you have the proper buildings. You command these soldiers to victory-or defeat-against the enemy. I personally belive CA did a great job on the battle mechanic of the game.\n\nIf you like Total War games, strategy games in general, video games in general, or if you like life, then buy this game. Even if you don't like life, still buy it.

Rome: Total War is set during the timeline of the Roman Republic to its transition into the Roman Empire.\n\nRome: Total War gameplay can be overwhelming for newcomers but its not hard to master the gameplay. First you can only play as Rome, choose one of three Roman royal family. You start on the campaign map with some settlement where you can expand it, train troops, train a diplomat and build your empire. You can engage in diplomacy with other faction such as the Greeks, Egypt or Gaul, make alliances or declare war. When it comes to battle, you can choose to auto resolve the battle if you outnumber the enemy or engage the fight in the battlefield where you will command your troops. This is the best part where you command hundreds or thousands of Roman Legion and Auxiliaries support to fight the Greek Hoplites or the barbarian army and watch them kill each other. Each army can be commanded by a general which will improve the army morale and increase the auto resolve chance of winning. Each general has some skill bonuses that can improve army or improve settlement when they become the governor. As General takes part in battle, their skill bonuses will improve.\n\nRome: Total War is quite addicting to play. When you're done playing with Rome, other faction can be unlocked and then you can play as them. Then you can instead fighting Rome and defeat the greatest empire ever exist in history. The graphics may be old, and some technical issues may occur on newer system, but the game is more than playable. I recommend this.\n\nRating 8/10","January 5, 2014","true","29.6"," 100 of 110 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","100","110","0","1"

An absolute classic!\n\nThis game is a mix between turn based strategy (on the world map) and real-time strategy (on the battle map)\n\n8/10 Macro mechanics - you can manage your cities, conquer, develop and train your armies\n\n10/10 Micro mechanics - the feelings of managing thousands of units on the battlefields adds both realism and grandeur to battles. Tactical decisions are what wins fights. Positioning and good decisions that are not necesarily split decisions make the clashes immensly fun. DON'T YOU DARE use auto-resolve. You'll miss out on a lot.\n\n7/10 Graphics, because it's dated. Newer versions of the Total War series like Medieval 2, Shogun and the new Rome coming out have better graphics if that's what you're looking at, altough you shouldn't pay attention to the graphics.\n\nLearning curve isn't steep at all. Modding scene has some goodies in store afaik. Never tried multiplayer but it has to be tons of fun.\n\nIt's an AMAZING game. It's like a middle ground between games like Civilization and Age of Empires and everyone should at least try it.","August 17, 2013","true",""," 87 of 93 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","87","93","0","0"

I've heard some good and some bad things about the sequel to this game, Rome II, so i figured i might try and review this one instead.\n\nI realize there's alot of TBS games kinda similar to this out there, but by some miracle i found my way through all those rip-offs and half bad ones, and found my way to this. Anyways, let's get to it\n\nNow even though this game might not have the best graphics, it's a good quality game, the game runs very smooth on even the worst of computers, I experienced a surprisingly few number of glitches and flaws. Also this game variates a lot more than you’d think, the terrain and weather and basically all the nature, and even soldiers surrounding the battlefield has an effect on the battle itself, and it manages to create a somewhat realistic atmosphere.\n\nYou start of by choosing between a rich number of factions to play as, and each faction has their own abilities, starting points, diplomatic and offensive advantages, and of course they all are different difficulties. Now when you start you can also choose different campaign lengths and modes, but the ultimate goal, is to conquer the world. Even after you’ve reached your goal, and have gotten the “You Beat The Game!” message, there’s a lot to do.\n\nNow the game doesn’t have many tracks to get you humming along, in fact it has a couple of tracks running in the background, and some music to set the mood for a fight, but that’s in the rough it, and that’s one of the things letting this game a bit down in my opinion.\n\nTo sum up, this game has a great costumization ability, and is good for a replay, or even two (to all the rome fanatics xD) not the best graphics or music but all in all, I give this an 7/10","April 12, 2014","true","112.4"," 116 of 134 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","116","134","0","6"

Exploring the ways of historical battle as finely and closely as it does is rare, and only some years after its first installment (Shogun) did the videogame industry begin to shoot similar titles.\n\nAfter the legendary Medieval, not many people believed that, apart from a change of setting to a different historical moment, a considerable amount of different content would come up. Then Rome shouted: you're wrong.\nThis game brings pretty much every element of real-time strategy and tactics to the table: city development, troop development and upgrade (besides restoration of battered troops), a ranking system for experienced details that smells pleasantly like Total War spirit, and a turn-based diplomatic conflict and tension only rivaled by the Civilization series, in my opinion.\n\nRome does have its flaws, mainly related to in-battle bugs and primary AI, but its general brilliance is undeniable. Total War lovers meet RTS lovers in this game, as we witness the rise of Rome from the eyes of three powerful political strata of the Roman Empire (houses Brutii, Julii, and Scipii), besides several pagan tribes from central and eastern Europe - some of which you can control after the main campaign has been finished -, as well as northern Africa. A complete set of compelling diplomatic progress is also displayed in Rome (you can constantly set up family alliances, strengthening the power of military stations in cities you control through the maturing of new generals and governors), as well as completude of technological upgrades, and plurality of maps for different battle strategy tastes, from snowy forests of Northern Germany to Spanish plains to Eastern European rocky hills.\n\nRome: Total War puts you right into the heat of pre-medieval belli, the moments of Roman rise and fall, the pressure from the outside and from the inside. Intrigues, military management, civil complexities, and territorial tension.","May 24, 2014","true","21.6"," 64 of 68 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","64","68","0","0"

Taking place in the late Roman Republic, you assume control of one of three Roman families vying for power. Depending on which family you select, the Senate will usually direct you against one of three adversaries - the Greeks, the Gauls, or the Carthaginians. The beautiful thing about Total War, however, is you can simply ignore the Senators and go on a campaign of your own... Egyptians? Invade them! Is the Senate demanding you join in on the war against the Macedon, but you'd rather become allies? Go for it! Just make sure you keep a home guard, because Civil War is a constant threat!\n\nIt has been almost ten years since Rome's release. It hasn't aged terribly bad - the AI is somewhat atrocious, the graphics are dated, but the game is still genuinely satisfying. At the price Rome goes for during Steam's seasonal sales, there's really no excuse NOT to give this game a try.

When Rome Total War was released I didn't buy it, didn't play it. Turn based sounded boring, I wanted real-time because that was cool. So when did I first play it? After Rome 2 was announced, I wanted to play with the ancient world but release was still months away. Then the release was utter garbage. Thus I turned to Rome Total War.\n\nSo lets start with the TL;DR part.\nGood: The feel of combat. It's not fast, a bit to slow but formations collide.\nGood: Size, this game is huge. Large amount of provinces as well as factions. Improvement over Shogun 2, stuck in Japan.\nGood: Atmosphere, Senate missions as Rome, three seperate factions. Lots of different other factions too.\nGood: Mods, mods, mods. There some excellent mods out there for this game.\n\nBad: Graphics, the graphics sure aged. Then again it's an old 3D game, they rarely age well.\nBad: AI, AI isn't the smartest. The game is easily gamed, then again newer Total War's still are.\nBad: Egypt. Egypt was greek at the time, not pharaohs, well not styled like the rulers of old. Just graphics but I'll mention it anyway.\nBad: Resolution, no real widescreen support and no 1080p at all. Highest I can get is 1600x1400.\n\nSo should I still get it? Well it's different for sure. I got into it after I played Medieval 2, Empire, Shogun 2 and Fall of the Samurai. I could make the journey back and was pleasantly suprised. On the other hand my main gaming PC wasn't very available at the time and I played mostly on a laptop. So older games was something I was stuck with either way.\n\nGive it a shot if you like ancient history, a slower strategy game and long battles. If you like historical accuraccy give Europa Barborium a spin. From a pure gameplay perspective it has an overwhelming amount of units, recruitment, moving and battles take ages but it's sure authentic.\n\nThis is a great game, it has aged but not to much. It's deep but not to deep and I'm sort of sad the path Total War games have been taken lately. Still we can go back to this and I recommend you do that.","September 23, 2014","true","101.9"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","33","35","0","7"

So instead I will put a recipe for pancakes.\n\n\\n\n\n\nMakes: 4 to 6 servings\n\nTime: 20 minutes\n\nIt’s amazing how quickly you can whip up this batter.  Store it, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.  Adjust the consistency of the batter with either more milk or more flour as you like. Recipe from How to Cook Everything.\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon sugar (optional)\n2 eggs\n11/2 to 2 cups milk\n2 optional tablespoons melted and cooled butter, plus\nunmelted butter for cooking, or use a neutral oil like\ngrapeseed or corn\n1. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat while you make the batter.\n2. Mix together the dry ingredients. Beat the eggs into 11/2 cups of the milk, then stir in the 2 tablespoons cooled melted butter if you’re using it. Gently stir this mixture into the dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten the flour; don’t worry about a few lumps. If the batter seems thick, add a little more milk.\n3. Use a little butter or oil each time you add batter, unless your skillet is truly nonstick. When the butter foam subsides or the oil shimmers, ladle batter onto the griddle or skillet, making any size pancakes you like.  Adjust the heat as necessary; usually, the first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches. The idea is to brown the bottom in 2 to 4 minutes, without burning it. Flip when bubbles appear in the center of the pancakes and the bottoms are cooked; they won’t hold together well until they’re ready.\n4. Cook until the second side is lightly browned, a couple more minutes, and serve or hold on an ovenproof plate in a 200°F oven for up to 15 minutes.\n\n","March 26, 2015","true","74.2"," 176 of 269 people (65%) found this review helpful 268 people found this review funny","65","176","269","268","2"

The gameplay may seem complicated at first, But you can absorb as much of the campaign map and battles works by playing the tutorial. Throughout the game you can also enable the tips of AI that will enhance learning. The enemy AI is good, although sometimes it may seem very easy on the lower difficulties. The main focus of the game are the battles,  so the diplomatic  and political party is not as well addressed, nevertheless I did not miss this factor.\n\nThe graphics are outdated but still perfectly playable, the sound quality is magnificent, as well as Hellenistic soundtrack, the speeches of generals before battle is a small detail but shows how much the developers have applied to the game, they are exciting! The Total War series has a solid fan base, it is possible to find many mods that improve, enhance and add replay value to the game. The expansion Barbarian Invasion is a good choice to play under another historical perpective.\n\nThe downside is that are technical problems that an old game shows, especially in newer OS. I lost a save that was corrupted in a campaign well advanced, it was very sad. Once you learn to play well, the AI also seems to be limited in combat and especially in the campaign, making it easy to match. But certainly this game deserves attention of those who enjoy history and a good strategy game.\n\n8/10","December 30, 2013","true","43.0"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","0"

After years of the same things over and over again, strategy games with only campaigns and no war, sitting and waiting for this mechanic or that to play itself out, games that made the GUI a bit messier and called it depth, features that just made the same stuff a bit more Heath Robinson and called it progress and innovation, battles where you watched columns of numbers, or 7-8 little RTS guys bip and bop for 30 seconds until the game told you who won... Total War brought in a tactical scope with depth to it, actual battlefields where real time decision-making and some sensible tactical considerations played roles, and where the clash was a grand spectacle. In one fell swoop, this series revitalized the genre, indeed carved out its own genre - strategy games where real time wargaming is actually a thing.\n\nThen, some time into the series, this game - this beautiful, beautiful game came along. Not content with what they'd achieved already, they made a game so good it broke the mould. Not content with creating their own groundbreaking genre, they then pushed further.\n\nIt might have aged now, and it isn't such a surprising, groundbreaking thing now as it was back then, and it has its warts and annoyances (like all of the games in the series) but I still have to say that for me, this is possibly the best computer game ever made. Certainly one of the best.\n\nAlso, it is a great family game, as long as the subject matter is ok for your tribe, we have had many years of fun out of these games. It is not bloody and gratuitous at all, although obviously war is violent in itself.\n\nThere is nothing else that does computer wargaming like the Total War series, and this is the glorious pinnacle of it. 100/10","February 13","true","14.4"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","26","26","0","3"

Hands down, no competition. It is old, but I've yet to see any other strategy game come close to this. The graphics are decent, considering its age. The gameplay is complex enough to not be bored and just steamroll through everything, yet simple enough to actually know how to use every feature this game has to offer.\n\nThe game is basically you controlling a faction during the time of the Roman Republic, and trying to become the best nation. Diplomacy is simple and allies will betray you constantly, unless you would just completely dominate them (and even then, they still might attack you!) The AI is pretty simple to defeat, their entire strategy seems to be just throwing all of their units at you and seeing who wins.\n\nThe challenges come when you get into the Roman Civil War. This is an in-game event where the 4 roman factions fight each other for control of Rome. Up until this point, you've just been steamrolling through barbarians with your heavy legionnaires. Once the Civil War starts, you're fighting 3 other roman factions (2 of which have just as much land as you if not more, each) and they have the same troops as you. If you're not playing a roman faction then this will never happen, but it's called ROME total war for a reason.\n\nIf you're into strategy games, buy this game. Even if you're not, you should at least give it a try. The controls might be difficult to use at first, but the tutorial is very helpful. You will probably lose your first few campaigns, but once you get the hang of the game it will be so much fun.","December 21, 2014","true","660.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

This game is a turn-based strategy game where you take command the various factions during the Roman Era as you command, build, govern and attack Rome's enemies.\n\nThe battle system unlike the system you will see in the modern day versions of the game is really simplistic. Sort of like an almost modern update of Imperial Glory. Now of course, the usual complaint would be "OMG the game is too hard" or "OMG the online players are wrecking me" Luckily the game has an in-depth tutorial plus you have all the time in the world as this game offers various combat both historical and custom made as you polish your skills in battle. And also being a leader of Rome.\n\nThe advisor system is really helpful as they give advice towards the player. DO NOT turn it off if your new. Keep that option for advisor input set to "High". Plus the User Interface for manging your territory and what not is simplistic as well.\n\nNow bewarn, save often. Some of the daily tasks that the senate assigns you don't really give you concrete directions. For some of them it's a simple click of the "zoom in towards target location" while others it's "Find this city" and your just like "Um okay...WHERE?!" some of these tasks are important as it may further your position in the Roman government.\n\nIf you still want a simplistic Total War game this is for you.","June 26, 2015","true","4.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

For over a year, it was the only game other than Spore and the contents of the Orange Box. Five years later, I still go back to it every now and then. I've had many a 14-hour marathon day playing Rome Total War, quite often back to back. I'm pretty sure I got a chance to play as every civilization before I switched computers and lost my progress. I've even gone through the Barbarian Invasion campaign a few times. Honestly, if I'd never bought Civ V, I'd have well over 1,000 hours racked up by now.\nThis is strategy at its purest. Not only do you have the strategy of "How do I move around my armies and generals and funds to best maintain and expand my empire?" you also have the battles themselves. Many games do only one or the other, and those games can go hang. I'm not going to go into detail about the games mechanics and why they're good or bad; instead, I'm going to regale you with but a few of the ridiculous stories that have come out of my 800+ hours.\n*My British faction leader, supported by two other armies, slaughters a quarter of the entire Brutii force over ten years, littering Poland with heroic victories. He eventually meets his end, known as "the Legendary," defending a town against a Roman force three times his size. Succesfully.\n*An elite squad of Berserkers sacrifice themselves on the walls of Rome itself, eliminating two entire legionary cohorts and flanking the wall's other defenders.\n*Four hoplite units hold Sparta against a full-size Roman army, earning a 100:1 k:d ratio.\n*My prize Egyptian army meets a humiliating defeat at the hands of Ponitc troops, navigates around the army, and marches straight into a Pontic city.\n*A Roman town is betrayed by Spain's finest, throws them off every year for three years until reinforcements can come in and ravage Spain's western coast.\n*A Carthaginian gambit to take Rome early fails miserably; a generation later, we're back with five armies that now include line-ravaging Armored Elephants.\n*Betraying Rome by landing an army next to her city - as well as every other non-Brutii city on the peninsula, and bloackading every Roman port east of Palma.\n*Falling in love with my faction heir, as he's my only general who can fight at night. He later on earns three bonus command stars at night, and sacks Constantine by the light of the moon.\nIt's a glorious game, one with an infinite supply of stories.

Being 11-years old, as well as having several newer titles in the Total War series, Rome: Total War considerably shows it's age; However, with that being said it is still a fun, interesting game in the overall series. The game takes place prior to the middle ages, After the fall of the Roman Republic, during the Early Roman Empire. As is typical with the Total War series, You start off with a small number of player factions to choose, in this case 3, and unlock additional factions as playable once you conquer them.\n\nAlso as is typical of a Total War game, gameplay is divided between the real-time battles when in combat, and the turn-based actions of exploration, nation-building, and diplomacy. Rome: Total War has been consistently rated as one of the highest games throughout the Total War Series, based on IGN, Metacritic, and GameRankings, and has a large following, as well as many player-made mods. Despite it's age, Rome: Total War is a strategy game any fan of the Total War series should have.","June 26, 2015","true","0.6"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","24","34","2","4"

As it was expected, it was a game of epic-scale real-time battles and impressive attention to historical realism and detail.\nShogun was a promising start for the series, while Medieval built on that promise to create an even more engrossing strategy game. Rome took the next step, and it was as much a revolutionary step as it was an evolutionary one, thanks to the at the time new 3D graphics engine that made the series' tactical battles (featuring thousands of soldiers) better than ever.\nThe results were nothing short of spectacular, helping make Rome: Total War the very definition of an epic strategy game and a beloved classic of the gaming industry.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437320119 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=439179739","May 8, 2015","true","99.6"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

Everybody just gets archers and camps in one place until other players get bored and try to attack but they are then in a losing position. AI is dumb, it plays terribly on campaign map, attacking with only a few units an entire army, leaving cities defenseless and in battle mode they just rush at you blindly, except horse archers who only harass you and run away and you have to chase them across entire map, which is extremely frustrating as it takes a long time.\n\nHowever, even with its shortcomings, it's a good game, and it can be much better with modifications, especially with a great Europa Barbarorum mod that makes the game way more interesting.\n\nIs it worth getting today? Or should you just play other Total War game?\nIt is definitely worth getting for Europa Barbarorum, just like Medieval II is worth getting just for Broken Crescent mod. Otherwise... not so much, as the vanilla campaign is much better in ie. Shogun Total War, and the AI tends to be much less frustratingly annoying and dumb there too.","April 21","true","58.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

After downloading and running it I went through a tutorial that taught me how to push buttons, and then I began the campaign. I started as the great Roman house of Julli, and began my great campaign.\nAfter pushing north to the alps, driving out the Gauls, I made peace with the nearby empires. The Gauls had been raiding me on occasion, and I had always beaten them back. Things seemed to be going well, until I asked to buy a city the Gauls owned. Now, of course, I offered a fair price. It was an incredible price, in fact, but they denied it. I offered again, with even more money and goods, and again they denied. This was the last straw. How DARE they deny me?! Don't they know who WON all those wars? I then decided that I had had enough of these ancient Frenchmen who dared to think they are equal to us great Romans. I not only wanted to teach them a lesson; I wanted them gone. So thus, the Great Gaul Genocide began.\nIt was a truly incredible campaign. Several new armies were raised. All traces of Gaul in the east were annihilated first, and a great push into the west began. Whenever I captured a city I was given the option to either occupy it as it was, enslave half the people and disperse them among my empire, or slaughter 3/4 of the people in the settlement. Naturally, I chose the latter. My goal was elimination. Death to all those barbarians who dared to have national pride.\nI pushed into the Gaul empire, taking city after city. The enemy had a bigger empire, perhaps, but mine was far stronger. Our great Roman soldiers killed all in their path. Despite a stumbling point where one Gaul army managed to defeat mine and save their city, two new armies took its place. The massive campaign wore on until, at last, the final Gaul stronghold fell. The people were slaughtered, and nothing remained of the once great empire.\nI had kept a running body count as the genocide wore on. The final results were:\nGaul Soldiers killed: 3,659\nGaul Civilians killed: 33,689\nTotal Barbarian Gauls killed (citizens and soldiers): 37,339\nBrave Roman soldiers lost: 1,258\nFinal body count: 38,597 people dead.\n\nIt was only after the genocide was over that I realized I'd forgotten why I was mad at them in the first place.\nHmm...it was something about a city...\n\n10/10 would genocide again.","February 14","true","56.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","100","8","8","11","1"

The options of other factions, and the different unit available within each, means you will have hours of fun mastering the pros and cons depending on who you go.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RageBerry/recommended/4760/","RageBerry","RageBerry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RageBerry/","45 products in account","As the user-defined tags suggest this is a historical strategy game.  The overworld campaign is a turn-based grand strategy- sort of a simplified Civilization.  The battles are mostly real time, with a toggle for 2x or 3x, so I guess it could be argued there is a 4x element to the battle.\n\nThe campaign takes a long time to finish, but it is good training if you want to play multiplayer.  There are some troops that don't seem to be very good relative to their costs-  I'm thinking the Arcanii (why only 16????????!!!!!!!!!!), but for the most part the game seems pretty balanced.\n\nThe biggest downside for me was the fact that this game crashes every 4th or 5th battle, and I hear I am not the only person who has this problem.  The public order system can also be wonky- I lost a settlement to a gladiator revolt, then recaptured it and two turns later there was another gladiator revolt with the exact same amount of gladiators.\n\nOverall, I would strongly reccomend this game if you like the idea of massive battles, tactical thinking, or time consuming strategic considerations.  I know I loved it.\n\n","February 25, 2015","true","146.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","5"

Even now the game feeling hasn't changed at all.\nI still get this goose bumps moment whenever I hear the music in the main menu.\n\nthe game itself:\n\nRTW can cause a very diverse game feeling, depending on what you like. Whether you look at the Imperial Campaign, which gives you the possibility to fight massive battles and conquer a huge empire; or you focus more on the multiplayer, that offers you battles up to 8 players on great maps and which includes a nice, helpfull and fair community, depends fully on your own preferences.\n\nmy own opinion and the peroration:\n\nRome: Total War was a part of my childhood, no doubt.\nThe game itself, with all of it's historic details and variety can only be overtrumped by it's amazing multiplayer.\n\nRome: Total War is a MUST-buy for all history- and strategy-fans.\n\nI rate it: 10/10","May 13","true","142.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Despite game breaking bugs and broken promises about modding support Rome Total War still manages to give you a grand experience as you grow your empire towards total domination.\n\nFor those who have never played a Total War game it has two distinct elements to it, the first is the campaign map, this is an overview map where you build your cities, train units, send diplomats and assassins to your enemies and friends and move your armies around in a turn based grand strategy style and while it has nowhere near the dept of a true grand strategy game it does the job well enough that you forgive it, especially once you start to touch upon the second, and the most important, major aspect of a Total War game, the battles.\n\nWhen two armies meet on the campaign map you are taken out of the turn based strategy and thrown right smack in the middle of a real time strategy battle with hundreds or perhaps even thousands of soldiers ready to fight and die. You move your soldiers around in squads of archers, swordsmen, cavalry, etc. Each faction has a semi-unique list of units they can employ, from the various types of Roman Legionaries to the Carthaginian War Elephants to the hilariously historically inaccurate flaming pigs. Each unit has it's own skills and abilities and while there is some level of rock -> paper -> scissors involved, the majority comes down to tactics, sure Spearmen beats cavalry, unless the cavalry happens to be charging them from behind.\n\nThe game is pretty too, with a good amount of detail considering the scope of the battles, the soundtrack fits almost perfectly with the mood of the game and sounds of battle are utterly satisfying. Even the load screen are great, each one featuring a different quote from a period persona although a lot of mistakes were made by whoever typed in those quotes.\n\nIt is not all roses however, Rome has a number of problems too the first and foremost of which being the same one that continues to plague Total War games to this day. The AI is completely and utterly inept. Whether it is trying to assemble an army by sending individual units walking through your territory one by one, letting you eliminate them piecemeal or displaying it's rather uncanny ability to form a perfect battle line and then break it in half just before engagement letting you flank the enemy at will you can't help but feel that this is somehow below the standards of the rest of the game and in fact modders have proven that making the AI not suicide every battle is indeed possible.\n\nIn addition to that rather large issue there is a number of smaller ones, the campaign map is incredibly shallow and while the movement style is a big leap up from Medieval it still feels very arcadey. The squalor bug, or feature, as the developers would call it, whereby all cities automatically revolt if they grow to a certain population size. The lack of full scale modding, although Rome features a bunch of great mods there are certain things you are simply not allowed to do, such as adding more factions to the game. And despite the developers saying it's possible and banning people from their forums who says otherwise, it really isn't possible.\n\nAlso the game throws any sense of historical accuracy out the window, from the equipment to the map to the very factions very few things in the game represent the time period accurately, this is something that will bother some people while others will ignore it. For me it only becomes annoying when people take their knowledge from Rome and try to apply it elsewhere.\n\nAll in all, Rome Total War is a great game, it set the standard for all Total War Games to come and despite a number of annoying bugs and problems it still remains a great game to this day.","March 15, 2013","true","438.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

One of the best pc games of all time.\n\nIf you've ever dreamed of being an ancient general like Caesar or Hannibal, or conquering the ancient world as the romans did, this is the game for you !\n\nThe game's main campaign is set during the rule of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire with the player assuming control of one of three leading Roman families. Other factions are playable once they have been unlocked. Gameplay consists of real-time tactical battles framed within a turn-based strategic campaign.  On the large strategic scale, players spend each turn managing diplomacy, developing infrastructure, moving armies, and managing the population's growth and public order. On the smaller scale, real-time battles against enemy armies take place with the player commanding forces that can contain thousands of individual soldiers.\n\nThe game is also featured in tv series about ancient battles - Decisive Battles and Time Commanders\n\nSome other roman themed games : Caesar 3, Qvadriga, Grand Ages: Rome,  Europa Universalis: Rome..","May 3, 2015","true","35.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game is a must have for all RTS and Grand Strategy fans!\n\nThis game is perfect for a newcomer to the total war series, it's simple and easy to get into but tremendous fun to play.  Don't be discouraged thinking that old games are stupidly hard, with cluttered UI and bad graphics, it's not the case here!\n\nThe city management and diplomacy is interesting. The UI is polished and easily understandable.  There's a great unit variety and especially the Roman legions are really interesting. There's nothing like mowing down hordes of barbaric tribes with your Legions. Sure the graphics are outdated but it still looks decent, at least you can crank them up to the max even on an old laptop. Total War Rome looked WAY better in it's age (2004) than how Rome II looks compared to today's standards. There are a huge number of mods, and complete overhauls out there to further enhance the gameplay and graphics.\n\nWhen you buy the game you also get the Barbarian Invasion DLC included which places the whole game to a completely different aspect. There's also another expansion called Total War Rome Alexander but it's perhaps the most forgettable one in the franchise.\n\nThis game is in my personal top 10 of all time, worth every penny if you like strategy games go buy it and I guarantee you won't regret it! I played hundreds of hours of it (I owned a physical copy).","May 4, 2014","true","6.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/recommended/4760/","Jragghen","Jragghen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/","965 products in account","Rome: Total War is the oldest Total War game available on Steam, and can be considered the basis of the rest of the games which followed (although I would totally rebuy Medieval: Total War if they ever added that). In previous games, the overlying board played like a giant Risk board, where you moved armied from province to province, instead of having the entire campaign map laid out and moving your armies to specific locations. This was a DRAMATIC shift for the series, and one which really helped to establish it at something unique from other strategy games.\n\nLike all Total War games that followed, you move your armies around the map to strategic locations in your turn, then the rest of the other players' turns elapse. At any point where two armies meet and fight, the option to autoresolve or fight on a tactical campaign map is provided, which is where the real-time portion of the game takes place.\n\nRome is also the first game in the series where the armies were polygonal as opposed to sprites, which was a RIDICULOUS feat for graphics at the time. It's still relatively streamlined compared to modern Total War games, but it still stands up to this day. It's an excellent, excellent game, and well worth playing even now, a decade after its release. While I don't personally hold it up as the best example of the series, I know many people who do and I cannot fault their opinions - this is a damn fine game.","March 2, 2014","true","3.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

A great game. If you are looking for something to fill up quite a bit of time for quite a small amount of money this is it.   It took me forty hours or so to get through one campaign, that is win one game.  After finishing a campaign successfully you can pick any of the nations on the map to use.\n\nAs for the gameplay yourself you start off with some citystates.  You must develop your cities in order to increase monitary capital, defenses, religion, law and order, sanitation etc. all the while keeping the citizens at a content state.  They can and will revolt and kick you out if they get to dissatified.  You also must recruit a variety of soldiers to defend your cities and conquer other cities and generals.  You build siege weapons, ladders, siege towers, battering rams, or later when you get them elephants to scale or break down walls to take other fortresses and eventually rule the world!\n\nAs you can tell there is a bit of a learning curve with  this game.  Save often at first.  With a little bit of patience you can learn to do all I have mentioned and more.  This sort of game is not for everyone, however, it is hard to know if you are really going to like it unless you give it a sincere try.\n\nThe game is a bit dated and can be hard to load at times.  Once loaded I have noticed no bugs.  It is a good game if you have a computer that is not 100% up to date as it will work on older computers that might not have the specs for the newer Total War Games.  So far I have played Total War Rome, Shogun 2, and Medieval.  They are all enjoyable in  their own ways.  So for those asking which game is the best I would recommend getting the one for the area of history you are most interested in as long as it will work on your computer.  If you like it you will most likely enjoy the others as well.","January 7, 2014","true","136.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

The soldiers which at the time seemed technological marvels now look blocky and cartoony, the campaign map looks less vibrant and more modular, the little portraits, banners and such all look unimpressive and much of the interface seems vaguely unresponsibe, low resolution and unattractive.\n\nBut they will never beat this game.\n\nWhat was Rome Total War? Think of cars coming into a world of carts, think of chocolate coming into a world of porridge. People had dreamed of seeing the vast armies portrayed as 2D sprites in the original Shogun: Total War in glorious full 3D, and this game delivered in every way imaginable. The roman cities were sparkling, shining in the sun, the landscapes were the scale of the real world and the armies were, indeed, massive. The formations looked just as good as you always hoped they would, and things like charges had the very, excellent, feeling that we had all imagined.\n\nNot only that, but the game was deep and huge, with hours upon hours of varied gameplay promised, with any faction we wiped out in one playthrough being available to control in the next campaign - something that Empire: Total War really should have allowed. The (strangely Australian) tutorial woman left nothing to chance, and we never felt out of control, rushed, or under any pressure that was not a direct result of our own actions (all faults that would plague later titles in the series, in my eyes)\n\nThe characters were great - real world names popping up here and there, generals increasing in effectivness. Money flowed relatively easily if you were but a little thoughtful about it, and developing more advanced troops was intuitive and straightforward.\n\nIn short, this game got everything right. It has just the right mix of gameplay imposition and gamer imposition, input from both sources comign together to create a sandbox empire building experience that could suck you in and satisfied you for tens, hundreds of hours.\n\nAmazing game.","May 21","true","12.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

From its incredible soundtrack to its exciting battles, I cannot find any part of this game I do not like. I was pleasantly surprised to find that unlike many other "strategy" games I've played, this one actually felt like it required a strategy to win. I haven't fought with all factions yet so I haven't expierenced fights with many different kinds of units, but combat feels well-balanced (except with the Gauls and Britons, whose hordes of disorderly footsoldiers are easily crushed, making wars with them a bit too easy and not as exciting).\n\nDirecting combat is easy, though units like Equites and the general's bodyguard are not fire and forget and require attention, which may make directing large armies a bit overwhelming, but that may just be me. The interface for controlling your units is simple enough to understand easily, and issuing commands is what you'd expect it to be.\n\nOn to the world map: There's nothing extremely special about it, but managing towns sometimes requires a bit of its own strategizing. I have terrible governing skills, so a few towns at a time that I've conquered will be having riots, and not many of my towns will have governors in them to keep order. This can prove inconvenient in situations when there are multiple towns that need attention. But hey, maybe you can do better. Every part of this game is strategy through and through.\n\nI may not have gone over every explicit detail of the game in this review, but I give it a ten out of ten. It may be old, but for people who are tired of extremely repetitive strategy games, it's definitely something new.","December 22, 2013","true","27.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game beats every other title out there in terms of a combined turn-based/rts historical game (especially with mods, which virtually increases the game length by hundreds--possibly thousands--of hours.\n\nGraphics: They're okay for its time (about a 6-7/10), but it may feel outdated for some newer gamers. Try some mods, and it'll feel more new. With that being said, about 7/10 with the mods in mind.\n\nGameplay: Very smooth, responsive battle animations. If you can control your cavalry well, you can handle any opponent with proper flanking and timed troop engagement. The turn-based aspect may seem somewhat outdated, but there are mods that will bring the diplomacy among other parts of the game to unrivaled levels. 10/10\n\nI'm not going to comment on anything else, since I think this game is all gameplay with some visuals to create immersion. There is a grand and truly epic feel to the campaign, so anyone with some interest in history would enjoy it.\n\n\n\n","December 11, 2015","true","65.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I purchased it a couple of years ago after watching gameplay on YouTube, I first saw how amazing  and fun it looked to control these huge armies and to be able command them to charge into their bloody deaths while women were throwing severed heads at the enemy. After, I learnt about the campaign mode, it is simple: build an empire and take over the world (pretty much all of europe and a bit of the middle east). This simple campaign type/mode is the best part about the game and all Total War games in my opinion. After playing the game it was just, or even more epic from the footage I witnessed on YouTube and was everything I expected.\n\nI'm not hugely a strategy game fan boy, but that hasn't stopped me from placing Rome Total War in my top 5 games of all time (I have played a lot of games haha)!

This time its for the newest and most improved sequel to Total War: Galactic Bowling. This game brings a whole new perspective to the war based trilogy we all know and love as, Total War: Elephant rekters. lel XD. So anyway this game has a lot of cool stuff in it, like the ability to move your troops around the map. Also, what I think is the most important, you could actually use boats xD. So yeah I give this game and awesomesauc out of awesomesauce. Get it? Its basically 11/12 because I left a number out! xD. So yeah have fun playing this RPG because I sure did cx.

I purchased it a couple of years ago after watching gameplay on YouTube, I first saw how amazing  and fun it looked to control these huge armies and to be able command them to charge into their bloody deaths while women were throwing severed heads at the enemy. After, I learnt about the campaign mode, it is simple: build an empire and take over the world (pretty much all of europe and a bit of the middle east). This simple campaign type/mode is the best part about the game and all Total War games in my opinion. After playing the game it was just, or even more epic from the footage I witnessed on YouTube and was everything I expected.\n\nI'm not hugely a strategy game fan boy, but that hasn't stopped me from placing Rome Total War in my top 5 games of all time (I have played a lot of games haha)!

Even with CA's recent release of Rome 2, it still does not compare to the level of pure effort put into Rome 1. Rome 2 is horedously buggy, overpriced, naval combat is a plus, but only makes the game more tedious, just as it did in Napoleon and Empire, and simply uses new age graphics to lure players. No game should be judged by graphics, onl by gameplay mechanics, sound, community, and execution.

So much can be said about this game. For this review I'll feel more comfortable explaining all of the Pro's and Con's I faced when playing this game. Remember, reviews are very subjective so my experience may not match yours. However, that shouldn't discourage you to purchase this title.\n\nPro's: Right off the bat I'm going to talk about one of the key selling points to this game. The Battles!\n\nBattles in this game highly depend on your strategical and logical thinking. You command hundreds to thousands of soldiers on the battle field. Each having unique properties and abilities. Some troops are purely Missile (Troops that use Bows, Slings and Human Heads), while other troops can be a mix of this. A good example to look at are Skirmishers. These troops throw spears and damage units. When they're ammunition is depleted they go into combat with daggers and swords. However, they are inexperienced at hand to hand combat. These types of setbacks and advantages are what bring out the strategic aspect of Total War. So many possibilities as to how you can fight. It's definitely a well made and balanced system.\n\nThe Campaign!\n\nRome 1 has a phenominal campaign alongside its battles. The campaign map spans from Portugal to the Middle East and Russia. Northern Africa and the UK are also included. There are 21 factions however, only a couple are playable. The only way you can play as other factions is by easilly editing a certain script in Rome 1's files. I reccomend doing this as it gives you more options and various ways to make the campaign different. Each faction owns settlements in their unique areas. These can be profited off of to fund your army and other buildings to improve your empires happiness and what you can train in certain settlements. For example, the Carthaginians have access to War Elephants. These beasts can tear through any troop easilly. The only problem is you can't train them during early game as you need certain stables to do so.\n\nCons: The AI!\n\nFirst of all, let me explain my position on the AI, It's not terrible at all, especially for a game made in 2004. However, it still needs to be adressed. In a game with a battle system that is dependant on strategy, well programmed AI is essential for such a mechanic. The AI in this game does fail to do so at times. Keep in mind though, the amount of times that such a problem occured is very miniscule. During sieges my Cavalry would sometimes decide to take the least logical route to get a to a certain point. Instead of going through an easy passage, they go to where all my infantry is and try to run through the hoardes of enemies. As long as you can correct them (Which can be done with one right click) this wont be a huge problem but, timing in Total War plays a big part in strategies. It may seem like I am nitpicking but, once you play this game you'll understand the importance of the AI.\n\nFinal Verdict: Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yeah I do! This game is amazing and I will always love it to death. Especially considering how it was made in 2004. In fact, I would even say that this game out performs Rome 2 (That game is a huge mess that I don't care to explain right now).\n\nI give this game 10 Roman Soldiers outta ♥♥♥♥ing 10. Also keep in mind, this comes with an expansion pack.","March 11, 2015","true","151.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A realistic RTS game without the chaos of real life interfering with it. Historically, this game is fairly accurate, and the Roman fighting style lends itself to more user friendly battles. And here is where the game is such a drastic improvement on the previouse titles in the series.\n\nOrganised Chaos\nWhether it is by phalanx or testeudo, the battles are a lot more organised than its predecessors. Battles are based on your ability to organise, coordinate and react to the adversity, more than the troops at your disposal. Gone are the morale sapping archers on the hill top and heavy cavalry charge from Medieval TW2 - Rome brings you a more balanced feel to the battle, even if it is elephants vs peasants.\n\nMacro, not micro management\nWhat I like most about Rome (and where they seem to have strayed from the path in more recent releases) is that these are strategy simulations, not population management games. The management evironment is simple and straight forward, the interface is both familiar and intuititve while still giving you the ability to go into more detail if those damn peasants insist on revolting every turn.\n\nRome is a great game to either pick up and play or delve into in for days on end. Rest assured there is a battle around every corner, usually where you least suspect it.","January 17, 2014","true","78.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The objective is to take over the world.\n\nManaging your settlements is the slow paced portion of the game but still varied, as you need to satisfy your people while also recruting and positioning your military in order to accomplish your goals. You also need to be wary of what other factions feel towards you and your movements, as having allies might make a critical difference.\n\nWhen your troops meet other troops in the battlefield, whether it was you who attacked or your opponent is when there is the option to combat them manually. You take control of large armies, going up to to the hundreds or thousands depending or your settings. Controlling this massive number of soldiers is easy and intuitive and the variety of available units allow the combat system to provide you with multiple options. Each unit has its strenghs and purposes and the overall combination of troops you decide to take to battle make all the difference in the world.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough to any player who enjoys strategy or military games.","July 29, 2014","true","105.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Certainly the best in the total war series in my books.\n\nRome excels with top notch gameplay and a smooth clear crisp battle engine. Certainly Rome Total War came out in 2005 so graphically comparing to modern titles it is inferior, however it runs and plays so much better as a game vs other total war games. Rome is like a no frills strategy game, no crap, no bulsht, an amazing game which loads of replay value- as it should be!\n\nI have probably spent more time playing Rome Total War than any other game. At it's current steam price around £1.60 it is a steal. Buy it, there are still plenty of folks online.","October 3, 2014","true","411.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The objective is to take over the world.\n\nManaging your settlements is the slow paced portion of the game but still varied, as you need to satisfy your people while also recruting and positioning your military in order to accomplish your goals. You also need to be wary of what other factions feel towards you and your movements, as having allies might make a critical difference.\n\nWhen your troops meet other troops in the battlefield, whether it was you who attacked or your opponent is when there is the option to combat them manually. You take control of large armies, going up to to the hundreds or thousands depending or your settings. Controlling this massive number of soldiers is easy and intuitive and the variety of available units allow the combat system to provide you with multiple options. Each unit has its strenghs and purposes and the overall combination of troops you decide to take to battle make all the difference in the world.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough to any player who enjoys strategy or military games.","July 29, 2014","true","105.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Okay, so there actually was a Medieval and Shogun: Total War before it, but Rome is the one that introduced the concepts its successors have built upon. While the graphics are a bit dated, and historical accuracy wasn't as rigorous as later titles, this game is quite fun, and can end up being a bit of a time-sink.\n\nTwo side notes: One, I first became interested in the game based on a fun History Channel series called Decisive Battles. The game engine from Rome was used to show the battles in the series. Second, while my time of use may seem low, that is a bit deceiving. First, I had played the game before finding out it was on Steam. And the other reason is I have many games that I tend to use when I cannot get on-line.

First released back in September 2004 the game recently reached it's tenth anniversary. I've played it on and off since release and the recent anniversary prompted me to go back and play through it again. It's a game that mostly stands up to the test of time for me and well worth playing today. I didn't play the Barbarian Invasion expansion included in the Steam edition as it's quite a distinct entity that should be reviewed in it's own right.\n\nLike all games in the Total War series there are two elements; the campaign map where you manage your empire, build cities, recruit units, move armies etc and the battle map, where you fight battles in real time. This gives the game some great depth and whilst you can auto-resolve battles this can be a bit hit and miss and you'll want to fight them yourself to get the best results. The Imperial Campaign is the main game mode where you can choose from a number of different factions and play through either a short or long campaign with prescribed victory conditions and different difficulty settings. There is a decent tutorial to ease you into things and plenty of advice is available throughout both with the optionn to turn it off for veterans.\n\nThe Imperial Campaign is backed up by being able to fight custom battles where you choose the map, faction etc and Historical Battles which recreate a number of famous battles of the era such as Hannibal's invasion of Italy and the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest. You can also play online against other players but this wasn't something I did.\n\nThe main campaign has a good deal of depth and each of the factions has different styles, units, cities and starting points which offer a wide variety of challenge. Playing as the Romans is the initial starting point and they are divided into three factions which compete against other and have some additional mechanics to account for including the Senate of Rome, the Marius Reforms and some other suprises which I won't spoil. Rome also generally has the strongest units and buildings which can make things somewhat straightforward for an experienced player. However a lot of the late game units of other factions more than match them and playing the campaign as Eygpt, Carthage, the Britons or others is very enjoyable.\n\nThe mechanics of the campaign map are very broad and offer a wide variety of tactical options to pursue; bribery, assassination and spreading plagues amongst them. I played through on the very hard settings which I'd reccomend any veteran Total War player to do and the campaign offered a good challenge with interesting scenarios and incidents along the way. Whilst my progress was steady I wasn't able to steamroll the AI into the ground within a few turns. I did play as Eygpt who are one of the easier non Roman factions to play but still a challenge later in the game.\n\nThe battle map is probably the slightly weaker side of the game and whilst some battles, particularly sieges, can be a bit difficult or frustrating, most are straightforward affairs if you have assembled a balanced army and have a relatively comprehensive grasp of the tactics to use. However the various factions armies all have different strengths or weaknesses and there isn't the rock, paper, scissors situation you see in some games. The Roman armies have the strongest armies as a general rule of thumb but other factions e.g. Eygpt, Germania have some very good units too and what works with one may not work at all with another.\n\nI've not mentioned performance or graphics at all as the game is ten years old and there generally shouldn't be any issues nor will it look fantastic.\n\nI'd also take a moment to mention the additional content available online from Europa Barborum and a couple of other sites. These add a huge amount to the game and are well worth a look if you want to take things further after playing the main game.\n\nOverall I'd definetely reccomend playing this if your a fan of the Total War series and I also feel its a good starting point for the series as whole. Those interested in the era itself will certainly find it enjoyable.","October 28, 2014","true","145.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This Games graphics are out dated, but the attention to detail and polish are abundant. Nothing was more satisfying then watching my cavalry charge send individual men flying. The world map is kind of bland, but you have a pretty good idea of what the terrain is. All of the cities are (or were) real cities, and many you may already know of. This game is a very well researched game. There are many historical troop types and landmarks. I can't even imagine how much time was put in to making this game as historically accurate as possible.\nOverall, this is a well-presented game.\n\nNow let's look at gameplay. This games battle system is hands down the best I have seen in any RTS ever. The attention to detail is astounding. Certain troops counter others, this is in other games. However, different formations and tactics can turn the tables on your so-called counters. You can be a regular Cesar if you play your cards right. The AI is not the sharpest tool in the shed, especially when it comes to troop movement. I have missed a table-turning oppurtunity in many a battle due to a units slow response or incorrect followthrough of an order. It could be said that this makes the game more realistic, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. The game can be played in single or multiplayer player mode. Single player has three functions: Campaign, Custom battles, and Historical battles. The Campaign can be played as one of the three Roman factions at first and later other factions. Not every faction can be played as-at least not in th vanilla-which is a shame as many unique factions were left out. The campaign takes place over a world map as you and the other factions take turns building and managing an empire. The campaign is extremely immersive. Players personalities are reflected in how they play the game. I can be impatient, but I also am a procrastinator. As a result, I would impatiently blitz one enemy, then stand around repelling the attacks of another. The goals of the game are dependent on what type of campaign tou chose. A short one has small goals while a long one has large. Overall the campaign is the best part of the game. The custom battle option is fun for experimenting with new tactics or just goofing around. It is not something you will spend a ton of time on though. The Historical battles are just that, battles from history. They put you in the shoes of real ancient commanders in battles that actually took place. They're fun, but not very replayable. The multiplayer is the second best function of the game. It allows you to play online in battles with other players. The type of battles vary, from sieges to free-for-alls. There are even some historical battles exclusive to multiplayer.

I've played every total war game atleast 100+ hours on/off steam and Rome I have played almost a 800 hours or so. Nonetheless I can still enjoy playing it. It's almost 10 years old and I still think it is their best game. It is balanced and challenging and nothing compared to strategy games brougt out today.  The best thing about this game is it's strategy on both real time and turn based gameplay. This makes the game much more playable than real-time or turn-based only. It's focused around 300 BC. Around that time the romans were just about to enlarge their empire into the great roman empire which makes it fun to discover all the lost nations that they conquered. It's geography is the entire mediterian and all of germany, france, spain and the southern half of great britain.  I would definetly recommend this game if you're a fan of strategy games. It is old so don't expect much features or awesome graphics.","August 18, 2014","true","42.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even LESS optimized. PC is a Win7-64bit with all the bells and whistles and up-to-date drivers but yet the performance of the game stutters and suffers after about an hour in play to where it takes about 20 seconds to click a menu button. Googling some updates or at least some methods to try to solve this problem...no results. I'm honestly disappointed at how badly optimized this game is for Win7. Your experience may vary.\n\nGood\n- Total War series. Everything you ever wanted to be the ruler of Rome and pounding barbarians into dust while bowing to the Senate.\n-Unit scale is ridiculously well imagined and with proper planning - you can have some pretty large battles.\n-All the mods you could shake a stick at in Workshop or mod communities.\n-Replay value for each race/city is phenomenal.\n\nBad\n- Badly optimized for Win7\n- Random stutters and crash-to-black. Save often.\n- With no balance mods, it's pretty easy for the micromanage to get out of hand to where you need to hire and fire peasants to transfer population from one city to another.

You might be the nicest person ever, but by the end of a campaign you might as well be ranked as the world's #1 sociopath, for you will be driven to crush every rebellion and consolidate the world under the mighty grip of your imperium. The aesthetic, feel, music, all for the glory of arguably the greatest empire ever created is emulated to absolute perfection.\n\nAnd that's 10 YEARS after the game has been released.

This Games graphics are out dated, but the attention to detail and polish are abundant. Nothing was more satisfying then watching my cavalry charge send individual men flying. The world map is kind of bland, but you have a pretty good idea of what the terrain is. All of the cities are (or were) real cities, and many you may already know of. This game is a very well researched game. There are many historical troop types and landmarks. I can't even imagine how much time was put in to making this game as historically accurate as possible.\nOverall, this is a well-presented game.\n\nNow let's look at gameplay. This games battle system is hands down the best I have seen in any RTS ever. The attention to detail is astounding. Certain troops counter others, this is in other games. However, different formations and tactics can turn the tables on your so-called counters. You can be a regular Cesar if you play your cards right. The AI is not the sharpest tool in the shed, especially when it comes to troop movement. I have missed a table-turning oppurtunity in many a battle due to a units slow response or incorrect followthrough of an order. It could be said that this makes the game more realistic, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. The game can be played in single or multiplayer player mode. Single player has three functions: Campaign, Custom battles, and Historical battles. The Campaign can be played as one of the three Roman factions at first and later other factions. Not every faction can be played as-at least not in th vanilla-which is a shame as many unique factions were left out. The campaign takes place over a world map as you and the other factions take turns building and managing an empire. The campaign is extremely immersive. Players personalities are reflected in how they play the game. I can be impatient, but I also am a procrastinator. As a result, I would impatiently blitz one enemy, then stand around repelling the attacks of another. The goals of the game are dependent on what type of campaign tou chose. A short one has small goals while a long one has large. Overall the campaign is the best part of the game. The custom battle option is fun for experimenting with new tactics or just goofing around. It is not something you will spend a ton of time on though. The Historical battles are just that, battles from history. They put you in the shoes of real ancient commanders in battles that actually took place. They're fun, but not very replayable. The multiplayer is the second best function of the game. It allows you to play online in battles with other players. The type of battles vary, from sieges to free-for-alls. There are even some historical battles exclusive to multiplayer. Overall, the multiplayer is great for when you want a change of pace.\n\nOver all, this game has a good presentation, pays attention to detail, and is highly immersive, the best ten bucks you'll ever spend. 9.5/10\n","August 16, 2014","true","514.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may just be me viewing it through nostalgia-tinted lenses, but this game definitelly surpassed the competition in my book.\n\nPros:\n- Good unit variety, building variety, and so on.\n- Far more colorful and vibrant than later entries.\n- Good variety of civilizations.\n- Decent dificulty curve.\n- Replayable to almost infinity due to variety of strategems and civilizations.\n- Decent modding community and re-works through dedicated websites.\n\nCons:\n- Realism slightly lacking.\n- Some balance issues in multiplayer (barbarians lack morale, phalanx beats any other unit one-on-one etc.).\n- Poor diplomacy.\n- Community has partially moved on to Medieval II and later, meaning less mods and reworks to add replayability that    otherwise.\n- Graphics slightly dated.\n\nIn short, the game has much to reccomend it. The main complaint I find is that the game hasn't aged well compared to others, that the graphics are out of date etc. While some have a point, the old graphics have a certain charm and don't detract from the gameplay one bit. In fact, I take that as a point in their favor as it means that older systems can run the game without frying from the effort.\nBuy it.

While they spend the next year working out all the bugs on Rome: Total War 2 I would strongly recommend getting a taste for the game through this edition by which time Rome Total War 2 will be patched enough that it will be a superlative game.

I've played every total war game atleast 100+ hours on/off steam and Rome I have played almost a 800 hours or so. Nonetheless I can still enjoy playing it. It's almost 10 years old and I still think it is their best game. It is balanced and challenging and nothing compared to strategy games brougt out today.  The best thing about this game is it's strategy on both real time and turn based gameplay. This makes the game much more playable than real-time or turn-based only. It's focused around 300 BC. Around that time the romans were just about to enlarge their empire into the great roman empire which makes it fun to discover all the lost nations that they conquered. It's geography is the entire mediterian and all of germany, france, spain and the southern half of great britain.  I would definetly recommend this game if you're a fan of strategy games. It is old so don't expect much features or awesome graphics.","August 18, 2014","true","42.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Choose a Roman family, rise in status, fight barbarians, and seize power in Rome herself. Or you could be a barbarian heathen. Easily one of my favorite games in the series and one of the best RTS games of all time.\n\nThe only problem perhaps is the autoresolve battle AI seems to leave a lot to be desired. However; if you wanted a turn based game I recommend The Republic of Rome Tabletop game (playable by your lonesome but better with friends you aren't afraid to lose) or your favorite Civilization. The Historical inaccuracy of certain aspects is also fairly blatant but it is forgiven due to the game being more about cinematic sword and sandal warfare than a rough simulation of historical events for that I recommend something by Paradox Interactive.\n\nThe game's strenghts lie in it's great battle system and it's fascinating overworld of intrigue. If you want a hardcore tactics game it can be that but there is also an arcade mode for people who just want to watch the sword fights but do not wish to get heavily involved in tactical movement.\n\nThis is a game I could recommend for anyone with even a passing interest in this period in history.

Certainly the best in the total war series in my books.\n\nRome excels with top notch gameplay and a smooth clear crisp battle engine. Certainly Rome Total War came out in 2005 so graphically comparing to modern titles it is inferior, however it runs and plays so much better as a game vs other total war games. Rome is like a no frills strategy game, no crap, no bulsht, an amazing game which loads of replay value- as it should be!\n\nI have probably spent more time playing Rome Total War than any other game. At it's current steam price around £1.60 it is a steal. Buy it, there are still plenty of folks online.","October 3, 2014","true","411.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Choose a Roman family, rise in status, fight barbarians, and seize power in Rome herself. Or you could be a barbarian heathen. Easily one of my favorite games in the series and one of the best RTS games of all time.\n\nThe only problem perhaps is the autoresolve battle AI seems to leave a lot to be desired. However; if you wanted a turn based game I recommend The Republic of Rome Tabletop game (playable by your lonesome but better with friends you aren't afraid to lose) or your favorite Civilization. The Historical inaccuracy of certain aspects is also fairly blatant but it is forgiven due to the game being more about cinematic sword and sandal warfare than a rough simulation of historical events for that I recommend something by Paradox Interactive.\n\nThe game's strenghts lie in it's great battle system and it's fascinating overworld of intrigue. If you want a hardcore tactics game it can be that but there is also an arcade mode for people who just want to watch the sword fights but do not wish to get heavily involved in tactical movement.\n\nThis is a game I could recommend for anyone with even a passing interest in this period in history. The phoenicians are waiting to meet you on the field of battle.","May 23, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a turn based campaign in which you create massive armies and manage settlements. Then when two armies collide (whether that be an seige or field battle) the real fun begins you can play battles with thousands of soldiers slugging it out. The different factions have huge differences in which you have to play. Romans have superb heavy infantry which can tackle most other infantry but lack cavalry. The Greeks have phalanx that buckle down enemy infantry so your cavalry can finish the job. And the barbarian have cool unique units like the druids and fanatics. This game is very polished and is better than all the other games in the series and i have played all but the first two (rome 2 is on my other account).

It is easy to see why this is considered the most influencial of all Total War games published. The battles are fantastic to play, the game is challenging to play, if you play certain factions, and fun to see a faction that was wiped out by the Roman imperilaists in our history, to suddenly lick Carthaginian sandal in your game. Another good feature in this game is how each faction has their own unique apperances and even how they fight and what units they can have, even if they are a bit copy and paste.\n\nIf there are any flaws in this game, it is these; stupid stacked armies (several generals with up to 30 or more units), overpowered factions and historical inaccuracy.  The stupid stacked armies are a constant menace, especially  if you invade Rome, so be ready for that. Another one is overpowerded factions. The one in particullar is Egypt. If you play as the Seleucid Empire against them, good ♥♥♥♥ing luck! Historical inaccuracy is another flaw, but only minor compared to the latter two.\n\nOverall, the game is fantastic and a good place to start if you're new to Total War and want to see how the Total War franchise became more famous!","April 23, 2015","true","222.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The objective is to take over the world.\n\nManaging your settlements is the slow paced portion of the game but still varied, as you need to satisfy your people while also recruting and positioning your military in order to accomplish your goals. You also need to be wary of what other factions feel towards you and your movements, as having allies might make a critical difference.\n\nWhen your troops meet other troops in the battlefield, whether it was you who attacked or your opponent is when there is the option to combat them manually. You take control of large armies, going up to to the hundreds or thousands depending or your settings. Controlling this massive number of soldiers is easy and intuitive and the variety of available units allow the combat system to provide you with multiple options. Each unit has its strenghs and purposes and the overall combination of troops you decide to take to battle make all the difference in the world.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough to any player who enjoys strategy or military games.","July 29, 2014","true","105.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yeah I understand, it's almost ten years old, but when did graphics ever matter? What it lacks in that department it makes up for in gameplay and sheer depth, and I don't know if you'll agree with me on this one, but is it just me that's thinking the Total War games are losing their charm with every new realese? I mean, you saw Empire, and sure, CA had the excuse of a new engine, but then they realesed that absolute mess that was Rome II (and I always thought the sequels were supposed to be better) I was appalled at what I was seeing, and henceforth opted never to purchase it.\n\nRome I is (in my opinion)  the  greatest Total War game made, and one of the best strategy games I've ever played. The amount of detail that CA put into the game is incredible, and better still, installing DarthMod to your game ever more makes the playing experience one to remember. Sure, the A.I is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible, but that never bothered me (just made Rome easier to capture). I can remember once, I had a small force of perhaps five-hundred professional, highly trained and disciplined Legionaries with me, to defend against an army of over three-thousand mindless barbarians. It was these battles that made the game so enjoyable, the sheer tension in the middle of a pitched battle, when neither side show signs of winning, is it going to be yours? Or the enemy's? And aside from the few small skirmishes between armies, when you give your opponent time to assemble a massive force, and you ride out to meet that force with your own, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing bloodbath (serious, the amount of corpses left on the sand was immense). As I've mentioned before, the battles are intense, oh, and, did I mention that the battles were intense?\n\nWith the expansions being "Alexander" and "Barbarian Invasion", these further build upon the gameplay. Offering you to play as the young Greek King as he forges his mighty path of blood and conquest against the Persians for control. Or giving you the chance to save the crumbling Roman Empire in a last attempt to drive out the hordes of invading Huns and Goths, and several other European barbarian tribes.\n\nI myself, never played much of the Alexander expansion, I've only sunk as little as a few hours into it. As for Barbarian Invasion however, that, that is a completely different story. I thoroughly enjoyed this expansion to the already great game.\n\nThat said. Rome I is a great game, one I have played for hours on end, and was never bored with it.\n\nI give this game a 9.5/10","May 2, 2015","true","112.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may just be me viewing it through nostalgia-tinted lenses, but this game definitelly surpassed the competition in my book.\n\nPros:\n- Good unit variety, building variety, and so on.\n- Far more colorful and vibrant than later entries.\n- Good variety of civilizations.\n- Decent dificulty curve.\n- Replayable to almost infinity due to variety of strategems and civilizations.\n- Decent modding community and re-works through dedicated websites.\n\nCons:\n- Realism slightly lacking.\n- Some balance issues in multiplayer (barbarians lack morale, phalanx beats any other unit one-on-one etc.).\n- Poor diplomacy.\n- Community has partially moved on to Medieval II and later, meaning less mods and reworks to add replayability that    otherwise.\n- Graphics slightly dated.\n\nIn short, the game has much to reccomend it. The main complaint I find is that the game hasn't aged well compared to others, that the graphics are out of date etc. While some have a point, the old graphics have a certain charm and don't detract from the gameplay one bit. In fact, I take that as a point in their favor as it means that older systems can run the game without frying from the effort.\nBuy it.

I played the White Label version to death a few years ago. I was quite happy to see that they added Barbarian Invasion to this as well. Rome Total War combines a turn-based strategy world map with real time battle screen. The battles are the best part of the game so if you're more inclined to staring at maps and managing economics  I recommend looking at the Paradox games like Crusader Kings or Hearts of Iron.\n\nThis game is considered one of the better in the series and the graphics aren't too bad for an eleven year old game. My favourite part of this game is the custom battles. A phalanx of Spartans vs 1000 Roman peasants, who wins?\n\nIf you're not sold on the dated graphics you can always download a mod or go for one of the newer games. However Creative Assembly managed to make every entry after Medieval 2 with a new engine. Since then the releases have been a bit hit or miss. Rome 2 had an incredibly poor launch thanks to a variety of bugs and removed features.\n\nSo if you want a fun strategy game I wholeheartedly recommend this game.","July 6, 2015","true","33.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You know this game came out in 2004 and twelve years later this game managed to heavily impress me. From the small part of diplomatic relations to the absolute massive battle scenes, the game just immediately sucked me in. Now the Total War games had never really been a big thing to me up until this moment so I was just a bit dubious about how much this game would appeal to me, but I am a history buff and I was trying to find a way to spend the summer so I picked it up during the sale. What I found was an actually really good game that managed to combine the turn base parts with the real time strategy.\n\nThe game as said is split into two types of strategy. The first part is map screen. From here you manage your settlements and your armies. You can upgrade your towns and recruit new units. From here you can also send out your diplomats to other factions in order to institute trade agreements and forge alliances for wars. The diplomats have actually quite a bit that they can discuss with the other factions. You can make demands such has making them hand over a territory or you can create a trade agreement that can help your income or just allow them military access to other parts of the world. Another thing that impressed me is that they can reject your offer and make counter offers. This really does feel like an actual negotiation rather than just a basic “I declare peace or war thing.” One thing I’m going to say though is that there is a severe problem with the lack of anything to really during peace time. In the end though the map screen is fantastic turn based strategy.\n\nNow as for the actual battle screens it is one the greatest parts of the game. The sieges and the battles are just so massive that it is impossible to be swept away by it. The fights aren’t too complicated. It doesn’t take long to figure the strengths and weaknesses and of each unit. Just know when to charge and how to flank the enemy and that’s rather easy to pick up. What makes it really work though is just the basic ability to pause the game and figure out your positions and where each unit should go. This takes a lot the panicking and stress out of other strategies that usually takes me out of most strategy games. The units are widely varied and it is rather cool to see the progress of your units to much more powerful troops.\n\nIn the end what really sells the game is just the absolute scale it has. The game just feels massive and every advancement you do makes you feel more powerful. Some might say that the effects don’t look good and to those people I say they need to shut it. The game looked amazing back in the day and still looks line today. I don’t care if we can’t see every pimple on the soldiers they look fine. As for the multiplayer I don’t know what it’s like.

I'd seen it advertised some months before that on a TV series that used its engine wherein two teams competed against each other to win an historical battle. That whetted my appetite enormously. When I bought it, I not only spent countless hours playing but also played its add-ons (Barbarian Invasion and Alexander).\nTo me Rome: Total War was the best of the Total War series - a balance between the old 2D strategy of Medieval: Total War and the increasingly eye-candy iterations that came thereafter (though I think Medieval 2: Total War was also very good).\nAdd to this the fact that Rome has more mods than any other in that series (and with more diversity of setting/theme) and you have a game that is highly replayable. I still dip into it after 11 years of owning it! Rome forums still remain populated after all this time, and mods are still being developed for it. That speaks volumes.\nI've had the pleasure of being a RTW modder myself which has only added to the great joy this game has brought. Give it a go.

I only bought the steam version to play online as I couldn't do it otherwise.\n\nThis Game. By far, in my opinion, the best strategy game out there. TODAY.\nThe economic system in campaign is simple enough so you can stay on top of it all but complicated enough so you face challenges to keep your armed forces financially. After play ROME 2 recently I have to say that I believe the economic system in this is better.\n\nActually, this game does stand up to its successor (ROME 2). The AI for one don't spam one unit constantly, they provide challenges to you as well as actually being fun to play against. The battles are great and a regular computer will be able to handle it with ease. Each faction has a wide and fairly balanced selection of Units.\n\nThis game is simply a masterclass. Way before its time, (if you excuse the graphics at times, althought they are not wholly poor). If you do not own this game, you are a fool.

Improve and manage your economy, infastructure, military, taxes, and more. Quell uprisings and keep your people happy. Lash out upon the world: wage war and wield clever diplomacy to accomplish your goals. Take on the world all at once or one piece at a time: create your empire as you feel fit!\n\nWhen engaging enemy forces for battle in Campaign and when playing Multiplayer(RTS), utilize a variety of faction-unique units to dominate your opponents! There are many, many playstyles to fit your taste; no one strategy is going to be your all-time winner, though some playstyles may be more comfortable for you. These battles can range from petty skirmishes to all-out conflict. No one battle is ever the same.\n\nThe graphics are decently good, the gameplay is superb, all in a single package. The only downsides lay in occasional multiplayer trolls and that the RTS combat can be a bit overwhelming/arcade-like since it can be very fast-paced at times.

I'd seen it advertised some months before that on a TV series that used its engine wherein two teams competed against each other to win an historical battle. That whetted my appetite enormously. When I bought it, I not only spent countless hours playing but also played its add-ons (Barbarian Invasion and Alexander).\nTo me Rome: Total War was the best of the Total War series - a balance between the old 2D strategy of Medieval: Total War and the increasingly eye-candy iterations that came thereafter (though I think Medieval 2: Total War was also very good).\nAdd to this the fact that Rome has more mods than any other in that series (and with more diversity of setting/theme) and you have a game that is highly replayable. I still dip into it after 11 years of owning it! Rome forums still remain populated after all this time, and mods are still being developed for it. That speaks volumes.\nI've had the pleasure of being a RTW modder myself which has only added to the great joy this game has brought. Give it a go. You won't regret it.","August 2, 2015","true","388.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It was revolutionary at the time and is still considered one of the best total wars to date. It is mostly balanced and when it's not it's usually just the overpricing of certain units. The community is full of skilled players which is a pro and a con. Many players may struggle to get into the game because of that fact, but if you practice enough and look up some strategy guides then you can rek face. I felt that no army was super under-powered or super over-powered and that anyone could be good with any faction.\n\nNow I'm going to talk a bit more about the cons. One of my major cons is that some factions do not get that many units. In campaign this may be OK but in multiplayer it can make some factions harder to play as. Next con is, well it's old. I'm not complaining about graphics, I'm more complaining about limitations. Battles above five thousand are laggy and hard to play. Also the campaign is hard if you don't look up even one strategy guide. It's confusing and sometimes you feel like you don't know what to do. They give you some tips that aren't neccessarily helpful. I remember having to restart the game as the brutii often because it's that hard. You can end up having built up a large debt. And my final complaint is diplomacy. Oh god the diplomacy. The diplomacy is awful. I remember gaul asking me for trade rights, me accepting, and then they attack me. Also, I have a friend who was attacking the last city of dacia. Dacia had a ton of money and he had accept or we will attack, in exchange for ten thousand denarii. Dacia refused and got obliterated. Stingy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Also, Gaul in my most recent Brutii playthrough said "give us 500 denarii or we will attack" and I just gave it to them. Keep in mind that the julii is currently making them their ♥♥♥♥♥. Then I was like, "Hey, want map information? Just give us 10,000 denarii." Gaul counter offered with "Give us 550 denarii every turn for two turns or we'll attack." and I was like "♥♥♥♥ you!" and then Gaul went to go threaten the rest of rome. Bare in mind that they haven't attacked yet.\n\nMy final score is 9/10 for the game. It struggles a bit, but for the time it was made it was amazing.","November 16, 2015","true","392.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved it because I love games of this type. Which, well thought out throughout, namely: graphics, gameplay interface, factions, troops, historical battles. It's all very well!\nAll the free time I devoted to this particular game, in the flesh, to dvetysyachi eight. Played for weeks without tiring, and with great interest looked at the entire history of all factions. In General, this is a game I would be praised forever, as hitherto, continue to play it. In this game I am a veteran, but unfortunately you won't see it. Speaking of simulated hours. Yes, alas, I played the pirates. And according to my calculations, the time that I played the same (10-15 thousand hours). No less. and no more.\nBecause the fact is that I did not know about this licenzionnoe the game. And the fact that it belongs to the community "Steam". Besides, in the official version, the Russian language is not supported, which is a pity. Now, I would like to go to the overall assessment\n9,97/10\n- Russian language is not supported\n- The inability to play all the factions, (I'm not talking about S. P. Q. R and the Rebels).\nThese disadvantages are not so great that in a loud voice to criticize this game, because the faction that was impossible to play. Already possible, because people already figured out this trick. And once figured out, it means I'm not the one who is madly in love with this strategy.

You know this game came out in 2004 and twelve years later this game managed to heavily impress me. From the small part of diplomatic relations to the absolute massive battle scenes, the game just immediately sucked me in. Now the Total War games had never really been a big thing to me up until this moment so I was just a bit dubious about how much this game would appeal to me, but I am a history buff and I was trying to find a way to spend the summer so I picked it up during the sale. What I found was an actually really good game that managed to combine the turn base parts with the real time strategy.\n\nThe game as said is split into two types of strategy. The first part is map screen. From here you manage your settlements and your armies. You can upgrade your towns and recruit new units. From here you can also send out your diplomats to other factions in order to institute trade agreements and forge alliances for wars. The diplomats have actually quite a bit that they can discuss with the other factions. You can make demands such has making them hand over a territory or you can create a trade agreement that can help your income or just allow them military access to other parts of the world. Another thing that impressed me is that they can reject your offer and make counter offers. This really does feel like an actual negotiation rather than just a basic “I declare peace or war thing.” One thing I’m going to say though is that there is a severe problem with the lack of anything to really during peace time. In the end though the map screen is fantastic turn based strategy.\n\nNow as for the actual battle screens it is one the greatest parts of the game. The sieges and the battles are just so massive that it is impossible to be swept away by it. The fights aren’t too complicated. It doesn’t take long to figure the strengths and weaknesses and of each unit. Just know when to charge and how to flank the enemy and that’s rather easy to pick up. What makes it really work though is just the basic ability to pause the game and figure out your positions and where each unit should go. This takes a lot the panicking and stress out of other strategies that usually takes me out of most strategy games. The units are widely varied and it is rather cool to see the progress of your units to much more powerful troops.\n\nIn the end what really sells the game is just the absolute scale it has. The game just feels massive and every advancement you do makes you feel more powerful. Some might say that the effects don’t look good and to those people I say they need to shut it. The game looked amazing back in the day and still looks line today. I don’t care if we can’t see every pimple on the soldiers they look fine. As for the multiplayer I don’t know what it’s like. I am not interested in it, but if you are then check it out. Rome: Total War is a game that everyone should check out if you are interested in history or if you think you might be interested in the game.\n","January 13","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd seen it advertised some months before that on a TV series that used its engine wherein two teams competed against each other to win an historical battle. That whetted my appetite enormously. When I bought it, I not only spent countless hours playing but also played its add-ons (Barbarian Invasion and Alexander).\nTo me Rome: Total War was the best of the Total War series - a balance between the old 2D strategy of Medieval: Total War and the increasingly eye-candy iterations that came thereafter (though I think Medieval 2: Total War was also very good).\nAdd to this the fact that Rome has more mods than any other in that series (and with more diversity of setting/theme) and you have a game that is highly replayable. I still dip into it after 11 years of owning it! Rome forums still remain populated after all this time, and mods are still being developed for it. That speaks volumes.\nI've had the pleasure of being a RTW modder myself which has only added to the great joy this game has brought. Give it a go.

Improve and manage your economy, infastructure, military, taxes, and more. Quell uprisings and keep your people happy. Lash out upon the world: wage war and wield clever diplomacy to accomplish your goals. Take on the world all at once or one piece at a time: create your empire as you feel fit!\n\nWhen engaging enemy forces for battle in Campaign and when playing Multiplayer(RTS), utilize a variety of faction-unique units to dominate your opponents! There are many, many playstyles to fit your taste; no one strategy is going to be your all-time winner, though some playstyles may be more comfortable for you. These battles can range from petty skirmishes to all-out conflict. No one battle is ever the same.\n\nThe graphics are decently good, the gameplay is superb, all in a single package. The only downsides lay in occasional multiplayer trolls and that the RTS combat can be a bit overwhelming/arcade-like since it can be very fast-paced at times.

Where if your army is inferior you can still win.\nThe battles can involve thousands of soldiers (if played on huge scale), with a maximum of 20 units of soldiers per army. The AI is rubbish, but ignore that. The campaign isn't the selling point of this game, it is the battles. There's online ones too. Whatever.

I loved it because I love games of this type. Which, well thought out throughout, namely: graphics, gameplay interface, factions, troops, historical battles. It's all very well!\nAll the free time I devoted to this particular game, in the flesh, to dvetysyachi eight. Played for weeks without tiring, and with great interest looked at the entire history of all factions. In General, this is a game I would be praised forever, as hitherto, continue to play it. In this game I am a veteran, but unfortunately you won't see it. Speaking of simulated hours. Yes, alas, I played the pirates. And according to my calculations, the time that I played the same (10-15 thousand hours). No less. and no more.\nBecause the fact is that I did not know about this licenzionnoe the game. And the fact that it belongs to the community "Steam". Besides, in the official version, the Russian language is not supported, which is a pity. Now, I would like to go to the overall assessment\n9,97/10\n- Russian language is not supported\n- The inability to play all the factions, (I'm not talking about S. P. Q. R and the Rebels).\nThese disadvantages are not so great that in a loud voice to criticize this game, because the faction that was impossible to play. Already possible, because people already figured out this trick. And once figured out, it means I'm not the one who is madly in love with this strategy.

The standard game is fun and has a highly active multiplayer community, and there are enough mods to let you enjoy the game in any way, from realism mods for the game's time period to fantasy mods and mods that change the time period altogether! Bottom line: buy it now or wait for a sale and snatch it up for anywhere from 1-2.5 dollars. You won't regret it, unless you're already into Rome 2 (I like both). If you're waiting for mods before dipping into Rome 2, you might as well get RTW cheap and play its mods, the best of which are already finished and were patched to perfection years ago (NOTE: there is still active discussion and support for them at www.twcenter.net), with more on the way. I'll only lay down RTW for good when full overhaul realism mods for Rome 2 come out. Don't be put off by its age!

This game is worth purchasing because it is a phenomenal RTS game and a must-have part of the Total War series. The graphics have aged but the game still looks decent and let us face it - the game has always been about gameplay first. Multiplayer is fun but the single-player campaign is what this game excels at. A huge map with three roman factions to choose from initially, later each defeated nation is unlocked as playable in the campaign. The gameplay is divided into 3 parts - cities management, sea battles and land battles. The last one is what this game is about and what makes it truly great. All the units, even siege engines, are nicely done and serve a purpose. The fighting is tactical and fair, although sometimes hard. But nothing beats the feeling of  a victory when you are outnumbered 4 to 1, or more! The AI has some problems but that can be forgiven in this case because it does not break the game at all. On top of all this are the mods, the lovely awesome mods. There are so many it would be hard to write all the good ones but MY personal favourites are Europa Babarorum, Lord of the Rings - Total War & Rome Total Realism.

The standard game is fun and has a highly active multiplayer community, and there are enough mods to let you enjoy the game in any way, from realism mods for the game's time period to fantasy mods and mods that change the time period altogether! Bottom line: buy it now or wait for a sale and snatch it up for anywhere from 1-2.5 dollars. You won't regret it, unless you're already into Rome 2 (I like both). If you're waiting for mods before dipping into Rome 2, you might as well get RTW cheap and play its mods, the best of which are already finished and were patched to perfection years ago (NOTE: there is still active discussion and support for them at www.twcenter.net), with more on the way. I'll only lay down RTW for good when full overhaul realism mods for Rome 2 come out. Don't be put off by its age! RTW stands out as one of the very best (if not the best overall) Total War titles (Medieval 2 fans can bite me) ever, especially with mods!","September 21, 2013","true","342.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

This game is like Sid Meier’s Civilization but more focused on , as the title would suggest , Total War. So, enough beating around the bush.\n\nPros\n\nThis game is absolute genius. Its historically accurate , apart from the part when you , the player , take 100 percent of the area near Rome. The game notifies you when something like a flood or the Pompeii eruption occurs around the same time (I have no clue if Pompeii makes an appearance in the game. I've never gotten far enough). Another great part are the wars. There are , I believe , 3 types of fighting : Army to Army , Army to Town or City , and Fleet to Fleet. Army to Army is a standard type of fighting. Two armies on opposite sides of a field where there will be a fight to the death. This is challenging for me due to all the open space but to others it may be easier. Army to Town or City is where an army is trying to take a town or city by either maintaining a successful siege , starving the enemies inside, or forcefully invading by making Siege Towers , Ladders , Rams , and / or other breaching equipment. Either way , If successful , the army and their faction will then take and rule the captured city. Technically this is a con but , Fleet to Fleet is just borderline impossible , at least for me. In this type of battle, two fleets fight each other on the unrelenting sea. This can be especially dangerous if your ship attacked is a transport ship carrying YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST TROOPS. If this transport ship loses the battle , every man aboard will die. However , there is a fantastic feeling when you successfully take down an army , general , town , or even 1 of 20 factions.\n\nCons\n\nThis game is anything but perfect. For starters , the battle screen. Before each battle , a screen pops up describing the soon starting skirmish along with 3 buttons : Flee and Retreat , Auto Resolve Battle , or Go to Battle Screen and fight the enemy yourself. Tip : Pick Auto Resolve. Fleeing is for Benito Mussolini and good luck trying to figure out the Battle Screen controls. The camera is awful. If you want to move the camera right there is a chance that you could end up looking at the ground. Along with that , you cant simply tell your archers to fire on an enemy. There's this whole process of moving them into position and it's just not worth it. Using a faulty controller to play Mortal Kombat while making a space station in Kerbal Space Program with your toes is easier than taking on an army. Its hard to explain but don't fight in the battles. Another con is the fact that the game goes through almost phases. One minute you have more generals than any other faction with more gold than Scrooge McDuck and another you are losing towns to rebels because of dying Governors without enough cash to fight back , let alone buy half a particle of dirt. This second phase is the main reason I can't get a single faction. The game gives you about 255 years to conquer all factions but even Alexander the Great couldn't win.\n\nSummary\n\nChallenge - 8/10\nReplayability - 8/10\nBattles - 6/10\nPrice - Rome Total War - Worth It\nRome Total War Collection - Yes if Previous Fan\nRome Total War Master Collection - Nope\nRome Total War Grand Master Collection - Not even if you are Bill Gates\n\nVerdict - Buy","August 4, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game has some learning curve for those who have never played any other RTSes but for those who have played other RTSes before they will have no problem getting into this game's controls.\n\nGameplay (on the battlefield) 7.5 of 10\n\nPros.\n\n+Siege battles are very fun and challenging without being too hard.\n+Land battles are Fun and tactical without being too hard.\n+The AI is very good for a game of this age and can keep up with human opponents.\n\nCons\n\n-some units are a bit over-powered such as elephants.\n-some units are completely worthless unless under very specific circumstances such as the incendiary pigs that are only effective against elephants and have a tendency to kill more of your own people then the enemy’s that are killed due to the attack.and they do the same thing that a barrage of fire arrows from your archers could do.\n\nOverall the land battles are very fun to play and are even better if you can find a human opponent to play with (CA recently migrated this game to steam due to the gamespy shutdown.)\n\nGameplay (Grand campaign) 4.5 of 10\n\nPros.\n+can be very fun when everything works well in tandem.\n\nCons\n-Very dated\n-It is nigh imposable to keep your budget in check when at war.\n-diplomacy is clunky\n-auto-resolving battles tends to end with your army losing a battle that anyone could win when controlling the units themselves.\n\nOverall the campaign is good at times and really bad at others.\n\nOverall 7 of 10.\n\nRome Total War is a game of two qualities; on one hand the battles are great and fun to command, on the other side the campaign is clunky, and not all that great at all. The good does outweigh the bad however. I completely recommend this game as custom and historical battles circumvent the horrid campaign and go to what is great about Rome Total War the combat.","November 20, 2014","true","7.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The A.I. can be easy at times but ramp up the difficulty and you may find yourself in a tricky spot during your campain. The game offers many different factions with a big yet easy to follow diplomacy setting and notifications to allow you to build up your own faction.\nToday the Mulitplayer is acomplishable but unless you have a freind that plays you probably wont find another player.\nThe steam version is up to date as you would expect and is a great  and cheap way to break anyone into the total war experience without beating an older PC to death with the high demands of shogun 2 (awesome game as well) and Rome 2 (which was dissapointing).\nRECOMMNEDED.","October 31, 2014","true","46.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This does make it a must play? no... simply because there are other total war games with a better gameplay and smarter AI. However, i must say that Rome original is better than Rome2... Simply because, they focused waaay to much on graphics and dumb zoomed in fighting in rome 2...\n\nWhile this game aint better than shogun 2 or medieval 2... it is better than any other total war and a must for a total war fan. and a classic nonetheless.. It offers much in terms of strategic options and tons of units and factions.... barbarian invasions is still my favorite total war dlc... to the point where, its worth buying this game just for the dlc... yea graphics arent good, but if you are the kind of baddie that likes to zoom in to watch soldiers hit each other... than plz stick to potato games.. with difficulties varying from potato to veryeasy...","August 10, 2014","true","61.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Buy it on disc from a retailer or online, or torrent it. Why do you ask? In returning multiplayer to this game with steamworks, which I applaud CA for doing, they completely destroyed the performance of the game somehow. No clue how they manage to mess up something so simple, but I have about 100% worse performance with the steam version of the game compared to the older, gamespy version. Another thing is that 99% of mods aren't compatible with steam Rome Total War so you're going to have trouble playing your favourite overhauls with this. Serious FPS trouble with a i7 2600k and GTX 960 on MEDIUM settings, i'm talking drops to 10 FPS in not even remotely huge battles. Unacceptable.

You pick a faction in 270 BC and build armies and take over the entire ancient world. The Campaign is spectacular, with good campaign AI and diverse factions. I personally believe that Medieval 2 Total War had the better campaign but thats not the point. The Battles are very good, making you think real time tactics for your army so your enemy doesnt kill you. Wether you like strategy games or not, you buy this game.

Rome 2, shogun 2 ,empire theres quite a few so if you bought rome now would it still be fun to play? the answer is yes, while the graphics suffer because of its age gameplay never dies and theres still an active community who play this game online. Rome feels like it has what it needs to be a fun game while rome 2 on the other hand feels like rome 1 but with aload of junk piled on top, rome is simplistic, fun to play and will have you hooked for hours even days. In its time i would of given it a much higher rating but as theres newer games like shogun 2 that gives you pretty much everything you would want in a RTS the score will be lower but this is still a gem and as a pc gamer you owe it to yourself to check out this game, Overall 8/10","February 28, 2014","true","316.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is an impressive strategy game that lets you live out those dreams of amassing a large army. Now these armies can be massive, carrying at least 1,200 soldiers, and don't even get me started on the reinforcements. However, it's not just a mere 'pick up and play' sort of game. This is a game that requires thinking, as a turnbased strategy game. You start off with a faction in the imperial campaign, where you are then given a large map of Europe that is populated with other factions of that time, such as the Greek, Egyptians, Gauls, Spanish, and many more.\n\nIt is up to you to conquer Europe and extinquish all other factions from the competition. You can also choose to become allies with a few of these factions, if you want. The diplomacy feature in this game provides heaps of options, from trade rights with other factions, to extortion, or you can tell other factions to attack your rivals.\n\nEach faction has its own economy, but I won't get into that. Admittedly, I'm not very good at this part. This requires constructing certain buildings to improve income, such as shrines to Jupiter or crops. You can choose to have each settlement have its own taxation. But set it too low, and your citizens may revolt and start an uprising. This is a game that requires lots of patience, and your experience should not be rushed. But there is no joy greater than conquering that final Spanish settlement, sending hundreds of infantry troops to slaughter them, while your archers lie back, and bring fire to the various buildings until finally, you have wiped their existence from the face of the Earth.\n\nOverall, Rome: Total War is a thrilling experience that you'll find yourself investing many many hours in. Oh, did I also mention that you can play historical battles that took place in real life? Or if that sounds too boring, you can create your own custom matches.","August 20, 2014","true","39.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I used to play this all of the time, back when it was on CD. It provides a ton situations to deal with: politics, diplomacy, family, war, financing, and strategy. Your empire's development is slow to start, but soon after you empire expands diplomacy and senate appeasing is important. Then you have to worry about your new neighbors to the north who also want your land. However, the Senate wants another territory on the opposite side of the empire to be taken. So you have to balance your troops, as you can only afford so much. While that is going on your citizens are upset at the tax rate and need to be subdued.\nThis game is complex and a great starting game for the Total War series.

The graphics and physics engines have become a little dated (2004-based) but if you enjoy the time period or game genre Rome: Total War is a must-play. You can choose between many different factions, each with their own unique play style and units, and recreate history or forge your own path. You can use diplomats, assassins and spies, fleets and massive armies.\n\nDue to the (relative) simplicity of the coding there are mods aplenty from total conversions (think Lord of the Rings) to complete historical-accuracy rehauls, making Rome that much more replayable and unique.","November 11, 2013","true","547.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Your empire's development is slow to start, but soon after you empire expands diplomacy and senate appeasing is important. Then you have to worry about your new neighbors to the north who also want your land. However, the Senate wants another territory on the opposite side of the empire to be taken. So you have to balance your troops, as you can only afford so much. While that is going on your citizens are upset at the tax rate and need to be subdued.\nThis game is complex and a great starting game for the Total War series.

But other wise the game is fantastic, it allows you to work on Strategy and tactics in combat, but also allows you to work on management with a great and powerful empire in the campaign.","May 31, 2015","true","60.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
