The game has interesting visual style, awesome sound and music. It's a competent TBS with terraforming and simple utilitarian combat mechanics.\n\nThe story is very good and the overall lore is pretty epic. The undead here are not a rеtarded reskin of daemons as usuall, but true undead, with their own agenda, not necessary "evil". Especially considering their origin story. Even deamons' faction not just pure evil like everywhere else.\n\nThe voice acting can scare some off, but it is very good and really appropriate to the world of Nevendaar. Sound design is vivid and grimdark. Visual style combines some asian animu tropes with western epic style and adds layer of gritty medieval realism. While the 3D pre-rendered sprites are surely outdated, they are not that bad. And all magic animations are purely awesome.","October 7, 2014","true","0.2"," 78 of 94 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","78","94","0","0"

I started out playing a demo for Disciples II: Dark Prophecy and fell in love with that game's dark atmosphere, music and gorgeous gothic illustration used for the UI and character portraits. I then saw Disciples: Sacred Lands on a shelf in Circuit City. It seemed so unassuming sitting there among all the more recent titles. And yet it was that game that my eyes were drawn too. I paid the ten dollars for the game and walked out of that store feeling as if I had stumbled upon the holy grail. Now things could have gone differently. I figured I loved Dark Prophecy so the first one had to be good too right?\n\nI got the game home opened up the nice little box the jewel case came in and installed the game. A gorgeous cutscene played and before long I was in the game and having a blast. The core mechanics that made Dark Prophecy such a joy were present here. And while the game wasn't quite as pretty as its successor it still was a gem. A diamond in the rough.\n\nToday when there are so many big budget games that turn out to be disappointments. Its nice to see a classic gem like this find new life through digital distribution. If you are a fan of the Disciples series or Disciples II Dark Prophecy you owe it to yourself to play this game.\n\nNow there may be some issues with getting this game to work on modern PC's. But there seem to be numerous ways of editing the ini file to get it to run properly. I imagine you could also try running the game/steam in compatibility mode.","January 24, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Still has a bit of a difficulty curve to it, something in common with it's protoge.  My friends had more trouble with it than I did and it can be a turn off if you don't have a mind that has molded to the setting and playstyle a bit.\n\nFor the most part it was a great first entry in the series and still holds up to it's sequel (and in my opinion much better than the 3rds).

The game offers 4 playable races being the Empire, Demons, Dwarves or Undead. The game is interesting because you start with a hero being a Warrior, Mage or Archer all with their own game effecting benefits and you assemble a party and level them up. You also build up your castle with specific buildings to level up your party, example being Footmen needing a Stables to level up into a Knight. With that said you need resources and to acquire resources all you need is to convert land underneath easily noticed resources.\n\nOne thing to note is: I've played all Sagas(campaigns) all offering challenge, but something I found a little disappointing is some of the maps were reused, just the advantage was flip flopped.\n\nOverall I rate this game 8/10 - Flawed but amazing nonetheless.","May 17, 2015","true","29.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In my opinion, sometimes they seem to bog the player down managing trivial details such as repairing armor, managing backpack space, and the narrative falls far behind. I was pleased to see that this game has an interesting campaign and the gameplay does not bog the player down in senseless micromanaging.\n\nDisciples Gold: Sacred Lands is a pretty good, but dated game. I bought this on a steam sale for $0.79, and I think it will yield many great hours of gameplay. The game seems pretty well done as far as the presentation is concerned. The game play took a little bit of figuring out, but I'd say I've pretty well got it now and I've never read the manual. To me, it reminds me a little bit of warcraft when it comes to the overworld and resource management. The fights play out like a simplified version of a turn based game. You do not really control what actions the players take or the order in which they take turns, but you control who they attack or heal, as well as the ability to skip players or run away. So, in some regards, it plays out like a top down Strategy RPG, but instead of the fight actions being represented merely as points of damage, it goes to a separate fight mode where the player has the ability to influence the outcome of fights. Then after the fight is done, it goes back to the overworld.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend the game, especially if you can get it on sale. 79 cents is a steal, and I'll be looking forward to playing more of this game.","January 4","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
