That being said, I also enjoy triple A title games as well, but also really love the nancy drew series for everything it has to offer in every game in the series. the things I appreciate the most about ND games that I dont see alot in other games is the presence of a mystery plot that you have to solve, and deductive and reasoning skills needed. the lost queen setting is very well done and incorporates lots of historical relevence into the puzzle and plot. the area of exploration is a bit small but otherwise I have no complaints about this game, one of the better games in the series, really enjoyed it. I have seen better plots in the series though. 7/10 from my biased view, but from the view of a mainstream gamer, 6/10","December 2, 2013","true","8.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I've been playing Nancy Drew since the very beginning, and this is just another spectacular entry in the series.

I enjoyed the hieroglyphic translation puzzles and the storyline kept my interest as well.  The artwork is quite good and felt like I was back in the Valley of the Kings again.  This game is enjoyable for adults as well as kids, although some of the dialog is a bit tedious.  One thing I liked is that they don't force you to do the typical "job" like some of the other games in this series, so you can just focus on the mystery at hand.","April 16","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One of my favorites because of the Egyptology! The only issue is they don't give you very many tasks during the game. Otherwise I really recommend this game.\n\n10/10","December 27, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
