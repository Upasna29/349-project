It was insomuch obtrusive that I thought there had to be a twist, yet this game takes itself seriously until the bitter end.\n\n- Subpar and amateurish writing in general. There were so many passages that would have made me laugh my head off if they hadn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off instead.\n\n- The final boss battle was a joke. I won't spoil much when I say that you can't win the first battle and virtually can't lose the second battle "for story reasons", thus revealing all grinding (see below) to have been utterly futile.\n\n- Battles in general are boring. Your only two choices are to either exploit your enemy's one and only weakness over and over again or to die. Not only, but especially the foes in the last dungeon can "one-shot" any character despite his/her setup. Unfortunately, the class system renders itself redundant. Your "mage-born" characters will never be strong enough for the fighter classes and your "fighter-born" characters will never be intelligent enough to use mage abilities effectively vice versa. At least all encounters are visible, but it soon becomes a chore to avoid them (if you plan to preserve your resources for a boss battle).\n\n- Balancing. I hate balancing (foes level with you) in RPGs. What's the point of fighting and leveling when you're as strong as before in relation to your enemies after gaining a level? Reversely, it takes for all eternity to grind/level up enough so you can beat the few optional bosses that have a set level. Therefore, I didn't beat the last optional boss (level 50) for I was only at level 35 at the end of the game after already having played for 70 hours (even though I'm sure this game can - and should - be completed in less than 10 hours).\n\n- Equipment, items etc. are far too expensive in general. There are several instances during the course of the game in which you have to grind for hours if you want to be able to afford the best equipment for everyone - just to find out one hour later that this equipment is already outdated.\n\nThis game may be for you if you need a filler jrpg and can stand (or if you even like) biblical indoctrination. Anyone else shouldn't waste his/her money on this Christian propaganda, disguised as a - at best - mediocre JRPG.","September 10, 2015","false","68.7"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","0"

It has some unique elements about it that makes it stand out form other RPG maker games. Although it seems that they used the default tile sets, they still made very good work of this game for a RPG maker game.\n\nGame PlayThis game as I said above is a very unique kind of RPG maker game. It has some features that normally other RPG maker games never really bother to use and use the default things. This game actually looks like it has been though through and put a fair bit of time into making the game. The story itself is interesting, you switch between 3 characters and eventually they all get together and start a adventure together. It does seem that the story is too fast paced, as it was kind of hard for me to follow what was actually going on in the story. The encountering of enemies is also another element of this game that is unique. You won't be encountering enemies randomly as you walk in a cave or forest, the enemies are roaming around the area and when they see you they go to you and once they are next to you then the battle starts. This concept of encountering enemies makes it less frustrating than random encounters because now you have a chance of actually avoiding the enemies. Now onto the battling system. It is a first-person battling system with other very unique elements implemented. First off while in battle you can change equipment, so say you forgot to equip a weapon you got you can equip it while in battle, other concepts such as information on the enemy when battling them can be very useful to see what their weakness is and to use this to your advantage. But the flaws of this is that sometimes you are just constantly spamming the attack button either 1.) your health is too low or 2.) you defeat the enemies. Also some early enemies are a little too overpowered, such as the Forest Fairy which can heal herself and attack you for a decent amount of damage.  Lastly, I will talk about the controls. Now if you are familiar with RPG maker controls then you will be able to start this game right away, but if you're new you might be unsure what the controls are. Might need to add just a basic tutorial for the controls at the start of the game for people who don't know what the controls are.\nScore (out of 10): 8 - Would like to see a better balance of enemies that make it so neither is overpowered and that it's not too easy, the story is too fast paced to keep up with, and need a basic controls tutorial at the start of the game.\n\nMusic & SoundsThe music is fitting with what is happening at the time, I can tell that some of the music is from the default music form RPG maker but others are custom made which makes it a little bit better than them lazy RPG Maker games. The sounds are just the generic sounds of opening doors ect so nothing really much to comment about there.\nScore (out of 10): 7 - Maybe put some time into making custom sounds for walking on grass and background music\n\nGraphics/Art StyleFinally I will be talking about the art style of the game. As far as I can tell it's using almost all the default tile sets you get with RPG Maker. This is kinda lazy, but I mean making tile sets isn't very easy so I will give the developers some slack for that. Some of the transactions when you walk say to the right of the cave you end up going up. That doesn't really make any sense... but I guess it's just the way that the map was created.\nScore (out of 10): 7 - Maybe a different and more suiting tile set for the game, and sort out the transactions.\n\nConclusionTo sum it all off, I would recommend this game to people who enjoy playing RPG Maker games, but those of you who are new to this RPG Maker games then I wouldn't recommend this to be your first one to play. Slow down the pacing of the story and change some of the music to custom would be create.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 12","true","2.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

Most of the time they aren't that good and so is the case with this game too. The story is rather boring. The "Creator" thing went through the dialogues every now and then, left me with a feeling that the game was made by some hardcore Christian. The writing in general is rather lacking. One thing that REALLY annoyed me what the gal said when the guy passed out after reaching the village at the very beginning of the game. It was just so... Bad. The whole fighting thing is rather bad too. Also, enemies respawn when you exit the area and go back to that area, so in the end (or actually early on) you'll start avoiding combat just because it gets annoying and eats your potions and other usable items.\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc3mumbXPsk","October 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

For me, the killer was the respawn rate of enemies. I like to explore every nook and cranny, and tend to wander a lot, but that is not advisable in this game. Monsters respawn as soon as you leave the map, so returning to the screen you left 2 seconds ago means more fighting, more potion use, etc. Very disheartening. But if you tend to move always forward, then you will probably enjoy it.","March 12","true","1.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The walking animation can be a little awkward in certain parts of the first town. The dialogue is a little bit cheesey and simple, and the story moves fast (so far). But I enjoy the battles, and it has challenge to it with the constant wave of enemies that respawn. So far, not too bad.","January 5","true","2.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The dialogue is all very professional and battles are well-balanced. A lot of thought went into it and lots of people should play this game.","December 29, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

It takes a little bit to get used to the controls and changing settings isn't the easiest thing to do you have to launch the game and then a configuration menu comes up (a bit like rust).\n\nI played less then an hour and the game is a bit boring the story line doesn't seem to be very straight forward and I got lost on which was to go most of the time. The graphics look like alot of time has been put into them and the parts you walk around in make it obvious on what you can and can't walk through.","October 14, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","8","1","13","0","0"
