"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sayasays/recommended/391270/","sayasays","Not FUNKe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sayasays/","60 products in account","[SUMMARY]\n\nFor a game that is free to play, and has very little download time it is most certainly worth your time, if you got 30 minutes or so spare, download this game and play it. Do note if you are under the age of 13, that you need to think carefully before playing this game, because it might scare younger players, but to be honest do feel free to play it, and finish it. Totally recommend: 8/10.\n\n[IN DEPTH REVIEW]\n\nSo, you still have your doubts huh? Well, I’ll explain why it is so great.\n\nThe storyline is so brilliant for an indie horror game, to be honest I hate horror games, but this, was something I actually enjoyed, it has no jump scares (although I did rush the game for the review, I may update it later if there is one, that I may have missed during rushing), and is purely driven about the idea of psychological horror, and that’s what makes it such a compelling storyline, and, despite the multiple chills I felt going down my back, I continued, because I wanted to see what would happen, and how it would end.\n\nIn terms of playability, it is, like most indie games, a pick up and play, the only thing that will make you think, is the complexity of the situation, and not which controls you need to press, the themes of this game is mildly concerning, (not going to spoil anything) and at the end, really makes you think about yourself, and if what your doing is right. I really struggled to get started on this review, purely because it keep returning to my mind, but, that is what the game is meant to do to you.\n\nThe game itself is quite a lot more serious than the clone of games being released every 3 weeks (*cough* Five Nights at Freddy’s *cough*), and is a ton better than whatever they are releasing, so before spending some of your hard earned cash, (or not so hard earned cash, I don’t know how you get money), why not give this a whirl first? Truth to be told, it has more entertainment value than You-Know-What.\n\nMy only complaint about the game would be that the game really could and should have been a great deal longer, the story and plot line has so much room for expansion, don’t get me wrong this game is good as it is, but an update or something to have more of a capitalisation upon the story of the characters (trying not to spoil here), as it was not really explained enough to really give to effective of a cliff-hanger, but is suppose, it is about the psychological effects more than the plot after all.\n\nAddressing re-playability,  it looks the game that you might feel inclined to play and then play again immediately, or after a few weeks of intervals, because the story immerses you so well, (like I said room for expansion) that you really want to replay it, (after this review I’m probably going off to replay it, because it’s so good), but, to be honest, it doesn’t need to be replayed, however, if you got the time, replay it, because it’s like your looking through a completely different perspective, and maybe I would of get FNAF 2 if I had the ability to be the animatronics, but to be honest, it isn’t up my street anyway, (I hate jump scares, poorest way of adding tension, but I’m not a game developer, so what do I know?), but I’m getting off topic.\n\nNext on my list is the graphics, and when I say what you expected from a game that takes barely any time to download, your answer would probably be not much, however, this graphics, enhances the game, and makes it more immersive, it feels older, making you feel it is more unknown the games you normally play, and considering the engine used was Unity free version, you can count me impressed. I think the creator could not be more right with this “It features a unique artstyle that combines elements of pixel horror with realistic lighting effect, which is intended to enhance the surreal atmosphere”. That right there is exactly what it does, the graphic make it feel more real, it makes the atmosphere feel as if it is happening with just you in control of the body, and that the body you control, is you, and you want to know who is this character, and what is he/she doing here? What relevance does it have to the story? How does the title fit in with all this? And that is exactly why you play this game past the opening moments, because you want to know the answer, and you are going to play through this game multiple times just to find out what is going on here. And that is the true beauty of an indie game like this.\n\nLast, but most certainly not least, the music. This tune, fits too well for this game, the eerie sound of the tune fits in perfectly with the game itself, as if the music was made specifically for the game (maybe it was?) because it naturally makes sense for the sounds being played and the game itself, I can’t have any real complaints about this game, because, on all aspects, its indie developer’s dream, because it doesn’t appear to have any bugs, its well-made and fluid.\n\nI really want to say how impressed I am by this, and I give kudos to the creator for such a unique and enjoyable game, that has changed my opinion on all horror games, and the genre itself, maybe I might get those games with lots of zombies and jump scares in it… No. This game is beautifully original, and is hand crafted to a perfect game, and is an absolute gem.\n\nIf you’re still not willing to give this game a go, then… I don’t know, maybe you just don’t like psychological horror, or maybe you’re on your phone or something, and you can’t download it yet, who knows, maybe you’re holidaying in Belarus, and won’t be back for a while.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, good game, well played. Sorry for any mistakes, I’m not fluent English, if you have any questions, or want me to review a game, add me or drop a comment on this, or my profile.\nAnd on that bombshell…\n\nGoodnight!\n\nP.S: I do know this game has been out since March last year, but just wasn’t on Steam\nP.S.S: Totally didn’t find out just now when searching the game to make sure I hadn’t got the wrong game","August 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 244 of 270 people (90%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","90","244","270","32","47"

It's free!" So, yes, let's acknowledge first that the game is free.\n\nBut did I *enjoy* it? Not really. The game is entirely centered around its story, which is told in the form of scattered diary pages that you are obligated to find and read. The story, though, is minimal. It's not so much a story as much as it is a concept. Is it a scary concept? Not really. It's more of a sad and despicable concept than scary.\n\nThe gameplay can be 100% described as follows: 1) Look for a diary page, 2) Guess which word in the diary page is a password for the keyboard on the desk, 3) type it into the keyboard to unlock a door, 4) go through that door into a new room, 5) repeat steps 1 through 4.\n\nDo that about 3 times and the game is over.\n\nIt might have been interesting, but the "gameplay" amounts to a checklist and the story is more of a concept.\n\nBut it IS free.

Good, and evil, are names that signify our appetites, and aversions; which in different tempers, customs, and doctrines of men, are different." - Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan\n\nFingerbones is the first game that David Szymanski made in the horror genre, and he confesses in the game's brief description that he has learned much since completing this project. Still, Fingerbones is a narrative and atmospheric success for a game which wouldn't take any longer than 20 minutes to complete, plus it is free for you to experience.\n\nWe open our eyes to an old bunker, and start our exploration. We are quick to discover some scattered notes around left by a man, a father who supposedly lived here. We know one thing: whoever left these notes to us as bread crumbs all around the house, is one obsessed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over the concept of "societal norms". What happened to him? That is one major spoiler, so if you'd like to find out, you have to spare 20 minutes and discover yourself.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game, in my opinion, serves as a foreshadowing for David Szymanski's future games. The usage of beaming lights, flickering screen and creepy background noises are used conventionally to establish a successful setting. Graphics are very basic, yet they do not fail to deliver the kind of uneasiness that you expect from a proper horror game.\n\nGame mechanics consist of a basic exploration, and 3-4 very easy password puzzles. Is there anything extraordinary about the story? Well, aside being particularly disturbing, the story isn't incredibly interesting. The imaginative or enlightening factor is the concept David Syzmanski decided to build the game over: the true nature of mankind. When given total freedom, away from societal norms and binding rules, human isn't even slightly glorious or benevolent than an ape, a wild animal. This game is a symbolic ode to the theory of men being evil - or primal - at their core. I bet Thomas Hobbes would be proud.\n\nI personally prefer games with more elaborate social theories, but if you have 20 minutes to spare, capable of ignoring some disturbing implications and enjoy atmospheric horror genre, there is no logical reason for not checking this game out. It is free, and it is really good in that context.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 12, 2015","true","0.3"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","49","57","2","0"

Proves that you don't need heavily advanced graphics to make a nice horror story and give you that sense of immersion.\n\nThe game has a simple, blocky, retro-style visual, a look that could easily fall into mid-to-late 90's game, with some nicely added lighting and fog, which adds, at least for me, that "Silent Hill" effect of "I know I need to go further, but I'm scared".\n\nThe great part of the game, though, it's certainly in its narrative, how it's constructed and how it uses sounds to help generate the mood during gameplay. It's disturbing, but not in a gory and visual style, and there are no jumpscares at all, the story brings you the terror without even showing a monster, ghost or whatever.\n\nAlso, while some people might find that this walking "back-and-forth" mechanic is a bit tiring, it's also one of the things that help build the terror in the game, like "ok, I'm going out, but I know I'll have to return and I have no idea about what  I'm gonna find there".\n\nIt's short, but it's a well written story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/391270/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Fingerbones is the first horror game by David Szymanski, the creative mind that brought us such gems as The Moon Sliver and The Music Machine. Originally published in 2013, the game wound up on Steam around a year later. This title is a short exploratory horror mixed with narration in the way of journal pages scattered about. It's up to you to unravel the dark story within, by solving a simple series of puzzles.\n\nI would be lying if I said that Fingerbones didn't keep me looking over my in-game shoulder, amidst the eerie crying of a child and dense fog. I was almost certain that I would see some demon-spawn in kid form awaiting me around the next corner, or behind a door. Needless to say, the thick and immersive atmosphere, however simplistic it may be, really sucks you in during the short timeframe of this narrative story. From the stand-alone mechanical howling of the generator in a well lit top level, to the forlorn cries of a child and creepy silence of the basement, every moment is suspenseful in some way.\n\nThe game uses Minecraft-like textures, in that everything is heavily and purposefully pixelated. Usually this distracts from any horror element that a game may have, turning them into child friendly PG-13 types. Thankfully, that is not the case here; however brief it may be, the chilling story is enough to send a shiver down the spine of any adult. The game only lasts 15-30 minutes at best, and there are only a handful of journal pages scattered about; it would've been nice if there was more story to this narrative-centric experience.\n\nFor a short and free horror title, Fingerbones is one of the best that you'll come across. Prepare to white-knuckle your mouse for the next half hour of entertainment, while anxiously waiting for what may be around the next bend. Take your time, don't rush, and read the pages carefully to fully understand what unimaginable horrors that this poor excuse of a father put his child through. Then, if you enjoyed yourself, go ahead and take a look at the other games from this fantastic developer.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","May 2","true","0.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Smaller, more alternative genres like psychological games, especially these small ones, can change the nature of the gaming industry completely.\n\nIt adds a flavour to gaming, allowing it to be enjoyed by all ages. In a way, it's very comparable to films. You have the blockbusters like Mission Impossible (film) and Call of Duty (game) which are respectable creations, but the truly introspective aspect of games can only be found in these little projects. It can put your ethics in question and  can truly alter your intellectual thoughts.\n\nI definitly approve this game, recommending it to all.\nAnd come on, it's literally half an hour of your time.","August 23, 2015","true","0.3"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","0"

It's simply a shock game that tries to make you disgusted by throwing as many touchy traits within the main character to make you cold to them as possible, then have him commit so horrible that the player is supposed to feel sickened.\n\nI didn't feel that sickening. I felt irritated, really. It's a very cheap trick to toss in too much shock at once rather than let a story happen naturally. Fingerbones doesn't do this. I implore any gamer to consider Serena, which introduces you to a plot that doesn't intend to smother you with shock but gently pull you into a plot and then slowly allows you to see the true horror to the story instead of smacking you repeatedly with it. Heavy handed and overly dramatic, skip Fingerbones. Please. Spooky's House of Jumpscares has more development than this should you complete the required actions. Both games mentioned are free.\n\nThe developer has done better than this. As others have also indicated, The Moon Sliver and The Music Machine are games that are worth being looked at. The Music Machine deals with similar topics you find in Fingerbones and is worthy of an artistic title due to not just how beautiful and creative it looks, but how it bends religious dogma to create a sort of universe that ties into The Moon Sliver but stands alone just as well.\n\nWhile this is, of course, a short game and one that is free, it's just not worth it. While there's nothing awful with the blocky and Minecraft-esque graphics, it's all about the tone set in the story. There was nothing here but a few sound effects and what I imagined would have been a "you're supposed to be scared here" sign. The mouse sensitivity has to be turned all the way down to the minimum on my end and I have to insist, I have a pretty new computer. This game will cause severe motion sickness.\n\nThe only thing I can say about this game that is good is you'll be over this game in about six minutes if you figure things out relatively quickly, but because many of the notes are fairly vague, I highly doubt that will happen.\n\nIt's a poorly made free horror game. It's not quite as bad as All Is Dust, but it's pretty bad.\n\nDon't believe the hype. Go for the dev's later games. At least he handles the topics a bit more tastefully in The Music Machine.","December 21, 2015","false","0.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Chances are, you've put more than half an hour into a lot of them.\nGo put another half hour or so onto them. Don't put a half hour into Fingerbones.\n\nYes, it does build up an eerie atmosphere (good background music), but hardly enough to keep the player interested. Sure, the notes are unsettling, but the story they tell is hardly original, and the supposed "trigger warning" needed is just a buzzword grab for attention. For such a short 'game' trying to be impactful, it pulls a lot of punches it didn't need to.\n\nFurthermore, retrieving passwords and backtracking to the keyboard is tedious, and takes up a fair portion of the ~20mins you'll spend playing this.

All you do is walk around and pick up notes and solve a couple of puzzles. It's really simple stuff, but if you do play the game it will be for the story.\n\nGraphics are simple pixel horror style, but use different lighting effects which gives the game a really awesome look.  Now some of the item models look a bit weird it's still a really good looking game.\n\nAudio is fantastic. The audio will make you feel like you're not alone and it's just really well done. The music is really good to, but there's not much of it.\n\nThe game has really simple level design so I doubt anyone would get stuck in this game. There's not much more to say about it.\n\nThe game is really short. It took me 15 minutes to finish the entire thing and I loved every second of it. Apart from the one playthrough you will do there's not much replay value.\n\nI didn't encounter any bugs what so ever. The game ran smoothly and I highly doubt that anyone would have problems playing it.\n\nOverall Fingerbones is a really good indie horror game. Now I wouldn't say it's better than Moon Sliver, but it's still really good. I highly suggest playing through it at least once. I give Fingerbones a 8/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 31, 2015","true","0.2"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","2"

It talks about taboo subjects that games often beat around and never truly even give note of, where as this game full dives into it head first and let's you in on all that's happening. The atmosphere is dark and the gameplay is quite profound, especially in the terms that of how as you progress, you can feel yourself get scared as if you were actually there and just grip the edge of your seat. I found myself at times simply pausing the game and walking outside for some fresh air because of how intense this game could become, whether it be the haunting and eerie score, the chilling wimpers of a young girl, or the context you pick up on as the ending of this game grows nearer and nearer. There even came a time in which I messaged the Dev simply because of both my brother and I being so afraid that a jump scare was surely imminent that we decided to stop until we knew for sure what the outcome would be. It is amazing and truly something when you have someone such as myself who has spent most of life looking into the paranormal and supernatural, along with my brother who is one play games such as Amnesia and FNAF in the chilling hours of morning with only the dark screeen as his light, to be so scared as to refuse progression until we knew what was possible to come next. I must digress. This game has it all and if you feel up to the challenge both mentally and psychologically, I say get this game and dive into it. Dive like you have never diven before and don't look back.\n\n-Eerie Score\n-Dark yet calm atmosphere\n-Taboo is present\n-Amazing Storyline\n-It's Free!!!","September 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I would call it "interactive shortstory" rather than a game, but I dont mean that in a negative way.\n\nTechnical stuff:\nThe graphic is similar to "Music Machine" (same dev), simple but atmospheric (for example due to the light and dust effects) - I uploaded a few screenshots if you like to have a look.\nThe game mechanic is very easy and pleasant, you move by WASD, look around with the mouse and interact with items by LMB. Thats it.\nA little annoying was that you cant really come near any objects like tables or the like, you stop a meter (~3 feet I guess) away from it as if you walked against an invisible wall. But that isnt a big deal, you get used to it and it doesnt happen very often anyway.\nWhat else? Oh the sound. Theres no voice acting. Your character stays silent and you have to read the notes you find yourself. But for me that wasnt a negative aspect - I liked the silence and found it matches this whole atmosphere perfectly. The backroundmusic could be better to be honest. I found it a little annoying after a while but the game is so short, that you are finished before it really starts to bother you hardly.\n\nContent:\nWell like a said, actually its kind of a short story. You find yourself in a bunker with no information who you are and what you are doing there and have to look around and find out what happend by reading short notes which you find here and there on the map (and that was it. In fact there isnt really anything more to do than reading notes. Thats what I mean by its a story, not a game). By finding new/more notes, the story reveals, till in the end you know who you are, why you are in this place and what happend there. The end.\n\nConclusion:\nI liked it and would recommend it. But ONLY for people who like to read and games in which the story is more important than the gameplay (or even in which there nearly isnt any gameplay except moving around and reading). Its in this regard (or actually in many regards) similar to "Serena" - if you liked this game you will probably also find something you like in "Fingerbones". But if you expect more than a very short story to reveal by reading notes, if you want a game where you actually have something to -do- that effects your enviroment and so on, this game isnt for you.\n\nBut since its free and only takes you 20 minutes... try it.\n\n[If you liked this game and want something similar but more complex, try "[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/359040/]The music machine[/url]". I can really recommend it.]","August 3, 2015","true","0.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I felt like it didn't quite drive the point home enough for me, or leave me with a sense of horror afterwards. So I played it again. And I feel I got more out of the experience this time, but still, I feel that it's missing something. It's all there in the notes, and the story is well layed out (and quite gruesome, don't get me wrong), but I feel like the game didn't quite go all the way for me. I left feeling like the creator didn't quite end on the highest note (no pun intended) and the dread just wasn't quite there for me, even though I feel it should've been given the story and tone of the game.\nHowever, I do recommend this game because it looks great stylistically, the story is well written, and while the horror (for whatever reason) didn't quite hit me as hard as I would have liked, it is a sufficiently atmospheric and creepy game that tells a pretty diabolical story. Perhaps this game will hit others where it didn't hit me.\n\n7/10","August 15, 2015","true","0.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's a short (20 minutes) narrative story.. Well how do I put it.. About mentallity of people it's straight up ♥♥♥♥ed up. You will be finding random notes untill you start heading deeper into the mentallity of the notes. It sorta describes how much people can be ♥♥♥♥ed up and how far will they go with that.. I won't spoil anything play it for yourself. It has a lot of backtracking which is sucky but worth if you like good psychological horror. But I do not, DO NOT recommend it to younger players since they won't even understand the severity of it and if they do they won't feel very nice. The game sends a message of some sort and that is what games these days can't do, it actually makes you think about what can the world turn in to and in what is it turning. It left me feeling uneasy and really is one of heavier themes. Could be I just handle it bad, but it really made me think and feel bad or I don't even know the feeling. Anyways, it makes you feel something, not just your typical JUMPSCARE HERE, JUMPSCARE THERE and ♥♥♥♥ like that.

You explore a small environment, slowly piecing together past horrible events. The problem with this one is this wonky password system that you have to use to access new areas and continue the game. Most of the passwords are easy to figure out, save one cheap one, but you are slowwwwly walking all around a few rooms trying to find clues, backtracking to the keypad, and also trying to figure out what the passwords you enter actually open when you're done.

It isn't a horror game that uses cheap jumpscares to frighten you\nInstead, Fingerbones uses your mind through different notes scattered around an environment that you need to read to uncover the secrets of the place you're in. At the beggining, you don't know who you are, where you are or what your purpose is. After reading every single note, uncovering every secret of this AMAZING but at the same time HORRIFIC\nstory, you finally find out who you are and what your purpose was from the beggining.\n\n\nThe game's main enemy is found right at the end, and this enemy will surprise you the same way as it surprised me.\n\n\nThe horrific story of the game somehow resembles I Am Legend combined with a Friday the 13th movie, although it's very original and the core is just a very tiny bit alike these 2 masterpieces.\n\n\nFingerbones can be finished in about 20-30 minutes, and uses no savegames.\n\nOverall, all i can say is congratulations to the developer for creating this masterpiece. We need more games like these, games that make us think and eventually ♥♥♥♥ with our minds in both a good and a clever way.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, and it definitely made it into my Gaming Hall of Fame\n\nI rate it 10/10\n\n\nBEWARE: IF YOU ARE NOT USED TO HORROR GAMES DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, THE ATMOSPHERE, MUSIC AND GENERAL STORY ARE NOT FOR THE EASILY SCARED!

Just kidding anyhow Fingerbones is a "Psychological Horror" in the broadest sense of the term seeing as how all of your attachment to the characters stems from brief journal entries that were for whatever reason scattered in your end of the world bunker. You are a man coming back to his bunker after a time period where you did nothing or something I honestly don't know. You boot up the game and walk around reading notes and then you pick up a flashlight for seemingly no reason it's pretty useless overall until the very end of the game where it serves as a plot device. So after reading the notes and what not you turn on a generator walk around type stuff into a keyboard jutting from the wall that's connected to nothing. You waste some more time then head to the door you could'nt acess before and head in. You go further down and then realise you can't. Go back upstairs and walk around go back down after becoming frustrated. Get into the hatch and figure out you cut your daughters fingers off as keepsake. Then your light go out, THE END. I really felt nothing throughout this whole game. The notes were bleak and meaningless other than to prove you are playing as an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a man who is having marital problems.

Although, honestly, as I was playing expected it was going to get a lot more twisted than it did... maybe I'm too used to things going to extremes...\n\nAnyway, I only recommend for the little bit of story and because it's free.","December 30, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I booted it up and could not for the life of me figure out what I was expected to do in the very first room. I thought maybe I was supposed to leave after activating the generator but the "Exit" door literally means quit-to-desktop exit.\nI'm glad I went right back in to give it one more shot. I've been following this dev's creations for a while now, and though they are disappoingly short I think the fact that I feel dissapointment at their premature conclusion really speaks to how engaging 20 minutes of gameplay can be. Fingerbones is free, so there is no reason under the sun you shouldn't pick it up and give it a go. My only gripe is that your character moves abysmally slow; if the walk speed was 10-15% faster there would be nothing I would find worthy to complain about.","September 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's good music. Less good are the other non-music sound effects, which were kind of cheesy. The rest of the game consists of 4 rooms, which you have to backtrack through several times in order to progress. Your character moves very slowly, adding to the game time. I think the visual transition between the first room and the cellar could have been done better--I found the cut to black to be much more jarring than the other doors, which you just walk through without seeing any kind of cut.\n\nRather than scary or creepy, I just found the notes, and the story they reveal, to be sad and a little hamfisted. Instead of being unsettled, I was merely grossed out. That's fine for some horror games, but that's really not what this billed itself as. I'm a complete wuss, and was hoping this would deliver on its promise of "psychological horror", but I feel about as affected as I might feel after watching traffic pass by for half an hour.\n\nRating: 1/55: Loved it; 4: Liked it; 3: It's OK; 2: Didn't like it; 1: Hated it","November 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may not be the best free horror game on Steam, but it's a nice game which takes about thirty minutes. However, it may even be shorter! The game is very basic. You interact with notes to find out what's happening, and why you're there at this abandoned bunker. The only puzzle in the game is that to unlock doors you must type in codes, which are found in notes most of the time. So, it's very simple and not challenging, but that's a good thing.\nThe big question is: Is this game scary?\nTo me, it wasn't. I rarely get scared in games. I recently just beaten "Until Dawn" and that didn't scare me at all, even though it is a good game. So that answers that question.\n\nSo, this free horror game is worth a shot, because it is good for a free horror game. It's quick, and you will most likely uninstall it after completing it just so you have that space in your computer back. So, yes, I do recommend this game. After all, if you don't like...it's free.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/furrynuclearwaste/recommended/391270/","furrynuclearwaste","FurryNomNoms","http://steamcommunity.com/id/furrynuclearwaste/","157 products in account","Review	It's a short atmospheric puzzle-horror game (no jump scares) that lasts about 30 minutes on your first try.\n\nYou start out in a room with no information on who you are and how you got there. As you start reading the notes scattered around the building you learn piece by piece of what happened. Also you can pay attention to the setting because it unravels information not in the notes itself. In a sense this game is an interactive story more than a game. The only game play here is walking around and pushing the left mouse button. Once you've found all the clues the game will end and ultimately you have to decide what happened.\n\nResult	It's an ok game that has an interesting story, but it has no replayability because the story is the only thing that carries it. It's not a must play and honestly I think watching an abridged video of it will be more worthwhile, but it's ok if you have some free time. I have a video link below if you want to watch a more humorous playthrough it.\n\nTips	1. There is a generator in the first room\n2. Read the notes for the passwords\n3. Type in the passwords on the computer to open areas\n4. nny is part of a four letter word Still stuck? ->  It's backwards\n5. There is a hidden wall hole in the first room\n\nDiscussion	Lots of spoilers here.  Judging from the bloodied tools and the bloodstained table in the basement I believe he killed her and then ate her. From his notes we see that he's denying it, but if he really did throw her into the woods why is there so much blood in the basement? Also why would he remember her screaming? People dying of diesease don't typically scream. It seems like the storage room is where he cut off her fingers judging from the amount of blood. Then he might have kept her alive while he slowly consumed her which might explain her weakened state.	 That's my take on it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4uYd7Jts2s0","September 28, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

This is his first release in the Incest Mysteries genre, and boy, is this ever a creepy one.  The choppy blocky graphics produce such a chilling level of mad awareness.  And this is just the beginning.  Scattered notes.  Madness.  Hopeless drivel.  Nonsensical rationalism.  End of the world bunkers.   A quick decline out of sanity and morality.  "Freedom" in captivity, incest, ♥♥♥♥, and murder.  A world without anyone where one may do as he/she pleases.  This one has it all.  Surely your woo-hoo thing-a-ma-jiggy down there will get an arousing devilish tickle after you complete this one.\n\nTruly, Incest Mysteries reached a new level of incestuous pedophilic creepiness when David Szymanski came onto the scene with Fingerbones.  His follow-up, The Moon Sliver, expands upon Fingerbones, but it doesn't hold the incestuously creepy vibe  Fingerbones has enduring throughout it.  A third installment has been released, The Music Machine, which I've yet to play, but surely, with all the positive reviews, it appears to be another Incest Mysteries hit.\n\nIf you're into imagining pedophile and/or incestuous relationships with a very young female--or with your own daughter or sister--then look no further to David Szymanski's line of Incest Mysteries games, especially Fingerbones.\n\nDavid Szymanski stands out like no other.  So much Valve has secretly begun a charity fundraiser campaign to pay for a pedophile/incest councillor specialist to council David Szymanski with his incest and pedophile fantasies and inclinitations.\nBut we all know Valve's charity fundraiser for David will fall miserably short of its goal.  Because Valve, at its deepest core, is a strong supporter of David's incestuous and murderous vision of "freedom", and wishes to see such a grand vision downloaded into the minds of their users.  And look at the results: raving positive reviews for David's works, to the lengths and depths of deep philosophy, awe, and praise for his work and vision.  Godlessness continues to reach new heights.\n\nThe simplest solution is for David Szymanski to turn to Christ with all his heart, by calling upon the name of Jesus Christ.  The same with big daddy Valve and his cookie-munching underlings.\n\nThis is lake of fire material.  Turn away, lest you wish to be thrown into it.\n\n","February 19","true","0.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

While it's not overtly scary (haters of jumpscares, fear not - no pun intended), it does build a wonderful sense of unsettledness (is that a word?) and the plot is disturbing at best.  At the end I was left feeling creeped out and disconcerted, which is exactly what I want out of a simple atmospheric game.\n\nSince the game is free and only takes about 20-30 minutes to complete, I'd say it's well worth it.  The only things you need are some free time and the imagination to read between the lines and fill in the blanks from the notes you find.  If you are, like me, a fan of being able to really THINK about a story, you should love this.  (On the flipside, however, if you are the type that likes your story explicity delivered to you word-by-word, you might not be appreciative of this story.)\n\nIf you liked The Moon Sliver, you'll probably like this one as well.

The character isn't believable at all. The existance of the notes explaining all his secret codes don't make any sense. Why would he invest so much in a conveluted passcode locking system if he's just gonna write down the codes to all his stuff and leave it around the house. It doesn't seem very consistent with his character. A character that seems so set on portraying himself as someone all about hard science and rationality.\n\nThe only suspense you get is from the cheap sound effects of a girl breathing, and sounding scared. But the sounds don't even correlate to anything that actually exists in the game.\n\nThe notes are the only real content here, and they're pretty laughable. The character just rambles on and on about some social darwinist crap. Doesn't really make a lot of sense. None of it sounds like something a real human would write.\n\nIf you want a good quick slice of pychological horror, go play The Static Speaks My Name.

The first password is relatively simple to work out, with the aid of several notes lying around that hint towards it. How the hell the creator expected you to work out the second and third, however, I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue. I walked in circles around the room for a few minutes, trying to find anything that may hint towards what the password might be. In the end I looked at a playthrough on YouTube. But the guy doing the playthrough had to tab out to look at the answer on YouTube as well!\n\nIn conclusion, the first room is fun and relatively simple to progress from into the second room. However, unless you possess some psychic ability, I don't know how you can be expected to figure out that in order to unlock the door to the third room, you have to run back into the first room and enter "nnyl" on the keyboard. Maybe I missed some note somewhere, but if that's the case, then it can't be very well placed. I circled the room about six times, and it's a pretty small room too.","August 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PantsuAreWonderful/recommended/391270/","PantsuAreWonderful","Dirst","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PantsuAreWonderful/","248 products in account","I think the best way to describe Fingerbones is "fine".\n\nIt's a short game where you explore an abandoned house place and solve puzzles to access new areas that contain more parts of the story. Classic formula for a storytelling game, but in Fingerbones, you move at a snail's pace between the same two areas for 20 minutes, solving "puzzles" so badly made that they can only be thought of as a filler, some excuse to let the developers say it's got puzzles.\n\nSo, the game itself is pretty bad. I say it's "fine" overall because the plot does involve things that normally you'd never see in games, and I like when games have the balls to reach new ground like that. The game has good audio to set the scene, but the pixel style didn't add anything to my experience.\n\nThe gameplay consists of going between two rooms reading bits of paper left around the place, figuring out passwords to enter into a terminal to unlock a door, and then reading more bits of paper. It's a bits of paper collecting simulator, which is a genre that's been done enough at this point, and it's only redeeming point is its unusual plot.\n\nIt also warns that it's not to be played by people who are easily triggered. ♥♥♥♥ that. If people are getting OFFENDED before they're getting scared when playing what is supposd to be a horror game, then I don't want to live anymore.\n\n\nTL;DR: I don't regret playing it, but I wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't play it again.\n\nPros:\n+ Story is different than the norm\n+ Audio is well done\n\nCons:\n- Stupidly slow movement speed means most of the game is spent walking between two places you've already been in\n- The puzzles are terrible\n\n","August 9, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

I also liked the way the puzzles link with the story of the game and the graphics (they're actually really well suited to the style of the game!).\n\nThe ending was also good with a small twist to it. Some of the sounds gave me a slight shiver too which I think ties in with the fantastic atmosphere this game has to offer.\n\nIf you're looking for something long winded and jumpscarish, don't waste your time with this game. However, if you're a fan of indie games, horror, and not things screaming in the face of the player, I really would recommend it!\n\n9/10\n\n","August 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I guess that's okay, the game leaving you to 'finish' the game in a 'suspense' ish mood. I find this game more depressing and saddening than horror, but that's why I like it. It tries to get to you.

It does require a LOT of backtracking when you contrast with how short the game is. I would love to see a sequal which is a lot longer, or a similar title.

It does require a LOT of backtracking when you contrast with how short the game is. I would love to see a sequal which is a lot longer, or a similar title.

Rather than the typical jump-scare schlock, this is a much slower paced game resorting not on forcing players to hide from monsters or anything particularly action-oriented, it focuses instead on creating a horror 'experience.' Perhaps something akin to a 'Gone Home' of horror games, though don't let that description turn you off, or on.\n\nIt was enjoyable, and I dare say the short length does nothing but help in this case, though I found it rather predictable, and even a bit cliched, and the writing wasn't too great, but overall, it was something I has happy about going through, and was happy about playing it.","August 3, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Like the apocalypse, the game doesn't tell you exactly what happened, but it tells you enough to know that it was seriously messed up.  Definitely check this out. The graphics are nice, the story is obviously the main focus of the game, and the music and sound effects were perfect.","August 3, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","5"

The only psychological aspect of it, however, is the wording of later notes you find, leading you to think one thing, but really end on a rather lame note.

The philosophical point makes sense since the creator's trying to suggest that all these beliefs are a bad way to live your life, but there just isn't enough punch in the end to drive home the point.  To be fair, once the flashlight starts flickering, the game does start to get a little freaky, but a little is all it gets.\n\nMy advice would be to include a new game+ mode where based on your discovery at the end, you can play the game differently to reach another ending.","August 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The last twist at the end surprised me, but only because I wasn't expecting the game to be THAT short and in any case, what of it? How does the big reveal actually change the story?

The thing that mainly gets me on edge in horror games is when you're being chased , and fortunately that didn't happen either in this game. The story the game tells in the form of notes you find is alright, it's definitely disturbing so that's good, though I still don't understand some things.

Pretty creepy when you get down to it and you find out what really happened in the abandoned building. This is great because it doesn't rely on jumpscares or creepy noises (though there is one scream). SPOILERS: so at the end you find out that your character is a likes to do things like dismantle bodies for his daughter dies in the basement and he cuts of her fingers (hence the name), and apparently didn't like her since he compares her to his ex-wife which is probably why he let his daughter starve to death and threw the corpse in the woods.

A chilling way to kill about twenty minutes.  More mechanics could have been incorporated beyond "Find and enter passwords" but I realize this isn't supposed to be a puzzle point-and-click, and it was meant to focus on the main character.

With the game being free, that's enough to warrant a recommendation in my opinion.\n\nThere's not much to talk about with the gameplay. It's just WASD (move around) and interact with objects with the click of a mouse. (Not significantly different from Serena, another free short game.) This game is about exploration and reading scattered texts to unravel a dark mystery as well as learning about the former, celler-inhabitant's psyche. The only true game elements are the clues you must gather and decipher to unlock the doors and progress.\n\nNo monsters and no cheap jump scares exist to startle you. Fingerbones scares you on a deeper level in both your heart and your head. I personally found it so disturbing because the story felt so human...and so real. And this kind of horror, that which echos with reality, tends to stick with you long after.\n\nWith that said, I'm not going to pretend this is a masterpiece. It's only 20 minutes long and perhaps it could've been something grand with more time, development and depth. But as short as it was, I truly think the the developer did a sastisfying job with it.\n\nNote: to get the most out of this short game, you must fully read the texts.

It doesn't faff about with superfluous information or character/world building, but instead pretty much aims straight for its intended target and fires, paying little attention to anything else around it. In this particular instance this really didn't bother me. We're pretty much given all we need to know about the situation and the people involved in the tale, both directly and indirectly, and kept on point with the story the developer wants to tell. Directly, you'll be playing as a man wandering around a... room (the nature of the environment is eventually revealed and is best discovered by the player, but at first it appears as a relatively non-descript living area with scattered furniture, boxes and notes). Indirectly, you'll be learning about the people closest to him and the roles being played by both the people and place.\n\nGameplay consists of reading notes that fill in the details while you sniff around the dwelling and occasionally flick switches or enter codes on a keyboard to gain access to certain things. Unless you immediately walk out the door behind your starting point, it should take you no more than 20 to 30 minutes to finish and has little real incentive to revisit, unless you just want to breathe in the incredibly unsettling atmosphere so masterfully constructed here. With the intentionally low res, pixelly art direction mixed with its effective lighting and chilling audio, it had me on edge for the entire duration of my time with it. That's easily the best thing about the game. The worst thing is, well... I hate to say it, but... pretty much everything else.\n\nThe problem I had with it is, after all that work spent crafting a tone and having the player right in the palm of your hand; being able to make their skin crawl and constantly have them looking over their shoulder, it just never actually does anything with it... nothing actually happens. The store page description does state there are no jump scares and it's more about psychological horror rather than something more manifestly horrific, but I was at least expecting some kind of pay-off to everything, for there to be an actual event to speak of, but there's no such thing here. It was a real disappointment, and more than anything, such a waste as well.\n\nI may be mixing up my quotes here, but I think Hitchcock used to describe the tension in his movies and its effect on his audience as being like blowing up a balloon. It keeps building up more and more, bigger and bigger, and with it, the audience's expectation. But you can't keep doing that without end, there has to be a release for that tension, a pop or a bang to finally get it out of your system and kill any sense of expectation, only then can you begin to build it back up again. The problem here is there's no bang, it just... ends. Right at the final moment when you expect a big reveal or something of consequence, be it an event or some information, it merely fades to black and the game closes. There's no sense of closure to proceedings and as a result I was left feeling pretty empty and unsatisfied by the time it ended, having no release for all that built up tension and anxiety it worked so hard to create. To its credit, it at least didn't resort to cheap scares or have any silly plot twist or ineffective monster, but then, it didn't really have anything else, either.\n\nI wish there was a Neutral verdict to click on for these reviews, and I'm so close to wanting to hit No instead, but given that it's free, it's competently constructed, is bold enough to approach some disturbing themes that are rarely ever tackled in other games (a lot of praise has to go to that especially), and the fact that it's the developer's first release (described in his own words as an experiment), I'm inclined to think it deserves a little more leeway than most. Plus, as much of a let down as it was, it still isn't actually bad at all. David Szymanski very much seems like one to watch, though, and I'll definitely be playing his other releases sometime too as they all look promising and other reviews for them seem reassuringly encouraging, but for this, at least, it's a semi successful attempt that holds lots of potential but sadly fails to truly capitalise on it.","November 9, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The last twist at the end surprised me, but only because I wasn't expecting the game to be THAT short and in any case, what of it? How does the big reveal actually change the story?

FIngerbones is a very short game, but if it were any longer, repetition would surely set in.\n\nHonestly, this is miles ahead of all of the "horror" nonsense that is squelched through Greenlight these days, and better yet, it costs not a penny!","November 30, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the atmosphere this game creates! Visual and Audio were an amazing combination. Fingerbones has simple puzzles and very rewarding in my opinion. I played it at 2am with the lights off volume turned up. Since I allowed myself to be fully immersed in the experience I really wasn't sure what was going to happen next. Sound effects are great and really added to my fear of the unknown. The game deals with some very horrific ideas. One of the more ironic points is that the game maligns individual perspectives on morality yet throughout the game the character's moral perspective is what justifies his actions. Fingerbones feels like it should be a section of a larger game with the areas of development that are suggested throughout the game.","February 28","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're apprehensive, you can hear something that sounds like a ghoul or a wraith, otherworldly.  It shocks your senses in the right way, and it never betrays you with a cheap RAHHH jump scare, it keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering if and when something terrible might happen.\n\nSomething terrible does happen, but it's based on really good use of video game mechanics, and not on crappy fluff where you get assaulted with Alma from F.E.A.R. or Kayako Saeki from The Grudge.  Instead, this game will freak you out in the right ways.  The only thing I might criticize is that the game's writing is a little too revealing at the beginning.  The game could pull back from a few of the plot reveals so early on (as I was able to easily see what was hiding), but I suppose at the same time, it leaves you with the apprehension of what's to come, so maybe it's not such a bad thing.\n\nIn the end the monster is revealed, but if you hadn't spotted it already, you'll wonder why you hadn't.","November 21, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know if that is on purpose as if you are "adapting" to the darkness, but it was those moments that broke the fantasy for me most. But the way that the 'fog' affects you and the lighting from the windows quickly drew me back in. Not too good if you look at it closely, but very good for being a free game.\n\nThe sounds are spooky. I was actually talking with a friend of mine while playing it at some point, and the sounds alone made me stop and go "dude, is that you making that noise?" "no." "oh... ♥♥♥♥. I'm so screwed! *panics*" There were multiple times I panicked and ran because I thought I heard someone breathing in my ear and that there was a monster at the end of the hall in the tool room!\n\nThe lack of jumpscares or monsters put me off a bit. When I go into a horror, I want to feel like prey. I want to feel hunted and having to watch my back all the time. I did watch my back because the sounds was just that good, but by the end I realized it was a bit too easy there. All the same, I read in the description that it was based around plot, so that is something I will accept as being me expecting something I wasn't going to get to begin with. Still, the fact that the sounds and lighting made me think it anyway is a good thing.\n\nThe plot itself proved to be the biggest weak point and disappointment by the time I was done. It had everything it needed. Enviroment was good, a sick villain, a clear innocent victim... there was a clear, well-written progression into madness within the reading material, but it lacked that extra push to really bring it all together and make you go "wow". It lacks that extra something to take everything and tie it together in a good knot. That realization. That final moment of clarity. It does TRY to bring the realization, but the way it does it was lackluster enough for me to go "okay. I get it... wait? thats it?" instead of "wow." or "oh ♥♥♥♥..."\n\nIts like putting a lot of really good puzzle pieces together and not quite having them form a clear picture that makes it all worth more than the sum of its parts. Instead, with this Indie, I would say it IS the sum of its parts rather than more.\n\nThe puzzles themselves were... both good and bad. I had to use my brain, even after there is a clear simplicity to it, in order to figure them all out. The way the puzzles work requires you to analyze, backtrack, and pay close attention to the plot, which is very good. However, there are two things that put me off in the end. 1. The puzzles are all the same. There is a small amount of variety, and intelligently done, but they are all from the same molding. 2. You walk the entire time.\n\nThe fact that you cannot move faster than a crawl really really put me off and kept me from enjoying it as much as I wanted. The fact that I had to keep backtracking to reach previous notes to analyze and study, and having to take several minutes just walking to accomplish that each time, really bugged me.\n\nThe size of the enviroment itself does HELP with how fast you walk. It bugs me you cannot move any faster, but the game maker did keep the enviroment compact enough that it doesn't feel as bad as I described. Its just something that will bug you when you feel that walking back and forth so much is a chore.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game. It has lots of good qualities that make it charming and definietely worth a 30-minute experience, just a bunch of little things that bug me to death enough to say it is not worthy of a price tag. Esspecially when you consider the length of the story itself.","August 28, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I thought it was time well spent; albeit a short amount. That said, once you play it a single time, that's all it takes to get the whole experience. No replay value here.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Ambiance/Atmosphere: Very good atmosphere lends a dark tone to the place, set against the glowing, radiant light from the windows. Nicely done. The added touch of music, and girlish cries adds authentication to the experience, making it that much more twisted a depiction.\n\n+ Story: The underlying story is dark, and really sits well with the ambiance/atmosphere of the place. Although it is a seemingly shallow story, it leaves a lot of questions to the gamer about how/why things went the way they did for the protagonist, and what coerced him to become the man he ended up as.\n\n\n=======\nDo I recommend?\nYes.\n\nIt's a fairly quick, disturbing play through, sure to give any horror fan a quick-fix of what they crave.\nNicely done~ :)\n\n(Uninstalled).","August 31, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is short, and one of the clues is a bit obtuse and can take some figuring out. The lighting is very atmospheric and- let me make this very clear- DARK.

Going up the stairs after going down is very frustrating, you move at a snails pace, I thought maybe this was a decision but I'm leaning more towards it's something in the character controller as it gives that "pushing through" feeling that box colliders in Unity will often give if the controller isn't accounting for something.  Maybe not casting enough rays or something, allowing the character's collider to move into the surfaces temporarily and move through like in "sludge"\n\n2.  The sound of "errrrt" when you enter a correct password is initially... confusing.  This seems like the noise it should make when you incorrectly enter something, as incorrectly entering something yields no noise.\n\n3. I very much enjoyed the soundtrack and how it was done by having tones placed throughout the environment as actual audio emitters, allowing you to control the soundtrack in a sense.  However I noticed that some of these samples gave a clicking/popping sound when repeating.  That's a sign of the sample not being perfectly seamless or not restarting at the proper point (if it is)\n\nIt could be great, but the clicking noise to me was very grating from the soundtrack.  The sound of the generator was also a bit grating and too loud in my opinion.  Moving slowly by it felt painful wearing headphones.  I am leaning both ways on this one.  For someone who is into this style of game I'd tell them to play through it as it gives insight into a few great things to do in this genre, but there's also a few things that very much bothered me.  For someone new to the genre I would definitely not recommend this, as I feel it could leave a sour taste in their mouth.  Kairo seemed to have a similar atmosphere but was MUCH better in its execution.","August 16, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

However, I don't feel as though the story is up to the standard of the developers later games. The narrative of the came is centered the caricature of a (secular?) man who fantasized about being the last man on earth who could be free to do whatever he wants, and his sick interactions with his daughter. Written from the perspective of someone who obviously disagrees with the type of person the father is, he's winds up being nothing more than a one  dimensional monster. Which is a shame because if his fall was more nuanced and we could find ourselves sympathizing with him, then it would make the end result all the more disturbing.

The notes written are utter gibberish and ruin the atmosphere of this product. There are some amiable qualities, yes it is kind of fun to walk around solving the game's puzzle.

If you're going to write really philosophically dense blanket statements like this to try and design a character who sounds like he's trying to be clever, what you end up with is a character who sounds like he is trying to be clever, but is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So instead of having a spooky atmosphere, I have an impression in my head that I'm chasing around the diary entries of some sexual assault victim whose failing philosophy class. And alongside that element of weapons grade autism the pacing, that's not scary at all.\n\nBut it's funny to read them.

Still i would not recommend playing it simply because I didn't enjoy it too much.\nIf there was a guy handing out free tshirts with only one arm I wouldn't recommend you getting any either - because I don't think you'd enjoy them (except if you only got one arm obviously).\n\nWhy didn't I enjoy playing Fingerbones?\n1) Walking is much too slow. Yeah, I know at the end it makes sense since the dude is starving. This is a pain in the ♥♥♥ especially since you have to go back to the keyboard all the time.\n2) I didn't find the flashlight but was able to use it later on anyway.\n3) I was able to guess the last password that opens the latch to the cellar just from finding the note on the chair in the second room. I didn't even mean to be a smartass, I just thought this was the way the game wanted me to solve the second puzzle. Some might argue this contributes to the concept of a free world, but it pretty much made me miss the whole plot (I read a walkthrough later making me realize I this.) so it has to be be considered a huge design flaw. The game tells a linear story that can't be altered. Being able to take a shortcut makes one miss out on the story. That's not a good thing. Why isn't the game designed in a way that makes (accidentally) taking a shortcut impossible? Two soluitons to my problem just off the top of my head: Cellar latch isn't in the second room or can't be opened until the last page is found.\n4) Just from the items on the table in the middle of the first room it was pretty easy to guess the guy physically abused and killed his daughter for reasons of insanity.\n5) The story itself (even without missing most of it) is pretty dull: Guy comes back to his bunker where he and his daughter seemingly survived some kind of catastrophe that wiped out most of humanity. He rediscovers the story of their life in the bunker by reading notes, seemingly from a diary. (Why didn't he remember his story anyway? How did he forget his passwords? Playing as someone else investigating what happened there would have made much more sense.) This story reveals he has/had some kind of mental disorder (identified as depression by the game. Not being an expert on psychopathology I would rather guess something in the spectrum of Schizophrenia.) making him think it would be a good idea to act purely practical, develop strange egocentric, pseudophilosophic and nihilistic views and let out his anger, frustration and sexual urges on his daughter. The exact storyline is a little blurry: Either a) his daughter dies from the abuse and he completely loses it thinking to abolish human nature and reestablishing some sort of primitive law of survival means freedom (extremely typical 2deep4u-♥♥♥♥), or b) he looses it and then kills his daughter because he abolished humanity and needs to let out his anger/sexual frustration. Oh yeah, also he was afraid of his daughter eating his food. Another good reason to kill her. Maybe he also ate her? No, we learn from the last page we find that he threw her body in the woods. Shouldn't he have eaten her since he abolished humanity long ago? Not so practical afterall, huh? Anyway, he kept her fingerbones as a symbol of sorts to his liberation. (Why those? Makes no sense? Yeah, but who cares!)\nAt some point after that he got out of his bunker, survived a little, felt the need to return, got controlled by the player and upon dying in the cellar of his bunker, right next to where his daughter died, despite still hearing her screams found a feeling of freedom and peace (2deep4u again). If I missed or misinterpreted any of the story please feel free to comment and tell me so.\n6) The riddles were ridiculous. Just finding all the notes and reading them is enough. I understand they're the game's way of forcingguiding one through the story, but just making them that easy is a great waste of potential. The concept also fails as stated in 3).\n\nI was happy there weren't any jumpscares though. Thanks a lot for that. Even though I got screamed at by the guy's daughter a little (ambient noise) I'm happy the designer didn't take that road trying to enhance his game by putting in random shockers. Working with suspense is often better than giving away too much.\n\nThanks again to the developer for releasing this game for free. It killed some time and made me write a review.\nEven though I didn't like it too much it is far from bad for a first game made entirely by one person.","October 14, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's creator tried to set a unsettling atmosphere, and if it wasn't for the minecraft-grade graphics ruining it, he could've achieved that goal. However it's hard to feel unsettled by just ambient music and blocky textures. Sure, it's a free game, but to get your audience really scared, you have to have them be absorbed into the world. The graphic level of this game doesn't nearly set that world up.\n\nAlso, as for the story setting a creepy tone, have you ever watched a film, and within the first few minutes you managed to predict the rest of the whole film? By the time you read the second note on the first floor, you've already figured out what happened, which removed the creep factor because now you know what to expect.\n\nFingerbones was a good start, and I feel with a few more games under his belt, the creator could make something really special.","August 4, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The audio was great and it helped create atmosphere pretty well. I didnt find any bugs as far as resolution settings or what little menu options are given.\n\nAs far as the story, I wish it were fleshed out a bit more. There are few notes, and they dont explain much about the story. All I got was that it was a father and his kid in the bunker because something happened. Unless I somehow missed a note, for all we know it could be zombies, it could be an a-bomb, it could be the father is just crazy. Wasnt really specified one way or the other which is something you would think he would mention at least once.\n\nAll of that said, what little story we were fed was pretty good. You start out exploring a room and reading the notes, then putting in passwords to a keypad attached to the wall to enter different rooms for more password hints and story notes. The story is told entirely through notes and objects you can see in the game.\n\nSo I guess it comes down to if I would recommend it. If you are looking for a short (30 mins or less), creepy story, then Id highly recommend it, especially since it takes only a minute or two to download. Its rough around the edges, but if you can look past that and look directly to the story, its decent enough (actually, Id like to see it remade, but with more notes/rooms/story meat. It has great potential).","September 17, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I decided to play this game because i am a writer and thought i might try getting into more horror games for the sake of one of my current writing projects (which is horror-based). Fingerbones, i'm happy to say didn't dissapoint.\n\nWhile the game is short and probably meant to be completed in 10 minutes or so, i spent an hour eating up the scenery. While basic and somewhat reminicent of Minecraft, the graphics formed a very good atmosphere. It's dark and mysterious and somewhat run down. The lighting in the rooms was also brilliant. The sunset you see as soon as you start the game up is GORGEOUS and i haven't seen many horror games that greet you with something as simple yet beautiful as a sunset. So that was a nice change... The gameplay over all is pretty mucha  walking simulator (or in this case, a back-tracking simulator) as you'll be going back and fourth to a small computer (well, technically just a keyboard) to type in code words to advance in the game. And by advance, i mean more just going into other rooms... Granted, as a writer i understand why some games are made and this developer was trying their hand at creating a narrative driven game, which i totally don't mind. I love games with story. For a first attempt at a narrative-driven game i wasn't really dissapointed. From a writer's perspective i noticed some flubs here and there but there is a lot worse fiction out there and the writing here fit the atmoshpere. The game itself also has a few tropes associtated with a first attempt to have a narrative-driven game (such as only using notes or text to convey the story, waking up in a mysterious abandoned location, ect), but i didn't mind that much because it was the dev's first try and I came for the horror elements of the story.\n\nThe character the player takes on is a scientist who has witnessed what he believes is the end of humanity and he has woken up in a bunker and through scattered notes do we the player find out more about the story. The notes are all we get in terms of story so they're all we have to go on to get an idea of the setting and the character we're playing as. Through the notes we find out he has a daughter who he had custody of when everything came crashing down and i won't spoil what happens from there... This character we play as is interesting, from both a scientific and writing perspective, it's not a character we see very often. He is deeply involved in science and is devoted to his work, he can admit that maybe having a child wasn't the best decision in his life and seems geuniely unsure of how to take care of his daughter during this disaster. We usually see a character like this as a villian rather than a main character, so that's a nice change. We're delving into the thought process and mental state of someone who only knows of science and can't really think outside of that structure.\n\nOverall, this game is supposed to be surreal horror in it's narative. Honestly, i like it :) It's my kind of horror, like something you'd see in a foreign horror film. American horror films try to scare you with an antagonist or a monster, but foreign horror films (like ones from Asia) try to get you invested in the atmosphere and the goal isn't always trying to scare you, but more to get you into the story and narrative. The game (as short as it is) kept me thinking the whole way through and though it's not scary in the typical sence (you won't be seeing any Five Nights at Freddy's style jumpscares here), it got me to care and feel somewhat afraid for this scientist and his daughter. It was more the atmosphere that scared you, the sound of a girl crying in the distance, the ambient humming of a generator and a beep from a keyboard, finding the titular fingerbones hidden away...\n\nAs a lover of games with story, the only bad thing i have to say about the game is that it does become more of a back-tracking simulator very fast. You're constantly going back to the keyboard on the first floor to type in code words to advance and go to different locations. But the game was always intended to be about narrative and completed in one sitting, so i could easily let this slide.\n\nIn conclusion this was a short little narrative driven horror game which was FREE to play. I'm happy to say i really like it despite some of it's flaws and i'd be happy to see a fuller version of the story (maybe with a bigger map to play with). Good job dev, i give Fingerbones 4 fingerbones out of 5! AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT FREE!","September 9, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So while the idea is a bit haunting, as well as the execution, I would have liked a little more story and for that reason, I can't really recommend it.\n\nHOWEVER.

However, I don't feel as though the story is up to the standard of the developers later games. The narrative of the came is centered the caricature of a (secular?) man who fantasized about being the last man on earth who could be free to do whatever he wants, and his sick interactions with his daughter. Written from the perspective of someone who obviously disagrees with the type of person the father is, he's winds up being nothing more than a one  dimensional monster. Which is a shame because if his fall was more nuanced and we could find ourselves sympathizing with him, then it would make the end result all the more disturbing. Overall it's a good little horror gem, and definitely worth the price.","October 6, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The audio was great and it helped create atmosphere pretty well. I didnt find any bugs as far as resolution settings or what little menu options are given.\n\nAs far as the story, I wish it were fleshed out a bit more. There are few notes, and they dont explain much about the story. All I got was that it was a father and his kid in the bunker because something happened. Unless I somehow missed a note, for all we know it could be zombies, it could be an a-bomb, it could be the father is just crazy. Wasnt really specified one way or the other which is something you would think he would mention at least once.\n\nAll of that said, what little story we were fed was pretty good. You start out exploring a room and reading the notes, then putting in passwords to a keypad attached to the wall to enter different rooms for more password hints and story notes. The story is told entirely through notes and objects you can see in the game.\n\nSo I guess it comes down to if I would recommend it. If you are looking for a short (30 mins or less), creepy story, then Id highly recommend it, especially since it takes only a minute or two to download. Its rough around the edges, but if you can look past that and look directly to the story, its decent enough (actually, Id like to see it remade, but with more notes/rooms/story meat. It has great potential).","September 17, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this game has a weak story.\n\n[Spoilers ahead]\n\nThe protagonist writes diatribes of generic ideology of the disaffected, disparages emotion in favor of reason, and fails to see his ex-wife and daughter as human beings. Okay, but this has really been done before.\n\nAnother story about a man who kills a woman. Correction, incestuously rapes his daughter then kills her. What if the story was from Katie’s perspective? What if it was about her struggle with an emotionally and morally empty father? What if it didn’t end in her murder? Was there any way for her to triumph? This would have been far scarier as a story if the protagonist was trapped in a bunker with an attacker and had to survive, and furthermore, would have been a more fully developed concept as a story.\n\nWas human society really destroyed, or was this an excuse to kidnap Katie? I can’t tell. Maybe other players understood this fully. If the father left the bunker and returned, where did leave to if civilization was destroyed? This could be an interesting question for the player to think about, but in order to say “yes, the writers cause us to ask this question purposefully”, they would have had to confirm if civilization was actually destroyed or if it was a delusion. Why are there windows on a bunker? Or was the cellar technically the bunker?\n\nWhy did the father return to the bunker to read his own notes? I understand it is for the purpose of enabling the central concept of the game, but it doesn’t make that much sense as a character motivation. Perhaps if he had returned for the fingers, the souvenir of his kill, it could have made more sense. And why does he just lay down and die at the end? Most people don’t just lay down and die. And the reader suddenly getting a third person narrative telling them the father laid down and died seems sloppy. There are methods of storytelling that could show the reader this. Is the father’s laying down and dying supposed to be an expression of remorse? If so, how did he get to a place where he could even feel remorse? That would be a good story to tell about his character.\n\nI understand the developers were going for a Hitchcock-style ending that made the player go, "Oh! I was playing the killer all along!", but it feel flat and wasn't really a suprise. In order to do this, you have to give the player/reader misdirects: you have to convince them that the identity of the explorer is someone other than the father, while laying clues that in retrospect make sense when we finally learn it was in fact the father.\n\nI support and admire developers who have the courage to make their own games. But, I would recommend taking the draft of your game’s story to a writer’s workshop before spending a lot of time building the game. Video games are another medium that has writing at its core and I think having a critical eye on the story you are writing with a mind to its creativity and subtext would serve the developers well in the future.","September 3, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't want to spoiler anything, but if you are a very sensible person, maybe this is not the game for you.\nAnd I don't mean there are gory or terrifying jumpscares, but the story itself can be very disturbing.\nThe horror element is build only on the psychological level, and the only 'true' scares in Fingerbones are some sounds.\n\nThis kind of horror build-up is what I truly like in Fingerbones, since there are very few games that have managed to do that so well.\nThe anxiety is created as you read the notes and discover the terrible story of the protagonist and the place where you are, and the horror (or disgust) as you realize what has appened.\n\nBut, in my opinion, this is also the main flaw of this game: the focus on the story make it a bit sterile.\nThere is the story, and nothing else, and the plot itself is not completely explored as it deserves.\n\nIn the end, Fingerbones is not a bad game, and in many ways it succeeded where others have failed, but, it leaves the feeling that there is something missing, and the story could have been explained and expanded better\n","August 19, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the game being free, that's enough to warrant a recommendation in my opinion.\n\nThere's not much to talk about with the gameplay. It's just WASD (move around) and interact with objects with the click of a mouse. (Not significantly different from Serena, another free short game.) This game is about exploration and reading scattered texts to unravel a dark mystery as well as learning about the former, celler-inhabitant's psyche. The only true game elements are the clues you must gather and decipher to unlock the doors and progress.\n\nNo monsters and no cheap jump scares exist to startle you. Fingerbones scares you on a deeper level in both your heart and your head. I personally found it so disturbing because the story felt so human...and so real. And this kind of horror, that which echos with reality, tends to stick with you long after.\n\nWith that said, I'm not going to pretend this is a masterpiece. It's only 20 minutes long and perhaps it could've been something grand with more time, development and depth. But as short as it was, I truly think the the developer did a sastisfying job with it.\n\nNote: to get the most out of this short game, you must fully read the texts. Don't just skim for clues.","August 6, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

IT'S FREE, so why not try it out!\n\nStory: The story was slightly confusing, but another playthrough (which, after knowing what to do, should take less than 10 minutes) will get you up to par :) As you can see in the playthrough at the bottom, my first playthrough didn't go so swell lol. I won't spoil anything, but the character you control is buried in research with his daughter in mind to keep him going. He may or may not be slightly insane... (Or that's what I interpret the story as, it may or may not be right O_o)\nGood work :)\nRating: 9/10\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is also simple: walk! There's no jumping or sprinting (which would have been kind of nice) and interact with notes to read. It would have also been nice if items that were interactable were more distinguished from the non-interactable-environment, but they're also pretty obvious to see and find so it's not a big deal XD nothing I can really point out that is bad. Puzzles were simple yet DIFFICULT (or I am just really slow hehe~)\nRating: 8/10\n\nGraphics: Let's be honest. This isn't exactly 1080p HD XD that's not really what this game is focused on, so I'm simply not even going to rate it!\nIf you want a reference, it looks a little like Minecraft without all the blocks.\n\nOverall: decent puzzles, great story, creepy environment, simply great! It's free, so try it out for yourself!

The whole thing was just so bland that by the time I reached the end, I really didn't care. There was no shock value or horror to this other than the mild eerie-ness.

I downloaded the game, expecting at least the promised half-hour of game time, a deep, comprehensive story, and something actually scary to occur(admittedly, I want games to be ♥♥♥♥-your-pants frightening, and am often not satisfied in that respect). Instead, I beat the game in less than half the promised time, and again to see if I missed something, got a boring story about the last man on earth visiting a cellar where his family died before he removed their fingers and stored them in a ♥♥♥♥ing safe, while talking about morality and ♥♥♥♥ in notes for no apparent reason other than the commonly percieved amorality of actions unknown for most of the 10 minute game, and was practically bored to tears moving at the pace of a beached whale through the environment to a conclusion about running out of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ batteries. The only opportunity for a good scare is in the cellar, when the light starts flickering, and nothing happens. Hell, I practically ran through the cellar, to see if a second ending occurred by leaving before the light goes out, and discovered it arbitrarilly shuts off, even if it hadn't flickered yet, leaving one to the same ending no matter what. So, I repeat my earlier statement; Really? What the ♥♥♥♥ was the point of this game, and why is it so well liked, if it's possibly up there with Pregnancy as some of the worst things on Steam?","August 26, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

IT'S FREE, so why not try it out!\n\nStory: The story was slightly confusing, but another playthrough (which, after knowing what to do, should take less than 10 minutes) will get you up to par :) As you can see in the playthrough at the bottom, my first playthrough didn't go so swell lol. I won't spoil anything, but the character you control is buried in research with his daughter in mind to keep him going. He may or may not be slightly insane... (Or that's what I interpret the story as, it may or may not be right O_o)\nGood work :)\nRating: 9/10\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is also simple: walk! There's no jumping or sprinting (which would have been kind of nice) and interact with notes to read. It would have also been nice if items that were interactable were more distinguished from the non-interactable-environment, but they're also pretty obvious to see and find so it's not a big deal XD nothing I can really point out that is bad. Puzzles were simple yet DIFFICULT (or I am just really slow hehe~)\nRating: 8/10\n\nGraphics: Let's be honest. This isn't exactly 1080p HD XD that's not really what this game is focused on, so I'm simply not even going to rate it!\nIf you want a reference, it looks a little like Minecraft without all the blocks.\n\nOverall: decent puzzles, great story, creepy environment, simply great! It's free, so try it out for yourself! See what you think of it :)\n\nThis game is about 8.5/10 for me :)\n\nA playthrough of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f19b3dgiw1k","August 23, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is obviously meant to be a horror game, and I have to say it does it's job pretty well at some points. Some critics might like this because this is more physcological horror like in games such as Silent hill 2. But the tension doesn't build up to that point, I would say.\n\nPuzzles are relativly simple and easy, didn't take that long for me to figure that out. To be honest there really isn't that much to do in this game, just walk and find notes of the dude's daughter really boring actually. Also a word of advice have a sprint or "walk faster" button the game can get really boring and dull, it can really kill the subtley and pacing in the game.\n\nBut there is a bigger issue in the game, there are no jump scares. Now you might have lost all seriousness at this point, but I am serious, what is the point of building all that tension if nothing jumps out at you? Now you did a fantastic job on atmosphere, a little dull on pacing, but what's the point of building all that tension up for nothing? Now this might be one of your first games and I can understand that, that's why I am giving you this review.\n\nMy advice have jumpscares in this game, but don't make them as preditcable as most indie games. MAKE THEM UNPREDICTABLE. But like I explained it is kind of worthless to have all that tension build up for nothing, because this game didn't scare me, good story, nice atmosphere just nothing to really be scared at.\n\nBut hey I'm just a guy on the internet so I don't know anything. But this is a lot better then the poor excuses for indie "horror" games, like "evil" or "the room" so over all I still really enjoyed it, a lot better then other indie games.\n\nOverall score: 75/100\n\n","August 22, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game takes place in what seems like a basement. You are given no apparent goal, but the game is quite clear on what you should do next, as the area you are in is quite small. The story is narrated through notes laying around, written by someone you may assume as the player character. Storytelling through notes is something that I don't particularly enjoy in video games, but it is quite well handled here.\n\nThe atmosphere is on point. The game takes advantage of its limited map to reinforce the claustrophobic impression it's creating. The visuals are great, it is dark, foggy, with a bit of light shining through the windows and that's it. The sound design is just as great. The horror is also different from what we are used to see (there are no jumpscares at all, if that kind of thing bugs you); I have not played the game Gone Home, but from what I have read of it it is rather similar; obviously, something has happened, but you don't know exactly what or who did it, and the tension builds up continually as you go further down the rabbit hole despite thinking you may not want to actually find out.\n\ntl;dr version: Fingerbones is a short, intense and bone-chilling experience that is definitely worth your time.","August 19, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fingerbones is an indie exploration, psychological horror game from David Szymanski. Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nLike my previously reviewed game (Port of Call), Fingerbones is completely free of charge. This alone should make anyone interested in playing it.\n\nThe graphics are very much Minecraft-clone quality, but, they have a certain, eerie feel to them that really do it for Fingerbones.\n\nThe story is pretty dark. There are no jump scares here; only notes left in an abandoned bunker for you to read an reveal the story at your own pace.\n\nThe music added to the creepy atmosphere of the game. This is always a major bonus as far as immersion goes.\n\nThe Bad\n\nNothing to see here. Move along please.\n\nThe Meh\n\nSome of the puzzles (yes, there are some light pseudo-puzzles you’ll be solving) require a little bit of back and forth. I wished there had been an option to move just a bit faster for this reason.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nFingerbones is a spooky enough game that I’d recommend it for anyone looking for a quick, light scare. It is great for the Halloween season and, if you’ve been looking for something new, Fingerbones is sure to keep you occupied for a few minutes.

Still i would not recommend playing it simply because I didn't enjoy it too much.\nIf there was a guy handing out free tshirts with only one arm I wouldn't recommend you getting any either - because I don't think you'd enjoy them (except if you only got one arm obviously).\n\nWhy didn't I enjoy playing Fingerbones?\n1) Walking is much too slow. Yeah, I know at the end it makes sense since the dude is starving. This is a pain in the ♥♥♥ especially since you have to go back to the keyboard all the time.\n2) I didn't find the flashlight but was able to use it later on anyway.\n3) I was able to guess the last password that opens the latch to the cellar just from finding the note on the chair in the second room. I didn't even mean to be a smartass, I just thought this was the way the game wanted me to solve the second puzzle. Some might argue this contributes to the concept of a free world, but it pretty much made me miss the whole plot (I read a walkthrough later making me realize I this.) so it has to be be considered a huge design flaw. The game tells a linear story that can't be altered. Being able to take a shortcut makes one miss out on the story. That's not a good thing. Why isn't the game designed in a way that makes (accidentally) taking a shortcut impossible? Two soluitons to my problem just off the top of my head: Cellar latch isn't in the second room or can't be opened until the last page is found.\n4) Just from the items on the table in the middle of the first room it was pretty easy to guess the guy physically abused and killed his daughter for reasons of insanity.\n5) The story itself (even without missing most of it) is pretty dull: Guy comes back to his bunker where he and his daughter seemingly survived some kind of catastrophe that wiped out most of humanity. He rediscovers the story of their life in the bunker by reading notes, seemingly from a diary. (Why didn't he remember his story anyway? How did he forget his passwords? Playing as someone else investigating what happened there would have made much more sense.) This story reveals he has/had some kind of mental disorder (identified as depression by the game. Not being an expert on psychopathology I would rather guess something in the spectrum of Schizophrenia.) making him think it would be a good idea to act purely practical, develop strange egocentric, pseudophilosophic and nihilistic views and let out his anger, frustration and sexual urges on his daughter. The exact storyline is a little blurry: Either a) his daughter dies from the abuse and he completely loses it thinking to abolish human nature and reestablishing some sort of primitive law of survival means freedom (extremely typical 2deep4u-♥♥♥♥), or b) he looses it and then kills his daughter because he abolished humanity and needs to let out his anger/sexual frustration. Oh yeah, also he was afraid of his daughter eating his food. Another good reason to kill her. Maybe he also ate her? No, we learn from the last page we find that he threw her body in the woods. Shouldn't he have eaten her since he abolished humanity long ago? Not so practical afterall, huh? Anyway, he kept her fingerbones as a symbol of sorts to his liberation. (Why those? Makes no sense? Yeah, but who cares!)\nAt some point after that he got out of his bunker, survived a little, felt the need to return, got controlled by the player and upon dying in the cellar of his bunker, right next to where his daughter died, despite still hearing her screams found a feeling of freedom and peace (2deep4u again). If I missed or misinterpreted any of the story please feel free to comment and tell me so.\n6) The riddles were ridiculous. Just finding all the notes and reading them is enough. I understand they're the game's way of forcingguiding one through the story, but just making them that easy is a great waste of potential. The concept also fails as stated in 3).\n\nI was happy there weren't any jumpscares though. Thanks a lot for that. Even though I got screamed at by the guy's daughter a little (ambient noise) I'm happy the designer didn't take that road trying to enhance his game by putting in random shockers. Working with suspense is often better than giving away too much.\n\nThanks again to the developer for releasing this game for free. It killed some time and made me write a review.\nEven though I didn't like it too much it is far from bad for a first game made entirely by one person.","October 14, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know if that is on purpose as if you are "adapting" to the darkness, but it was those moments that broke the fantasy for me most. But the way that the 'fog' affects you and the lighting from the windows quickly drew me back in. Not too good if you look at it closely, but very good for being a free game.\n\nThe sounds are spooky. I was actually talking with a friend of mine while playing it at some point, and the sounds alone made me stop and go "dude, is that you making that noise?" "no." "oh... ♥♥♥♥. I'm so screwed! *panics*" There were multiple times I panicked and ran because I thought I heard someone breathing in my ear and that there was a monster at the end of the hall in the tool room!\n\nThe lack of jumpscares or monsters put me off a bit. When I go into a horror, I want to feel like prey. I want to feel hunted and having to watch my back all the time. I did watch my back because the sounds was just that good, but by the end I realized it was a bit too easy there. All the same, I read in the description that it was based around plot, so that is something I will accept as being me expecting something I wasn't going to get to begin with. Still, the fact that the sounds and lighting made me think it anyway is a good thing.\n\nThe plot itself proved to be the biggest weak point and disappointment by the time I was done. It had everything it needed. Enviroment was good, a sick villain, a clear innocent victim... there was a clear, well-written progression into madness within the reading material, but it lacked that extra push to really bring it all together and make you go "wow". It lacks that extra something to take everything and tie it together in a good knot. That realization. That final moment of clarity. It does TRY to bring the realization, but the way it does it was lackluster enough for me to go "okay. I get it... wait? thats it?" instead of "wow." or "oh ♥♥♥♥..."\n\nIts like putting a lot of really good puzzle pieces together and not quite having them form a clear picture that makes it all worth more than the sum of its parts. Instead, with this Indie, I would say it IS the sum of its parts rather than more.\n\nThe puzzles themselves were... both good and bad. I had to use my brain, even after there is a clear simplicity to it, in order to figure them all out. The way the puzzles work requires you to analyze, backtrack, and pay close attention to the plot, which is very good. However, there are two things that put me off in the end. 1. The puzzles are all the same. There is a small amount of variety, and intelligently done, but they are all from the same molding. 2. You walk the entire time.\n\nThe fact that you cannot move faster than a crawl really really put me off and kept me from enjoying it as much as I wanted. The fact that I had to keep backtracking to reach previous notes to analyze and study, and having to take several minutes just walking to accomplish that each time, really bugged me.\n\nThe size of the enviroment itself does HELP with how fast you walk. It bugs me you cannot move any faster, but the game maker did keep the enviroment compact enough that it doesn't feel as bad as I described. Its just something that will bug you when you feel that walking back and forth so much is a chore.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game. It has lots of good qualities that make it charming and definietely worth a 30-minute experience, just a bunch of little things that bug me to death enough to say it is not worthy of a price tag. Esspecially when you consider the length of the story itself.","August 28, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
