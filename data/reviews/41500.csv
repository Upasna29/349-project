"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/41500/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","TL;DR? See Conclusion\nNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:\nTorchlight II Review\n\nINTRODUCTION:Torchlight is a Top-Down Action RPG Dungeon Crawler developed by Runic Games in 2009. The game invokes a Diablo-esque / Fate-esque gameplay mechanic mostly because the developers were former members of the teams that made said Diablo and Fate games.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):The game is set on the town of Torchlight, a small mining community who stumbled across a strange new mineral called 'Ember' which produces an unfortunate side effect to anyone who comes into contact with a corrupt piece. The player takes on the roles of the Alchemist, the Vanquisher or the Destroyer who makes their way through the deep mines and caves of Torchlight to stop a great evil from rising and destroying the world.\n\nPROS:+ Classical Formula: -(Also a CON, see below) Although the game is dangerously familiar to Diablo, Torchlight executes this formula almost to perfection. The loot system, monsters, player classes and gameplay mechanic were applied and utilized very well in a way that gives a renewed interest on the genre.\n\n+ Artistic: -Graphically, its not the most pleasing game, but its true artistic quality is with the style. It deviates from the regular dark, gothic themes of most games in the genre and instead, replaces it with a cartoon look in a steam punk setting.\n\n+ Map Variety: -Story wise, you're only headed down, but each map you enter has completely different themes. You can be exploring a dark dank cave one moment, and the next, find yourself in a long forgotten stone crypt or an ancient temple.\n\n+ Sound and Music: -The composer is Matt Uelman, Composer for works such as Diablo, World of Warcraft and Star Craft, and with a track like that, you can only expect greatness in the music quality.\n\nCONS:- No Multiplayer: - The game is a single player experience. No multiplayer mode whatsoever which disappointed many fans.\n\n- Story: - Rather weak and forgettable story with too few side missions.\n\n- Classical Formula: -(Also a PRO, see above), Strip it down to its bare minimum and you have a generic Diablo Clone right down to the Story. PERSONALLY, I think its GOOD since the newer generation of gamers who never got to experience the glory of the original Diablo can now experience it through Torchlight.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME FOR GREAT VALUE. Although some may argue that Torchlight (1) is obsolete because of the release of Torchlight II, the first title still provides a lot of entertaining hours with its Diablo (1) type of gamestyle.\n\nWORTH IT?:Sale or full price, this game deserves your attention however, you may also want to check out Torchlight 2 since it expands the world and introduces multiple new classes.\n\nFINAL NOTES:You would think that its just your average Dungeon Crawler RPG and you would be right since all the elements of Torchlight are the basic elements to an Action RPG, HOWEVER, it's how Torchlight merges those elements that make it stand out from the rest. From start to finish, this game uses and applies the tried and tested classical formula to create a wonderful and memorable experience.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

It's not a refined as TL2, however there is more than enough game here to stand own it's own. The story isn't bad, the graphics hold up well. The end boss is actually an epic battle.\n\nA few downsides: drops do not highlight unless you hit 'alt'. I found my thumb perminately locked on the 'alt' key. There is not shopping list for your pets. If you do the Bard's quests you will have to town port after almost every level. Pets pathing and selecting drops is sometimes stressful.\n\nThe goods: Lots of levels. It took me about 22 hours of play time to get to the final boss that was on dungeon level 32. There are 100 more dungeon levels past that. Character development is very open. Just because your a warrior doesn't mean you can't wear a robe and wield a wand. Potions drop from about 60% of the mob kills: This seems like a con in the beginning, but once you hit the lower levels you'll be thankful.\n\nIf you have this and haven't played it, why not?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spackeck/recommended/41500/","spackeck","Spackeck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spackeck/","301 products in account","I don't really play games like Torchlight. The style of action RPG proliferated by titles like Diablo never really interested me. It seemed like a repetitive slog of killing and looting identical enemies who changed only statistically, becoming incrementally more difficult so as to retain the same amount of effort required for their deaths. Torchlight, however, managed to keep me entertained for quite some time. I found the diversity in enemy types, artistic direction and player abilities to be engaging, and I found myself drawn in to Torchlight.\n\nThe gameplay hardly needs explaining--it's like Diablo. You control most everything in the game using the mouse and some hotkeys. I chose to play as the 'vanquisher' class, focusing on ranged weaponry and magic related to it. The abilities of this class mostly serve to complement her ranged weapons, and I managed to completely finish the game without even equipping a melee weapon. I did find that the class benefited significantly from having summoning spells, allowing players to fire powerful ranged spells at enemies while minions keep them at bay. Although it may sound dull, I quite enjoyed it--a lot of powerful weapons felt great to use, and I was impressed by the game's lenience toward players interested in multiple gameplay styles--nothing stopped me from summoning an army of skeletons, even though I didn't choose the class focused on that at the start of the game.\n\nTorchlight's balancing feels fine, though later levels do feature some enemies with huge damage output that were a pain to get past. I really liked the way the game's entire story takes place in a single dungeon, with the player's gradual descent into the earth beneath the titular town slowly revealing different fortresses and ancient ruins all lying beneath the ground. The game begins with entry into the mine upon which Torchlight's economy is reliant upon, but before the game's end you'll see a sprawling necropolis, colourful, flooded ruins and a fiery dwarven fortress. The graphical diversity keeps things interesting, and everything's quite pretty too. I liked the cartoony art style, but I found it quite curious how many enemies were simply recoloured, buffed up a bit and reused.\n\nThe music is memorable and eerie, complementing each area well and adding to an atmosphere that one wouldn't expect from a game as simple as Torchlight.\n\nOn release, some criticised Torchlight for it's lack of any form of multi-player component. I personally found this to be a good decision, as a single-player game tends to be more focused. Torchlight, despite the admirable streamlining of UI and gameplay still contains a large amount of engaging content, even after the final boss. I just don't know if Torchlight will be one of those games that the average player can get a huge amount of mileage out of--while I found the content to be sufficient, it certainly does get old after a certain point.\n\nTorchlight serves as a solid single-player RPG, and I highly recommend it, but it's certainly not a huge game, and will lose its appeal eventually.","October 2, 2015","true","67.1"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","33","35","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/41500/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","A very, very enjoyable game.  If Diablo is the older, serious, stylish sister, then Torchlight is the younger, jovial, fun-loving twin.\n\nAt its heart beats a quick-based action RPG where performing story based kill or fetch quests, see you fighting through numerous levels of varying monsters and enemy bosses.  In addition optional sidequests though similar steal your focus from time to time allowing you to power-up your characters abilities if you so desire.\n\nNow while you can expect alot of repetitive gameplay you can choose from three archetypal characters with which to complete the challenges ahead: Go hand-to-hand combat with the fighter, shoot from range with the archer or blast your foes with magic as the wizard.  Each character can assign skill points to four seperate skills: Melee, Ranged, Magic and Defense and each has a set of three skill trees from which to customize their style of gameplay further.  Through the clever use of item pre-requisites you can actually choose to use all three types of weaponary available to you.  So mix and match to your hearts content.\n\nPlayers can choose to equip many aspects of their character with a truly huge assortment of equipment from armor types, jewelry and weapons - all of which are designed to provide you with a selection headache.  If that is not enough some items can be upgraded further by slotting them with magic igots called ember that boost certain abilities.  These igots can be transmuted to form bigger more powerful items, that provide bigger bonues if enough are found.\n\nFurther to the base game you will be able to use numerous magic spells to augment your offensive and defensive capabilities from casting fireballs to calling on temporary npc allies.  You also possess an animal companion which can be used to send items to the town above when you can trade and upgrade items.  This animal companion can also be temporarily be turned into other creatures with other powers in your fight to reach the end of the game.\n\nOverall despite its functional story its graphics, music, voice-overs and design provide some nice touches filling with with atmosphere, providing a fun flilled blast-a-thon with plenty of action and reward for those of you who'd love a change from a deep meaningful game.\n\nProbably the only down sides is restrictive nature of the inventory which can be a pain when handling alot of items, its purely singleplayer aspect and also the expected reptitive nature of gameplay.  (If you want mp/coop try TL2)\n\nHowever I would recommend this to anyone who likes to try something different from shooters, strategy or deep RPGs.","December 17, 2013","true","194.6"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/41500/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Diablo-inspired isometric hack-n-slash dungeon crawler (or "action-RPG"), with many, so many levels filled with treasures and monsters, under seemingly common and peaceful village.\nThose of us who have played Diablo before, will recognize everything immidiately, and will be wandering only with cartoon-animated visual style and with the pet - which is quite nice and useful companion, generally, both in fight and in dealing with the loot (which was quite a problem back in time).\nThose of us who saw Fate, however, will not be asking any questions, as the Fate is just the base for the Torchlight, with the same visual style, mild music, and the pet. You may think of Torchlight as of much upgraded towards the more comfortable gameplay version of the Fate... And as of next of kin to Diablo Hellfire. And made by the same people, creators of Diablo and Fate.\nTorchlight is not a "Diablo-killer", as it goes with so many projects like Titan Quest, Sacred and so many others. On the contrary, Torchlight is actually made all this race to beat the fame of Diablo 1&2 looking even more out-of-order. As you don't need to be better than somebody else. You just need to be fun and complete all by yourself. And Torchlight is just that kind of game - with satysfying content, challenges, variety of features, and general fun-out-of-the-game.\nThat I personally liked about Torchlight is the atmosphere, which is both quite reminiscent to the original Diablo, with the nearly same background and music... but much more mild and joyful altogether.\nThat has frightened me there - is the same thing as with the Fate game - the amount of levels below the surface. Even after you'll beat the main scebario nemesis - you still have a long way down before you, with more and more powerful foes and more of the rarest loot.\nAnd it was namely the loot - along with other possibilities to enhance and empower a character - that frightened me the most. Really, while some people are starting to hate Skyrim for the hundreds of hours of adventures, in Torchlight the biggest blackhole, that has eaten the majority of my playtime - was levelling and redistributing items, perks and other enhancements. Yeah, just the same thing for which so many people love RPG systems in the first place - clear numerical system of your hero's progress - made me sick. For it seems so bottomless, that I've dropped the playing at one moment, realising that for every hour of dugeoning I'm spending 2+ hours just orginizing the stuff and making preparations... I'm not saying the game is like this. Actually, you can play it on the flow, and pauses for changing equipment and distributing stats can be as small as you want them to... It's just the way I'm playing the games and living life in general - if I can tune something to go with that in the field, I usually do that, ad perfectum.\n\nSummarizing. Torchlight is the one very nice and enjoyable hack'n'slash dungeon crawler, which can leave uncomfortable only those who can't play action-RPGs, sicked with cartoon-style animation, or completionsts like myself. One last thing to add is that I suggest to start playing right from the hard difficulty, for "easy" and "normal" settings are somewhat less inspiring. Overall mark is 7.8/10.","May 23","true","57.9"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","31","33","3","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/41500/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The dungeon-crawling genre has never had a complicated formula: you kill stuff, you get equipment, you kill bigger stuff, you delve deeper. Repeat as necessary. Torchlight is, well, no different. But it does it well. It refines many aspects of the genre, adds some more options to the top, and tops it all off with an attractive style that is pleasant to look at as you cut down swaths of enemies.\n\nYou begin the game as one of three classes: the Destroyer, the Vanquisher, and the Alchemist. Despite the names, they're really just fancy ways to say Warrior, Ranger and Mage. Each of the classes gets a number of skills unique to who they are, such as the Destroyer having a lot of close-combat abilities to take down enemies, the Vanquisher having a number of traps and long-range attacks for their guns and bow, and the Alchemist has a number of spells that do different types of elemental damage to enemies. Each skill has only a character level as a prerequisite. No previous skills need to be taken, no amount of skill points need to be spent. This is a system that I'm not fond of. It encourages hoarding skill points, and can be a little dull to distribute skill points in.\n\nIn addition to these class-specific skills, there are about ten skills that are shared across all classes, passive skills that do things like increase damage with martial weapons, increase armor defense, or increase the effectiveness of some spells. Based on what class you have, these shared skills are only available at certain levels. For example, as the Alchemist, you can get Magical Weapons Expertise immediately, while as the Destroyer this skill has a much higher level as a prerequisite. But these aren't all the skills available.\n\nThere are also a number of spells in the game, scribed onto scrolls, that every character can learn. These spells range from healing yourself to attacking enemies, raising your damage, and so forth. These act differently from skills: they are learned just by using scrolls, not skill points; any character can learn them; each character can only have a certain number memorized at any time (they can be forgotten whenever you want); and to get a higher level of the spell, you need to find the higher level version of that spell on a scroll. The variation of class-specific skills, general passive abilities, and spells means that every character can be different.\n\nEach character also starts with a pet as well. With this pet comes not only a fighting partner in the dungeon - one that can equip rings and an amulet, in addition to two spells - but also something of a pack mule. You can throw a bunch of equipment onto your cat or dog, then send them off to town to sell all the equipment. It makes the action a lot more seamless, since frequent trips to the town are no longer required, breaking up the action all the time. Throughout the various dungeons you can also fish, the results of which can be fed to your pet in order to turn it into different creatures with different stats, abilities, and weaknesses.\n\nAttributes are handled a little oddly in this game. There's the typical Strength, Dexterity, Magic, and Defense, but they don't do what you might expect. Though defense is pretty much self-explanatory, all the other attributes do is increase other amounts of damage. Strength raises physical damage, dexterity raises ranged damage, and magic raises elemental damage. Like I said, it's weird (magic doesn't even increase your mana reserves), but it makes for some interesting builds. In other games, you'll always see mages, for example, have very high magic levels and a disregard for every other attribute. In Torchlight, while this is viable, spreading out your attribute points also works. You can put points into magic and dexterity to increase the damage of wands that shoot long-range magical attacks, or some points into strength to beat the enemies that get close to you with staves. It offers a lot more options than a typical dungeon crawler, though it may take some time to get used to.\n\nThe dungeon levels are randomly constructed, but impressively so. I seldom encountered any lay-out that I considered strange or out-of-place. There are several different tilesets used, depending on the level of the dungeon, so the atmosphere never grows dull. Levels are littered with secret passages, multiple story construction, and the occasional trap to keep everyone on their toes. Each section of the dungeon has its own style, from the typical dank stone passageways to an underground greenhouse to the fiery depths of volcanic doom.\n\nAnd it’s not only the levels themselves that look great. All the graphics in Torchlight are top-notch. Torchlight sports a cartoonish look, keeping things from becoming too dark and dreary. The various spell and ability effects are solid, and everything runs along very smoothly. In fact, the system requirements for Torchlight are incredibly low even for a game that was released in 2009. The audio fares equally well, with solid voice work and a simply great musical score.\n\nThe main plot demands about 15-20 hours of adventuring per character, and can be done at varying difficulty levels. Once the main story is complete, players can embark on a much deeper dungeon to further advance their character. Should players decide to be done with a character, they can “retire” that character from play and bequeath some bonuses on the next.\n\nI had an absolute blast with Torchlight, and I’ll be returning at least a few more times to try out some additional character concepts. There’s just a ton of well-done ARPG goodness here. And while I usually don’t comment on the price of the games I review, Torchlight brings all this goodness to players for just 14,99€. That’s an incredible amount of fun for a bargain-priced title. For action RPG fans, Torchlight is a title not to be missed.","February 5","true","132.4"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","26","26","0","0"

The guys at Runic Entertainment have nailed what makes these types of games so addictive but that should come as no suprise considering many of them were involved in the creation of the original Diablo many moons ago.\n\nThe game does suffer by sticking so closely to the blue print set by the 1996 classic making it feel rather antiquated. The World of Warcraft visuals, whilst pleasant and colourful to look at, only seem to reinforce this.Torchlight, like the orignal Diablo, is nothing more than a series of randomly generated levels vaguely connected to a story so flimsy and paper thin you'll have forgotten why you are doing the things you are doing in the town of Ember ten minutes into the game.\n\nA bit more variety with level design (deja vu sets in quite early) as well as enemy variety would have elevated the score as would a more cohesive and engaging world to explore (points they did address with the sequel) but as it stands its a great game to while away precious hours if you are a loot mongering ♥♥♥♥♥ in search of the ultimate armour or weaponry.\n\nAlso one has to congratulate Runic on their fantastic pricing structure.

It is a dungeon based arpg without any surface missions. It has much in common with Diablo 2 but can't quite be as good as it's big brother. Still, all elements of a good addicting arpg are there. But that's also the only point which I can criticize, the game just doesn't try to push for more. The story isn't good but the combat and gameplay feels fluent. The fishing mechanic is a cool gimmick but I never really used it since it wasn't needed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cockseverywhere/recommended/41500/","cockseverywhere","Metanoia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cockseverywhere/","1132 products in account","This game has more similarities to Diablo than I can explain.\n\nAt the core, the game offers the same experience. You have a dungeon underneath the town that leads to a boss that is ultimately corrupting the town. The townspeople will offer quests which you can complete and will give you rewards. (often non-consequential.) Where the game shines is in the huge amount of polish attached to that. Not only is it polished, it offers difficulties which tie to a level 1, something Diablo tied to tiers of levels.\n\nSomething else I can rant and rave about is the fact that the game is essentially endless. The dungeon goes for 100 levels, and on top of that, there's maps which take you to a randomly generated map that you can trek through for even more content. Now enemies are pretty set to each map, unless you do the maps that are randomized per level.\n\nThis game does only offer three classes, but those three each have three trees that are different in and of themselves. You have you brutish fighter with his defense, attack, and dual wield options. You have your archer that can either be a melee rogue, set traps, or go full on archery. And you have the alchemist that will boast summoning, and two types of spellcasting. (I played the Alchemist the least.)\n\nAs for anything else, check the game out. It's definitely worth it if you enjoy Diablo style hack and slash games. I would honestly even recommended it to newcomers to the genre, since it boasts a casual difficulty, and even goes all the way to a Very Hard, which is definitely hard. It also comes with Hardcore modes for the masochistic, like myself.\n\nI cannot rant further about how amazing this series is, except I can, because there's a second installment that adds on top of every good thing here.","March 27, 2015","true","93.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

I cannot remember the last time I played a game that I had this much fun while playing. This is an extremely well done hack and slash action/rpg, plays very similar to Diablo and Fate (which I finished a week or two ago as well), but there is something about this game that is head and shoulders better.\n\nWhether it is the cute cartoony art style, or the simplicity of the game play mechanics, probably a combination of them all. By the end of my first play through, my character was so overpowered that I was one hitting enemies and taking bosses health down by half each swing. I was a slow mace duel wielding warrior and it was hella fun.\n\nAnother thing I like about Torchlight is there is endless replay-ability, once you finish the game, you open up a new dungeon with infinite amount of levels, each floor is randomly generated with enemies which scale to your level. This is a game to keep installed once you finish as there is plenty of reasons to keep coming back","February 5, 2015","true","52.6"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","3"

Arthur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnVArthur/","145 products in account","TL;DRA classic action RPG with a lighthearted attitude.\n+ Solid gameplay\n+ Classes (the classic trinity)\n+ Graphics\n+ Setting\n+ Loot\n+ Tons of mods (no Steam Workshop though)\n- Linearity\n- No multiplayer\n- No customisation (there are mods for that)\n\nREVIEW\nTorchlight is a classic action RPG developed by Runic Games. It features Diablo-esque gameplay with a cartoonish art style.\n\nThere is not much to say about the story: Torchlight is a mining town where a magic mineral called Ember is stored. Alric, once an adventurer like you*, has been corrupted by the One Ring tainted Ember and fell to the Dark Side went rogue. You are to enter the depths of the underworld and track him down. The gameplay is solid and focuses on going deeper down while completing quests and eviscerating thousands of nasty creatures. The setting is an interesting mix of medieval fantasy and steampunk: magic and swords meet robots and firearms. One should not be surprised to see a robot bard who gives monster contracts.\n\nThere is a classic trinity: a warrior (Destroyer, male), a rogue (Vanquisher, female), and a sorcerer (Alchemist, male). Each of the classes have 3 skill trees which provide a player with a variety of playstyles. Unlike in Diablo, some skills are shared among the classes (e.g. passive skills which provide an xp boost, dual wielding damage bonus, etc.). What is also unique is that every character can learn to use various spells (up to four at a time). Wanna be a dual axe wielding Destroyer who can also cast fireballs on demand? No problem!\n\nThe art style is pretty much timeless: the graphics are decent even now (there are texture mods should anyone be interested). Even though there is not much freedom to explore, randomly generated dungeons are diverse enough to keep one entertained for hours. Moreover, the game is paced just about right – the "just one more level" phenomenon is real. Speaking of art, the soundtrack is just astounding which is hardly a surprise. It was composed by Matt Uelmen, the author of Diablo's soundtrack.\n\nIt is a shame that there is no multiplayer, as gathering a group and venturing forth is a staple for action RPGs. The only companion a player will go with is a pet: either a cat or a dog. Pets can support you in a fight, cast spells (up to two at a time), and go to town to sell your items. The player can also feed them fish which make them change into different creatures. Speaking of downsides, there is no character customisation.\n\nIn conclusion, Torchlight is a marvellous action RPG which can provide hours and hours of highly enjoyable gameplay. One should do themselves a favour and play this gem. A 9/10.\n\n*Wait, wrong game.\n\nP.S.

Village gets attacked by evil wizard, heros help, heros save the day (and genocide countless minions).\n\nYou have 3 playable Characters, without being able to edit their stats and looks: A melee, ranged and mage.\n\nBeside having classes with roles, every characters has 3 skill trees, that mostly provide main damage, support abilitys (buffs or debuffs) and summoning allies. Also each of these trees provide you with the abilitys to fight with the weapon, that was made for the class (sword for melee, guns for ranged and staff for mage) or buffing the damage with fighting with another class weapon, so the melee fires with staffs (why would he do that?).\n\nThe loot is mostly randomized like in every ARPG. Exeption are uniques and set items, that also can have different stats, but have them always in a certain pattern.\n\nAlso, the village provides you with different NPCs who offer you:\n- 3 traders\n- A quest NPC, that gives you tasks into special dungeons, giving you bonus dungeons as reward\n- a gambler that sells you items, that have random stats\n- two goblins, that can ether save sockets from items or clear items from sockets\n- an item enchanter, that can upgrade your items. There is always a chance to break the item, which chance increases with every use. Features like that were stupid like ever, because they can be bypassed by save and load (in this case, because the game saves automatically, you can crash your game to leave without saving).\n\nHaving a campaign that is going through a dungeon with 34 levels, the bonus levels from the quest NPC and a endless dungeon, after you completed the campaign, you have enough time to enjoy the game.\n\nContra:\n- The classes are really imbalanced:\nHaving trouble fighting with the mage? You maxed your skills and still the enemy doesnt feel your hit? Play the ranged: I made a ranged fighter playthrough with every skill on level 1. How? The skills of the ranged character make damage based in % of your weapon damage. Most of the attacks of the mage do not. Who designs crap like that? Having a skill that gives you better mana regeneration and having the first ability on max, you can use it instead of your standard attack, blasting 300% weapon damage with every shot, with an attack, that pierces through enemys in a line. Why even playing the other classes.\n\n- The enemy damage is imbalanced:\nA big rock troll is hitting you? No problem, didnt even feel it. A little kobold mage casting a lightning on you? Dead!\nWhile physical damage gets blocked by your armor, elemental does not! So, you will be ignoring all enemys, only focusing on their mages. This can be so extreme that in the dark fortress levels you always look out or demon caster, because you will onehit them, and they will onehit you. It is who is spotting the other first. All that doesnt feel like it is right.\n- After lvl 50 the game starts feeling dull and unfinished:\nAfter playing through the campaign, you will notice that the drops of uniques will decrease more and more. Thats because instead having your level, most uniques have a certain item level they drop. Around lvl 50-70 the normal items will also start going rubbish, giving you sometimes lvl 40 item on lvl 70. After a time, normal playing is no longer possible, because the enemys get stronger, but you dont\n\nYou can have a lot of fun with Torchlight, but dont take it as serious as a Diablo.","October 17, 2014","true","70.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","1"

While the game is almost extremely easy, it does have it's difficult moments - however, the pacing and introduction of these difficult moments is odd.\n\nIt's almost like the developers knew the game was too easy, so decided to throw a whole bunch of killer mobs and mob groupings together in the last few levels of the story mission. All of which leads up to the insanely difficult last boss - you will die several times fighting this large ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nOverall not a terrible game, and if Torchlight II hadn't been released I'd recommend this highly, especially given the cheap price point it seems to have these days. Interestingly, it appears as though the Story Mode is only the tip of iceberg, as the game seemed to open after killing the 'end boss'. New dungeons opened, options to retire hero appeared, all of which I now want to explore and play around with (at a later date).\n\nTorchlight's nods to Diablo are nice, and it's refreshing to see a game not denying the influence of Diablo to the Dungeon Crawler genre.

You get into it by recognizing the marks of the Diablo franchise. It is no surprise, because Runic Games was founded by ex-Blizzard veterans, and they intended to make a "better clone". So, the game is great fun for a couple of hours... but then the problems start to emerge. First of all, the levels are more of the same. The only difference is the texturing. Seriously, all levels play out the same - even the enemies act very alike, despite them being completely different looking creatures. Furthermore, you aren't really forced to evolve your character further and further. You can keep the same skills and just invest more points into them. Torchlight gets very boring and very repititive too early. I disagree with both scores on Metacritic (press + user). This is a mediocre game. Could have been a great game with a ~5 hour length, but no, they had to stretch it to be dull & tiresome. Runic failed with this first attempt.

It would go something like this:\n\nBlizzard: We have Diablo 1 and 2 that are the best classics ever! For only $20 each!\n(Might be more even considering Diablo 1 is hard to come by at stores that sell used games).\n\nRunic: We have Torchlight that has a level editor AND doesn't screw gamers over their money for expansions/dlc. Only $15!\n\nBlizzard: Yeah? We have Diablo 3 with stunning graphics! And that's for $40 new and $30 used!\n(Depending on where you buy it, and it's $60 at the blizzard store if you buy the digital deluxe edition, or $40 if you buy the standard for Reapers of Souls).\n\nRunic: We have Torchlight 2 with the steam shop. Only $20!\n\nConclusion: Get Torchlight. While you're at it, get Torchlight 2. You could get Diablo 3 for the price of Torchlight 1 and 2. Just get Torchlight 1 and 2. They're a lot better and funner (I know funner is not a word, but it's the right word to describe this game).

I didn't write this review simply to be a contrarian jerk.\n\nVideogames age, some more than others. At times, all it takes is for a game to receive a sequel, in order for its age to become readily apparent. Torchlight II improves on the original in every conceivable way. I'll even go as far as to say that Torchlight has been rendered obsolete. There's literally no reason to play Torchlight 1 over its sequel, or over the great many other loot-heavy action RPGs that have been released over the years.\n\nThe absolute biggest problem with this game is the difficulty curve. I played through this game on normal, and for 9/10ths of the game, there wasn't any challenge. However, once I got to the final portion of the game, I started running into Dark Zealots. Dark Zealots have auto-targeting instant lightning. All it takes is a couple crits and I die. I admit that my lightning resistance wasn't up to snuff, but the fact that this attack is completely unavoidable is ridiculous. Once Dark Zealots start appearing, they're bound to show up fairly often throughout the post-game. I was on the 5th floor of the Shadow Vault and a Dark Zealot's lightning brought me from full health to death.\n\nI played through Torchlight II on hard difficulty. A veteran is likely to pop in here and say "That's still way too easy." but hear me out. Torchlight II on hard was more consistent than Torchlight 1 on normal. The game remained fairly challenging (for me) throughout the entirety of the main campaign. I didn't sleepwalk through the game, nor did I suddenly get a heaping helping of horse manure towards the end of it and beyond.\n\nBy the way, why does Ordrak have 3 billion HP? Why can he summon countless dragons and skeletons? I'm positively boggled that anyone signed off on this nonsense of a finale. The ludicrousness of the final boss really stands out, when every other boss dies in a minute or two. Torchlight 2 was more consistent when it came to bosses.\n\nLoot. Now I know it's difficult to expect good loot. There is the almighty RNG, and I've never been very lucky. Nevertheless, there is a rhyme and reason to how this system should work, and players should feel like their time is rewarded, especially when they defeat bosses or discover secret rooms. Instead, you're just as likely to get a weapon that's usable for half the game as you are to not find any decent armor upgrades for 3/4s of the game. AGAIN, Torchlight II is more consistent.\n\nTorchlight II also has better quest-design, exploration, map-design, classes, skills, monster-variety, and so on and so forth. It's practically a revelation by comparison.\n\nNow I could download a couple mods to fix the Dark Zealot's insane lightning, or drop Ordrak's HP to something manageable, or improve the myriad of other things that need improving, but that's not my idea of a fun time. Mods are at their best when they add to a game, not just fix its problems. Besides, I already own the sequel. At this point, there really isn't an excuse not to. Torchlight II enjoys sizable discounts during all of the major Steam sales.\n\nOn the bright side, when I review Torchlight II (eventually); I won't have to spend the entirety of it discussing why it's a better game than the prequel.","June 6","false","10.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Torchlight and Titan Quest were pretty much the only Hack 'n Slash during this period, at least that I can think of, and Titan Quest weren't that similar to Diablo. Torchlight have a similar atmosphere to the Diablo classics, even though the art style and graphics are more colorful and high-res that those of Diablo 2 - They still have very similar atmospheres.\n\nA few guys in the Runic Games studio did work on Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction, and therefore have a professional insight of what made the original game so great. I wish to prevent using the term Diablo-clone, because it casts a negative shadow over a great game, but Torchlight is a obvious success of cloning. In some regards, Torchlight is even better than Diablo 2 because of it's added genuinity.\n\nAs every Hack 'n' Slash and RPG, you get to choose your class. In Torchlight there are only 3 classes; Vanquisher, Destroyer, and Alchemist. All three with different perks and advantages. Vanquisher is Range, Destroyer is Melee and the Alchemist is a Mage. Clear focus point for the three classes is speed, strength and magic in that order. You get to modify each class heavily though throughout the gameplay so each class can look very different in the end. There are a lot of different types of Weapons and Armors in the game, as expected from the genre! Loot is the most wonderful of things, see.\n\nOne unique addition is the pet system, where you always have pet with you. This has a few advantages; for example can the pet go back and sell your loot, for non-stop hacking and slashing. The pet also helps out in the fights, and can never die only flee and run around like an idiot. You can boost your pet with armors and jewelry, as well as bind scrolls to the pet that it will cast by itself. I never upgraded my pet too serious though, I always forgot to give it new items - so it's not a game breaker. Just a neat feature.\n\nSadly Torchlight lacked in a few areas as well, Multiplayer mostly so. Hack 'n' Slash is most enjoyable in co-op, where mowing through hordes of monsters become more of a sport. Luckily this year's sequel, Torchlight II, has improved the series greatly while maintaining the renowned Diablo aura. Torchlight offers rogue-like gameplay with the Hardcore difficulty settings, if you get tired of playing like a wuss.\n\nWorth picking up if you like Hack 'n' Slash and mindless killing, just be prepared to do it alone. Very good atmosphere and art-style\n\nNote: It might be worth checking out Torchlight II (Review) as it only improves the original in all ways. As well as Free to Play game Path of Exile.","December 3, 2012","true","121.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Always the life of the hero I guess. My mission was to go below the town into many floors of caves and ancient ruins to find a once good but now bad, like always, guy who was hell bent on awakening some all mighty evil. What he wasn't expecting was me, the all powerful bad guy killing machine and my trustworthy wolf.\n\nTorchlight was a pretty fun game to play. It's a massive dungeon crawler with loads of loot to grab, sell, upgrade, and use. The main storyline runs you down 35 floors which may take you some time to accomplish.  I clocked in a little over 27 hours to finish it but that is with some side missions too. You can put in tons of more hours into this if you want, specially if you like to collect achievements.\n\nStory is the basic good guy went bad and try's to bring some powerful evil out from below to take over the world. I didn't pay to much attention to the story since it didn't really grip me. This game also isn't really focused on the story since it is mainly a dungeon crawling loot grabber. After a while I did get a little burnt out playing and felt like the same thing over and over.\n\nTorchlight does look pretty good and play pretty good. There was a good variety of enemies to fight which would range in all sizes. Controls just had you clicking on enemies to attack which sometimes became an issue for me cause I would lose track of the mouse icon on my 46" TV. You also had a pet to help you fight and carry loot. Both of you level up from XP to make you stronger throughout the game.\n\nEquipping your character and pet was pretty fun and a lot of work. You can equip every body part with armor and also have rings and a necklace. Your pet can also be equipped with a necklace, two rings, and two spells. All weapons and gear can be enchanted to add more stats to help you out. They can also lose all enchantments when trying to enchant them.\n\nOverall the game was fun and worth playing if you like dungeon crawlers. You also may want to just skip this one and go right on to part two as it has much more to it and it's co-op. This game can keep you busy for hundreds of hours just trying to accomplish all the achievements. You can definitely get your moneys worth out of it.\n\nBear Rating: 8/10","November 5, 2013","true","27.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's fun, yes. For about 15 levels. Then the repetition kicks in as you grind your way to the conclusion.\n\nThe initial feel of this game is much greater than it ultimately delivers. It's got all the bells and whistles you'd expect in a full-price Adventure RPG, but the main storyline is short, and when it's done, there's no compelling reason to keep playing. Even though there's an infinite (?) dungeon waiting to be plundered, I felt no compulsion to continue when there was no quest to fulfill.\n\nI am very much looking forward to Torchlight 2 to see if it's a bigger game. It may be a compelling alternative to Diablo 3.\n\nAs this game is on sale often for $5, it's a great intro for first-time ARPGers.

That being said, Torchlight exists in a world where it is overshadowed and outperformed by its sequel.  The original Torchlight game has a a very small world, and the game/ progress is incredibly linear.  Basically there's a single town and a solitary dungeon with numerous levels leading down that you work through.  That's it.  In addition, the story is pretty much an afterthought.  What the game does get right though, is the actual gameplay.  Combat is a joy, and honestly you rarely mind grinding through the same early stages as you try to progress deeper down into the dungeon.  My typical play session stretched to several hours and I think I burned through this game in two weeks, so that gives you an idea of how addicting the combat is.  Multiple classes, a great concept of a helper pet, and bright visuals make for a fun time.  If you can only pick up one game though, I would recommend the vastly superior sequel.  In addition, if you've already played the sequel then this game feels like a step down after that.  A solid game, but others (including the sequel) do it better.  7/10 for this one.","October 21, 2015","true","22.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You are forced to guide them through random mazes in order to finish the game. In your way will encounter 'random treasure drops' which you can choose to pick up, or not pick up. This constitutes about 50% of the gameplay. The rest of the game is filled with battles with 'mobs' who will attempt to 'hide' this treasure from you in their soft underbellies. the characters have abilities which you can 'pick' from, although choices are often easy if you want the game to be easier. Combat is comedic in that you don't feel anything but puny and weak fighting your adversaries.

The game is fun to play for a short period of time but if you continue to play it for more then 4 - 5 sittings it picks up a boring momentum of repetition, going over and over through same enemies and same levels. After completing the game for a few times the story still remains a complete mystery to me. Bugs make things even worse, destroying the fun concept of the GamePlay  (especially on hardcore mode). To top it all off, it doesn't have a MP which is a must in nowdays dungeon crawler games.

I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.\n\nIf Torchlight has solidified anything in my design preferences, then it’s my distaste for huge amounts of loot. I like Torchlight, I really do. It’s a fun isometric Action/RPG experience, with very precise, responsive and polished controls, good enemy variety, a nice skill system, and pets. When I first opened up the game and saw that you can have a dog or a cat I instantly went ‘OH MY GOD THIS IS SO COOL’, I didn’t even know what their purpose was at that point.\n\nBut by Odin’s beard does the loot system just annoy me. It’s actually the very reason why I become bored with Torchlight after playing it for a while. Though the next day I want to come back to it, because the core gameplay is fun and addicting in a way (and although I guess this is contrary to the general opinion, but in my case loot doesn’t contribute to the addiction). But there’s just too many items with too little differences, that the joy of finding something is not there at all. For example, on one dungeon run I have found five rare chest pieces of the same type with little differences in bonuses they give. I couldn’t choose, it was really hard to make an informed decision based on minuscule distinction, so I decided just to sell them all, and try to enchant my current armor instead. And put a gem into the socket to give it additional stats I needed.\n\nAnd, you know what… This should have been the focus of the loot mechanic, of the whole equipment system. Enchantments and gems. In the game, whenever you visit an enchanter, you have a chance to add a random bonus stat to an item, or a socket for a gem (on another hand, there’s a chance that all your bonuses are going to be removed completely, and it increases with every enchantment of the item). You use different kind of ember gems to put into sockets, which give the items more stat bonuses. You can also combine (transmute) different tiers of ember gems to create more powerful gems.\n\nI haven’t played Diablo-like games in a while, so I don’t think the idea is new to Torchlight. However, it’s a very cool concept that increases the longevity of the item that you use. In fact, you kinda become attached to it, especially after a number of successful enchantments. But the loot system – the amount of all the stuff you find and how similar they are, it hinders the enchantment/gem system, because you are not quite sure which part of your equipment to focus on when there’s such a huge turn-over rate of the items in your inventory.\n\nDecrease the randomness of the items (and the loot frequency), increase the amount of ember gems that you find, and tweak it so every new piece of equipment you find would be (or become) a meaningful addition (and would make the choice between staying with current upgraded equipment or refocusing on new one more prominent). I would’ve had so much more fun with that. You can say, “Well, why don’t you go make your own Torchlight then (with blackjack and hookers)?” And hey, Runic Games allows us to do just that – they have released an editor for Torchlight which allows to edit… well, pretty much everything. So I might as well try to change how the loot system works. Modding scene is definitely one of Torchlight‘s strongest points, and they embrace it fully – there are even Steam achievements for using mods.\n\nOverall, Torchlight is a very good game. I really don’t agree with the loot mechanics, and the random dungeon generator sometimes creates exact same huge chunks of levels in supposedly different locations (so it’s somewhat jarring), but it has got fun hacky-slashy core mechanics, and everybody can tweak it to his or her liking thanks to the modding capabilities.","May 7, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

At the time Diablo 3 was far away from being released so fans of the prequel could really enjoy Torchlight as it had the same mechanics as Diablo 2 had in 2000.\n\nBut what about now? In 2014? Is it worth playing?\n\nWell, it depends: The first game focuses on single-player only. Runic Games made the sequel an MMO so multiplayer and coop can be found in it and it offers a long-lasting experience.\n\nIf you do not mind playing alone an RPG for dozens (if not hundreds) of hours then Torchlight is for you. If you prefer friends then you should purchase the sequel and you'll immediately see that even for one class there are many builds you can create so Torchlight can truly be a long game.\n\n","May 6, 2014","true","20.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The weapon system is pretty good and keeps you looking for that next good drop.  The pet system is a nice addition over the Diablo series, saves a lot of wasted trips to town to dump junk drops.

And just like Diablo, it can cause you to crack out on it till 3am if you arent careful. The temptation to go "just one more level" is quite high. It has socketable items, a whole crapload of different items, 3 classes (mage, fighter, ranged) and the choice to choose between a pet bobcat like tthing or a wolf that follows you around and attacks enemies. You can also turn your pet into other creatures if you feed it fish, a quest system and a whole lot more. Personally I like it better than either Diablo 1 or 2.

For starters, the overall difficulty level is arbitrary, veering from too easy to extremely difficult in a matter of moments. Some monsters are impossible to kill without spamming unique abilities or spells, and oftentimes combat reverts to simply holding down a spell hotkey until spawning monsters are completely wiped out. The end boss is a supremely horrible example of game design, and the targeting system is far too finnicky to be of any accuracy - you have to click on the same tiny spot in order to target any opponent or else you'll miss completely. In addition, there are several game-breaking issues that can bring play to a halt and ruin a finely-tuned character forever.\n\nNot a bad game by any means, just poorly designed and executed by the developers. Hopefully Torchlight 2 makes up for all of this.","March 20, 2012","true","142.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world was still waiting for Blizzard to deliver the next Diablo, and so, this was well-timed.  (Runic went on to release Torchlight2 at around the same time that Diablo3 came out.) It also has a pretty deep mod community, though I'll admit that I played the game vanilla on my playthrough.\n\nThe game is polished: graphics aged fine, clean audio helps the game feel immersive and responsive, and the game runs smoothly on my high-end gaming rig. Did not try it on anything else, but I suspect it'll run just fine. The story is nothing new, but then again -- you're not really playing this game for the story. It's a game where you diablo diablo diablo til you diablo diablo diablo, while you diablo diablo diablo... diablo. In that aspect, the game entertained me 'til the end. According to the in-game panel, that was about 12 hours.\n\nOne point of emphasis: the game difficulty runs easy. If you want a challenging game in which you engage all the mechanics, I'd highly suggest you nudge the difficulty up. In my playthrough, I didn't touch any of the optional map-fragment dungeons; simply the main dungeon and the ones that Hatch opens for you, in his Quest For Many Things. My character's levels almost always matched the number of the main dungeon floor I was on. Though I do have a habit of clearing each floor completely, I shouldn't have been overleveled for any part of the game. And yet, I never had to use a mana potion or any of the various mana shrines. Didn't touch a health potion until L25, and even then rarely. Never had to fiddle with my pet's form -- simply used him as a carryall back to town to sell my items. (So, that took the need to fish right out of the picture.) I had no real use for my currency. (Game only has one -- gold.) I was one-shotting enemies with the gear I found on the ground. I cannot imagine the devs intended for you to three-shot their bosses. At some point toward the end, I just decided to put 100k gold into enchanting a single item, you know, for funsies. I suspect the devs had intended for the enchantment system to work as a gold sink, but I simply didn't need the stat boosts to make the game less challenging. I'm afraid it would have become boring.\n\nI never once used any spells. I also didn't bother learning any non-passive class skills outside of the first available frost shot. Once I learned that, that's what I left my secondary attack on.\n\nPerhaps it was simply because I'd built up a ranged, spike character and the dungeons are designed with bottlenecks galore (hallways and corners everywhere, weeee), but giving the ranged player a NPC tank, a single-target spike, AND a piercing crowd-control projectile so very early in the game may have been overkill.\n\nEven if you haven't played a Diablo before, turn the difficulty up a bit.\n\nOther small notes:\nPet pathing. I realize this is sticky for many devs to get right, but boy -- my pet did not know how to go up stairs when the stairs were perhaps seven feet away from him. It's a small irritant, of course, since I could simply spend the 5 seconds moving around to manipulate his pathing algorithm.\nReplayability. Once you beat the game with any class, a new "Shadow Dungeon" opens up. I fully admit that I will not be playing the game again (I have far too many other things to get to!) but that along with being able to "retire" a character to pass along a heirloom makes it seem as though the replayability is solid.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/41500/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Torchlight skip to Results and read from there.\n\nRunic Games pushes the boundaries of RPG genre by providing a unique dungeon generation experience. Torchlight uses standard mechanisms for character development, but combines them in a unique experience that provides a fun and dynamic game.\n\nStory:\nIn the relatively small town of Torchlight a mysterious element has caused a bundle of trouble. A special mineral known as Ember, popular for its unique traits, has been corrupted by a dastardly foe. A giant monstrosity has released his evil across the land and has corrupted the Alchemist known as Alric. It is up to you to fight through the layers of the mine and free the town of Torchlight from the evil daemon Ordrak who is forged from the ember the mine withholds.\n\nCampaign:\nTorchlight provides a relatively linear campaign filled with irrelevant quests that essentially provide a long-winded grind. The main story consists of 35-floors of a mine where each floor generally resembles the next with minor changes to the environment and foes held within. As you battle through the floors the enemies’ levels do not scale with the player; although, they do maintain a good consistency with the player’s level.\nTo help separate the campaign each group of floors are bundled into segments that have portals connecting them: Orden Mines, Necropolis, Estherian Ruins, Tu’Tara Caverns, Molten Prison, Lost Fortress, Black Palace, and Lair.\nEach segment of the campaign contains a main boss which provides a unique battle experience that tests the player’s fortitude and skill.\n\nGameplay:\nTorchlight offers a unique mixture of gaming by providing a generated dungeon element similar to Spelunky with a combat system such as Diablo the game provides a unique experience with each champion play through. In my personal opinion the campaign has little to no replay value when playing the same champion twice as the generated dungeons, although different are relatively the same.\nSimilar to a standard RPG Torchlight provides classes that offer different combat styles: Alchemist, Destroyer, and Vanquisher. The Alchemist is your standard mage class and plays off magic attribute. The Destroyer is your standard fighting class and plays off strength. The Vanquisher is your standard hunter class and plays off dexterity.\nThe gameplay elements are rather cumbersome and can be infuriating at times. There will be more times you will perish because of poor game mechanics than difficult curve. The player is required to move and fight by left-clicking with the mouse. This causes a lot of times where the players champion will run into battle when you actually just want to shoot from distance, this can also be annoying especially with fast moving and smaller enemies.\n\nHints:\n>Do not waste your gems, using the Duran the Transmuter you can combine smaller gems into powerful gems that will have massive impacts on your champion.\n>Purchase Gems from Triya whenever you get back in town. She will sell them relatively cheap and if you keep using the Duran the Transmuter who doesn’t charge you can make powerful items.\n>Make sure to give your pet two spells, two rings, and a necklace. This will make them more powerful – I recommend Heal All and Frost.\n>If you’re ever stuck on a level just go back to an earlier part of the Campaign where the enemies are weaker and level up.\n>Make sure to send your pet back to town to sell items and heal up.\n>Defense is an important attribute – there is no tanking class so all classes need defense.\n\nResults:\nI played Torchlight after beating Torchlight II – this game is fun, but some elements are missing which cause the campaign to drain rather than provide enjoyment. The campaign is formatted in a way that seems like a grind rather than progression. The levels offer very little dynamics, meaning one portion of the campaigns play through is relatively similar to the next. Overall this game is relatively fun, and provides a good bit of enjoyment. It is a single player game and I’d really recommend getting Torchlight II over Torchlight, but if you are interested I’d say try to get this game when it’s on sale.\n\nPros:\n+Lots of gameplay – estimated 40+ hours.\n+Unique character class with dungeon generation which causes acceptable multi-play through.\n+Pet which provides decent dynamics and intelligent character building.\n+Once the main campaign is completed the game goes on.\n+Two types of leveling: Fame and Experience. Fame gives you points to level your special abilities, while experience gives you points to level both special abilities and character states.\n+Amazing item diversity and item building. Enchanting items allows them to become stronger which makes key items very powerful and effective for building a highly custom character.\n\nCons:\n-Poor controls moving and attacking utilize the same button.\n-No multiplayer\n-Pets stats are relatively low making them not entirely tank or damage.\n-Limited tutorial, this isn’t really that bad unless you are not averse to gaming.\n","February 20","true","42.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Skill trees offer greater flexibility at the cost of logic and simplicity -- if you're the sort of player who likes a little direction with their character development, you may find it frustrating.  8 out of 10.","July 4, 2011","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You get gems and sockets, transmutation, unique item drops or rares with random stats, town portal and identify scrolls, waypoints, hordes of mindless monsters, randomly generated dungeons, and skill trees. Unfortunately you lose out on multiplayer, varied environments, and a demon filled story to paste it together. Torchlight is not unique enough to not just be Diablo 2 version 1.x. And Diablo 2 version 1.x may still be better at being Diablo 2 version 1.x. That said, if you're a bit bored of killing the classic baddies of the Diablo series, but don't want to do anything unique either, this can actually be a bit of fun as a diversion. If you are a big fan of the genre there is never enough to go around. I hear Torchlight 2 is a big improvement. Diablo 3 has fairly well righted the ship. If you just want to loot all the things maybe even try Borderlands instead. 4/5","August 25, 2011","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Because reasons. I guess it's a good diablo-esque dungeon game. I wouldn't know. Ask people who actually like those sorts of games, because I'm not one of them.

I will play two additional classes to try and get some hardcore- and speedrun- achievements, but not further.\n\nA point worth mentioning is that there exist a lot of mods out there to enhance almost everything - additional quests, monsters, dungeons, a new GUI, only to mention a few things. Even better: They do not disable the achievements (only a very few mods do) but rather there are 3! achievements for having mods active while playing.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7 out of 10 and can recommend it when its in sale, although you MIGHT wanna play the second game instead.

I mean, everything from how you move and attack (left mouse to attack, shift+left  mouse to stationary attack), to the hack-n-slash style of the game's quests, to the scrolls of Town Portal, to socketed weapons and armor, to a three-pronged, Mana-powered skill tree, to the...well, you get the idea: it plays a lot like the old Diablo II game.  So, I guess one could argue that it's a Diablo II rip-off (and they may be right), but it's an extremely well made, easy to learn, fun to play game so it's hard to judge Torchlight too harshly.  I loved Diablo II and despite (or maybe because of?) the similarities, I'm having a ball with this game so far.  It's totally worth buying (especially on sale).  Yes, the story is pretty simplistic, but if you want a fun, doesn't-take-itself-too-seriously, hack-n-slash adventure game, then this is your ticket!  :)  Plus, the cartoony graphics sort of add to the charm of the game.","December 1, 2013","true","19.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I say this because many of the features, from the automap and music to the item sounds and classifications, are all evidence of the developers' previous works, which indeed includes Diablo II. I see this game as a kind of introduction to the type of game it is, whereas Diablo II is its apex. Despite my "for kids" label, this game is nevertheless fun and definitely worth playing. Coming from someone who has played Diablo II for years, this game constantly reminds me of its predecessor. If you like to play a Diablo II-like game, but without the dark, horror backdrop, this is a great game with which to begin your adventure.","July 19, 2013","true","34.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Wait, hold on... why is game even more colorful than D3, I thought it would be all dark and scary like Diablo. Also where's my god damned guided arrow, I'm an Amazon for christ's sake. Er, I mean... a Vanquisher. Oh well I guess this ricochet shot will do, and let's not forget to max the passive critical buff, criticals are awesome. Let's continue deeper down.\n\nSigh. The bottom rows of my inventory is literally filled with potions, Identify and Town Portal scrolls and managing all of it is making me crazy. Like stacks of 20? Seriously? I know Diablo had it as well but that was not why I loved that game. Anyway, I ain't picking up more of that ♥♥♥♥. I'll just buy it from the vendor. If only my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cat could teleport me back to town... I did teach him a friggin Town Portal spell after all. I mean what else is he supposed to do, he'll start fleeing immediately when engaged in combat.\n\nUm... why am I finding guns? This is not Dungeon Siege. Diablo had no guns. Oh great, now that I'm not picking up useless items anymore, I can't even see when I get rare or unique items because they're all hidden behind white trash and you need to be a surgical tech to pick them up. Honestly I can't even pick up what I want without picking up trash in the process so I'm just going to spam the click button.\n\nYay, final boss time. I kinda rushed through the later game and I'm fighting him at level 25. Luckily I just got my raining arrow skill so I can kite him for 20 minutes while dying now and then, not that it matters cause I can be revived on spot. Okay dead. What the... the floor is getting flooded with hundreds of dragon corpses. This is weird. I guess it makes up for every annoying experience I've had with this game.

The gameplay... well, you pretty much just smash and inicerate all the foes on your way, collect new equipment (Most of which you sell - most of stuff you find is not worth equiping) and level your character, unlocking new abilities. These are real fun and different for all three classes. You also get a dog (Or cat, or something weirder if you get a specific mod)  which can be sent to town to sell all the junk you don't need - works great for a speedrun. All the levels are randomly generated (That's what makes any Hack'n'Slash game so unrepeatable and fun) and all the locations look great. Only issue is that weapons and abilities are bit unbalanced - dual wield is best, 2-hands suck. Graphics are simple but neat and remind me of Warcraft 3.","September 25, 2011","true","67.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Players who enjoy those kinds of games and/or are loot and stat junkies will absolutely adore Torchlight however everyone else will probably run out of steam once the main "story" is completed.\n\nThere's tons of loot ranging from common stuff to rare items and sets of items to track down, you have three character types to choose from (the basic three: warrior, rogue, and wizard who each have three skill trees), you've got a pet that will carry loot and even transform into different things when you feed it fish, the different sections of the dungeon are artistically well done, and the range of enemies is definitely substantial.\n\nOther than being a solid dungeon crawler though there's not much else to attract those who aren't quite fans of that genre. The story is paper thin, theres absolutely no characterization in regards to your own avatar or the very few NPCs, the sidequests are uninspired (get this, kill that, go to a different dungeon and get this) and the whole thing just feels like a time sink - one that will definitely appeal to some but will leave others bored and ready to move on to something else after a couple of hours.\n\nThe best way to really describe Torchlight: you're going to love it or hate it. Unfortunately I tend to put a good deal of emphasis on narrative, the game world, etc and this game just straight up doesn't have that.","July 27, 2013","false","16.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The graphics are varied and colorful, the sound and music are fitting and sharp, and the controls are simple and effective.\n\nTorchlight's story and gameplay, however, fall short.  Our hero will massacre thousands of creatures in order to save a couple of humans the trouble of moving.\n\nThe gameplay only matches the story's blandness.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalTruth/recommended/41500/","TacticalTruth","TacticalTruth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalTruth/","184 products in account","Torchlight: a dull glow\n\nI played Torchlight way back when it first came out, circa 2009. I enjoyed it, but there were some things that just nagged at me while I played it. Unfortunately, the more I played it, the less I liked it. Going further and further into the game did not increase my enjoyment. And I ultimately stopped playing.\n\nSadly that perfectly describes my most recent experience with Torchlight.\n\nI’ve tried to figure out just what it is that I don’t like, but every time I formulate my thoughts I come up with the same conclusion:\n\nThe game feels hollow and generic.\n\nIt doesn’t seem to have it’s own identity or stand out as unique from other games in the ARPG genre. Hell, Torchlight is essentially an “HD remake” of Diablo from 1996… without the “Hell.” The game follows the same basic progression and is, in many ways the same game, but with less of an edge.\n\nI feel that really hurts Torchlight.\n\nPlenty of games can be fun without a cool in-game world or a “gritty” story hook to pull you in. It’s gameplay that matters in the end, right? Sadly I think that Torchlight also falls flat here as well.\n\nTorchlight is pretty a pretty shallow game, to its detriment. Killing monsters is fun in its own right, but only for so long. Other ARPGs alleviate this by giving you things to work for: new more powerful items, more powerful skills, harder challenges, etc. Torchlight does have all of these things… they’re just not interesting. So although the game does have the “carrot on a stick” incentive to continue playing… I’m, sadly, not interested in the carrot.\n\nI found the gameplay to be rather lackluster and boring. Torchlight’s art style does not appeal to me. The environments lacked feeling, and ultimately felt sterile. The items in the game were shallow, and only the “unique” items had any flavor. The various character skills weren’t very impressive, and didn’t feel very powerful.\n\nBut let’s break down the individual pieces of Torchlight and critique it against the five points I mentioned previously.\n\nAtmosphere and Story\n\nAtmosphere\n\nthe pervading tone or mood of a place, situation, or work of art.\n\nTorchlight has little to no atmosphere. Certain areas in the game look pretty darn cool, but carry absolutely no feeling.\n\nMy favorite areas are a necropolis found underneath the mines beneath Torchlight (Yes, that’s the name of the town) and the underground jungle-temple ruins beneath the necropolis. Why I like these two areas over all the others? Probably because they have the most ‘flavor’. But even then it’s spread pretty thin.\n\nThere isn’t much to be said about the game’s various locales other than that they don’t make much sense and require a bit too much suspension of disbelief for my taste.\n\nStory\nan account of imaginary or real people and events told for entertainment.\n\nI consider story to be tied very closely with atmosphere, and like Torchlight’s atmosphere, there isn’t really much to be said about the story. It’s pretty generic and could be summarized in two sentences: “Torchlight was built over a corrupted source of magic caused by an ancient evil deep within the Earth. Go kill it.”\n\nMore accurately: The town of Torchlight is mining a substance called Ember, which allows for the various forms of magic in the world, but it turns out the Ember under Torchlight is corrupt and will turn anyone who comes into contact with it evil! This is because the Ember Vein runs over an ancient evil, later revealed to be a dragon. You are called to Torchlight to help the mining operation, which is being attacked by monsters, but are promptly betrayed by the man who summoned you. As it turns out he wants to revive the dragon sleeping beneath Torchlight. And you, the hero, have to stop him by traveling deeper and deeper into the Earth uncovering older and older civilizations that fell to the corrupting allure of the Ember.\n\nPretty good ideas! Not going to lie, there’s definitely a cool story in there. But it’s really only used as an occasional spur to remind you to continue murdering monsters as you travel what seems like miles into the earth. A shame, really.\n\nThere is very little involvement in the story, and to be honest the voice acting is pretty hammy. If you like that sort of thing, then good on ya! I had to skip most of it.\n\nBut hey, atleast you can skip it! Actually all of it! Which is nice.\n\nEnemies\nthe persons who are actively opposed or hostile to someone or something.\n\nUnfortunately, the enemies in torchlight are boring. There isn’t any way around it. I don’t like their designs, and none of them really seem to have any interesting mechanics to differentiate them. They’re all just bigger and bigger punching bags. Some will revive their comrades, and some will leave noxious fumes after death. But by and large, the majority of them are meat sacks that fling their bodies against your weapons.\n\nIt doesn’t help that the enemies have massive spikes in difficulty towards the end of the game. There is a LARGE increase in enemy health and damage in the last area. And every time I’ve played, it has come as a shock.\n\nI’ll be doing just fine, then I’ll walk into the last section of the game and be murdered. Only to find that I’m unable to deal significant damage to the enemies. Their scaling seems to be off, and it’s just not fun.\n\nYour Character\n\nthe representation or expression of something in a tangible or visible form.\n\nTorchlight utilizes the typical stat system. Your RPG standards are all present: Strength, Dexterity, Magic, Life, and Defense. Every time you level, the game gives you five points to allocate to each of these different parameters. Unfortunately it seems like the various stat points are really just a way of directing your progression. It didn’t seem as though loading a bunch of points into Magic made my Alchemist’s magic any more powerful, despite it being his main damage stat. It seemed as though it was just a holdover from previous games. “Diablo had them, so Torchlight will too.”\n\nReally the stats just felt like numbers I had to inflate in order to put on different armor. My character’s power seemed to be located in the weapons and armor he was wearing rather than the character himself.\n\nSkills\n\nskill or expertise in a particular activity or field\n\nTorchlight also follows a rather traditional skill tree format, present in almost every ARPG. Ever.\nThat’s perfectly fine. Skill trees are used so commonly because they work. Sadly, the skills in Torchlight are boring. Plain and simple. The coolest spells I got for my Alchemist were Chain Lightning and a laser. Everything else rather boring.\n\nI think that is was a major contributing factor to why Torchlight felt boring to me. The three different classes all had pretty boring skills. Nothing really stands out, and everything felt pretty lame.\n\nItemization\n\nthe balance and distribution of items, their types, and the various effects, powers, and statistics attached to them\n\nLast but not least, the items. Again, there isn’t a lot to say. Torchlight’s items were rather lacking. Most items are of the, “+10 fire damage,” “+20 lightning damage,” “+5% attack speed” variety. Nothing to write home about.\n\nThis is probably the one aspect of the game where Torchlight tried its hardest to please me.\n\nI received about 7 unique items before reaching level 15. Unique items are Torchlight’s highest rarity item, apparently. They were all decent, and some of the unique wands I found had cool effects that altered combat, like shots bouncing and releasing arcs of electricity on the ground. But they were little more than more powerful versions of the base items. Not particularly exciting.\n\nBoring skills, boring monsters, boring items, boring combat.\n\nVery sad indeed.","October 5, 2015","false","6.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It is basically a very poor shadow of Torchlight II, which to an extent is to be expected, but the gap in quality between the two games beggars belief. Characters don't amass enough potions or skills to make the game about anything except plugging away and resurrecting constantly because you can't stay alive with the tools you've got. What's worse, if you're fighting a boss and you die, choose to resurrect in town (because you inevitably have no health potions left), then try to take a Waygate back, getting back is a matter of complete luck. I fought my way through ten levels of the dungeon and then got to the very last level, just to die and have to go back to town, and then found I had to traverse all three dungeons again. This would have been annoying in any normal game, but in this game it was unbelievably, gut-wrenchingly painful, since all the dungeons were filled with monsters anew. Needless to say I used all my health potions just re-traversing them, and after half an hour of repeating what I had already done, gave up and never made it back to the final boss. I am counting this as clocked because it doesn't deserve any more of my time. I was so close to finishing and that would normally not be good enough for me, but under these circumstances, that's all I'm willing to concede.","July 4, 2014","false","13.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I must say, it's refreshing to have a game that rewards you for playing it. But only to a point, it seems. There's a lot to like here, but obviously it is a few years old now - it is still a fun dungeon romp to introduce you to the Torchlight universe.\n\nThat said, the game gets fairly repetitive, fairly quickly. If you've played 20 levels of the game, you've played 100. That can be fine if the game kept mixing things up somehow - but theres not enough here to hold your interest.\n\nThat combined with that it's a single player only experience? Don't bother. Torchlight stands as good game, but a game that is showing it's age. Pick up Torchlight 2 instead.

It will say a 4 or 6% chance, but that is complete crap. When it says 4 or 6% its really like a 25 or 50% chance that your best item will become worthless.\n\nThis may seem like a silly thing to give a bad review about, but getting new equipment and experimenting with the gameplay is half of the fun in a game that is not very hard.

I remember when this game first came out. Remember too? The graphics were just plain ugly even back then.\nTorchlight's history in short is that most of the Dev team worked on Diablo 1, 2 and every expansion in between. And that is exactly what makes Torchlight a complete failure.\n\n\nFrom the very first second I played it, I didn't like anything. The style, the visuals, the setting.... It feels rushed and unfinished. Normally I do a Pro v Con list but there are no Pros here, so here are just the worst things about Torchlight.\n\n- Linear Gameplay: I can't stress this enough, It may very well be the only thing that's absolutely wrong with this game but it's a big one. Ever played a 2D platformer, like Mario? Well that's just about as linear as you can get. Just go from start to finish, no deviation in between. To have something like that in a 3D game is... is...what? Why? But that's what Torchlight is, constantly. You go down and then you follow the path, follow it, kill every enemy you see and keep following the path.\n\n- Music: Well the town music is very similar if not the same as in Diablo 1 and 2. Because they hired the same guy to make the soundtrack. It shows, it isn't good. They probably thought that it'd be nice to have music that sounds the same as a far superior game. But by doing so, they hit the same note when an awful movie refers to a better movie during the movie.\n\n- Classes: Three character classes...? This is an RPG right? What kind of RPG only has 3 classes? Maybe Torchlight isn't the only one, but it should be. There really isn't an excuse for that, most RPGs already have the same classes over and over. But Torchlight takes the most generic 3 classes too, Melee Ranged and Wizard/Summoner\nNone of which are any fun while running towards the next level down.\n\n- Graphics: I'm not a graphic freak, I honestly don't care about them, choppy framerate? I'm probably the last person to notice, but these GFX?! No! Just no, why is everything squareish? Was the Dev team all like "We need something round but a dodecahedron is easier to draw." I don't think so, don't like it\n\nFinal verdict, Torchlight is nothing more than a Diablo clone. But I've played several clones in my day, this is by far the worst one. Torchlight feels like an empty vessel, like a game without a soul. It has no identity other than the one it tries to be. I heard that the sequel is far better.","May 10","false","10.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

This game is so incredibly repetitive! The level design is basically the same with textures only differing. The quests are always the same, near the end I just focused on the main quest to get it over with because it got so boring. But the first couple of hours of this game are good, the story is'nt much but the magic system is good with really great spells, although I didn't get to check them all out. The quests also didn't give you good rewards, they were usless, I was a warrior and for a reward they have be a wand, a wand! Why not set the rewards to the specific class! Although it does give a Diablo fell which makes it fun. I spent about 16 hours on this game with about half of it just try to complete it. I have heard that they changed Torchlight 2 so maybe skip this one and go onto the 2nd one instead. I have played the demo and it looked ok, with some customization and you can travel from different towns instead of staying in the same mine all the time. I would strongly avoid this game because you will get bored quickly.\n\n3/10\n\nPapa Hale Storm","November 25, 2013","false","16.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/41500/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","In Torchlight, you are drawn to a town, also called Torchlight, where a magical ore called Ember is mined. As you move down through the dungeon, you learn that Ember has a corrupting effect on any who use it, and has led to the downfall of a number of civilizations before yours. It's not the deepest story in the history of RPGs, but it is clear that the developers put real effort into it. The writing is miles better than that of many other hack & slash games I've played as well. The same can't really be said of the sidequests, which follow the exact pattern from Fate: your task is always to kill a specific boss and/or retrieve a specific piece of loot, with little real reason given. I don't think of this as a significant problem, though. Instead, I think it's pretty standard for action games.\n\nTorchlight may only be above average in the story department, but its gameplay is outstanding. It takes good ideas from the developers' previous games and improves on them in just about every way possible. There are three character classes (essentially, a barbarian, a ranged character, and a magician), each of which plays very differently from the others, and each of which can be viably developed in several ways as you level up. For example, my first character was a magician who focused almost entirely on summoning, similar to Diablo II's Necromancer. I could have put my points into casting spells, though, and been more similar to the Sorceress.\n\nEach class has three skill trees, although certain skills like "ranged weapons mastery" show up in the trees of all classes. I appreciated that, since I wanted my summoner to dual-wield pistols – something he's not necessarily good at by default. In addition, there are magic scrolls, found as loot or purchased, that allow you to teach certain skills to any character. I loved having that ability, because it allowed my barbarian to cast town portal spells and identify magical items; skills that many RPGs restrict to the magician class.\n\nIn Torchlight, your character is constantly accompanied by a pet dog or cat. You can catch fish and feed them to your pet to change them (temporarily or permanently) into another animal/monster, and I was overjoyed to see that Torchlight doesn't make you waste inventory space on a fishing pole to do so. Your pet levels up along with you, and it can wear two rings and a necklace, which is nice. The pet also has an inventory, can be directed to pick things up, and can be sent back to town at any point to sell loot. Doing so really helps keep the game flowing because like any good hack & slash game, you'll pick up a lot of loot, and going back to town to sell it is annoying.\n\nYour pet doesn't just serve as a pack mule, though, or even as simply a meat shield. You can also teach it any of the spells learned from scrolls. It can only learn two spells, but the pet AI makes good use of whatever you give it. I liked my cat to be able to summon zombies and leech health from attacks, but a dog who can throw fireballs and heal the whole party sounds pretty awesome too.\n\nThe main story takes you down through one long dungeon to a final boss battle, but once you've beaten it, a second, never-ending, randomly generated dungeon is unlocked where the monsters scale to your current level, so you can keep playing with the same character as long as you want. In addition, maps can be purchased from vendors that take you to shorter randomly generated dungeons. These serve as a nice break from the main storyline or even a place to grind for levels and loot if you ever find yourself in need of doing so. Interestingly, there are also random monsters called "phase beasts" that open a portal to a one-level dungeon when killed. Again, the only reason to go to these dungeons is to get loot and experience, but they seem to give good loot, so they are worth the time.\n\nThere are a hundred other things I could talk about in terms of gameplay, but I won't. Instead, I'll limit myself to four brief things I can't leave out of my review. One: you can install gems in your equipable items, and when you're ready to upgrade something, you can destroy the gems and keep the item or vice versa. I would have loved this in Diablo II, where I agonized over actually using all of those runes I collected. Two: each character has their own inventory, their pet's inventory, a private stash in town, and a stash that they share with all of your other characters. If you love to hoard items, this is a dream come true, because it makes passing items between characters and creating "mule" characters a breeze. Three: Torchlight is designed to make modding easy. It's reportedly a piece of cake to create mods, and I can confirm that it takes almost zero effort to install them. There are a lot of mods out there, and they range from the classic "I'm lazy, so I'll break the game's balance" to simple, but really nice, things like changing the opacity of the mini-map. I even installed a mod that unlocks a ferret as a third pet option. Four: when you look at weapons in your inventory, you're shown their attack speed and the damage they do, but you're also shown their DPS (damage per second), which is a huge help when deciding whether to trade up to a new weapon.\n\nThere is one thing missing in Torchlight's gameplay, though: multiplayer. I rarely play games online, so I didn't miss it, but I know that this may be a deal-breaker for some gamers. It stands up very well as a single-player experience, though, so if you're interested in this kind of game, I'd urge you to give it a shot despite that lack.\n\nGraphically, Torchlight made me very happy as well. It's not that this is the prettiest game you'll ever see, because it's no Crysis. It's that it looks great on even a lousy setup like mine. There's even a "netbook" mode to allow machines even weaker than mine to play.\n\nThe game really does look good. Spell effects are plentiful, and weapons that do elemental damage throw the appropriate sparks, flames, or snow. The environments are rendered in full 3D, and use the classic overhead isometric camera. Like any game with that camera, it has to deal with the issue of environmental elements getting in the way, and Torchlight's solution is to render a sort of x-ray version of the character. Friends are blue, enemies are red, which really helps. Stylistically, it falls halfway between Fate and Diablo II.\n\nThis game sounds great, both in terms of music and sound effects. Certain sounds are almost identical to their Diablo II counterparts, but that is so common in this type of game that I find it hard to criticize. My only true complaint is that when your pet gets injured, they whine, which can be annoying if they're surrounded by a huge pack of enemies.\n\nTorchlight controls very simply, but in a good way. You click on the ground to move or on enemies to attack them, and I like the fact that it's fairly forgiving. If you are pretty close to an enemy when you click, you'll attack, which really helps when dealing with fast-moving enemies. Skills, scrolls, and potions can be assigned to slots for the 1-0 buttons on your keyboard. You can equip two sets of weapons and switch between them at any time by pressing W, which came in handy for me on many occasions. Buttons are assigned to your inventory, your skill tree, etc., but they're easily accessible through on-screen icons as well. It isn't groundbreaking, it's just a good implementation of tried-and-true controls.\n\nIn the broadest terms, there are two ways to make a great game: do something cool that hasn't been done before, or do a great job of improving on things that have been done before. Torchlight falls pretty firmly in the second category, but that doesn't make it any less great.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 26, 2014","true","12.6"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","0"

Combat seems like it takes forever and needs no real type of skill. You expect a dungeon crawler where the main premise is to keep upgrading gear to get better but Torchlight seems to fail at this as new gear for my character came far and few between. I ended up ending the game with a level 10 piece of gear at level 36 because it had better stats then anything i could find. At least your pet can hike this stuff back to town to vendor for you, giving him more then the benefit of a lowly ai companion And last the final boss was a letdown due to the fact that he is easy to deal with but the devs just gave him absurd amounts of health that took a long time to windle down. The game does offer great art style that is pleasing to the eyes and never gets dull as the enviroment changes often.\n\n\n2.5/5\n\n**From what I heard TL2 improves on a lot that made this game average so it is best to go for that instead of this one if you want a Diablo 3 alternative**","May 28, 2014","false","12.4"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","4"

The game is literally just running through a 30 floor dungeon while killing everything with one (mouse) button. Has none of the charm that the games in the genre usually have, upgrading gear isn't at all satisfying and doesn't change the game at all from start to finish. There are more spells, but there's really no point when you can just click fireball through the whole game and kill everything and drink a potion once in a while. Mainly played through to find out why everyone praises the game and it was nothing to write home about.

TL is a game that would suit youngsters that don't have access to the internet and do not have the ability to play WOW. To all others unfortunately in the current tiem i would advise to get TL2 and avoid this complete diablo clone with WOW visuals....even the music in TL has been completely copied to this game. My guess is this is a diablo mod with new WOW skin and package as an entirely different game. NO! It sounds, plays and acts just like diablo even down tot he narration. had this game came out in 2004 it would of been great as an alternative to WOW, but sadly this is lil too late and retro won't even save it.\n\nMy biggest gripe is not the game, but the recent critics that reviewed this as decent.....yeah maybe 8-10 years ago!!!

It’s not a buggy game, everything works very efficiently, and the graphics and sounds have a clear unity to them. But I will never ever touch to this game again if possible. It doesn’t have any charm, the setting is dull beyond all belief, the identity it tries to build falls flat, the combat is exhaustingly boring, and the item hoarding reached its new pointless peak. Like I said there’s a unity to the graphics but they possess no appeal whatsoever. They’re just there. They don’t add anything to the game — certainly not atmosphere. Everything looks like a kiddy cartoon and strips the experience from any emotion there was left. You never find anything useful in the dungeons. I bought everything I used and only gathered stuff to sell it. The spells are useless. I wanted a mage but ended up using the special skill that by the way don’t get bonuses from your skills that you can level up. The levels are so repetitive that I barely noticed when their themes changed. The general jist of it was: switch the doodads around a bit and put up different color wallpapers. Then there are the end bosses which bring the word “boring” to a new level. It’s just running and grinding. For minutes. Or in the case of the final boss possibly HOURS (I can’t know for sure because I had to use cheat codes to get through it before I fell asleep). This game does so many things wrong that it doesn’t deserve any sort of recognition. It is just horrible.","November 25, 2013","false","12.4"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

To be honest, it reminded me of the worst parts of playing WoW: Boring grinding and sorting through loot.\n\nIf you could get this for very cheap, I could see you getting your money's worth, but with Torchlight 2 already out, I think I would have to recommend picking that up instead.\n\nI will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.","November 25, 2013","false","14.5"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

Hit detection and controls are more clunky that I would like them to be - if you can stomach the repetition, belong to the "Diablo 3 sucks"-crowd or are a newcomer to the genre this title might provide some lasting appeal but in the long run it's a complete waste of time and the ultimate grind.","December 1, 2012","false","13.4"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","7","0","0"

Diablo III was going to be released soon, and I didn’t want to get involved in a similar game when I knew that my time was going to be devoted to Blizzard’s mighty franchise.\n\nDiablo III came and went, however, I will try my best not to focus this review on Diablo III versus Torchlight, though I very much want to. I think for this review it would be best to try to articulate the things that make Torchlight a fine game by itself.\n\nSet in a colorful (though mainly steampunk-esque) fantasy world, the town of Torchlight is the only hub world to find in the entire game. All other dungeon crawling is done in ONE dungeon, which you must descend in order to advance the main storyline. Thankfully, several floors are themed, with unique enemies, traps, and décor. Although the enemy types are not varied enough for my liking (there’s really only four or five enemy types in every theme), the floor themes shift often enough to keep me interested.\n\nThe visuals are stunning, although the character models are shaped like chunky children’s toys, with bright spell effects and impressive monster types. It feels as if every color in the visible spectrum is fully represented on-screen sometimes, but everything still remains clear enough to know where your character is in relation to the enemy at all times.\n\nAlthough the lack of multiplayer was addressed for the sequel, it is sorely lacking for this title, as I would have completely enjoyed bombing around this world with a group of buddies, storming through underground jungles and blasting apart lava prison ramparts. I felt like I was always making forward progress and improving my character, yet I never felt completely godlike nor outmatched against my enemies. I was genuinely pleased with my character in this game, though only the “big three” choices are offered (ranger, warrior, mage).\n\nTorchlight 2 may have taken everything right with the game and improved the formula even further, but I can actually recommend the first game to someone easily, especially so if it’s on sale. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys RPGs, or fantasy games in general.","December 8, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have always preferred a game with graphics that did not give you the feeling you are playing a cartoon game but instead puts you into the game and makes you feel like you are living it or a part of you. This game does not do that. For those that simply love the cartoon style games with a dungeon feel to it then this is for you.

Steam has me clocked in (currently) at just under 6 hours of play time. I, however have tons more time invested in this game as I have also completed it on my Xbox 360. Owning this game on two different systems should be enough praise to get you to buy it. To add a little more fuel to this, if they add this game to the Xbox One list I will buy it there as well.\n\nI love Diablo....LOVE it. I've been playing the Diablo franchise since it was first unleashed opon the world all those years ago. It has everything I could want in a good game and Torchlight, being a Diablo clone (and very competent one at that) does it all just as well. Sure Torchlight has a more cartoon like feel and is more comic book like in its graphics, but that's not a bad thing. It deos everything right. Quests, gear, challenge..it does it all just as well as Diablo ever could.\n\nIf you don't haver the money to get  Diablo itself, Torchlight is a great substitute. Hours of fun, great environment, excellent level design and you can tell the devs put love into its creation. Highly recommended.","January 13, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then this is the title for you! Brought to us gamers by some of the creators of the original Diablo, and plays just like it with a few new additions. Unlike Diablo this game allows to have a pet, which will level up alongside you. You can even use special potions to temporarily change them into some of the beasts you will fight! This game also has a more animated look kind of like Fable meets Borderlands. Only downside is that there is no co-op in this game, but that is why Torchlight 2 is in the works!

So much to do and never gets old. If your in a game for a story line then this one may not be for you because the story isn't very in deapth but it is a neat one to follow along with but gameplay wise there is so much to do .. To bad its only single player but being able to collect gear and stash it in your "tickle trunk" is awsome but when you find something you don't use normally it would be "ah crap ... more crap!" but now you can actually put it in a seperate chest that is shared between every character you create so that you can transfer items that you find between them. Then the multitude of dungeons you can explore which are all randomly generated. Plus there is rudementary crafting, easy gear upgrades and enchants, thousands of different gear variations and sets that will blow your mind!  Only way I can compare this at all is a more fancied up version of Diablo 2 but with a twist and a hell of alot less hassle! - GET IT!! :)","November 26, 2011","true","69.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Matt Uelman's music is still excellent, however the music is a clear re-edit of his compositions for Diablo 2, rather than newly composed which is somewhat disappointing. As for the gameplay, it is of course nearly identical to that of Diablo and Diablo 2, unsurprising of course due to the development team. Yet it is of course this specific gameplay that makes Torchlight so much fun. Even though its simple, there is still enough customization to make it interesting, and it is a great game to come home to play after a long day of work, when your brain isn't exactly capable of processing a demanding overload of input.\nAs for the environments and plot, well it's your standard fare, executed well but not anything to expect greatness or insight from. But then we're not exactly playing it because it's redefining a genre, we're playing it because it's just simple fun.\n\nAs an older game its a light, easy, quick install and will run well on most hardware with advanced graphics settings on.","August 9, 2014","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Random dungeons make for good replayability. Oh and, by design, this game is easily modded, and there's already tons of great mods out. These mods do everything from simple skins, adding enhanced camera controls, to new levels, new skills, and new classes.

Matt Uelman's music is still excellent, however the music is a clear re-edit of his compositions for Diablo 2, rather than newly composed which is somewhat disappointing. As for the gameplay, it is of course nearly identical to that of Diablo and Diablo 2, unsurprising of course due to the development team. Yet it is of course this specific gameplay that makes Torchlight so much fun. Even though its simple, there is still enough customization to make it interesting, and it is a great game to come home to play after a long day of work, when your brain isn't exactly capable of processing a demanding overload of input.\nAs for the environments and plot, well it's your standard fare, executed well but not anything to expect greatness or insight from. But then we're not exactly playing it because it's redefining a genre, we're playing it because it's just simple fun.\n\nAs an older game its a light, easy, quick install and will run well on most hardware with advanced graphics settings on.","August 9, 2014","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Steam has me clocked in (currently) at just under 6 hours of play time. I, however have tons more time invested in this game as I have also completed it on my Xbox 360. Owning this game on two different systems should be enough praise to get you to buy it. To add a little more fuel to this, if they add this game to the Xbox One list I will buy it there as well.\n\nI love Diablo....LOVE it. I've been playing the Diablo franchise since it was first unleashed opon the world all those years ago. It has everything I could want in a good game and Torchlight, being a Diablo clone (and very competent one at that) does it all just as well. Sure Torchlight has a more cartoon like feel and is more comic book like in its graphics, but that's not a bad thing. It deos everything right. Quests, gear, challenge..it does it all just as well as Diablo ever could.\n\nIf you don't haver the money to get  Diablo itself, Torchlight is a great substitute. Hours of fun, great environment, excellent level design and you can tell the devs put love into its creation. Highly recommended.","January 13, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Diablo III was going to be released soon, and I didn’t want to get involved in a similar game when I knew that my time was going to be devoted to Blizzard’s mighty franchise.\n\nDiablo III came and went, however, I will try my best not to focus this review on Diablo III versus Torchlight, though I very much want to. I think for this review it would be best to try to articulate the things that make Torchlight a fine game by itself.\n\nSet in a colorful (though mainly steampunk-esque) fantasy world, the town of Torchlight is the only hub world to find in the entire game. All other dungeon crawling is done in ONE dungeon, which you must descend in order to advance the main storyline. Thankfully, several floors are themed, with unique enemies, traps, and décor. Although the enemy types are not varied enough for my liking (there’s really only four or five enemy types in every theme), the floor themes shift often enough to keep me interested.\n\nThe visuals are stunning, although the character models are shaped like chunky children’s toys, with bright spell effects and impressive monster types. It feels as if every color in the visible spectrum is fully represented on-screen sometimes, but everything still remains clear enough to know where your character is in relation to the enemy at all times.\n\nAlthough the lack of multiplayer was addressed for the sequel, it is sorely lacking for this title, as I would have completely enjoyed bombing around this world with a group of buddies, storming through underground jungles and blasting apart lava prison ramparts. I felt like I was always making forward progress and improving my character, yet I never felt completely godlike nor outmatched against my enemies. I was genuinely pleased with my character in this game, though only the “big three” choices are offered (ranger, warrior, mage).\n\nTorchlight 2 may have taken everything right with the game and improved the formula even further, but I can actually recommend the first game to someone easily, especially so if it’s on sale. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys RPGs, or fantasy games in general.","December 8, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a budget version of Diablo 2 but with all the fat and grind removed and a delightful level of enhancement added to the experience.  The visuals are very pleasant, eschewing the grim gore and putrid monsters of Diablo with an almost storybook charm.\n\nThe game is incredibly smooth and easy to play. Your character quickly levels up in power and the improvements noticeably make a big difference. The pet is a brilliant tool for adding to your damage and your personal economy, and it's all too easy to get attached to the little bugger. The 3 character classes add a lot of replay value and the upgradable skills diversify the personality of gamplay immensely.\n\nUnfortunately there's no multiplayer.  Single player is strong enough to make me forget about that however, even though there's little interest to the story.\n\n$15 is a terrific value, but the sale prices of $7.50 and $5 = INSTANT BUY.

It basically takes the structure of Diablo II and copies it exactly, while adding a few things, upgrading the graphics, and putting it underground. It's a good action RPG, as Diablo II was. From what I've seen, it's light on story, but pretty fun.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to finish Torchlight. That's probably because the game's single player only, and I only finished Diablo II because it was a lot more fun with friends. I think the lack of story probably contributed too, since I didn't have a motivating factor to push me through it.\n\nIf you really liked Diablo II, just buy it now. If not, you won't like this either. If you're on the fence, then I'd wait until Torchlight goes on sale. As far as $20 games go, it's not a bad choice, but I'd rather point you to Neverwinter Nights 2. NWN2 has slower, more complex gameplay but a far superior story. Or, if you can spend more, check out the Dragon Age games, which I find superior in both ways.","February 28, 2011","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has some serious balance issues later into the game. Most "old ARPG" annoyances (that modern games like Diable 3 address) are rectafiable via mods. Class skill trees can be imbalanced, but again mods fix that. Actually, mods are a godsend for this game. Lots of quality-of-life upgrades immensely changed my satisfaction with the game. The story is completely throwaway, so if you're looking for a decent one then you better keep searching. Overall an enjoyable experience, but I would recommend just going straight to Torchlight II as it is vastly improved upon and contains multiplayer.","December 29, 2013","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a good intro to the Torchlight world, expecially if you played T2 before T1.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the experience.\n\nEdit: This game gives impression that the devs, started something good, but didn't had time or for some reason didn't finished it well. Only creatures I respect are Tutara and the goblins as they make lot of damage and makes you wonder how can I pass this obstacle more efficient.\nThe big trees hitting your head, are just funny and seem placed there to just improve the graphics :D\n\nBut I like the environment, from floor to floor, it changes which is enjoyable.","April 19, 2015","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You should already know, should already at least have heard of Diablo-styled games if you weren't living in a cave.  However, I review this game as a gamer, and not a hardened veteran of the genre.  I think I've only played this game type less than five times.\n\nThe game is colorful, that's for sure.  The best way to characterize it is that it gives a feeling of polished Warcraft 3 graphics.  Most things are visually pleasing, but you cannot customize your character - at all.  Many of the bits of gear are shared templates.  The soundtrack is suitable but completely forgettable.  The voice acting, what little of it there is, is pretty good.  Now on to the meat.\n\nYou have your pick of three classes: an alchemist, a destroyer, and a vanquisher, and they are all genderlocked.  That is, a mage, a warrior, and a rogue.  Each class has three skill trees, but there aren't that many actual skills, and the variety only goes up to level 25.\n\nThis is important: you cannot respec.  This is a problem because many skills either do not scale well, or become obsolete.  Both Torchlight games are moddable, so I assume SOMEONE must have included a mod for this, but if you're going to play vanilla, you'll be stuck with whatever you've got.  You can look up builds, but I'm going to be up front here - if you're on Normal or Easy mode, you can probably completely screw up your character and still make it through.\n\nYour stats generate base values for certain abiliites of course, and determine what kinds of gear you can wear.  More on this in a moment.\n\nYou can also learn up to 4 spells from scrolls, and are able to unlearn and switch them out with better versions/different ones once you find or buy them.  This was important for the alchemist, because he HAD NO HEALING SPELL.  I bet that since the mage didn't have one, the other two classes didn't either.\n\nYour pet, whom you pick at the beginning of the game, serves several functions.  He attacks, of course, and you can feed him fish to turn him into various other creatures temporarily.  Fishing as a mini-game is amusing for all of five minutes, and in spite of what it does I never needed it.  He can hold as much loot as you can, he can learn two spells, equip two rings and a necklace, AND you can send him back to town to sell whatever he's got in his inventory.  Once I figured this out the only time I went back to town was to pick up more quests.  If you shift-click you can have him pick up items (I typically had mine loot "grays"), but there's no way to have him pick up anything by himself.\n\nAs I trudged through the main dungeon's innards during the game's woefully simple plot, several things became immediately apparent.  The first is that if, like me, you prefer to do sidequests before the main quest, you will be massively overleveled.  Normal mode has been written off as too easy by pretty much everyone, and the sidequest mechanic doesn't help.  Through most of the latter third of the game I found my mage running around with his small army of minions basic-attacking things with a wand and shield and positively steamrolling EVERYTHING.  Which brings me to my next point.\n\nSometimes limitations are there for a reason.  Each class has 3 trees, but since the gear is stat-based, you can have mostly any kind of character you want.  My mage was fairly balanced between offensive spells and minions.  I basically ran around with my two golems, the pet, two imps, 6 zombies (three from the pet), occasionally 6 skeletons (all from the pet), firing overpowered thunderbolts while teleporting around with a damage absorbing shield.  With each wave of that wand I stole both health and mana.  I'm fairly sure I wasted several precious skill points on abilities that were out-leveled or simply not very good in the first place.  The fact that I was doing it all in half-warrior gear was the icing on the OP cake, and frankly the game just wasn't up to the challenge.\n\nThe interface was a little... quirky.  You cannot rebind keys, and you only get one quickslot bar for skills and potions.  Left click and right click can be designated as well, with a third Tab-accessed function for right click.  By the end of the game, at least half of my skills could not be used, because you apparently cannot use them from the skill menu and I had no space for them.\n\nSometimes, when re-arranging inventories (there is no auto-sort), I'd accidentally stick a gem into an item.  Using most of the items from the inventory screen requires a RIGHT click, but apparently not gems.  The only way to get them back out is to destroy the items.  You have two inventory pages thanks to the pet, one bank, and a storage bin that's shared between all characters.  It's not a lot of space considering the game is about loot.\n\nThe vendors are what you'd expect, with one exception:  the enchanter.  His sole function is to turn whatever item you give him into a better item, which can mean either stats or gem sockets.  Although I hardly used it, I thought this was a pretty nice feature.  There's a % chance of the item become disenchanted.  It's a nice way to upgrade generic gear that may have better base value than older gear, though the process is hideously expensive.\n\nThe clicking frenzy of battle works fine for a warrior, I'd imagine, but is a bit messy for a mage with minions, and probably a ranged rogue too.  Some skills go right where you click them, some require only pointing in the general direction of a mob.  Attacking with a ranged weapon when there are many mobs is frustrating, and since left-click to move is a thing, I frequently found my mage running headfirst into groups of mobs whenever he'd use his wand.  The key point is that basic attacks do NOT activate unless you click right ON the mob, and if you have minions this can be a real mess.  Sometimes skills can be used up or down staircases, and sometimes they can't, often times for the same skill.  This sort of randomness is not a major gripe, but it's definitely noticeable.\n\nAI companion pathing is reasonable.  Many times my minions would be stuck in nearby areas because the levels are packed fairly tightly with many turns.  If you want to be cheap you can hit enemies with ranged attacks in other areas of the map because they're not smart enough to find their way to you.\n\nSpeaking of those levels, one of the talking points of the game is the randomized environments.  Truthfully, you'll notice some repeated designs, but for the most part you either won't notice or care.\n\nThe difficulty in the final few floors ramps up dramatically, even if you're five levels higher than the mobs.  It's hard to know what combination of possibly gimped character stats, and a couple of cheap monsters created the difficulty, but it was the only time in the game where I died.  And the last boss?  Oh, you better be ready for that cheapness.  The final battle was completely unimaginative to boot.\n\nIf you complete the few long-running sidequests along with the main story, you'll probably look at somewhere between 15-20 hours of play.  Some people blast through it (especially on easy mode) in 6 hours, and some people blow over 60 hours on it.  To be honest, the real game felt short, and since Torchlight II is out (and reputed to be superior in every way), the only reason to play through this title is because the story is continued (although it's painfully simple) in T2.  Unless you're a hardcore fan of the genre, do NOT pay full price for this game.","June 7, 2014","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I suppose the easiest place to begin would be with the demo, which ultimately sucked me into buying my first-ever game on Steam and my last at full price, Was the price worth admission? Silly question really.\n\nThis game, while not as diverse as its sequel, perhaps holds up as a stronger effort. While I'm not entirely sure about that statement, I have finished the first and grown incredibly bored with the second, which is still a mighty fine game ya hear!\n\nThe concept of more is better is one I wrestle with constantly and, while I love a good story, do the Torchlight games actually benefit from convoluted yarns? I lean towards a negative answer on that front and would suggest that the first game's strength lies in the fact that its set up is so blindingly simple. Torchlight is a mining town and your job is to burrow down until you find the evil resposnible for all the "bad things" endangering the lives of the fine townsfolk above.\n\nWhat could go wrong? Very little really. The gameplay is astoundling tight, though, as you've probably read elsewhere it can become a little muddled when during large-scale fights. However, this is a piffling complaint considering how much can be going on at any one time with marginal slow down (system dependent!!). I put the bulk of my hours into the Mac version FYI. Sure, I game on PCs now, after a somehwta prolonged hiatus, but on an i5 MacBook Pro (2010ish) Torchlight stills gets along at a fair old clip.\n\nAnyway, where was I? Ah yes, the gameplay. To complain because the screen fills up with enemies, summoned minions and fireworks seems a little churlish to me. Torchlight has  diferent play styles on offer and if you happen to go the "mad necromancer" route (using prolonged duration skeleton mods) as I did, then you only have yourself to blame when the screen dissolves into carnage!\n\nI could go on about why I love this game, but what would that achieve? Artistically, it still holds up by today's standards. Gameplay-wise, it's a great ARPG, but... what else were you looking for? Nothing to see here move along!\n\nWhile I do plan to get to the end of Torchlight 2 someday, perhaps the lack of a focused experience is what has left me disinterested. Mild warning, here! I like playing games on my own, so Torchlight's solitary dungeon crawl will probably appeal to a solo gamer such as myself more.\n\nAnyhoo... 9/10 - minus a point for how hard it was to find matching sets, boooo! ;)","December 19, 2013","true","202.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A town atop an endless dungeon that’s randomly stitched together as you play. Hundreds of enemies that die in a torrent of clicks. Scrolls. Health and magic potions. Quests. Leveling. Loot. More loot.\n\nDiablo is the obvious comparison you could draw with this combat-heavy RPG, but Torchlight is more than a clone. This is like a super-clone with psychic powers. Choose a character. Choose a companion cat or a dog. Enjoy a quaint cutscene, and then wonder where your evening went.\n\nWith Torchlight 2 on the horizon, and Diablo 3 even further down the line- enjoy this game as your go-to clicky-looty-action-rpg. The game just recently went on sale already, but perhaps we can see some deals when T2 releases.","August 4, 2011","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are three classes you can choose from and it's up to you on how you want to build them.\n\nThe game itself is not that hard so I'd recommend maxing out your chosen difficulty for a bit of a challenge.\n\nStill waiting on Torchlight 2 for the newly remodeled classes and all of it's improvements.

It basically takes the structure of Diablo II and copies it exactly, while adding a few things, upgrading the graphics, and putting it underground. It's a good action RPG, as Diablo II was. From what I've seen, it's light on story, but pretty fun.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to finish Torchlight. That's probably because the game's single player only, and I only finished Diablo II because it was a lot more fun with friends. I think the lack of story probably contributed too, since I didn't have a motivating factor to push me through it.\n\nIf you really liked Diablo II, just buy it now. If not, you won't like this either. If you're on the fence, then I'd wait until Torchlight goes on sale. As far as $20 games go, it's not a bad choice, but I'd rather point you to Neverwinter Nights 2. NWN2 has slower, more complex gameplay but a far superior story. Or, if you can spend more, check out the Dragon Age games, which I find superior in both ways.","February 28, 2011","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
