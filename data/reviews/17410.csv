A fresh new adaptation of true and tried platforming. Rather than moving slowly and timing the jump from the edge. Speed is what counts here. You need to be moving at a constant speed to kick open doors, catch a drop wire etc. etc. Every thing is setup for constant nonstop movement. The level designs are so perfect; once you get hang of controls there is no need to stop. The game takes you through roof tops, A/C vents, malls, office walk ways and lots of other varied setups. At every stage there are multiple paths to move forward. There is a lot of freedom and it is tied well with risks.\n\nA critical thing to understand here is that the start-up period of the game is ROUGH. You are expected to be able to wall-jump, balance on thin rails, jump over chasms, and do other challenging things. The controls are going to be hard to get used to. Don't give up. It could be frustrating. Stick at it, and give yourself time to get used to those controls. Keep working through the initial levels. The reward is well worth it.\n\nOnce you become used to the controls, the game really becomes captivating. You're expected to race top speed through a variety of obstacle courses. You have to think on the fly, react instantly, and pay attention to clues. It draws your mind in to focus on the moment.\n\nYou can replay levels to try different paths, to try to get a better speed, and simply to have fun. So even if you "solve" a level in one way, there are reasons to go back and replay them multiple times.\n\nThis game has been agony and ecstasy for me, and when I beat it I felt exhilarated. If you are a high-energy gamer who has the patience to try and try again, you will find yourself rewarded. If not, you should know ahead of time that there's no cathartic blasting your way out of trouble in this game.","December 19, 2013","true","4.3"," 438 of 489 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","438","489","2","15"

A nice launching for this new saga that replaces the word 'brief' with the word 'intensity'.There's depth here that you'll only discover hours into time trialling a single stage and no other game in recent memory comes close to being as cool. I can't wait to see what Faith gets up to next. Console ports are usually a waste of time, but that's certainly not the case with Mirror's Edge. In fact, the PC version of the game offers even more than its console counterparts. Mirror’s Edge works like a charm with keyboard and mouse, too. Parkour above a shining beautiful city is a nice change of pace after normal shooters. Hopefully we get to see more games like this in the future.Mirrors Edge is an intense and intensely enjoyable experience from top to bottom that manages to capture a very interesting gameplay element and perfect it.","June 16, 2014","true","11.2"," 313 of 341 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","313","341","0","0"

I mainly played this offline.\n\nMirrors Edge is a first person parkour game with some shooting elements. All combined highlights Faith's (the main character) trip through this beautiful city. The small details in the graphics, such as motion blur and even the dust particles when you land after a massive jump make this experience feel real at times. Highly recommended for fans of parkour based gameplay with the occasional fast paced, reflex combat.\n\nAlso this is one of the very few first person games where you can acually see your feet as well as your arms.  Mirrors Edge is also a fantastic game because it still looks good even if you don't have a gaming PC to run it. Futhermore it doesn't take up that much space on your computer. (around 7 gigs or so)\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it is a bit too short (around 6 hours). Keep in mind this is pretty much the only downside to this game.\n\nVerdict\n9/10\n"Parkour + Amazing Graphics + A Little Bit Of Shooting = A Game Worth Your Money"","October 31, 2014","true","0.3"," 180 of 192 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","180","192","10","0"

The combination of visuals, graphics, artistic feel and look of the game is just astonishing. The first game to do parkour and freerunning any real justice, ME shows you what it's like to be that guy/or girl without having to leave your damn seat.  DICE really nailed it but while as an idea it seems to work great, in practice a parkour game would be quite lacking in terms of content. And that is the main issue with the game: not enough content. Yes, there are speedruns to keep you playing and compete against other players worldwide but that does not really add any realistic level of playtime to the game. Most people won’t even bother.\n\nIf DICE had more time to tinker with the game, other notable examples to get ideas from (absolutely none at the time) or maybe more resources to work with, we could have possibly seen a much bigger game with a larger player base (that’s not to say that it was an experimental game, not at all). That perhaps explains why ME was not a major financial success, but still the most loved underrated game of all time.\n\nEveryone wanted a sequel, even those that logged like no more than 10 minutes into the game thought it’s cool and deserves a sequel. We are getting the sequel and it looks very promising so far. In my opinion, all that DICE needs to do to make sure that ME2 is a huge financial success is add more content, keep the feel and look of the game and improve it further.\n\nDICE’s work has always been inspiring and Mirror’s Edge is no different. The addition of combat and the constant feeling of  “I have to keep running to evade the highly trained ninja monkey special forces that are after me for no apparent reason (IHKREHTNMSFAMNAR)“ adds a sense of danger and foreboding to the game. It’s parkour as it should be.\n\nParkour is cool and everyone knows it. If you haven’t yet played the game, you owe it to yourself to do so.\n\nJust don’t go and play it with the Oculus Rift, especially not if you’re afraid of heights.\n\nYou have been warned….","August 20, 2014","true","27.8"," 175 of 190 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","175","190","0","9"

Now I do wish to say more about this game, I played it years ago on my neighbors xbox 360 but now I am looking forward to Catalyst! It reminds me of hitman which is funny. So the point I wish to bring up now is about the settings, I have a GTX 980 Ti (Very high graphics card) But I had problems running this game, at certain points. This is entirely because of PhysX. There are two files which are in the game when you install here on Steam, and if you remove them then the problem is fixed, because this game came out half a decade ago, those files are outdated, and removing them will allow proper updated ones that you already should have to take their place, the files you need to find are called: PhysXCore.dll & PhysXDevice.dll. To find them go to Where Steam is on your computer, usually under program files x86, then steamapps, common, mirrors edge of course, then the first file maybe, called binaries, just find and delete those two I mentioned before hand and you should be completley done if you are up to date otherwise. Now this works as of now for me, maybe it will not in the future but I think it is worth doing this right now to try to help others.

Is it worth playing? Yes.\n\nFrom creators DICE (known for work on the Battlefield series and the 2015 Star Wars Battlefront), Mirror's Edge is a first-person platformer which involves parkour in all its glory, leaping across buildings, scaling walls, and traversing up factories. Parkour functions very smoothly, and the first-person view adds a layer of immersion which helps to sell the games atmosphere. Say what you want about the plot and characters (I found both to be good enough), this game's setting is a unique piece of art. Taking place sometime in the future in an unidentified utopian city controlled by a totalitarian government, Mirror's Edge conveys this by its very simplistic and pleasant art style: White everywhere, with bold colours such as brick red, lime green, or saphiere blue alongside. Cutscenses are also presented in a unqiue "drawing animation" (search up the first cutscene, I can't really explain it well), with a charm of their own. The soundtrack is also quite amazing, all the way from the main theme "Still Alive" to more atmospheric tracks used in the levels.\n\nAs for gameplay, this game is centered around parkour as I said before. Your moveset includes jumping (no duh), sliding, wall running, climbing, and clambering to name a few. The feeling of successfully pulling of multiple moves at a fast pace is incredibly rewarding, and the game is entirely hard to master. Difficultly (for parkour) progression is smooth throughout the entire game, and (at least for me) the game never felt cheap at any times. However, combat also is an important part of this game. In some sections enemy soldiers will attack you, and you'll have to use kicks and punches to either kill or unarm them, in order to use their weapons. Gunplay in this game is very basic (kind of surprising as this game comes from DICE), and only serves as a way to kill baddies faster. Weapons include SMG's, shotguns, and snipers, however you wont find yourself using them too often as the bulk of the game is parkour, and some sections with enemies do involve chases, which are awesome and tense.\n\nThat's pretty much this game! Sound a bit basic for you? Well, the main campaign/story mode is only 5 hours (it might take you shorter), and besides that there's a time trial mode, but that's pretty much the game. While a piece of art IMO, the game could have used a few more levels for the story mode, and perhaps a race mode for multiplayer, or at least something related to that. Gunplay/combat could also be expanded, and the parkour moveset could always be refined and expanded upon. Overall, it's an awesome concept and an original idea for a game, and I would give it a 7.5/10. For $19.99 it's a good price if you are absolutely sold on this game, but either than that I would either be cautious or wait for a price drop due to the lack of much content.\n\nAlso, Mirror's Edge 2 for 2016!","January 3, 2015","true","5.3"," 88 of 97 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","88","97","9","2"

The first playthrough will always be rough, but this game has excellent replayability.  The theme of this game is that you are evading/rebelling against the government while trying to carry out tasks for an organization. The thing I disliked most about this game was the forced combat against heavily armored police. Some areas of the game can be very frustrating and may take multiple attempts to complete, but the feeling of accomplishment afterwards is present. This game takes a whole new approach on gaming. With very fast paced gameplay that sends you soaring through the skies across rooftops and construction sites. It really makes you feel like a badass ninja.

I still love it as I loved it after my first playthrough. Even with all its flaws, Mirror's Edge has some amazing moments, like Faith, her character overall. Music made by Solar Fields. Soundtrack is simply beautiful and one of the best I've heard in video games.\nEven after all those years game looks pretty good, especially city itself. Design is pretty original, sterile, trying to show "the perfect society" Kruger wants to create after The November Riots.\nStory... story is a little bit short, but blame EA for cutting like 60% of it without the writers knowledge, but even so... story about Faith and her sister, Kate, caught my heart. This isn't about saving the city or the world, no. It's just about Faith and her sister and this is why I loved it.\n\nAnyway, give it a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/17410/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nMirror's Edge is a first person Parkour game developed by DICE in 2009. I don't know if this is “the first Parkour game ever developed”, but it is the first I've ever played, and I suspect it can earn its place as one of the first and one of the good ones.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You play as the Protagonist named “Faith”... I see what you did there DICE, touché. Faith is part of a rebel group that has risen up against the oppressive ruling government which monitors all communication within this city,  sound familiar? Hmmm...\nFaith is a “runner”, runners are individuals who act as couriers that carries messages around the city. Runners see the world in a different way; where one person might see a dead end, a runner see's opportunities to climb, jump, and vault to get to their objective.\n\nGameplay: Mirror's Edge has one extremely strong selling point: First person Parkour. Have you ever wanted to jump off a building and not break your kneecaps? Have you ever wanted to travel a zip line from a skyscaper? Mirror's Edge is for you!\nThere are various types of obstacles that you'll face throughout the game, the game teaches you how to deal with each one by going through a “training” session before you start the game. This training is skip-able but I suggest you get through it... but I'll be honest, I probably spent more time on the training then the first level. I could not master the “turn-around-wall-jump”, every time I missed the game would force-ably restart my attempt.\n\nAchievements: At this time there are no steam achievements for Mirror's Edge, however on the Xbox there are 50 Achievements, so it's possible sometime in the future Mirror's Edge might have achievements, but at this time (08/03/15) there are no achievements.\nThere might not be achievements for Mirror's Edge, but there are time trials that you can complete against your friends on, unfortunately they're not sync-ed with steam leaderboards, so you would need to add your friends in game via Origin account.\n\nPrice: Mirror's Edge is priced at $19.99, I completed this game on Normal difficulty in 7 hours. I want my games to go an hour for every dollar spent... If you go by that standard you should wait for this game to go on sale.\nHowever if you have the money, this is an excellent Parkour game that you definitely should give a try at some point, regardless of cost.\n\nConclusion: To recap... Story: Okay, Gameplay: Excellent + Parkour, Achievements: Not available at this time, Price: a bit high.\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes jumping puzzles in first or third person video games. You can fight your way through the game (that's what I did) however it's not designed to cater to the fighting crowd (but it's so fun to punch out one guy, grab his gun and rata-tata-tata!), the game is designed to be like a Parkour or Free running simulator. And many times feels quite realistic on what you can and cannot survive... well almost, I did some pretty messed up stunts.","August 8, 2015","true","7.8"," 61 of 66 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","61","66","10","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/recommended/17410/","7grain","7grain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/","291 products in account","Mirror's Edge is a unique and wonderful experience. There are some rough edges, but it's a beautiful and memorable game.\n\nThe closest gameplay comparison I can make is Portal. If you enjoyed the challenges in Portal 2, you will likely enjoy Mirror's Edge, too. The puzzles of both these games are about figuring out how to master a complex open 3D arena through trial and error, and the sense of fulfillment when you figure out the solutions in both games is similar.\n\nMirror's Edge is set in a beautiful near-future city, with abstract gleaming white towers and stunning vistas. Outside, you engage in parkour-style running, navigating high ledges and leaping from tower to tower, in a fluid manner. It’s similar to the more familiar Assassin's Creed games, but faster. Indoor sequences are more puzzley, usually about getting from Point A to Point B efficiently. The free running is exhilarating, both outdoors and indoors. Missing a jump by a faction of an inch and falling to your death will make your fingers tingle as you catch your breath! And there was a memorable close encounter with a subway train that made me jump out of my seat from the adrenaline surge.\n\nUnfortunately, Mirror's Edge also features awkward combat sequences. The early training missions teach complicated combo moves for executing martial arts maneuvers. For example: blocking a punch while taking a weapon off an enemy. Honestly, these moves were way too complicated for me to execute confidently, but I quickly learned one easy combo that served me well in every situation: the slide-tackle. Turns out that if you take people out at the knees, everything else goes pretty smoothly!\n\nThese combat events are generally unwelcome in an otherwise excellent game. Disabling a cop as you round a corner, then dash away? That's fun. Disabling a cop, taking his weapon, and then having a shootout with his partners for 5 minutes, moving from cover to cover? This does not match the overall theme of the game, and it's a distraction. Fortunately, these combat events are few and far between, and not difficult enough to frustrate you, or dissuade you from completing the game. Think of them as a different kind of puzzle.\n\nLast word: The trailer that Steam offers in the Store page is a poor choice. It features the cartoony animation from some of the between-levels cutscenes.  The actual gameplay is more like this trailer:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N1TJP1cxmo\n\nDefinitely consider Mirror's Edge; it's fine entertainment.","August 18, 2013","true",""," 61 of 69 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","61","69","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/17410/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Mirror’s Edge consistently feels like the point of impact for two diverging strains of game design.\n\nThere is, first, the game Mirror’s Edge would propose itself to be, a first-person parkour escapade through a city overrun by corporate interest. It’s a crunchy, mechanics focused affair sold on the adrenaline rush that is leaping off a rooftop and hitting the ground in an effortlessly smooth, lifesaving roll. Where games such as Assassin’s Creed and Prince of Persia employ parkour as a flashy means to a navigational end, Mirror’s Edge obsesses over the act of putting one foot in front of the other; a roll here, a leap there, each action a purposeful and considered exertion meant to carry you forward as fast as possible with as little surface friction as can be managed.\n\nThe precision Mirror’s Edge demands of you in controlling your character’s body is at once overwhelming and exhilarating. I routinely felt as if the game demanded more of me than its simple over/under controls allowed for, but then I would flawlessly string together a series of moves and everything would snap into place. There is a delicate balance struck between contextual automation and player driven navigation in how you traverse the industrial playgrounds that make up Mirror’s Edge’s levels, and more often than not the choice to keep the actual controls simple pays off and helps make for a game that feels both smooth and tactile.\n\nProblems arise though when Mirror’s Edge’s level designs fail to match the intuitive nature of its controls. There is a distinct visual vocabulary at work in Mirror’s Edge that seeks to clue you in on what can and can’t be climbed, jumped, and run on, familiar objects and situations giving way to habitual movements that streamline the planning phase and keep you moving. But despite what attempts Mirror’s Edge makes to help teach you how to read levels, by and large they remain entirely opaque. I might recognize a piece of geometry, but rarely did that translate into me knowing how to actually use it to move forward, and again and again I would find myself having to slow down and deconstruct a level before I could move forward.\n\nThis stop-and-go workaround is certainly functional, but it goes entirely against the way Mirror’s Edge seems designed to be, and how it wants you to play. For a game built with speed and flow as top priorities, Mirror’s Edge does a poor job ensuring you ever make it through a level without needing to first memorize its layout and the sequence of moves needed to successfully navigate it. It’s not impossible to get good at Mirror’s Edge and capitalize on its promises, but doing so requires such an investment of time and energy spent beating yourself against its inscrutable exterior, that it hardly feels worth it. I never expected to reach speedrun level proficiency without putting in the effort, but Mirror’s Edge fails to accommodate for players who fall anywhere outside the hyper dedicated and skilled, without feeling as if that exclusion is an intentional choice. I don’t believe developer DICE wanted Mirror’s Edge to be as hard and frustrating as it ultimately became, but perhaps that is just what happens to games that move as fast and are as demanding as this.\n\nBut I feel as if most of Mirror’s Edge’s failings are less the result of design oversights than they are the splintering of priorities. I said earlier that Mirror’s Edge feels like two strains of game design, and that second side comes into play in all the ways Mirror’s Edge either fails to flesh out the parts one would believe to be most important, or the things it chooses to include for no discernible reason. The much maligned combat is likely the biggest offender in this regard. You are rarely forced to engage with enemies, but not doing can often make the game more challenging than it is worth. Often I ran into situations where I would die dozens of times without making it through, only to reluctantly pick up a gun and be out in a matter of moments.\n\nThe reason combat is so annoying then is the same reason much of the game becomes a frustrating slog the further you progress: it keeps slowing you down. There is also the added fact that combat, while technically functional, is horrifically clunky and unsatisfying, with kicks and punches being by far the least controlled actions you perform in the game, and the gunplay feeling loose and awkward (which is especially strange given DICE’s shooter roots). It all feels like a last second inclusion, as if someone high up at EA saw the game running and became worried that no one would buy a game without combat. One can only speculate as to the various hierarchies at play in Mirror’s Edge’s development, but that doesn’t change how wholly alien the combat feels to the rest of the game, and its inclusion means that at some point development time was being allocated to it over the rest of the game (the end result being the game we received).\n\nThat isn’t to say that if DICE had opted-out of combat they would have been able to fix all of Mirror’s Edge’s problems, but when so much of the game feels rushed it seems hard to imagine that time couldn’t have been better spent elsewhere. The campaign itself is brief even by shooter standards at anywhere from 4-6 hours, and is made to feel more insubstantial due to being married to a narrative that is structurally akin to a show billed for 24 episodes that got cut down to 12. There is a framework here setting up a fascinating near future, where the control of information is paramount, and the only way to get messages relayed outside the government’s prying eyes is to use runners who carry them by hand. Our lead, Faith, is a quintessential sentimental rebel, enacting what eventually becomes an outright war between the city higher-ups and the runners in order to rescue her sister after being framed for a crime.\n\nThere is a lot to work with in Mirror’s Edge’s setting and premise, but events are strung together with so little continuity and character development that the result is something of a mess. Much of Mirror’s Edge’s plot seems to hint at a history that is never explained, with character relationships never getting much attention even as they switch sides at the drop of a hat without any legitimate justification. Eventually things boil down to a blur of small-scale politics with big ramifications, plot holes that make for easy conclusions, and an overarching storyline that by the end seems to have gone nowhere despite everything that unfolds. I am a sucker for Marxist dystopia and would have loved to learn more about Faith’s world and how she fits into it. It is incredibly rare we get a female lead in games, which makes it perhaps more frustrating than it would otherwise be that Mirror’s Edge does nothing much to develop Faith as a person. I appreciate her being here and DICE avoiding most of the pitfalls that developers fall into in creating female characters, but that only serves to illustrate just how dire things are in games even so many years after Mirror’s Edge’s release, that even being a lousy character in her own right Faith still constitutes one of the better leading ladies in a major release.\n\nMirror’s Edge is an experience that few games have come anywhere near replicating. Its blend of high-contrast visuals and a visceral sense of movement and impact can be incredibly exhilarating once you learn how to make use of what you’re given. However compelling a concept Mirror’s Edge might be though, its execution is so flawed as to make playing it often far less enjoyable than the idea of doing so. With a sequel on the horizon it will be interesting to see if DICE learned anything from Mirror’s Edge relative failure, but until then it exists more as a curiosity than a classic.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 6","true","4.7"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","40","42","5","0"

This is the sort of game that can be played ten years from now and it will still play great and look great. It's one of those timeless games.\n\nPositives:\nSimple and refined gameplay, check. The free running is so very enjoyable. The sense of speed as you rush across rooftops is exhilirating. For someone like me who loves the thrill of heights, it puts a grin on my face. (You'll probably want to raise the game's FOV, it's pretty easy, look it up.)\nI want to live in that city. Maybe without the dystopia but, it looks so nice. The art direction in the game is gorgeous. Indoors also. I want to work in those offices. I would desk jockey the ♥♥♥♥ out of those office environments.\nYou can take a screenshot at any time and hang it on your wall. My F12 key is wearing out.\nI liked the world they created. The runner culture. The story keeps it simple, with just enough to provide you with incentive. Character designs are great too, from Faith to the runners and villains. Check out the unlockable art in the main menu.\nI was sad to hear Rhianna Pratchett wasn't invited to write Mirror's Edge 2 because  I liked her take on this. A girl on the wrong side of the law who's doing everything to save her her sister, the framed cop. Interesting backstory to the city and the characters. I'd love an animated series with the same setting and aesthetics.\n\nThe negatives:\nCombat is definitely the weak point of the game. Most of the time it's frustrating. Lots of people wish it didn't have combat at all. I think they could have made it work. You can disarm most enemies via quicktime events that suck, even if you use the slowmo button.\nFor a game about free running, it's pretty damn linear. I've seen corridor shooters that offered more varied paths. At least I played it without "runner vision" which literally paints your path in red.\nI didn't mind these but it seems a lot of people did: the cutscene cartoons are not as well made as the rest of the game. Not a big deal for me.\nMirror's Edge 2 is supposed to address these issues, if it ever releases. DICE are a hostage to developing Battlefield after Battlefield, sadly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gargoote/recommended/17410/","gargoote","Gargoote","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gargoote/","85 products in account","English Version:\nI don't know how to define this game. A First-person action where your main purpose is to run. That's right, run! One of this game's strenghts is, among all and in my opinion, its freshness! But let's talk more in details about the game...\n\nThe plot is based on a city (which apparently hasn't got a name) where information is constantly controlled and supervised (reminded me of "1984", for those who know the book!). This kind of society brought to the birth of the so-called "runners", who are rebels who do stunts taking advantage of the environment between buildings, pipes and platforms; are deliver information even at the cost of their lives. Our protagonist is the runner Faith Connor. The story begins when Faith's sister, Kate, is trapped and subsequently indicted for the murder of a politician. This will push Faith, to break the boundary of the city in which the rebels are ''crossing in the mirror's edge'' (reference needed). From here we will investigate to try to exonerate her sister.\n\nThe gameplay is very hectic, which makes everything much more exciting and unfortunately short-lived given that, I finished it in a few hours. First of all I'd advice EVERYONE, even the expert players, to complete the tutorial in order to understand the game mechanics, because as I said it's a different game compared to the others! However a lot of It is about observing the landscape in order to notice any path you can take to move forward (it isn't always easy to identify them, even though they are highlighted in red, especially if you are running). In case there are policemen nearby, you can use the attack to beat 'em up, to steal their guns and to quickly shoot the rest of 'em (we still available a few bullets, also if we had taken the charge weapon). Still you'd better avoid all of that, 'cause it slows down the run and makes you more vulnerable (if they shoot you even just three or four times you can easly die).\n\nThe characters are poorly characterized, little is told about Faith. The graphics are very pretty and fits in the context in my opinion!\n\nIn conclusion I think it's a game that everyone should try. After that you can like It or dislike It, but as It's a different kind of game-experience that still allows the player having fun!\n\nItalian Version:\nNon so bene come definirlo questo gioco. Un gioco d'azione, in prima persona, dove lo scopo principale è di correre. Esatto, correre! Uno dei punti di forza di questo gioco è proprio questo, a parer mio, la novità! Ma parliamo più nello specifico del gioco..\n\nLa trama parla di una città (senza un apparente nome) dove le informazioni sono costantemente controllate e vigilate (mi ha ricordato molto 1984, per chi conoscesse il libro!). A questa legge si ribellano i cosiddetti ''runners'', ragazzi che correndo e facendo acrobazione tra palazzi, tubi e pedane trasportano informazioni anche a costo della loro vita. La nostra protagonista è la runner Faith Connor. La storia inizia quando la sorella di Faith, Kate, viene incastrata e successivamente incriminata per un omicidio di un politico. Questo spingerà Faith, ad infrangere il confine della città a cui tanto si ribella ''varcando il bordo dello specchio'' (citazione necessaria) in inglese appunto Mirror's Edge. Da qui la vedremo indagare per cercare di scagionare la sorella.\n\nIl gameplay è molto frenetico, il che rende tutto molto più eccitante e purtroppo poco longevo dato che, almeno io, l'ho finito in poche ore. Inizialmente consiglio a TUTTI, anche ai più esperti, di fare il tutorial, per capire bene le meccaniche di gioco, perché come ho già detto è un gioco diverso dagli altri! Comunque il tutto sta nell'osservare bene il paesaggio per notare eventuali percorsi da poter fare per andare avanti (non è sempre facile individuarli, nonostante siano evidenziati in rosso, specie se si sta correndo). Nel caso ci siano poliziotti vicini, inoltre, è possibile usare l'attacco riavvicinato sia per stenderli sia per rubare la pistola e far fuori velocemente il resto della polizia (abbiamo comunque disponibili pochi proiettili, anche l'avessimo presa carica l'arma). L'arma comunque è meglio evitarla, dato che rallenta la corsa e ci rende più vulnerabili (non abbiamo molta vita, se ci sparano anche 3-4 colpi in pochi secondi siamo morti).\n\nI personaggi sono poco caratterizzati, viene dopo poco anche di Faith. La grafica è molto carina ed adatta al contesto a parer mio!\n\nConcludendo secondo me è un gioco che tutti dovrebbero provare, poi può piacere e non piacere, ma è un gioco diverso che comunque può divertire, quindi lo consiglio!","April 11, 2014","true","8.7"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

Unlike other DICE games, Mirror's Edge wasn't using the Frostbite engine, instead they went with Unreal Engine 3.\n\nThere is no game like it. The parkour is simply amazing here. There is no run button in this game - instead your character simply builds up speed as she runs. To complete an obstacle, you have to do it all in an instant, without stopping. It's not really about planning or puzzles, but more about instinct. You really have to give it to the level design in this game. Without right level design none of it would really feel right. All of that really make it feel very natural and epic. DICE really managed to combine cinematic feel (and i don't mean 30 fps) and gameplay together. I wouldn't mind for a open world though.\n\nThere is also a bit of FPS in this game. You can never hold on to a gun or reload it. You have  to attack the enemy to get the gun, but it's easier said than done though. The game wants you to be tactical, even if you attack an enemy that only had a pistol, he will still gun you down if you just run out in the open to him like that. You have to use cover, pick the ones that are separated from the rest etc.\n\nThe gameplay component of the game, whether it's parkour or shootouts, is simply amazing.\n\nThe game also has nice use of aesthetics. They use primary colors mixed with white for the most part. It's so simplistic, yet so gorgeous. Musical department wasn't lacking either. Main theme by Lisa Miskovsky is superb.\n\nUnfortunately this game suffers from one big problem - the length. It will take you about 4 hrs to complete it. I guess EA thought of it as an experiment project?\n\nAdditionally, there are also those terrible cutscenes in between the levels. Clearly shows the limited budget EA has given.\n\nUsually i dismiss these 4 hrs long games. Most of them offer no originality and are overpriced. But due to unique nature of Mirror's Edge i will have to recommend it. There is really no game like it.","September 28, 2014","true","5.6"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","24","26","3","0"

The gameplay is awesome: you run from rooftop to rooftop, you climb stuff, you make dangerous jumps while the police chases you, etc. but sometimes the flow of the game is completely broken by mandatory gunfights (which are thankfully few and far between).\n\nThat said, Mirror's Edge is everything good that can come out of a big studio & publisher. I'm repeating myself, but the design of the city is just THAT good. The character design is pretty good; and hey! For once, we finally have an AAA game where a woman is the lead character!

You can chain up your own moves by building up momentum using the environment around you giving a devastating blow to your enemies, this I didnt expect in a game and that too in an FPS!!. The speed run challenges are quite challenging no matter how many times you try there are multiple ways to do it and the most obvious path isnt always the right path... It also features a leaderboard where you can compete your stats with your friends but to do that you need to sign in via origin, the game and your friends should do the same for comparing stats, which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and confusing for some. The soundtracks are awesome! for me its #1 in video games its always relaxing seamlessly free running here and there whilst listening to them, I would listen to it whenever I'am depressed.\n\nYeah its that good and only people who are fond of FPS love it a lot but for others it might be difficult to play or uninteresting.\n\nCan't wait for Mirror's Edge 2!!\n\n9/10","April 4, 2015","true","14.2"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","23","27","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menycet/recommended/17410/","Menycet","Menycet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menycet/","246 products in account","Mirror’s Edge is a game in its own league because there aren’t many – if any – like it. The gameplay consists of running, jumping, sliding, kicking, etc. You’re in (almost) constant motion. The learning curve is steep and you’re required to have a lot of patience. You might not even get full enjoyment out of it if you’ve just played through the game once, unless you get the hang of it straight away. Now, at first I thought that the game’s just unfair and unnecessarily difficult... until I stopped making things too complicated for myself.  Unfortunately, that happened about an hour and a half before the end of the main campaign. I expected all the routes to be very linear and complicated but the truth is that there are many ways to get from one place to another. I just had to open my eyes, learn how to notice things and think simply.\n\nPros:\n•	The game is at its best during chase sequences and, fortunately, there’s a lot of them. You can actually feel the thrill of being chased while you’re running away from enemies.\n•	The graphics are gorgeous and the visual style is quite fascinating. I saw some wonderful greens, oranges and blues. A real sight for sore eyes.\n•	You can run through timed race tracks that are fun to complete. A good way to hone your skills.\n•	Running feels very smooth once you get a hang of the controls.\n•	There are some really exciting moments, like running towards a fast approaching train.\n•	The soundtrack is really cool and fits the world and atmosphere perfectly.\n•	Standing on the edge of tall buildings gives vertigo.\n\nCons:\n•	Early on in the game the routes might seem confusing or not obvious. Often it’s not clear where you’re supposed to go, the indicators are misleading and so on. What I learned is that the routes that make you think, "There’s no way in hell I’m supposed to go that way", turn out to be the right ones.\n•	The game’s very bright, so it may be straining on people with sensitive eyes. The brightness can always be turned down but I found that this makes the game lose some of its visual appeal.\n•	Reloading autosaves may place you slightly ahead of where you just were and that might create some confusion.\n•	The main campaign is short. I believe it can be completed in under 5-6 hours.\n•	Trying to grab onto ledges and jump off things can sometimes be very frustrating to the point of ragequitting.\n•	If you’re afraid of heights like I am, then the possibility of falling to your death from tall buildings might create some actual anxiety (or it may be exciting, in which case this point belongs with the pros, not the cons). I must admit that I felt a bit anxious because, whenever you fall, you watch Faith fall until she hits the ground.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say that I recommend Mirror's Edge to people who: a) want to play something completely different because this game truly is like no other, b) are looking for a thrill and c) aren't put off by minor gameplay related annoyances.","February 6, 2014","true","8.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","2"

Unless you are broke, BUY IT.\n\nFull Review:\n\nLet's start out with what I expected after watching the trailers and pictures:\nParkour\nPretty maps\nHand to hand and combat\nI got my parkour, pretty maps, and hand to hand combat. I also got a short story and very simple but annoying and unforgiving controls.\n\nOh the controls... Given that one of the very important parts of this game is parkour, you would think it would be the most fleshed out and well done part of the game right? Wrong, unless you are on point with your movement every time, the game will punish you with the same old falling animation. Fighting or running away from enemies is a whole other deal. The game has a very simple movement base which can be fun when you fight enemies. Sometimes enemies get weird advantages and knock you down/do a lot of damage that nearly kills you; Some enemies are not meant to be fought so when you do fight them, you know why they are able to nearly instantly kill you. Even though one of the core elements of the game was designed poorly it won’t dock it points for this. Mirror's Edge came out in 2008 and I am willing to bet that not much was done to study how good its combat/movement system was since back then not many games could be used to compare it and see what it lacked/boasted.\n\nThe art and modeling is so good. Without a doubt in my mind this game has absolutely beautiful looking maps, just visually at least, and even better looking models for props in the game. The maps however don’t feel like they were meant to be used for parkour. With all the clutter everywhere(yes clutter, even though it looks very clean), it is hard to really enjoy the game. I think the mappers did a lazy job of planning the maps which ended up making most maps feel slow, unintuitive, and clunky. A little bit more effort in the development of player movement through the maps would have gone a long way. On Top of all this the maps are relatively small making it very apparent they are linear. But like I said in my previous paragraph this game was made without much to go off of so this feels more like it was an experiment that went pretty well rather than a real game franchise.\n\nThe sounds/music are just ounces of amazing. This game had extremely good and worked out tracks for different times during each map. The attention in detail to the sound as well as the physical location of the player made this special and memorable. I really is a shame that thanks to its initial unpopularity more people didn’t try this out and get to hear the games music. The sounds for the player and VA for the characters are on point and very good. You can tell what you are doing pretty easily by the sound and it doesn’t get in the way or rip out of the immersion. Certainly no argument here at all.\n\nThe story in this game was interesting and relevant, but that doesn't really matter as those two descriptions are assigned subjectively. The story is short and lacks implementation. Yes implementation, I don’t mind cut scenes but you could literally play the entire game without ever knowing about the story. It is that loosely attached! Not like it matters since the story itself leaves a few things unanswered but not on purpose. It becomes extremely forced once you get into the later levels. Overall the story is a good idea and concept but it was poorly created and implemented making it feel cheap or unappreciated. This does to me count as a tick against them because it isn’t much effort for a game studio to make a decent story, and Mirror’s Edge story is not even close to being passable.\n\nOverall the game is 7.9/10 Not really mediocre just small and unpolished. The ideas behind it are great and a lot of what carries this game is actually the visuals, music, and maybe sometimes the movement. It’s certainly not a triple-a game, at least it wasn’t on its release, expecting a triple-a game is silly. If someone asked me if Mirror’s Edge is a good game for them to buy, I would ask them if what they were looking for was something quick to pick up or a new thing they can invest a few hours in. If you seek a quick game you don’t really want to get into then don’t bother getting this. But if you want something new and interesting you can really sink your teeth into then Mirror's Edge is the game for you.\n\nExtra:\nOne of the things I liked the most about this game besides the art, music and gameplay is the fact that this was never even a triple-a game yet it felt like the game had been given access to the kind of resources a triple-a game gets when being developed. It wasn’t pandering and it had its own style instead of a bland mundane repetitive feeling you get from modern triple-a’s but with the quality of one. That’s what made is special to me. I LOVE THIS GAME!!! (hopefully its newfound popularity and hype won’t bog it's prequal(Mirror's Edge: Catalyst) down into another triple-a let down).","September 29, 2015","true","53.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/17410/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","We step into the running shoes of Faith, a runner in this fast paced, acrobatic game, which is one of a kind. There aren't many games that combine the action adventure platforming with the first-person genre. The concept is well executed, too bad the game falls short in other areas.\n\nIn the unknown dystopian city, where crime virtually doesn't exists the Runners are the only ones that disturb the peace achieved by the totalitarian regime. It's a small group of anti-government individuals who can do one thing very well: run... and climb pipes and do acrobatic jumps, but that's (and committing crimes) part of the life style. Our protagonist is one of them, whose sister (a cop on top of that) is caught in political crossfire and arrested for the murder of the mayor candidate. From now on it's on Faith to discover the secrets that lie below the surface.\n\nUnfortunately there are no hearth stopping, breath taking moments in the story. It's pretty plain and simple, nothing we haven't seen somewhere else (1984 - Orwell). Likewise the length and scope of the game doesn't allow the story to get to deeper levels. The game can be finished in a mere 4-5 hours. On the other hand the cartoony cut-scenes are a nice touch and the characters are believable thanks to the great voice acting.\n\nMirror's Edge consists of 9 chapters. In every chapter you have to get from point A to point B to complete an objective. It doesn't get any deeper than that, but at least the time spent between the start and finish is fun. The controls are reactive and you can take alternate routes to get an advantage over the riot police or just to be quicker and more efficient. In almost every level there is at least 1 point where you'll find yourself dying in 10-15 seconds after the checkpoint loads. Over and over again until you find the correct route or you can execute your jumps perfectly. These parts are pains, but the most frustrating thing in the gameplay are the gunfights. It's simply not meant to be there. Disarming guards and policemen, then shooting others feels off balanced, weak, and frustrating over all.\n\nFaith's story has its flaws, but the game is at its best when you have to do what it's created for: platforming, wall running, jumping from pipe to pipe, rolling, sliding and so on. When you learn the levels and you become more proficient in spotting out the best routes it feels like you are a panther capable of anything. Unfortunately if you aren't in for the challenge of finding the best routes in each map there is not much else the in the game that could keep it installed on your computer for a long time. After finishing the story mode you can jump in and do some time trials, but as I said there isn't anything else beside that (if you don't count the bags which can be found in the story mode - 30 in total).\n\nRating: 68/100; Replay Value: 2/5; To Beat: 5 hours; Played on: normal.","August 20, 2013","true","6.9"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/recommended/17410/","MaraKalat","Mara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/","1228 products in account","A solid concept lacking polish breaks down into tedium and frustration\nThere is something to this game that really speaks to people, the free-running first person parkour, when it works, is absolutely amazing.\nUnfortunately, there's a whole lot of stuff getting in the way of your fun.\n\nIt's not the plot, the plot is perfectly serviceable. Sure, it starts with your sister being framed for a murder and returns to that big bag of clichés for every new twist and development, but it wasn't bad and the little animated cutscenes did their job (...of masking loading screens, but they're neat too).\n\nNo, what breaks this game is the lack of polish that was applied to it. The finishing touches. There are many small gripes to be had here (lack of non-hostile characters within levels, level design not making sense from a functional perspective, big bulkhead doors that take half a minute to open, no subtitles for ambient speech like overheard conversations and announcements, shoddy and partially missing directions) but the two main ones are:\n\nBad checkpoints:\nIn a game that is ALL about flow, making your way through complex environments and a certain amount of trial and error in how to approach things it is absolutely critical that messing up does not frustrate too much. The checkpoints as they are now are far too few and far between to accomplish this, and some of them are spaced very weirdly.\nThere's a segment where you're climbing out of a large vertical shaft (it's in the Store page screenshots as well) and one of the checkpoints is right before a valve you need to turn to shut off a stream of water directly behind it. After that comes some tricky platforming, and I had to do that section several times. The problem here is that the game does not remember that you turned off the water, so you're stuck watching Faith perform the same ~8 second animation of turning off the water every single time, on top of the loading screen and unskippable bit where you're falling to your death that is far, far too much time to spend waiting and redoing things. This is only one of many places where I felt the game was far too sparing with the checkpoints, and to add insult to injury the in-chapter progress isn't even saved when you quit the game. You always start back at the beginning of the chapter.\nThe enemies:\nIn Faith's world the worst thing anybody can do is run across rooftops, it is immediate reason to send armed SWAT teams and attack helicopters after them. They shoot first, then shoot some more, and maybe ask questions later but that's not in the game. The justification for that is that you're supposedly carrying top-secret information and messages without the government surveillance catching it... except you don't do that in the game even once.\nYou're able to disarm these enemies when you get close or punch them out, and then pick up their guns and use them but I didn't bother with that and the game very much feels like it doesn't want you to (there's even an achievement for it... you know, on consoles. Because Steam integration is too much to ask from EA).\nRegardless of whether you choose to engage or avoid these soldiers (they're hardly police forces any more) they will be in your way. Shooting for you as you duck and weave trying to make it to the next too-far-away checkpoint. I get why they're there, they are adding tension to the game.\nOr parts of the game anyway, their appearance and disappearance is very jarring. Open up an inconspicuous door that is marked as your next target to find a dozen soldiers just lazing around a parking lot in case a Runner (that's you, because you run) decides to come through there. Run your way past them into the elevator, go up a floor (or however many floors, the insides aren't marked with a number) and you're completely in the clear again. The game seems divided into platforming segments and engagement segments, and the transitions are almost always immersion breaking.\nIn the late game the attempts at adding challenge become almost laughably silly, with every door you walk past popping open, revealing a tiny dark room with no other exits and one to three fully armed enemies that were sure you'd be coming this way. Add to that the new agile enemies, which should make the game more interesting since they can follow you around, but who end up doing pretty much the same thing anyway (and are as easily befuddled by you running through a door).\nFor DICE, a studio that was at that point best known for its Battlefield series, this was a huge and impressive step towards something more creative. A first person game built around avoiding fights, with a kick-♥♥♥ female protagonist.\nFor Electronic Arts, a publisher known at that point for buying up smaller development studios and turning them into faceless drones that will never make another fun game in their life this was a great moment to show the world they could do something special, something different. Unfortunately, they did not.\n\nWith an extra 6 months of development and a whole lot more play-testing and polishing this could have been an absolute gem and must-play.\nAs it stands it is a 5-hour eulogy for what could have been.\nDo not get this game, and be careful with the upcoming sequel, it might have similar problems.","May 19, 2015","false","4.5"," 39 of 61 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","39","61","4","10"

I mean, in those situations "rabbit hunting simulator" would be a better fitting title for the game, with the player being the scared wabbit.\n\nStory is there, it's alright I guess, voice acting and music are good, it's all AAA quality I'd say, no need to go into details, you're here to run, dammit!\n\nEnding song made a lot of nerdy boys and grils cry, I didn't like it very much, but maybe check out the Benassi remix, I don't know...\n\nAnywho, it's a game that can make you hate yourself, and the world, but it's worth a playthrough.

I'll glady recommend it to anyone looking for a new, visually spectacular, experience. I keep telling my friends this is one of the few games that they should've played at least once in their life. Unfortunately, no one ever listens. I don't mind though, because let's face it - it's their loss. And while there's definitely room for improvement, what's there is already very solid and lays the groundwork for a possible sequel, minus the story.\n\nAbout the story: Mirror's Edge puts you in the shoes of Faith, who has to clear the name of her sister after being wrongfully accused of murdering someone. Doesn't sound all that exciting ? Well, I might agree with you there. However, it's the way the game is played that makes it fresh and interesting. You see, the game is played from a first person perspective. But instead of shooting your way out (which is optional, but not recommended, for maximum enjoyment) you'll be running. Parkour style. In other words: free running.\nYou'll be running through offices, on rooftops and many other places in order to get to where you want to go, all the while fighting off the police. This is all shown in one of the most beautifully realized environments I've ever laid eyes on (those office interiors ! *drool*). It's truly stunning.\n\nLike I mentioned before, the game does have some flaws. First of all, it's short. Many people will complete it in a hour or 4-5. Not terribly long, but not terribly short also. It keeps the experience fun. I personally would've liked it if it was at least twice as long, but it's nothing a sequel can't fix. Besides, the time trials will keep you occupied for days, maybe even weeks. One other thing that can definitely be improved for a possible sequel is the number of routes you can take to get to your destination. Mirror's Edge gives you the illusion of an open world, but in fact there's only one way to get to your objective. Agreed, this way it keeps you focused on the story, but it certainly would've been nice.\n\nNot much else I can say, really. This game is the reason why I play games. Play it yourself, and you just might agree with me. Maybe not today, but one day, I'm sure of it.\n\n[Rating: 92/100)","May 21, 2013","true","16.6"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","7"

Do you like the colour white ? Do you like tattoos ? Do you like cartoons ? Do you like the sound of broken bones? If you like these key elemets , you will need to get the game :)\nJoke aside , this is one of the games you must play at least once in your life time ...\nThe story , well to be honest it's pretty OK , the problem here is the writers , they presented it in a pretty mediocre way , and most of the story is told in the cutscenes which are cartoons (which ain't that much of a problem , at least for me). The story goes like this , your a Runner , which bassicly is a parkour ninja courier , one day your Lucy Liu look-alike sister gets in trouble and you need to help her. I was saying earlier that the writing is pretty bad , a good example of this is the few dramatic moments of the game , which could have been dramatic with some charcter development , which is almost inexistent . Tho this is a action-puzzle game , just like an action movie you won't expect some top grade story , you will expect some action !\nWhich is exactly where the game shines , in the gameplay, It's a very fresh experience , you  parkour your way out of level to level , sometimes you shoot your way out , with a suprisingly varied and realistic arsenal or by punching or kicking . It's pretty linear and the puzzles aren't that complicated , but that ain't that much of a problem, A suprisng thing is that even the gameplay is pretty linear , it's not repetitive at all. The replayability is there also , after you finished the game , you can play it again and try to speed run it in under an hour.\nTalking about how long it is , if it's your first time around the game , it will take you in the vecinity of five hours.\nGraphics , pretty bland , most of the time your feeling like your in a hospital with all that white , but you'll see some colours during the end.\nSoundtrack , the classic combo between repetitive and boring ambient music and then the drumy and annoying fight music , this game truly needed a better soundtrack for example some really chill chillstep during the puzzle solving part and some hard core dubstep during the fights , but i guess that's just me.\nA cool thing about this game is that technically is pretty well made , very few glitches and a very stable engine (no crashes here)\nAll in all , a pretty neat game , i higly reccomend buying it during a sale , you'll have a pleasant experience.\n","September 4, 2014","true","5.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

This game feels like a testbed for an entire sub-genre, the First Person Platformer, its so far is the only unique example of it and it shows. When the game is in its stride it feels exhilarating to play with an amazing sense of direction and unique style in graphics that really has stopped it looking dated several years later.\n\nUnfortunately the combat sequences can feel really out of place and can get frustrating very quickly and the game can quickly confuse the player about where exactly they need to be to the point where you have to look up videos on Youtube just to get an idea of where you are supposed to be. These two negatives can also get happen all at once which only serves to unduly stress the player. The story itself is also a letdown with no real talking points or standout characters excluding that of the protagonist Faith.\n\nSo with two glaring flaws why do I give this the thumbs up? I feel simply the concept that this game shows is full of potential, if DICE can iron out these flaws in the upcoming sequel it could really fly. There is something about this game that I just can't put my finger on, but it none of the less makes me excited to see if DICE can properly bake the formula into something incredible in the sequel.","August 23, 2015","true","30.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

I love the clean bright look of the game. It really enhances the feeling of space and freedom as you are leaping about. The main challenge is to discover  where you have to go, while being chased, which leads to repeated "death by bullets",  and you just having to replay the section again and again until you discover the exit. But the constant race to avoid death leads to the game being very rushed, which somewhat undermines it because you can't take in all that  freedom and space.  Personally, I think they would have done better not having the police chasing you everywhere. It really wasn't necessary. Having said that, it's still an enjoyable game and one I have no reservation in recommending.","August 20, 2012","true","1.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

For the most part of the game you're unarmed trying to escape from trigger happy police. You are able to slide kick or punch enemies and you are even able to take their weapons. Guns carry a few bullets so you won't kill that many opponents but that's alright since it's not what this game is about.\n\nMost of my favourite games have a great story but Mirror Edge is an exception. It's not like the story is bad but it's not great either. What makes Mirror Edge one of my favourites is simple: Atmosphere. It's just amazing to run around sky high buildings, escaping from the police. The buildings all look white and clean even the indoor industrial areas look clean which are just great to look at. Even falling down from tall buildings was something I enjoyed and made dying a lot easier.... in a way.\n\nThe graphics are still great for a 2009 + Mirror Edge has a great OST.\n\nThis game is not recommended to people who want to kill lots of enemies but everyone else who is open to new things should really try this game at least once in your life.","January 30, 2015","true","8.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/17410/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This game was a major breakthrough in the gaming world. Parkour hasn't been addressed much in any game until Mirrors Edge came out. There are a few ninja games (or splinter cell games) that had a bit of these abilities available but it wasn't until this game came out that parkour started exploding (besides the youtube videos). I beat this game on xbox 360 and here I am again for more.\n\nYou are a girl named Faith running through a city that is poison for runners (as her kind is called). These runners are pursued by "police" relentlessly until a potential mayoral candidate is found assassinated at his desk with Faith's sister (who is a police officer) right besides him. The story starts lifting more questions than any wrestling sitcom ever would.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fairly good, especially for it's age (released 2008). Controls include jump, slide, punch, kicking while sliding, disarming, time distortion (slow), turning 180 on a press of a button and another button for hint. Sprint happens gradually as you gain momentum and hold LS all the way up. RS will allow you to move your head as you'd like even when climbing a pipe or ladder. Some of the grab controls feel clunkier on PC than they did on xbox. By that I mean you have to be very direct in where you point and how you jump. If, for example, you are jumping ledge to ledge and decide to jump from a diagonal, you may encounter issues in Faith grabbing the ledge. Sometimes it will catch (depending on where you're facing). Other times, you will fall miserably to your death from hundreds of feet. Besides that little hiccup, most of the game feels right on. Besides zip lining and running and jumping on ledges, the player can jump from some insane heights, run along the wall to reach another ledge and even combine sliding (crouching) and jumping under and over obstacles. All these mechanics put together with the pressure of evading bullets really combines for a neat and exhilarating game.\n\nTo help the player figure out where to go, pressing B will point you in the right direction. It can be a bit confusing at times as not knowing what to use to maximize your parkour skills can be difficult. Fortunately, the developers chose to go with a simplistic graphics scheme. This simplicity does not take away from the game. Rather, it accentuates what's really important about it. The graphics using a minimalist design not only helps the player recognize tools they may use, but also gives the game a unique personality. Concerning the animations, they aren't the best but certainly aren't the worst. Some disarming scenes may feel a bit funny to watch. Would have been nice if they gave you more control in this situation! You will see faiths hands or feet appear on the screen as you jump (which is a great addition). Sounds and effects are pretty good. You'll hear Faith pant when she gets tired or a clunk when she misses something (or a big thump when she falls to her death). I think they could have done a little bit more with the sound to incorporate more of an ambiance.\n\nOverall, this game is definitely recommended. I'm not sure how it's predecessor will live up, but this is the game that made parkour "famous". The physics in this game were definitely a break through and a lot of other games have attempted to emulate such movement. When it first came out, it was easily an 8.5. Due to it's age...\n\nRATING : 7.5/10\n\nScreenShots :\nGetting shot at? Just slide and kick\n\nWhat a cut scene looks like\n\nWhat's worse : looking down a building or this\n\nRiding and jumping train to train\n\nThe thrill you get jumping from roof to roof while getting shot at\n\nWell, I gotta gun too now\n\nVisual cues in game","February 23","true","4.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

I love the idea, I love the graphics, I love the setting - but the gameplay is just godawful frustrating.  The controls are sluggish and finicky in places.  Some actions - climbing up ledges, swinging on horizontal bars - are  smooth as butter, but some parts - grabbing onto vertical pipes, certain jumps off a wall-run - just never seem to work right.  The melee combat is awful, especially the disarming mechanic.  Put all these things together with checkpoint saves and a lot of trial-and-error, try-die-repeat to figure out how to get past an area, and you get a really repetitive, frustrating game.  The fun bleeds away pretty quickly once you're having to repeat the same sequence of jumps twenty times over in order to retry the one jump you keep missing because the controls are so fussy.\n\nGot it on sale, and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it.

My only beef with this game is that the combat system is terrible, you are constantly being chased while defenceless, and it has a lot of frame rate issues when other NPCs come out. I have a really nice computer so I know that the frame rate problem isn't due to my specs. I searched the web to see if any one else has frame rate issues while NPCs arrive and I found that TONS of people have the same issue.

It may be short, but it leaves one heck of an impact, and will easily draw you in for more. Having previously played it on the Xbox 360, I can attest that while you can finish the whole story in one sitting with relative ease, you'll likely be playing the bits you liked over and over again.\n\nThe story is where the game really shines. You quickly learn that the primarily trigger-based controls are, while unique, pretty intuitive after a while. Everything in the game feels natural pretty quickly. Finding a path, stringing together acrobatic moves, and generally making your way around. Only the combat really feels stilted, with a same few punch animations. You're mostly encouraged simply to disarm opponents by tapping the Y button when their weapon is highlighted, which gives you their gun and instantly knocks them out. This can get tedious, but pacifist runs are possible.\n\nThe cutscenes have an animated comic sort of look to them. This is decent enough for getting the point across. The plot exists, primarily to get you between things to run around. It does a well enough job, and has quite a few surprises for only ten levels. The actual story levels themselves are like a combined puzzle platformer, as you mull over how to get where you're going and pull off some intensely satisfying parkour once you get the hang of it. The color scheme and lighting keeps the areas distinct from each other and easy on the eyes. It's a very particular, stylized look that benefits the game well.\n\nAs for replay value, as the main story is short and sweet (it does not overstay its welcome by any stretch, but you may be expecting a bit more at the end), the game banks on you enjoying time trials. Really, really enjoying time trials. Because that's all there is. No other challenges in any way, shape, or form, just be the fastest. To be fair, it's quite clear the game is designed for this exact purpose when you start shaving valuable seconds off and learning how to keep momentum going throughout your run, but if you don't like them, already got the three runner bags hidden in each level, and, for whatever reason, don't feel a little thrill at pulling an awesome time off, you've pretty much finished the game as soon as the credits roll.\n\nThe music is excellently fitting. The game overall can put a fantastic feeling of adrenaline into you, and a feeling of success when you figure out a new way through a level. There's no faster way to give someone a fear of heights than having them fall to their death in this game. The loading times are almost gone in the PC version (only three "Loading Level" screens still appeared for me), but the lengthy elevator rides and various delays meant to mask them are still perfectly intact, leading to some rather pointless waiting in the middle of a good run. Finally, the time trial scores are not registered through Steam. They are tracked through an EA Online account, which basically means you will not be finding your friend's times and racing your ghosts without a lot of undue effort.\n\nIn the end, though, this is quite the amazing game, and I must still recommend it, if only because it leaves an amazing impression and stands alone as an experience. There's just nothing quite like it.","June 8, 2014","true","21.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It really feels like you flow through the levels, quickly fight back (or escape) an enemy and get back on track running towards your goal. The game has also some of the greatests vistas of urban landscapes I have ever witnessed in a videogame. The level design is remarkably beautiful to date.\n\nSome negative aspects I could drag your attention to are its lenght and the way the story is presented. The game is short, no doubt. Although it offers a certain level or replayability because of its open level design, each time you play it you will finish it faster (but we can say that about just any game, can't we?). As for the story, it feels like it is just there; a filler that gives you a reason to run from point A to point B. But you do not really get into it and what you actually do in the game does not feel too much related to its further development.\n\nHowever, I do not think they are game breaking or that the experience suffers as a whole from these two elements, otherwise I would not have been playing it for the past 5 years, let alone recommend it.","February 26, 2015","true","45.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I really enjoy the parkour mechanics of the game, it is original and I have yet to experience anything like it in other titles. The world design is briliant, it is very clean and beautiful. Considering the game was realesed in 2009 makes it even more impressive. The graphics is really "up to date".\n\nThere are also a few things I did not like. The story is not the best and the gun play (whitch does appear frequently) is terrible. You cannot aim, you can't see your current ammo and you can't reload. This can be really frustrating in clutch scenarios and it does not help that the crosshair is bad.\n\nHowever, I would recommend this game to all the people that are looking for a parkour/running game with cool "jumps" and different ways to reach the target.

Kickass game!\nI was surprised that the ending mission took less than 5 seconds on my first try, maybe because I followed my instincts as Faith and haven't done otherwise.\n\nWhat I don't like in this game is that I can't disarm opponents early in the game. I just learned it when I'm already at chapter 8 when I used my adrenaline first then was able to successfully disarm an opponent. Another thing I hate though, is that I had motion sickness in early levels...\n\nI don't know about the game's replay value since I just completed normal mode in 10 hours, and I don't think that I would play it on hard mode.

The story though is a little short, but it is covered up by the different time trial courses which take part in some of the same places the story does. Even though there's no anti-cheat system for the game, which makes the world record impossible to beat, it's a very nice feature with stars being handed out in the time trial section as well. It promotes players to think, which is actually quite nice when you actually beat the level, since they're quite hard to get all the 3 stars in.

It's faster/harder than I thought it would be when I first started keeping it nice and challenging. The only issue I have had with the game is screen/texture tearing.

The level designs are absolutely breathtaking, from the skyscrapers to the underground levels.\n\nThe combat is very fluid and for once in any sort of game, I feel that having a weapon is actually a detriment. You move so much slower, attack so much slower.

It's faster/harder than I thought it would be when I first started keeping it nice and challenging. The only issue I have had with the game is screen/texture tearing.

The game did suprisingly horrible at launch, but over the years, Mirror's Edge is a force to be reckoned with. This game packs AMAZING visuals for such low requirements. The controls are absolutely perfect. They feel like you're not doing a ridiculous combo move to move Faith around, but you're also not one-buttoning it. The story is amazing, and packs a punch. You'll love feeling like a badass, dodging bullets and slaying the "blues" of the game.

This is not only beacuse of the story which is easy to follow, or the amazing graphics (Especially since this game was released about 5 years ago), but it's beacuse it simply is a game you simply can grab, and easily get grabbed by it. The story though is a little short, but it is covered up by the different time trial courses which take part in some of the same places the story does. Even though there's no anti-cheat system for the game, which makes the world record impossible to beat, it's a very nice feature with stars being handed out in the time trial section as well. It promotes players to think, which is actually quite nice when you actually beat the level, since they're quite hard to get all the 3 stars in.

The whole game relies on a constant "flow" of movement; the more you run the faster you go and you're encouraged to link jumps, wallruns, slides and rolls like you would in a fighting game, in order to maintain some kind of a combo.\nAs soon as you start it becomes incredibly addictive, and you'll soon challenge yourself at being faster, faster and faster.\nThe thing that separates this game from the rest, other than the simple yet perfect gameplay, is the masterful level design; the city you play in has an incredible charm, with its candid roads and silver skyscrapers and the developers really put a lot of though into the design of the map. Whenever you are not runnin you'll spend countless minutes enjoying the scenary and daydreaming about how living in such a place must be like, and the specific use of primary colors for the interiors makes a nice contrast to the bright white outdoors; everything is clean, perfect, symmetric, simple. The path you have to follow is linear, but that allowed the developers to craft the most interesting way ever to navigate the environment, showing an insight into the life of the city, making the player visit its underground stations, offices, sewers, police headquarters, rooftops ecc...\nIt's very hard to describe this with words and you really have to play it to witness it.\nOne thing that's fair to admit it's the game's lenght; realistically you'll finish the campaign in about 5 hours or less, which for me never was a problem but i know for many others could.\nThere's not much else to say about the game, because of its genius semplicity, other than it's a masterpiece; a game that every gamer worthy of this title should experience, to make its cult status grow even bigger.\nA game like this is only made every 10 years or so.","February 14","true","6.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lazyhomosexual/recommended/17410/","lazyhomosexual","Nephy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lazyhomosexual/","316 products in account","I finally got around to beating this game after like two years. I got about 2/3 of the way done before, got stuck on an area, got salty, and quit. Picked it up again and finished it in 3 hours or so.\n\nIt's usually not hard to see WHERE you're supposed to end up, it's just finding the path there and not falling to your death from a bad jump. I'd say there's replay value, because as soon as you finish the game you're just really getting the mechanics down and tend to make less mistakes.\n\nI see a lot of people complain about combat - I sort of get it, the combat isn't exactly fun but it's also not the point of the game in my opinion. You're a runner. You should be avoiding every enemy you can and taking the others out with acrobatic grace.\n\nShould be, anyway. I suck at disarming enemies so I just had to punch folks until they fell down. It was underwhelming, but I also think being chased and attacked was necessary to the feeling you get while running away. Glass crashing around you and bullets flying, Faith escapes again into the corners of the city.\n\nI adored the art style and selective use of colors. People saying it's all red and white are blind or didn't actually play the game. The colors do a lot of foreshadowing and kind of mentally prep you for upcoming events. I plan on doing some speed trials just to get pretty screenshots.\n\nPhysX is a turd and will blow your computer up, even if you have a PhysX optimized GPU. If you get huge FPS drops when windows break, it's PhysX. Disable it and enjoy the game.\n\nIt's so easy to not notice the soundtrack. A lot of the time you're just being talked to via headset, or you hear the sounds of the city. But there are a couple areas where the song is inspiring, where it makes you feel like you're flying and the air is rushing past your ears and through your hair.\n\nThe story is so-so. Think 90's action flick and you've got an idea of it. There are a couple plot holes but they're pretty easy to overlook and don't affect the enjoyment of the game for me personally. I just wanna jump off walls and do cool stuff.\n\nIf you're into acrobatic gameplay and using speed rather than force, definitely give this game a shot. It's fun and the style is so memorable.\n\n","December 18, 2014","true","15.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Get involved into some action and fast-paced parcour on roofs, inside buildings and on the streets! All that comes in addition with a bright style of graphics and a handfull of other, very fitiing, colours.\n\nTo begin with, the mechanics and the idea are a very neat thing, and it keeps you occupied for the time you play the story, as you get to use the variety of interactions, like wallrunning, pipe climbing, walljumping, disarming, sliding, etc. in a totally random order, depending on the levels.\n\nThe con at that part is, that the level design forces you to take a passage, the game is rather linear when it comes to that. There sometimes are several possibilites to get around though, still they end with the same result/position to be in.\n\nThe idea behind collecting secrets to unlock artwork/extras is a neat idea, still, I do believe that it does not really improve the fact, that the replayability is kind of low, as you barely get to see something new when you play for a second time.\n\nThe multiplayer, if you can call it like that, is more like a racer. No cool disarming, no avoiding or dodging of gunfire. You race other people, with the hope to win. Nothing else to say at that point.\n\nIn total, I can recommend Mirror's Edge at the price it is at. It is worth buying and enjoying, as it is a different expirience.","March 28, 2013","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't knock it off just because it was developed by EA (Because a lot of people just hate EA for... Being EA I guess). The general overview is that you're Faith Connors, an individual classified as a Runner in a resistance network against the city where a totalitarian government is in place. Essentially, your very existence is illegal, and the police, the SWAT teams, and even the news helicopters, are going to do everything they can to eliminate you. Your only choice? Run.\n\nInstead of starting off with the graphics and soundtrack and whatnot, I'll start off with mentioning what a brilliant idea Mirror's Edge tries to convey. The game makes you think beyond just the game itself. In the city, where all buildings are either a blinding white, or have shiny surfaces similar to a mirror, everything seems sterile and under control. When you play as Faith, parkouring over rooftops and transforming this orderly design into her own route, it presents a question of security vs. freedom of the individual. It makes you question how much people should sacrifice just to feel safe? Should they give up their privacy like so many others? Or should they struggle against it, despite the danger?\n\nNow, for a game that was released in 2008, the graphics are quite good. If your computer has graphics cards that can handle all the PhysX stuff, the shattering glass and the bullets embedding themselves into sides of buildings are quite realistic. That's essentially all I can really say, but the more important part is that if your computer can't handle it, (And I doubt it since the System Requirements come with almost all laptops these days), then turning everything on low doesn't give you a massive headache just from the pixels you can see.\n\nGraphics aside, (Because graphics don't matter as much to me as long as I don't get a headache because the game is too pixelated or something) the next thing I'd like to talk about is the soundtrack and the environment. As I mentioned before, the city gives off this sterile, no-touchy feeling. At the same time, when you're running across rooftops and leaping from building to building, there is this otherworldly feeling of almost flying. As you're running, Faith's rhythmic footsteps and breathing just give you a sense of freedom as the wind actually whooshes by you and the music just emphasizes that quality. This feeling is sharply contrasted when you're under attack, and the peacefulness is broken, and the music does make you feel either the freedom of just running, or the terror of getting caught.\n\nThere were some areas of the game that I felt lacking. The main problem I had was the short storyline. When I ended the game, I was satisfied, but at the same time, it left me wanting something more. Good news is that Mirror's Edge 2 is coming out soon... Sure, it's a prequel to Mirror's Edge, but now we get some background information on our heroine!\n\nAnother area I had was the gameplay itself, more specifically, the combat. The point of the game is to run, but there are times when you have no other choice but to fight. After all, there's only so many bullets you can try to outrun. Perhaps it's because I almost never remembered to use the "slow-motion" key, but disarming became increasingly difficult, especially as other people were shooting you from behind. In the off chance that you could actually disarm and pick up the weapon, shooting was pretty easy. I found myself generally just bashing people until they stopped moving, and then running away.\n\nSomething that annoyed me in general would be Faith's "health". Since Mirror's Edge doesn't have a "health bar", the general way to see if Faith was injured would be your vision turning gray and becoming more colourful as she recovered. What became a nuisance was that she could only take a bullet or two before dying. This does help discourage running headlong into combat like an idiot, but when snipers blasted from long range, it became quite tedious to avoid getting hit.\n\nMy last little pet peeve would be the cutscenes.

While sadly fairly short, although the time trials add extra time, this game is very fun, with very flowing free-running that feels very natural and fun. However, the same cannot be said for the clunky combat, athough that can be avoided for all of the game apart from a boss battle, however this fight is very enjoyable as the boss has the same fighting as you, rather than having guns which will cause your death the moment you try anything other than countering. Despite a lacklustre end, this game is so damn fun - let's hope that in the sequel they either remove combat or make it more fun and intuitive.","October 18, 2014","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

DICE put a lot of work making it feel real and fun at the same time, and it pays off really well. The fact that its first person makes you feel like you're actually doing it. Despite the combat not being up to par, the parkour works so well that you almost forget about it\n\n2) Graphics: For a game that came out in 2008, this still looks great. Not only does the world feel real, but the art style is just so memorable. It makes me wish a city like this was real\n\n3) Soundtrack: For an electronic soundtrack, it creates a relaxing feeling. It fits the tone and world perfectly\n\n4) Level design: While the game is very linear, it makes up for it with well thought out levels that give you multiple paths to get to your destination.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1) Length: It's only 5-6 hours. Should've been at least 8-10 hours\n\n2) Combat: I wish you could chain your parkour with your fighting skills to take down enemies while still moving fast, instead of having to come to a complete stop every time you want to do a takedown. Also, the punching and kicking animations feel stiff. Using guns is even worse; I wish they would have improved the hand-to-hand combat and removed guns completely.\n\nDespite its flaws, this is my favourite game of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique action-adventure game.\n\n9/10","June 13, 2014","true","146.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Get involved into some action and fast-paced parcour on roofs, inside buildings and on the streets! All that comes in addition with a bright style of graphics and a handfull of other, very fitiing, colours.\n\nTo begin with, the mechanics and the idea are a very neat thing, and it keeps you occupied for the time you play the story, as you get to use the variety of interactions, like wallrunning, pipe climbing, walljumping, disarming, sliding, etc. in a totally random order, depending on the levels.\n\nThe con at that part is, that the level design forces you to take a passage, the game is rather linear when it comes to that. There sometimes are several possibilites to get around though, still they end with the same result/position to be in.\n\nThe idea behind collecting secrets to unlock artwork/extras is a neat idea, still, I do believe that it does not really improve the fact, that the replayability is kind of low, as you barely get to see something new when you play for a second time.\n\nThe multiplayer, if you can call it like that, is more like a racer. No cool disarming, no avoiding or dodging of gunfire. You race other people, with the hope to win. Nothing else to say at that point.\n\nIn total, I can recommend Mirror's Edge at the price it is at. It is worth buying and enjoying, as it is a different expirience.","March 28, 2013","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't knock it off just because it was developed by EA (Because a lot of people just hate EA for... Being EA I guess). The general overview is that you're Faith Connors, an individual classified as a Runner in a resistance network against the city where a totalitarian government is in place. Essentially, your very existence is illegal, and the police, the SWAT teams, and even the news helicopters, are going to do everything they can to eliminate you. Your only choice? Run.\n\nInstead of starting off with the graphics and soundtrack and whatnot, I'll start off with mentioning what a brilliant idea Mirror's Edge tries to convey. The game makes you think beyond just the game itself. In the city, where all buildings are either a blinding white, or have shiny surfaces similar to a mirror, everything seems sterile and under control. When you play as Faith, parkouring over rooftops and transforming this orderly design into her own route, it presents a question of security vs. freedom of the individual. It makes you question how much people should sacrifice just to feel safe? Should they give up their privacy like so many others? Or should they struggle against it, despite the danger?\n\nNow, for a game that was released in 2008, the graphics are quite good. If your computer has graphics cards that can handle all the PhysX stuff, the shattering glass and the bullets embedding themselves into sides of buildings are quite realistic. That's essentially all I can really say, but the more important part is that if your computer can't handle it, (And I doubt it since the System Requirements come with almost all laptops these days), then turning everything on low doesn't give you a massive headache just from the pixels you can see.\n\nGraphics aside, (Because graphics don't matter as much to me as long as I don't get a headache because the game is too pixelated or something) the next thing I'd like to talk about is the soundtrack and the environment. As I mentioned before, the city gives off this sterile, no-touchy feeling. At the same time, when you're running across rooftops and leaping from building to building, there is this otherworldly feeling of almost flying. As you're running, Faith's rhythmic footsteps and breathing just give you a sense of freedom as the wind actually whooshes by you and the music just emphasizes that quality. This feeling is sharply contrasted when you're under attack, and the peacefulness is broken, and the music does make you feel either the freedom of just running, or the terror of getting caught.\n\nThere were some areas of the game that I felt lacking. The main problem I had was the short storyline. When I ended the game, I was satisfied, but at the same time, it left me wanting something more. Good news is that Mirror's Edge 2 is coming out soon... Sure, it's a prequel to Mirror's Edge, but now we get some background information on our heroine!\n\nAnother area I had was the gameplay itself, more specifically, the combat. The point of the game is to run, but there are times when you have no other choice but to fight. After all, there's only so many bullets you can try to outrun. Perhaps it's because I almost never remembered to use the "slow-motion" key, but disarming became increasingly difficult, especially as other people were shooting you from behind. In the off chance that you could actually disarm and pick up the weapon, shooting was pretty easy. I found myself generally just bashing people until they stopped moving, and then running away.\n\nSomething that annoyed me in general would be Faith's "health". Since Mirror's Edge doesn't have a "health bar", the general way to see if Faith was injured would be your vision turning gray and becoming more colourful as she recovered. What became a nuisance was that she could only take a bullet or two before dying. This does help discourage running headlong into combat like an idiot, but when snipers blasted from long range, it became quite tedious to avoid getting hit.\n\nMy last little pet peeve would be the cutscenes. While in game you could see everything in 3D, Faith's legs running beneath you, her arms reaching up to grab that ledge, the cutscenes initially shocked me. Seeing as everything else in Mirror's Edge was presented in 3D, I naturally expected that the cutscenes would also be 3D. After a while, I got used to them, but I would have liked them the same as the rest of the game. After all, how much money and time would it have taken to show Faith kicking butt?\n\nOverall, I still highly recommend this game. There are a few flaws, but they don't hinder the game too much after you get used to the combat system. Honestly, the cutscenes probably bothered me more, but you can always skip them if you get really annoyed about them. Parkour moves were incorporated into this game and there are areas where you have to carefully plan out your path, which for me just made up for some of Mirror's Edge's more lacking areas.

Picked it up for $5 on sale and it was absolutely worth it.\n\nThe movement is amazing.  With about half a dozen techniques to use, you can approach most of the game from a variety of (literal) angles.  There's also a time trial mode to really test yourself.\n\nWhat little combat there is is intentionally clunky as you're a "runner" not a "fighter."  But if you master the movement, you can do some amazing combat techniques too.  I, however, settled on repeatedly doing a running slide and kicking every single opponent in the junk over and over.  Crude, yet effective.\n\nThe platforming never felt "cheap" like in a lot of platformers, where you need nearly pixel-perfect precision.  In this game, if you're having trouble with a jump it's more than likely you're using the wrong techniques.\n\nThere's not much to the story, so don't expect anything wonderful there.  Someone wronged you, you're trying to figure out who they are and why they did it.  Nothing epic or grandiose like saving the world, it's pretty much just personal revenge with a bit of a political background.\n\nI had a few minor issues, including one slowdown/crash that was remedied by simply turning off PhysX in the options.  Other issues were my character not grabbing ledges that I clearly thought she should, or at one point I must have "stubbed my toe" mid wall-run because I just stopped and fell off the wall.\n\nDue to the extremely short length of the game, I can only recommend picking it up on sale.  It has difficulty settings, time trials, and some collectible items, so there's a small bit of replay value to it.","June 21, 2014","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything is so bright, it really makes you feel like you're outside, unlike the dark/murky look of most games.  Combat is good, but not as good as the running.  You'll find yourself panting/breathing along with the runner.  The problem is there is not enough of it.  Instead you run into areas that bring you to a dead stop while you try to figure out how to get to the next area.  This can be frustrating when you fall time after time, then when you finally get past one obstacle, you'll fail at the next one and have to start over again.

While many people say it's not replayable, I've gone through the game a good ten times and enjoyed each run. Memorizing spots to speed up your runs that you may not have known existed during your first playthrough and seeing a great running combo pay off is very rewarding, which adds a sense of replayability to the game and also makes second and third runs faster and more fun.\n\nOn the flip side, by giving players such an intensely graceful experience, after a few runs the player starts to play overly recklessly and hectically as they try to keep the flow going, which often results in death and frustration. Going fast for the whole level is incredibly addicting, and I hope Mirror's Edge 2 either adaps to or changes this. Give the player an incentive to ever stop going very quickly, like a decent combat system or a small chance to explore and see what the safest/fastest routes through a level are and make your choice. Otherwise, make sure the game flows as neatly as possible and feels graceful and fast the whole way.\n\nFor what it is, Mirror's edge is definitely worth the buy, especially at $4.99, which I've seen it go for many times.","March 18, 2015","true","57.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldfire242/recommended/17410/","coldfire242","Cold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldfire242/","44 products in account","Mirror's Edge is a beautiful game. It's fast paced and doesn't have to ever slow down if you are a good enough free-runner. But, this game isn't perfect, and as a hug fan of this game I'm going to be completely honest.\n\nThe good things about Mirror's Edge:\nThe Look - The City is amazingly gorgeous and dynamic. Different color schemes for certain buildings really help piece the city together.\nThe Feel - The controls are decent enough to get you where you need to go without looking like an idiot, but it's the animations and the lightweight feel of Faith that really make you feel like a runner. The way she vaults and slides across the floor look fantastic.\nThe Soundtrack - One of my favorite videogame OST's, Mirror's Edge has a distinctive feel that's core comes from listening to it's music.\n\nThe Bad things about Mirror's Edge:\nWonky parkour controls - At times you'll find that what you want to pull off isn't achievable unless you're a skilled pro at the game. You want to wall run then coil over that fence? Until you're completely familarized with the controls you'll fail 90% of the time.\nNo Achievements - You wanted to get achievements and cards for your amazing parkouring in this game? You would be better off buying it on console. That's right, Steam doesn't offer any achievements or trading cards for this game. Probably because the game is so old, the port to Steam is missing a lot of things that would make playing Mirror's Edge worth your while.\nThe combat - Now, this is completely avoidable if you have the skill to evade the police, but the combat isn't all that great. Sure, when you have the chance to pull of wallrun-kicks and leap onto SWAT members it can be enjoyable. But the areas at which you face the police are so open and empty you'll end up walking up to them, waiting for them to hit you with a melee attack, and easily tapping a button and countering them. Then you'll drop their gun, rinse, and repeat this process until all of the police are taken down and you can get on your way.\nShort storyline - The story is pretty uninteresting in my opinion. It only picks up at certain parts, and it's easy to tell who the villain is going to be by the final chapters. The game is only 9 missions long, and these missions are usually 10 - 30 minutes long.\n\nIn the end, Mirror's Edge is a great game that you will enjoy if you're into parkour and first person combat games. But if you want rewards, achievements, cards, or badges, steer clear of this title. By the end of the game, you'll feel one of two emotions. Satisfied with a great short-but-sweet experience, or you'll be left wanting more out of the game, since you can only now speed-run the same sections of the game or do time trials on certain parts of missions. Also, mentioning the no achievements you'll feel like you just sped-ran the whole game and all of the time trials for nothing, seeing how your scores on the leaderboard are only going to be buried beneath hackers of the game.\n\n6/10 - Good but could be a lot better if Steam supported the features that other titles have on it's store.","June 26, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is only one thing that made this game great and it's running. Running in Mirror's Edge, or just parkour, is amazing. It makes things that aren't good not important at all, just a little addition which you can ignore. There probably aren't game about running made so well and enjoyable. There is also one thing praiseworthy and it's graphics. Graphic in Mirror's Edge is great, even tho it's game from 2009 - simply yet beatiful mix of few colors on and in buildings makes you think "damn, it looks great".\n\nMirror's Edge is short game - for the first time playing you might spent at most 5 hours but trust me, every second is filled with great parkour actions. There are few difficulty levels, special speed run option so you can see how fast you are and time trials, where you can beat tracks as fast as you can and compare scores with your friends. There are also bags to collect in story mode if you enjoy searching for hidden stuff. These things makes game much longer to enjoy. I haven't tried everything yet (speed runs and all of time trials) but I'm sure I will be back to Mirror's Edge one day, when Virtual Reality headsets will be avaible for everyone. Just imagine, this thrill and excitement with goggles which will make gaming even more real...

You could also relieve the cops of their weapons and show them how to put it to better use if you're more of an aggressive player.  The levels are fairly linear, but the overall gameplay experience is one that is quite enjoyable.\n\nIt would be a good idea to play this one with a controller.\n\nPros:\nSolid freerunning platforming action in first person.\nPhysX support, for those with Nvidia cards\nCombat sequences don't clash with the actual gameplay, and you can choose to take out your attackers in most cases.\nA few extra challenges added in to really test your ability to cover ground.\nTime Trial mode once you ace story mode.\nExcellent graphics and environments.\n\nCons:\nLow replayability\n\nAfterthoughts\nPlay this one with a controller, as the controls are better suited for a controller as opposed to a keyboard.

Don't let EA's involvement in the game throw you off, this one was from before the dark days that give us nightmares every night.\n\nWhile the storyline of the game is not amazing, it is still pretty decent and is still more interesting than a lot of storylines in current games. The main appeal of this game for me was the apparent freedom of movement you have, even though the levels are quite linear. The wide-open level design makes you feel like the path you take is not necessarily the one and only path through the level, even though most of the time it is. The time trial levels reuse some of the storyline levels, which makes them somewhat repetitive yet familliar in an environment where practising easily makes you more comfortable with the section you are running.\n\nThe freerunning mechanics don't feel clunky and with the focus on momentum, they feel really fast and smooth when you are playing well and have a reasonable drop in this when you are not (which still does not make the freerunning feel clunky).\n\nConsidering the game was released in 2009 for PC, you don't need one of those new-fangled super-toaster 5000 with four bread slots and fast-defrost action- glueing a few potatoes together should suffice. Since the game is over five years old, it is pretty cheap now, too. Unless you don't like this kind of game, there isn't much argument for not giving it a go.","April 19, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Had something of a movie.\n\n- "Enemies either cannot hit you when you are standing right in front of them or snipe you over 500 miles"\n-> True, but to be more specific: When the game wants to push you or hold you out of a specific area (e.g. if you try leaving the map) enemies become deadly accurate. That way you stay on track and don't try to fight your way out. And that not every enemy is deadly accurate is actually a good thing, don't you think ;)\n\n- "bah too much gun figthing"\n-> Well, it is a game taking place in a distopian future and you are on the other side of the law.

Don't let EA's involvement in the game throw you off, this one was from before the dark days that give us nightmares every night.\n\nWhile the storyline of the game is not amazing, it is still pretty decent and is still more interesting than a lot of storylines in current games. The main appeal of this game for me was the apparent freedom of movement you have, even though the levels are quite linear. The wide-open level design makes you feel like the path you take is not necessarily the one and only path through the level, even though most of the time it is. The time trial levels reuse some of the storyline levels, which makes them somewhat repetitive yet familliar in an environment where practising easily makes you more comfortable with the section you are running.\n\nThe freerunning mechanics don't feel clunky and with the focus on momentum, they feel really fast and smooth when you are playing well and have a reasonable drop in this when you are not (which still does not make the freerunning feel clunky).\n\nConsidering the game was released in 2009 for PC, you don't need one of those new-fangled super-toaster 5000 with four bread slots and fast-defrost action- glueing a few potatoes together should suffice. Since the game is over five years old, it is pretty cheap now, too. Unless you don't like this kind of game, there isn't much argument for not giving it a go.","April 19, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

This game forces you to think in real time to get to your goal while dodging trigger happy cops in some parts.  You could also relieve the cops of their weapons and show them how to put it to better use if you're more of an aggressive player.  The levels are fairly linear, but the overall gameplay experience is one that is quite enjoyable.\n\nIt would be a good idea to play this one with a controller.\n\nPros:\nSolid freerunning platforming action in first person.\nPhysX support, for those with Nvidia cards\nCombat sequences don't clash with the actual gameplay, and you can choose to take out your attackers in most cases.\nA few extra challenges added in to really test your ability to cover ground.\nTime Trial mode once you ace story mode.\nExcellent graphics and environments.\n\nCons:\nLow replayability\n\nAfterthoughts\nPlay this one with a controller, as the controls are better suited for a controller as opposed to a keyboard.

The combat is for the most part foucsed on melee, however you can disarm your enemies if you wish to use a gun. Every movement you make feels fluid and satisfying.

Had something of a movie.\n\n- "Enemies either cannot hit you when you are standing right in front of them or snipe you over 500 miles"\n-> True, but to be more specific: When the game wants to push you or hold you out of a specific area (e.g. if you try leaving the map) enemies become deadly accurate. That way you stay on track and don't try to fight your way out. And that not every enemy is deadly accurate is actually a good thing, don't you think ;)\n\n- "bah too much gun figthing"\n-> Well, it is a game taking place in a distopian future and you are on the other side of the law.

What is it about and why is it so popular? Well if you love free running first person gun shooting action this is the game for you. The story sets off as the main protaganist faith (late after she joins the runners) Finds out her sister was about to get framed for a murder. Faith tries hard throughout the game to cover her name while the cops thinking Faith was the one who killed the man. Now about the gameplay, It's a great parkour game with things like wall running climbing on pipes rolling and many others but your character specializes in hand to hand combat making things a whole lot interesting. You can take guns from people in great fashion and even jump kick them. With that being said the question "Are there any mods for this game"? are possible but you'd have to download them off the internet, not from the workshop. So back to the question "Why is this game so popular?"

Game duration is also quite low as I completed this game within 10 hours.\nEven though this review does appear somewhat negative I did truely have quite an extensive amount of fun with this game so i'm rating it a 6.7 / 10","February 27, 2015","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't let EA's involvement in the game throw you off, this one was from before the dark days that give us nightmares every night.\n\nWhile the storyline of the game is not amazing, it is still pretty decent and is still more interesting than a lot of storylines in current games. The main appeal of this game for me was the apparent freedom of movement you have, even though the levels are quite linear. The wide-open level design makes you feel like the path you take is not necessarily the one and only path through the level, even though most of the time it is. The time trial levels reuse some of the storyline levels, which makes them somewhat repetitive yet familliar in an environment where practising easily makes you more comfortable with the section you are running.\n\nThe freerunning mechanics don't feel clunky and with the focus on momentum, they feel really fast and smooth when you are playing well and have a reasonable drop in this when you are not (which still does not make the freerunning feel clunky).\n\nConsidering the game was released in 2009 for PC, you don't need one of those new-fangled super-toaster 5000 with four bread slots and fast-defrost action- glueing a few potatoes together should suffice. Since the game is over five years old, it is pretty cheap now, too. Unless you don't like this kind of game, there isn't much argument for not giving it a go.","April 19, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

One of the best games by graphically and soundwise. The Game runs well and the gameplay is really smooth. Parkouring is one of the things I've always wanted to do, so this game made it happen. Soundtrack is amazing. Cutscenes are well animated. Graphics are eye candy and action sequences works fine. You can run, but you can also defend yourself by using weapons, for example I tried the shotgun and holy poop it felt good when the enemies flew through the air when I burst 'em with it. I think that this game looks a lot better than many other new games. Run. Jump. Feel the air below your feet.

Altough one may slow time down for a short while i rarely use it because it disrupts the gameflow (in my humble opinion).\nI could not play this game in full resolution (1920x1080) when there where multiple enemys appearing. Even so there are only barely visible differences when playing on 1360x768 pixels thanks to the way the levels are buildt.\n\nOne fustrating thing is the setting of Savepoints, that force you (especially in the later chapters) to start some long passages over once you die/fail. On the other hand really being forced to get longer sequences  and timings right gives this game its charm and made me think back to the first Rayman i played on a Gameboy advance.\n\nAll in all a fun first person parkour game/ 3D Platform jump and run, that gives you the freedom to either fight your way trough or run past all obstacles without harming anyone. Wheras the main point is to match your timing and finding your way.\n\nPs.: Because I played offline my game time was not recorded.\n","January 8","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All of this often leads to an encounter with armed forces which sometimes can be avoided or challenged through a combat.\n\n★ Movement has a good flow until you reach combat. However, it can be sloppy from time to time and because of that your character might miss objects that you're supposed to hang onto like poles.\n\n★ Combat is probably one of the worst aspects of this game. The melee part is kinda fine until you take possession of a gun. Its mechanics are literally crap. It would've been better if there were less combat because you can't avoid everything and you'll be forced to engage in it at some point anyways.\n\n★ As for the story, it didn't seem to be interesting for me at all. I was really trying to get into it and make it grow on me but I still found it dull (many will disagree).\n\n★ Music and graphics had a huge impact for this game's success. Soundtracks are relaxing and fits the theme. Moreover, colorful and minimalist graphic design added so much to this game visually that it distracted me from the gameplay just to enjoy the view.\n\nTherefore, this game stands on the verge between + and - but I'll still recommend it since I enjoyed it to some extent.\n\n6.5/10","May 27","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The fact that we had a strong female lead and not your stereotypical male hero added to it, Faith was a really well structured, beautiful and cool protagonist.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite good, the ambient music fitted the game's tone, though I didn't find it exceptional.\n\nOne minor flaw that I had heard many times was the game's short duration (~10 levels), but in my opinion the game was just long enough to keep the player's interest unwavering and ended right on time, with an open -kind of- ending, leaving us wanting for a hopeful sequel!","February 25, 2015","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

That's the key here. If you are looking for something that doesn't have to do with gun mechanics all the time, this is the title for you.\n\nBeing the FPS player I am, I still want to take breaks from the genre. Mirror's Edge at the time was the perfect solution. I don't have to pick up a gun to progress the action and story.\n\nShooting enemies in a first person camera has always been a "been there, done that" thing. Just look at the Battlefield series. It's Americans vs. <Insert National Enemy>. Where's the new "dyamics" or "mechanics" that make it worthwhile to play? The answer is, there isn't, and that's where Mirror's Edge is different.\n\nNow, speaking about guns.. You can do all those fancy disarm moves and take guns for your own use — if that floats your boat you are allowed to do that. Remeber that you should be using your environment to your advantage, and that's where the challange lies.\n\nWith simple colours, you may find your self looking at the environment instead of playing. Mirror's Edge has a very unique art style to it, which is yet another reason I picked the title up.\n\nWhile certainly an "older" game for sure, the graphics still have a kick. Throw in the integrated PhysX however, and the environment responds to a different factors. I should make a note here to say that the game ships with it's own copy of the PhysX dlls. This can cause serious frame rate drops when effects are activated. You can simply remove them to fix the issues. Just look online for details.\n\nSo if this game is so "great", why does it have a 81 on the metascore? Isn't that against my recommendation system to tell people to play this game with such a low score? Here's the thing...\n\nThe story... isn't long. It takes about 8 hours to finish the game. So price wise, $20 isn't worth the lack of story. $1 a hour for enjoyment tends to be my guideline, and works reasonably well for the most part.\n\nA lot of the cinematics should be done in game, but they aren't. There's nothing more I hate then low res compressed prerecorded cut scenes.\n\nWeapons look like the ones in Battlefield Bad Company 2. My suspition is due to testing for EA's (and thus DICE's) Frostbite engine. If you have played Battlefield Bad Company 2, you should see some simularities.\n\nTo tag on here, there isn't really any interaction with other characters either. It tends to be a few words to whoever, and then that's it.\n\nSo really I would still pass this game a thumbs up. However, I'd buy it on sale, and take some time to look at the environment.","December 31, 2014","true","24.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I didn't even know what it was, not the slightest idea. I picked it up on PS3 for roughly $80 AUD going from only the pictures that were on the back of the cover. When I got home of course I just had to boot it up straight away and at the time the first thing I remember was my eyes just lighting up, like I've just seen the best thing ever and nothing could top this. I was hooked and nothing stopped me from finishing the game in one sitting, the next day I had to tell everyone I loved it.\n\nThe game itself has aged well, it's still the same old original game I played back then. It's still stunning to look at, it's bright and unique like nothing you have seen before. The soundtrack is beautiful and calming and the sense of speed gets your heart racing. The keyboard and mouse works great and so does a controller straight out of the box, there's plenty of options to set and the game overall is optimized pretty well if not great. Now the story is simple sometimes it's comic styled and other times it's in game cutscenes but it's as average as you'd get for a parkour game... still it does it's job well, the plot gets you by surprise and the ending has a nice tone to it.\n\nNow a few things that are not the best, the first thing is well clearly it's not a game for everyone and that's fine you might just go into it and think well this is stupid. The gun mechanics are underwhelming so most of the time you'll find yourself avoiding it altogether. For AMD users as always the NVIDIA physics will destroy your fps but you can just simply switch it off which is good.\n\nOverall I think the game is amazing it might be the nostalgia talking but if you see this on sale for cheap, give it a try I'm sure you'll end up liking it just as much as I did.","July 27, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

What's not to like?\n\n\nLong version\n\nThe story is a bit weak and predictable with some big plot holes and on the short side but you are not going to care about that. You'll be too busy running around the city map missions using creative ways to get around, under and above obstacles.\n\nEnemies can be avoided, fought or just killed; it's up to you. The PC version does not have the trophies achievements from the console versions, you will unlock everything by just finishing the game on any difficulty. So go nuts and kill if you want, there is no penalty or Steam achievements.\n\nThe game uses checkpoints, but they are not located far from each other so no frustrating long re-attempts at difficult points.\n\nThe stage designs.....GORGEOUS!!!  Bright clean colors and great architecture. Even background (or rather the far ground floor looking down from skyscrapers) has actual people and traffic life to it. You don't feel like you're in a dead city. Even birds and airplanes are sometimes visible in the sky. Seriously, who ever made the maps, is a genius.

Nada contra as sagas nem contra a empresa, só talvez não tenha sido tão bem feito quanto precisava.\nMuita gente realmente "brosha" por causa das cores do game na hora de jogar porque enjoa de ficar encarando ou então porque elas realmente não entram no espírito de pulador de paredes e muros e de tanto morrer (e escutar som da queda-q), acabam desistindo do jogo. Apesar de motivos para broshar, o jogo é E-X-C-E-L-E-N-T-E.\nTem alguns puzzles (não muito difíceis, só são divertidos) e algumas partes mais complicadas porque você tem que correr o tempo todo ou pular ou dar voadora nos adversários roubar as armas e fazê-los desmaiar.\nO jogo é em 1ª pessoa e isso o torna ótimo, mesmo que você fique um pouco perdido às vezes porque não tem visualização de uma câmera para ter uma melhor visão de onde você está ou onde você tem que ir.\nA steam antes tinha um bug na hora de abrir o jogo e não o abria de jeito algum (problemas com patch e o inicializador) mas acredito que esse erro já tenha sido corrigido e se não tiver é só baixá-lo e baixe um crack mais atualizado e só. O jogo não exige muito do seu pc, até porque o meu é um lixo e rodou ele no mínimo lagado mas dava para jogar.\nA OST é muito legal, tanto a música oficial em que foi inspirada para o menu do jogo como as tocadas nas diversas fases, elas simplesmente te tranquilizam e te deixam inspirado (pelo menos a mim).\nMirror's Edge 2 já está em andamento e além de esperarmos lindos "visus" -q , esperamos uma história um pouquinho mais cativante e um jogo 100% divertido, assim como o primeiro. DICE, nos surpreenda.\nE porque esse jogo ser o meu favorito? Ah, nem sei, acho que me identifiquei com a personalidade de Faith e seu jeito de tentar resolver as coisas e também me identifiquei muito com o esporte que ela pratica (mesmo para quem nunca praticou, dá uma sensação de liberdade magnífica - no jogo - e é uma das coisas que às vezes precisamos quando muito pertubados, algo que acontece muito comigo)\nDê uma olhadinha nos vídeos e tente dar um de David Belle, através da Faith. Divirta-se.\n\nP.S: Esse gameplay aqui embaixo é muito legal :D\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uGgi2gXNK4","February 22, 2014","true","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Climbing isn't as boring as in Assassin's creed, story is good too, although I find it a little unfinished.\n\nLevels are mix of running, labyrinth puzzles and fighting/running away from enemies. And some more running. Yes, even more on top of that.\n\nI enjoyed every minute of gameplay(except the time where I got stuck in puzzles).\n"Extras" menu in game allows you to check some beautiful concept arts, from early ones to the latest pre-release ones.\n\nThe game worth the price even without discounts, that's a rare sight to see, for me at least, so I totally recommend anyone to grab it and spend at least few evenings playing it.","July 15, 2014","true","6.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Свой возраст вообще почти никак не выдает и ее всю целиком и полностью хочется резать на открытки. Вместе с годный муз. сопровождением создает ощущение какой-то белоснежной свежести, вин.\n\nОчень понравилось как оно в целом играется. Персонаж ощущается изумительно - проблем (как у некоторых ворчливых австралийских критиков) вообще не возникло. Очень порадовало что нету никакой тупой системы прокачки - играть и преодолевать все более и более сложные препятствия учится непосредственно сам игрок, а не автопилот. Временами матерился и хотелось бросить геймпадом в телевизор, но в отличие от некоторых других игр - это все приносило при прохождении свою долю фана.\n\nОпечалили разве что некоторые упоротые уровни под конец (уничтожение серверов, WTF), уровни-медленные-залазилки-куда-то и дурацкая система чекпойнтов (тут тупо нет опции "начать с контрольной точки" и не дай боже вы упали куда-то вниз и не расшиблись - будьте добры лезть всю дорогу снова)\n\nМногие почему то ругают сюжед. Говорят, мол, хотели мир и лор. Господа, нафига вам мир и лор в игре про стремительное преодолевание расстояния от точки А к точке Б. Сюжет тут делает главное - не отсвечивает и не мешает играть, за что ему и спасибо. Ну и что, что он дурацкий - who the hell cares.\n\nОчень понравилось в общем, вторую часть жду настороженно (оупенворлд, мир, какие то идиотские коллектблс, ЗАЧЕМ?)","June 29, 2015","true","10.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","5"

A sensação de velocidade e de liberdade é o que torna este jogo viciante e permite esquecer a história com algumas lacunas. Os cutscenes também merecem destaque, por se demarcarem dos gráficos (bastante bons) do jogo e apostarem numa vertente mais banda-desenhada que acaba por funcionar bem após o choque inicial.\n\nNo fundo, é um jogo de puzzles e perícia.

Is it fun? Yes! Absolutely! But it's not as groundbreaking as some hoped it would be (someone like me :P).\nIt's a good game with some designer flaws, none of which, however, deter from the experience. Allow me to elaborate.\n\n\nIn this game you play as a runner named Faith (how quaint) who runs into a, well, let's call it a "political disagreement" with the local PD, giving her (and you) an excuse jump off walls, off buildings, off TRAINS! Basically there is a lot of stuff to jump off of. And on, as well, as you are given the ability to beat the crap out of your enemies using said running and jumping abilities. This is very a smooth combat system, and very entertaining to do, as using your momentum to drive your punches and kicks like a projectile leaves you with an awesome feeling. The game seems to suffer from some kind of split personality disorder, though, as it can't tell if it wants to be a freerunning racing game, or another stylish EA shooter (meh). There are several points in the game where the only way to progress is to pick up a gun and blast/snipe your way through. Luckily there are only a few parts like these.\n\n\nThe game markets itself as something unique and different that the current FPS generation would enjoy, however if you ignore running aspect and focus on what else the game is offering you basically have a linear campaign with several elements taken from games such as Half-Life 1+2 and portal, such as having to analyze your surroundings and cleverly use them to your advantage (another would be crawling through the air vents). This doesn't necessarily make this a bad game, just don't expect it to be ground breaking. I thought I was going to have an experience similar to Prince of Persia, but really it was far from it. It's a game of speed and momentum, where you are trying to get from point A to point B in the smoothest and quickest way possible, whereas Prince is about using special climbing techniques to solve puzzles that take up entire rooms.\n\n\nThe graphics are great, and the massive city truely looks amazing. The Unreal 3 engine really shines in this game. I just wish we could actually go into the city and explore it more. Instead you are guided through a linear path, probably because that way it could tell the story, however unrelatable it was. It's clear that they worked hard on the story, but it's just so convoluted that I found myself paying less and less attention to it as I went along. The gameplay keeps you more engaged than the story, which is ok.\n\n\nI personally liked it, and found myself coming back to the time trials to kill some time. Without a doubt this game had much more potential, and with the fact that they had to revise the story several times, it kinda shows. But for a new IP with an experimental play style it seemed to present itself quite well. I would recommend this game to people who want to kill a weekend with some high velocity scissor kicks and clever outside-the-box speed run levels.","January 9, 2015","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/myleandro/recommended/17410/","myleandro","myleandro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/myleandro/","154 products in account","Parkour, cyberpunk, high-octane adventure/action thriller with a female hero protagonist.\n\nPros\n\n* Sexy asian female heroine, lead protagonist provides a distinction to just about every other game out there since Tomb Raider which I found refreshing and captivating.\n* Visuals are excellent, and could have been even better if my system would have handled it.\n* Storyline was simple but easy to follow and still captivating.\n* Simple and straight forward, it's main tenant is one or two things and it doesn't try to pretend to be anything more.\n* Has been made to work in VR, which I am very excited to try.\n* Really liked that it had combat strewn in there as well. I began to really look forward to weapon encounters just so I could steal the weapon and shoot every one up - kinda breaks up the rhythm of the game.\n* Exhillarating, fun, almost-realistic, inspires a rush of adrenaline and fear.\n* Breathtaking and awe-inspiring cityscape views.\n* Beautifully animated cutscenes.\n* It was really fun, and the combination of parkour, gun battles, fighting and chases was enthralling.\n* Cinematic quality gameplay that really flowed from one scene to the next, creating a sense of urgency - really well done!\n\nCons\n\n* The wall-running and other parkour techniques that are fundamental to the game are not explored thoroughly enough in the tutorial, which can lead to frustrations later on in the game and slowed it down, when the challenges become more difficult.\n* Extremely laggy on an 2xGPU ATI gfx card with PhysX turned on (in particular the scenes where lots of glass breaks) - had to disable PhysX - then it ran excellent.\n* Storyline may be a little too simplistic for some. Could have used a few extra twists perhaps, but I was satisfied just the way it was, but could definitely have been a little longer.\n* Some of the city detail could have been a little richer (cars, trees, animations, pedestrians, etc).\n* Recognising it was an experience focusing around jumping around buildings and parkour, I would have enjoyed a little more combative / weapon encounters.\n* There is one particular part of the game when the parkour and 'movement sequence puzzle' became a little overwhelming, but not enough to not want to see it through (though I could've done with about half as much).\n* No stealth. I mean this is a Pro as well, as the game is not designed to be "Thief" - I feel that every other game should have develoepd the parkour elements of Mirror's Edge to this degree and not the other way around. But since it is already such a simple game, adding stealth would have enriched the game dynamics further somewhat. I can't help but feel that it was designed to be a 100% parkour game, but then at some point someone made a decision to chuck in some weapons, and left the storyline/gameplay with regards to weapons under-developed, whilst the parkour elements over-developed. I mean I could have done with a 100% parkour game, but if you added the weapons element, why not extend it a little further.\n\nConclusion\n\nI really, really enjoyed this game! My biggest gripes are that I wish it were a little longer and that they explained the wallrunning and other parkour techniques a little better at the beginning. I managed to get to almost the end before realising "OK this is going to HAVE to be a wall run!" and finally googled how to do it, though it would have made the rest of the game just that much easier (in the sense of time wasted) if I had known how to do it correctly from the beginning.\n\nAlso, in relation to making the game longer, it seems that if the devs had invested as much time as they did *SPOILER ALERT* with that huge empty atrium, and instead filled a few more carparks or construction yards with a bunch of baddies with guns in a fashion that allowed a combination of parkour, gun battles, chases and fighting - the replayability of this would be enormous. I'd still be playing it instead of writing this review :) With just a little more encounters that combine your parkour and stay under cover, steal weapons, fight, chase all rolled into the same scene, it would have stretched the hours playtime considerably as well as increasing replayability.\n\nI will be definitely playing it again, and will definitely play and look forward to a sequel. It was awesome!","December 24, 2014","true","27.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play this female freerunner whose sister somehow gotten herself involved in a giant conspiracy, and you need to run through a gauntlet of cops, SWAT teams, and perhaps, other runners in your quest for truth and justice. As this is a first-person parkour game, you will be vaulting fences, guard rails, making death defying jumps between buildings, zipline across cables, wallruning between platforms sliding under some obstacles, as well as do some unarmed combat where you take guns away from cops and such (optional, this is NOT a shooter). There are plenty of challenges, and the game has a way to ease you into it by having a rooftop training course. Then it's balls to walls time as you're being chased by everybody... cops, SWAT, even helicopters. The idea is to chain together moves smoothly to get maximum speed, and it's not easy.

Let me tell you, I have only (At the time of me writing this review) played about 25 minutes. Already love this game. FIrst off, I was happy how my crappy PC ran this game so smoothly, Secondly, I LOVE How your character Faith Feels, her movements are so fluid, like water, so agile and graceful. I freaking LOVE IT. And it needs to be all these things in order to play the game. The game it'self is more of a puzle game slightly portal-esque, Minus portal, Why it reminds me of portal is because it uses the enviroment as the puzzles, I freaking love that. There are so many ways to move, like making yourself smaller in mid air so you can hop over barbed wire fences, Zipline, slide, climb, shimmy, sidestep, wall ride, roll to save yourself from taking damage. You literally FEEL LIKE A RUNNER. You feel like a legitimate bada$$. I highly recommend this game, even if you may have a slightly laggy computer, this game will run beautifully for you. SOOOO worth the money, even though I got this game on sale for 5 bucks, It's sooo worth more! But I have more money to spend on other games as well >.>","September 14, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How many first-person parkour exploration/fighting/puzzle games can you think of that are driven by storytelling-elements? I personally can not think of any. The characters and voice acting are a bit cheesy and predictable, but still enjoyable. The game (in my opinion) has pretty good replayability value because of how engaging the gameplay is, but it can get a tad repetitive. And the visuals are great. I have a Medium to Low Laptop, so I run this game smoothly at mostly medium settings, and even with the graphics down a bit, the scenery is just wonderful.

Also you can turn this option off in the main menu if you don't need any help or you thing that the arrow if annoying you.\n\nAs this is a first person game what makes this feel that your in the game (depending on your monitor). The other reason on why it feels like your in the game and you are the person jumping all over the buildings with amazing graphics! This helps you play the game for a long time per session you click on the icon.\n\nINCOMPLETE\n\n--------------\nShort Version\n--------------\n\nThis game is a nice game if you like parkour and lots of options in the main menu! I have not finished the game! so don't look at the review and think i've finished the game.\n\nPros\n-------\nHelpful tutoral - Tells you all you need to do in the game.\nTells you where to go if you get lost in the game - Red highlights on where to go.\nMakes you feel like you are in the game running around the buildings - As this is a 1st person parkour it does make feel like your in the game, only if you have good monitors and a good computer for the FPS.\nGood story line - Tells why your in trouble and why your a runner in this city and how you can fix it.\n\nCons\n--------\nFighting - As this is a parkour game why should there be running away from people or killing people? the main thing what I hate is the parts where you have to run away from the helicopter!\nLanding - Just remember i've have not finished the game so i'm not the best but it is hard to land when you jump off buildings, you have to press the button close to the ground but not too high up from the ground.\n\nI rate this game 8.9/10","December 22, 2013","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Aside the great amount of work that was put in, I would like to point out that the shooting mechanics were terrible and sometimes even terrifying, I never looked forward to those bits in the game, they were litteraly forced into the game in my opinion. The parkour mechanics were excellent, they actually felt as if I was doing those acrobatic manouvres, and I'll tell you I only clenched my buttocks 30+ times.

It's a first person parkour game. I would leave it at that but that wouldn't be very helpful. As a free runner myself I can say this is the best free running engine I have seen in a game. Whereas games like Assassins' Creed feel too floaty and Sleeping Dogs feels too clunky, this really feels as if I'm the one doing it. The physics seem very accurate to doing the real thing, if ever so slightly floaty at points but compared to some of the engines I have played with, it's superior by far. The story is nothing special but the game makes up for that through game play mechanics and stunning visuals. It has been a long time since I completed the game but it's still very enjoyable to go back and improve your "flow". Would I recommend this game? Yes, if you want something original and enjoyable gaming wise, this will satisfy your want.","June 24, 2014","true","35.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Skyscrapers rise into the air everywhere.\nWhile it is a beautiful sight, the City can be a dangerous place for some individuals.\n\nIn Mirrors Edge, you take the role of a Runner called Faith who's sister has been framed of a murder that she didn't commit, and you are being chased by the police, also known as 'Blues' by the Runners.\n\nMirrors Edge lets you preform wall-runs. death-defying leaps across buildings and vaults over objects. The graphics for Mirrors Edge are magnificient. Sometimes I just wanted to be able to stop and just soak it all in.\n\nWhile the game has a very basic art style - mostly white and red with the occasional blue, orange or green - this tends to help the player focus on intense moments of action. The hud is not cluttered at all, as it only comprises of a small dot in the middle of screen, which is used for aiming weapons.\n\nMirrors Edge doesn't focus on combat and instead focuses on movement throughout the enviroment, which is why I would extremely recommend that you play this. 9/10","September 25, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole fun of the game (and the obvious core) is running around and doing parkour in possibly one of the most beautiful cities you could ever parkour in (and clean).\n\nFor a game released in 2009, it's more than what you could ask for (visually/aesthetically talking).\nThe clean, peaceful and safe feeling that the environment around you provides is simply amazing (which is funny seeing how sometimes you might be running for your life).\n\nEven though the overall game is visually stunning, some of the levels (again, visually speaking) will just keep you speechless (causing my deaths several times in several levels, but..."IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT."\n\nThe game itself, well. Some levels you will find incredibly frustrating and nearly impossible at times, but that's actually a good thing, or a pro about the game. The reason behind this is, because once you manage to accomplish the level, the satisfaction and the sense of accomplishment (and lets admit, cleverness) is beyond satisfying.\n\nCons? Well, my top recommendation is to disable physx. That is basically the killer of the game. It can cause severe (and I mean SEVERE) frame issues and lag, even going as far as crashing your game.\nI'd also recommend avoiding confrontation when faced against many cops or snipers (oh how I despise those snipers).\n\nOh and, you'll find out what I mean when I say that you should probably RUN FOR YOUR LIFE when you're being chased by your shadows (or runner's shadows, not quite a spoiler. As you probably don't have a clue of what I'm taking about).\n\nIf you're having problems in deciding if the game is worth it or not, I guarantee it, if you love parkour and stunning visuals, go for it. I'd also recommend it so you get to know the origin of Mirror's Edge (as the second one will be coming out eventually).\n\nWhat are you waiting for, buy the game!","March 7, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/17410/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","One of the most original games of recent years. I would never have guessed that a developer company would some day release an FPS game where the emphasis would be on running, sliding, jumping, vaulting, rolling, crouching and all this done on the rooftops of skyscrapers. These are the movements your protagonist, Faith, uses whenever she is faced with an obstacle.\n\nThe game is an unstoppable roller coaster ride. All the movements you do you do while running. And to make it more exciting the game does not want you to stop - your "vision" enables you to see certain objects, ramps, ledges and pipes highlighted in red so you know you can interact with these objects and you do not need to stop to look for clues. Later on as the game gets gradually more difficult this assistance is reduced and you can even turn it off completely so that the game can offer you the ultimate challenge.\n\nEnemies can be taken down with melee combat but most of the time you need to run. Those that have weapons can easily eliminate you. Interestingly, you can knock out some of these police officers and pick up their weapons. Bear in mind that the ammo is limited so once your magazine is empty you should get rid of your firearm. But with weapons you want to aim like in a true FPS game, right? So, using a firearm will break the pace here, therefore, it's best to just skip this opportunity and run all the way till the game ends.\n\nAnd pretty much that is the only problem with Mirror's Edge. You run fast and you reach the end fast. They could have included some extra chapters to make the game longer. You have time trial challenges so that you can keep playing stages over and over again improving your total time for completion.  I really wish, however, if there was a sequel to this game as it was such an exciting ride. It would be really nice to be a courier again in the new era of next-gen games.","March 27, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The platforming and running mechanics amazingly portrayed what parkour is all about. And the game gives off a definite feeling of speed and momentum as you navigate the few levels the base game has to offer. And that feeling is emphasized even further by the vibrant and colorful environments. The premise is neat but how they told the story and the characterization could have been done better. That's kinda disappointing since the player character, Faith, is pretty much a badass.\n\nOnly thing though is don't buy it on Steam. Buy the game on Origin, EA's own client, because for some absurd reason the great Time Trials DLC is not for sale here on Steam. The DLC is worth it because it's just pure running and none of the atrocious combat is present.","April 30, 2013","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once you take the time to learn the controls and develop some rudimentary skills, the fun factor goes way up.  The most fun part of the game for me was the time trials, because it's just pure parkour all over the place.  You get to make the rooftops your own, and run/jump/climb all over your territory.  The campaign itself is quite good.  The writing isn't great, and the plot unfolds somewhat predictably, but that was never the main focus of the game.  The focus is running from the cops, or chasing other dudes, and that's where all the excitement is.  There is a ton of adrenaline value in most of the levels, and the non-chase puzzle levels are so interesting, you're still on the edge of your seat.  A lot of the enjoyment of the game comes from how good everything looks.  It's a bit unrealistic that everywhere you go is so clean and amazing looking, but that just adds to the experience, and helps to remove anything that might distract you while you run full speed past it all.  The only downside to the campaign is that once you've really hit your stride and parkour through the levels like lighting, it ends up being over rather quick, leaving you wanting more.  Then it's time to challenge yourself and run it all again, looking for quicker runs, and more efficient paths.  There's such a good selection of path options, that it really encourages you to make split second decisions, and judgement calls.  If you do get hung up, and decide to fight it out with the pursuers, there's a pretty interesting and engaging combat system.  *Spoilers*  The cops constantly try to kill you and never hesitate to open fire.  Shooting them is fun, but you don't get much ammo so if you go exterminator mode like I did, you have to plan out your attacks and work your way from enemy to enemy one at a time.  Fighting one enemy is really fun.  Fighting two gives you about a 50% survival chance but it's still doable and still fun if you pull it off.  It's understandably not fun to get mowed down from 3 or 4 different directions if you just run into the fray, and that's what happens, so you have to stay tactical.  *More SPOILERS*  The ninja dudes at the end are hard as hell to beat, but they are killable, and I figured out to beat the sh** out of those mofos, but again it involves extreme tactics.  They, like you, regenerate unless hit a lot of times in quick succession.  Get 3 good hits on them in under 10 seconds and you knock them the heck out, but that's so hard to pull off it's easier to just run away and escape them.\n\nJust to summarize\nPros:\nFun Campaign\nFun extra modes\nAwesome concepts and execution\nCool main character\nLevels look cool\nParkour looks awesome and sounds awesome (the sound clips used are perfect)\nCan play like a speed demon or a vengeful punisher\n\nCons:\nCampaign is short if you speed demon the whole thing\nStory is probably the least developed part of the game.\nHow much fun you have depends on how well you learn the system and timing.\n\nI spent a lot of time on the levels, finding shortcuts, killing everything, and exploring, so I got a lot out of the game.  It's unique and it draws you in.  Immersive yet light on a heavy gamer's pallete.  I'd even say, it's an almost perfect game.  5/5 stars.","September 1, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm giving it a thumbs-up because the free-running gameplay is an interesting mechanic, but the game has enough faults that I really only recommend it when you can find it on sale.\n\nAll in all not a very good game, even though it seems to have a pretty rabid fan base. To be fair, the graphics are very good, especially considering it's a few years old, and the developers had some innovative ideas for how to play the game. Unfortunately actually playing the game just wasn't as fun as it should have been. Mostly the game suffers from pretty bad controls coupled with unforgiving gameplay mechanics, which results in having to replay sections over and over again. Most jumps and grabs have to be precisely timed and the distance precisely judged, but many times the button presses didn't register quickly enough, and it's in general pretty difficult to judge distances, so I found myself dying dozens of times when I missed jumps by no more than an inch or two - that got frustrating really fast. The control issue also raised its ugly head in the wholly mediocre combat. Many, many times the right-mouse button counterattack failed, which got me killed more times than I could count. I eventually grew to hate the combat so much that I just pounded on the first guard I saw, took his gun, then shot everyone else just to get it over with.\n\nThe other huge frustration with the game was the fact that for such a completely linear game it was often nearly impossible to figure out where to go. There was supposed to be a hint system that highlighted your path in red, but sometimes it showed up off in the distance, sometimes not until you were right on top of the path, and sometimes not at all - I wandered around a lot because of that. Even worse was the level where the devs decided to paint everything in the building red; I don't know why, I guess maybe they just thought it was funny to frustrate us even further.\n\nTo make matters even worse (or perhaps better, as things turned out) - beyond the spotty controls, oft-failing hint system, unforgiving mechanics and mediocre combat, the game took me all of 5 hours and change to complete. I'm not necessarily opposed to short games, as long as the story is engaging and gameplay is fun - The Darkness II is a perfect example. But this game was neither engaging nor more than moderately fun, and was far too short for the money they normally charge. Luckily I got this as part of the EA Humble Bundle, so I really didn't shell anything out for it. If you can pick it up really cheap then it's fine to waste time on for a few hours, but anything more than a few bucks is probably a waste of your money.","November 26, 2013","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story isnt really all that great but the gameplay is awesome. Its such a crazy feeling running and stunting all over the roofs of "the city." I especially liked how this game actually encouraged avoiding violance. Violance will usually end in you getting shot in the face unless youre really quick and can disarm enemies. It is such a satifying game. Buy this game. It is amazing.\n\n(if in the second mission the game lags out like crazy when the glass get shot, if you have an AMD graphics card or any non- Nvidia card just turn of "physics" in the options menu and it should be fixed. if you have an Nvidia card then look it up on the fourums. i have no idea how that works but i know its different.)","October 18, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Beautiful, fast-paced, exciting, and fun. The first thing you'll notice besides the lovely intro track is that this is primarily a puzzle parkour game with a little combat sprinkled in. The second is that the screenshots fail to represent just how gorgeous the game looks in motion. It has a near perfect first person movement model.\n\nThe lowest point is the predictibility of the story, but it's so well executed that you can forgive the cliches. There is an average of 6 hours of main storyline game time, so you may want to pick it up for $15 or less although there are speed runs and trials to help compensate. The parkour is more fun and dynamic than any assassin's creed and even if the levels are very linear there are multiple ways to engage each combat situation or puzzle.\n\nNote: If you have vertigo or experience motion sickness, you definitely want to watch some videos full screen to make sure you will be able to enjoy the game without severe side-effects.","March 6, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a first person parkour game. I would leave it at that but that wouldn't be very helpful. As a free runner myself I can say this is the best free running engine I have seen in a game. Whereas games like Assassins' Creed feel too floaty and Sleeping Dogs feels too clunky, this really feels as if I'm the one doing it. The physics seem very accurate to doing the real thing, if ever so slightly floaty at points but compared to some of the engines I have played with, it's superior by far. The story is nothing special but the game makes up for that through game play mechanics and stunning visuals. It has been a long time since I completed the game but it's still very enjoyable to go back and improve your "flow". Would I recommend this game?

Not at first, no. It took a while to like it. My main problem with it? Nvidia.\n\nPhysX is awful. Its broken. It doesn't work. I spent the longest time trying to get the game to stop lagging and to stop screen-tearing. I gave up for a couple months, and eventually came back. This time I figured out what was wrong. It was PhysX. So I enabled v-sync and disabled PhysX. BAM, suddenly the game runs perfectly.\n\nBUT when you finally get into the game, its great. The running is a bit awkward, parts of the running and stuff seem unrealistic, however on the whole, its pretty awesome. You get to run around and jump and vault and wall-run and more.\n\nWhat I wish they'd fix is the combat. Its okay, I guess, but when you're trying to disarm, its a 50/50 for whether you can actually do it. Most of the time you're a split-second late or early, and the soldier kills you. You can take a few shots, but it gets to the point later in the game where you're getting killed what seems to be WAY too easily, compared to earlier in the game.\n\nThe story is great if you're paying attention. It could be a lot better, they should have revealed more about what happened to the City and how its come to this awful state its in now, but instead they set all the focus on saving Kate. Its not bad, because its still a pretty great story, but it could be better and more indepth. I figure Mirror's Edge 2 (if it ever gets released, and if DICE doesn't ♥♥♥♥ it up) will have all that backstory.","April 29, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fast-paced action game all about momentum and using three buttons to do a million things.\nThe game is set in a dystopian and overly uniform city of towering skyscrapers, and the plot revolves around the murder of a close friend of the main character's family. The game is essentially get to Point A to Point B, without dying, as fast as you can. Combat is rather awkward and there isn't much of a way to learn moves except trial and error, which can prove to be extremely irratating. Graphics reflect the dystopian world in solid, vivid colors, and keep the puzzles simpler as different key objects can be easily separated by the distinct colors. Voice acting is tolerable, but not especially impressive. As previously mentioned, momentum is imperative in performinfg many of the game's not-so-realistic moves, but oddly is often lost in solving some of the intermediately difficult puzzles.\nOverall, I would recommend this game.\nGraphics: simple yet uniquely beautiful. Gameplay: engaging, smooth and straightforward, although some moves are difficult to figure out.

The 1st time I heard about this game and watched the trailers, I instantly fell in love. The graphics, oh my god, so realistic and I can admire the details in the enviroment. But then again, I'm a little old-school on videogames such as ps2 gamecube or even nintendo 64 so you probably won't be surprised if your used to the new graphics today. It's so much fun running with very well-fitted music and sometimes I feel the adrenaline pumping when I know the parkour persuit cops are on my tail. Seriously, I got intersted in free-running after playing this game. This is a game where you are struck in awe, but a shame that the adventure ends quick. The game's a little short and I wished there had been more modes than just time trial and single player.. EA and Dice definately needs to make a sequel.

In fact, I think "Mirror's Edge" was one of those pattern-makers in game industry, which highly increased awesomeness of first-person-games-gameplay.\n\nThis game kinda reminds me "Portal", because the point of the game is finding a way out. That's it.\nYou can distinguish two parts in "Mirror's Edge".\nFirst one. I'd call it "Flying part", because in these moments you can truelly relax and go with the stream. Just fast running, jumping, finding new directions to go. This part makes an impression of this game, cause it takes the most time of the game.\nThe second one is a "Puzzle part". Like in "Portal", you can go through the game with insane speed and then BOOM. You got stuck. There was a couple of places where I really got stuck for a long time, but this makes this game more interesting. Sometimes you gotta stop and realise that this game is not about button-mashing. There is some intellectual work here, you know.\nSo both of these parts are perfectly combined in one game, mixed and interfered from time to time by a simple combat with enemies. And when you play it, it goes really well.\n\nI can't say that there are some deep thoughts in a story-line, jokes in a dialoges or some really unexcpected plot-twists, BUT this game is amazing. It's all about gameplay, I guess, and about this freedom that you feel in a mid-air.\nAnd having good gameplay only doesn't spoil anything. Very unique game. Totally a "must-have".\nSo go buy it, cause I'm out of words.","February 13, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This city has an achevement of having a totalitarian regime and monitors all communication and controls the media. Before events in the game there was a protest against their rule.\n\nThe protagonist in this game is Faith a runner , a courier who carries uncensored news around the city. Faith's parents were killed in the protest when she was young leaving her with only her sister.\n\nThe mechanics in this game are decent. Sometimes when playing Faith woulden't grab on a ledge or do the action I wanted her to do. The shooting in this game are just bad... instead of shooting an assault rifle I thought I was shooting a Nerf gun and the shotguns seem to blow your enemies away (literally).\n\nThe core gameplay is extremely immersive, fun, replayable and had a nice flow to it. With beautiful visuals and somewhat challenging levels make this game extremely amusing. The level design was just the thought of "Oh! that's convienent!" where someone would park their tall van right outside the fence i had to climb around. Next, this game has no implementation of stealth (which would be cool) for example, I would silently get into a building when all the sudden an alarm would go off or I would get a messege saying "the blues (cops) are all over you!" and this was very frustrating.\n\nThe art style is interesting. Everything is white with pops of color in different places and I found this pretty cool.\n\nPROS:\nfun, replayable gameplay with a nice flow\nvery immersive\nbeautiful art style\nsomewhat good parkour mechanics\n\nCONS:\nterrible shooting mechanics\nconfusing story\nno stealth implementation\n\nOverall, this an awesome game. With its beautiful graphics and immersive and fun gameplay I would reccomend this game for anybody!\n","March 4, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I coach parkour in real life so I found this to be more related to myself as well as giving me plently of neat ideas at what to do out there in the real world, minus being chased by swat teams. The neat thing about this game is there isn't just one way to play it, I noticed as I was going along there are different routes you can take if you are skilled enough with your keyboard to make those jumps or wall runs. While doing some of those jumps, it has moments where you feel the fear of heights shiver up your spine.

The whole fun of the game (and the obvious core) is running around and doing parkour in possibly one of the most beautiful cities you could ever parkour in (and clean).\n\nFor a game released in 2009, it's more than what you could ask for (visually/aesthetically talking).\nThe clean, peaceful and safe feeling that the environment around you provides is simply amazing (which is funny seeing how sometimes you might be running for your life).\n\nEven though the overall game is visually stunning, some of the levels (again, visually speaking) will just keep you speechless (causing my deaths several times in several levels, but..."IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT."\n\nThe game itself, well. Some levels you will find incredibly frustrating and nearly impossible at times, but that's actually a good thing, or a pro about the game. The reason behind this is, because once you manage to accomplish the level, the satisfaction and the sense of accomplishment (and lets admit, cleverness) is beyond satisfying.\n\nCons? Well, my top recommendation is to disable physx. That is basically the killer of the game. It can cause severe (and I mean SEVERE) frame issues and lag, even going as far as crashing your game.\nI'd also recommend avoiding confrontation when faced against many cops or snipers (oh how I despise those snipers).\n\nOh and, you'll find out what I mean when I say that you should probably RUN FOR YOUR LIFE when you're being chased by your shadows (or runner's shadows, not quite a spoiler. As you probably don't have a clue of what I'm taking about).\n\nIf you're having problems in deciding if the game is worth it or not, I guarantee it, if you love parkour and stunning visuals, go for it. I'd also recommend it so you get to know the origin of Mirror's Edge (as the second one will be coming out eventually).\n\nWhat are you waiting for, buy the game!","March 7, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has an art style that really struggles to be beaten for something that was made in the Unreal 3 Engine. This is probably due to the fact that DICE developed their own lighting system for the game. The vibrant colours and cleancut city really made the game stand out in an era of brown and grey "realism".\n\nThe freerunning itself is often let down by clunky controls and "that was crap, I pressed that" moments, but if you get it right and can make the freerunning flow it really does make the game and you can get a lot out of the time trial missions.\n\nThe gunplay is pretty much non-existant and I would highly recommend a no guns playthrough in order to really get the runner feeling.","May 20, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's simply exhilarating and incredibly satisfying to pull off a series of jumps, wall runs, vaults off roof-tops, and jump kick an ememy all in one cohesive, reflex-dependant motion.

I really like this first person runner style, where the empahsis is moving through the levels rather than fighting opponents.  There is some combat, but at least sometimes I think you can avoid it.  I enjoyed the way you move through the city (when I wasn't falling and dying), which can give some cool views, and the story that tied things together was interesting.  There's some replay value, too, since the game includes story, race, and time trial modes.  More automatic save points in the game would have been nice, because sometimes I'd lose progress when I stopped playing.  Some parts got repetitive as I tried over and over to pass them, but that's kind of the nature of games like this.  It wasn't too frustrating (on easy) though, since after I while I could learn the general patterns and improve how I played through those parts.  Overall, I thought this was a good game, enjoyable to play, so if it sounds interesting to you, I'd recommend getting it and giving it a try.","April 21, 2013","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Really well implemented control system and environment. A little bit let down in the combat aspects, I wish they'd have just removed those sections and let the game be just platform, but I guess they wanted more mass market appeal with the shooting sections, yet they evidently didn't have enough time to develop that type of gameplay fully.\n\nOverall a decent game, and worth getting because it's different from the norm. Some frustrating parts, but the game is reasonably easy, main campaign takes about 4 hours to complete, so pick it up in a sale to maximize your money spent for game played.

Not at first, no. It took a while to like it. My main problem with it? Nvidia.\n\nPhysX is awful. Its broken. It doesn't work. I spent the longest time trying to get the game to stop lagging and to stop screen-tearing. I gave up for a couple months, and eventually came back. This time I figured out what was wrong. It was PhysX. So I enabled v-sync and disabled PhysX. BAM, suddenly the game runs perfectly.\n\nBUT when you finally get into the game, its great. The running is a bit awkward, parts of the running and stuff seem unrealistic, however on the whole, its pretty awesome. You get to run around and jump and vault and wall-run and more.\n\nWhat I wish they'd fix is the combat. Its okay, I guess, but when you're trying to disarm, its a 50/50 for whether you can actually do it. Most of the time you're a split-second late or early, and the soldier kills you. You can take a few shots, but it gets to the point later in the game where you're getting killed what seems to be WAY too easily, compared to earlier in the game.\n\nThe story is great if you're paying attention. It could be a lot better, they should have revealed more about what happened to the City and how its come to this awful state its in now, but instead they set all the focus on saving Kate. Its not bad, because its still a pretty great story, but it could be better and more indepth. I figure Mirror's Edge 2 (if it ever gets released, and if DICE doesn't ♥♥♥♥ it up) will have all that backstory.","April 29, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This city has an achevement of having a totalitarian regime and monitors all communication and controls the media. Before events in the game there was a protest against their rule.\n\nThe protagonist in this game is Faith a runner , a courier who carries uncensored news around the city. Faith's parents were killed in the protest when she was young leaving her with only her sister.\n\nThe mechanics in this game are decent. Sometimes when playing Faith woulden't grab on a ledge or do the action I wanted her to do. The shooting in this game are just bad... instead of shooting an assault rifle I thought I was shooting a Nerf gun and the shotguns seem to blow your enemies away (literally).\n\nThe core gameplay is extremely immersive, fun, replayable and had a nice flow to it. With beautiful visuals and somewhat challenging levels make this game extremely amusing. The level design was just the thought of "Oh! that's convienent!" where someone would park their tall van right outside the fence i had to climb around. Next, this game has no implementation of stealth (which would be cool) for example, I would silently get into a building when all the sudden an alarm would go off or I would get a messege saying "the blues (cops) are all over you!" and this was very frustrating.\n\nThe art style is interesting. Everything is white with pops of color in different places and I found this pretty cool.\n\nPROS:\nfun, replayable gameplay with a nice flow\nvery immersive\nbeautiful art style\nsomewhat good parkour mechanics\n\nCONS:\nterrible shooting mechanics\nconfusing story\nno stealth implementation\n\nOverall, this an awesome game.

Let me tell you, I have only (At the time of me writing this review) played about 25 minutes. Already love this game. FIrst off, I was happy how my crappy PC ran this game so smoothly, Secondly, I LOVE How your character Faith Feels, her movements are so fluid, like water, so agile and graceful. I freaking LOVE IT. And it needs to be all these things in order to play the game. The game it'self is more of a puzle game slightly portal-esque, Minus portal, Why it reminds me of portal is because it uses the enviroment as the puzzles, I freaking love that. There are so many ways to move, like making yourself smaller in mid air so you can hop over barbed wire fences, Zipline, slide, climb, shimmy, sidestep, wall ride, roll to save yourself from taking damage. You literally FEEL LIKE A RUNNER. You feel like a legitimate bada$$. I highly recommend this game, even if you may have a slightly laggy computer, this game will run beautifully for you. SOOOO worth the money, even though I got this game on sale for 5 bucks, It's sooo worth more!

I've never played anything quite like it. In fact, I'd like to say that Mirror's Edge is the best first-person parkour game I've ever played, but it's also the only first-person parkour game I've ever played. You know what? To hell with it. Mirror's Edge is the best first-person yada yada I've ever played, there you go. This game is something special and the experience of playing it, in spite of a few noteworthy imperfections, is awesome.\n\nThe story takes place in a large sterile looking city where The Man has established a typical sort of Orwellian society with all the usual tropes therein. Granted, this is only really explained to you through flash animation-esque cutscenes, and never really explicitly shown. There are police here, like anywhere else, and you do have to avoid and occasionally fight them, but other than that, the air of oppression that they speak of is never really conveyed through the gameplay. All I see here is a society where the cops just really don't like you running around on the roof. The plot revolves around a conspiracy and, like many conspiracies, certain details don't really add up. Expecting a tight cohesive story out of this game is probably not something you should do.\n\nYou play as Faith, a professional courier who conveys senstive items and information about the city via the art of parkour, flipping and jumping about far above the streets where the ubiquitous eye of big brother is ever watchful. Faith is an alright character. All those people who think video games are sexist might actually be okay with her. She's resourceful and athletic and determined and she also has normal sized cans, so women with average proportions don't have to be jealou- I mean, outraged at what a bunch of pigs the men who made this game are. She's also Asian, so if you're a creme colored frat boy with a weird fetish where you want to control a woman of the orient and make her do your chores and bear your children, this game is for you. I actually knew a guy in college who was like that. He constantly tried to make his American-born Vietnamese girlfriend come over and do his laundry. That relationship didn't last long. And no, he wasn't me. But I digress. Faith never does any of that, really. She's more of a sprint-up-the-wall-and-occasionally-murder-a-police-officer kind of chick.\n\nAs far as the parkour in this game is concerned, the gameplay is fluid, intuitive, and uniquely excellent in its execution. The runners of the game, "runner" being the name prescribed to those of Faith's ilk, often expound upon the virtues of "flow," which I guess is sort of like the Force for these guys. It's the essence of what keeps their ninja mojo a goin'. This game actually has that: flow. Once you get over a moderately steep learning curve, you really develop a sort of intuitive feel for how to play this game well. It's pretty cool. The only downside is you might also start to feel a little ashamed of sitting in front of a computer for hours, pretending to be an extremely athletic person by pressing a series of buttons.\n\nWhat is a little lacking in Mirror's Edge is it's combat system. This is usually easy to forgive as combat is something best avoided 95% of the time. You are a runner, after all. However, you do have to engage in hand to hand combat and wield a gun occasionally. For lack of a better term/brain, the best way I can describe combat here is as "woogity," or maybe "rickety." You could even say its a little "finicky," or perhaps "mercurial." I guess what I'm trying to say is it feels pretty unnatural and inconsistant. It's basically the exact opposite of, well, everything else involved in playing this game. But that's okay, it's more or less functional and there's a good chance if you've decided to get into a gun fight, you should actually be running away anyway.\n\nOne more thing, the atmosphere in Mirror's Edge is pretty cool. The people who made this thing did a whole lot with not very much as far as graphics are concerned. It's got a sort of over exposed, white washed, ultra clean sort of style, with lots of post modern angles and a stark ultilitarian urban sensibility or something. I should also add that the music is, like, real chill, bra. I mean, its nice, I really do like it. Sort of a nice mellow electronic thing going on there.\n\nAlright, so anyway, clearly I have too much time on my hands and IGN needs to hire me. Play this game, you won't regret it. You'll be hoping the sequel actually happens.","September 18, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A sensação de velocidade e de liberdade é o que torna este jogo viciante e permite esquecer a história com algumas lacunas. Os cutscenes também merecem destaque, por se demarcarem dos gráficos (bastante bons) do jogo e apostarem numa vertente mais banda-desenhada que acaba por funcionar bem após o choque inicial.\n\nNo fundo, é um jogo de puzzles e perícia.

This is the thing this game was made for. Faith runs like a dream, and there's nothing more satisfying than flying across rooftops and making those jumps that would probably break a normal person's legs. When this game is going fast, it's great.\n\nSecond: the combat. Where do I even start with this? First of all, the game encourages you to avoid combat as often as possible. After all, you're playing a fragile speedster, so when it comes to fight or flight, flight is the better option. That being said, the game often doesnt LET you avoid combat. There'll be too many people shooting at you, and even with all your running and ducking and dodging chances are you'll be gunned down in seconds. And again, you're a fragile speedster, emphasis on the fragile part. You can't take very many hits. So when running isn't an option (even though the game will remind you that you SHOULDN'T be fighting), the only other choice you have is to fight. So what's the problem with fighting? Try: most everything. The timing for disarming someone is absurdly anal (and chances are while you're doing that someone else will be shooting you in the back), the timing for striking is anal (most often they'll just block and you'll be knocked back instead), and the controls for attacking someone while moving are awkward. If you engage in hand to hand, expect to have to repeat a segment over, and over, and over.\n\nIn other words, every time combat happens, the game comes to a grinding halt. The point of the game is to be going fast and getting from place to place quickly and adeptly, but this becomes impossible when you have to slow down to fight 10 heavily armed guards that just rushed you and cut off the only escape route that doesn't end with a sickening *splat* sound. Combat completely throws off the pacing. The game tries to make the combat faster paced by causing the action to start the moment you enter a room, but this leaves no window of time for you to adjust to the surroundings. I get that part of the game is being able to react and choose routes quickly and everything, but there's only so fast a human can react before they get shot.\n\n(And I'll add here that you could just grab a gun and use that, but there's this little notice on the pause menu that tracks if you've shot anyone yet, and though I haven't finished the game yet, I can figure it'll be important. If this doesn't bother you, go for it. The game's great.)\n\nFor all my complaining, though, I really do like this game and would recommend it, or at least the parkour parts. The combat system is poorly managed (and IMO doesn't belong in this type of game), but it isn't impossible, just incredibly frustrating. My grievances with the combat system are meant to be more of a forewarning than a dissuasion. Mechanics aside, the story, art, and voicing are fantastic, so design in that sense is solid.\n\nTL:DR; play it, it's great, but either brace yourself for grueling combat sequences or stuff your morality and use a gun.","February 1, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals and soundtrack are great, but don't ever attempt to gunfight, it really wasn't made with that in mind, in fact forget about combat, the real challenge is to actually avoid enemies, being creative with the path you walk into.

You have to turn the PhysX modulator off, then you can breakthrough glass with no lag. The parkour in this game in amazingly done and very fluent. The disarming tricks are awesome, and it is also cool how you can pick up the dropped guns. The story is amazing, and I finally got to do some of the things that I have always wanted to do...

The one part about the game I couldnt get enough of is the graphics; this game's graphics still hold of with games today. the next part about the game that I enjoyed was the movement, which is the base of this game, there were many parts of the game that looked very fluent and there are many ays to get through the level. Now the only bad part of the game that I personally did not like; The game is incredibly short and if you play it in one sitting you will be occupied for 4 maybe 5 hours before it is complete.

Sometimes the combat was frustrating and rarely did the freerunning aspect of the game feel clunky, but overall, kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of these guys in this BEAUTIFUL environment was very enjoyable. It's another unique take on what a first person puzzle game should be. The artsy cutscenes told a good story along with the commentary from Merc, ending the game in kind of a cliffhanger.\nOverall, the story could have been a bit longer, they could work out a few kinks in the combat system, they could allow for a bit more freedom in each level, but all in all it's a solid 8/10.\nI really hope the sequel is what AC2 was to the original Assassin's Creed.","March 28, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a little difficult to get used to at first, but this game proves that first person parkour is actually possible. The only thing I think it's missing is some sort of progression system similar to Farcry 3 where you either level up or just earn different techniques that can be used in combat or the parkour. But that's just a little thing I hope they improve on for th sequel. 8.5/10","March 29, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
