You missed probably the best Diablo-clone out there. That's why fans where so dissapointed about Sacred 3 release. But we are reviewing the original game, so here we are.\n\nSacred Gold is a lassic action RPG where you slash and loot and slash and loot and slash and loot and take some random quests in between. Steam edition includes every single patch ever released, including some Sacred Plus stuff and Underworld campaign. Also the latest 2.28 patch removed the Starforce DRM, which is awesome.\n\nThe map is huge, the area you'll uncover in an hour will only take 1% of the whole map. Since this game is actionly 2D, you might think the graphics are way off and the screenshots here might prove it, but it's just steam stretching, cutting and smoothing the image. If you click it, you'll see it's more sharp and actually has some HUD. Also, all screenshots here present the massive close up on the character. While it was the issue back in 2004, I think the developers added the option to zoom out way farther with some patch, so now you can actually see stuff around. The only problem is that the game is locked on the low 4:3 resolution and never was patched for the wide screens, but it doesn't really feel so bad as in some other games. However, having 1080p and actual smoothing would be nice...\n\nThe official online servers are down, but you still can play this via Tunngle or another LAN emulator. You might face a certain issue with error 10026 which is not explained anywhere, but in the tutorial I posted here on Steam. Check it out if you'll ever face this issue.","August 31, 2015","true","46.7"," 62 of 66 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","62","66","2","0"

However, the art style is pretty nice and the spell animations are still quite beautiful. This game needs a remastered version! 5/10\n\nStory: I don't expect much of a story from this kind of game and I don't receive it, this is definitely what you neither should want the game to give to you. There is a story and the characters are likeable, at least the devs tried and got you some funny dialogues, always a goal in mind and, admittedly, even twists. It's better than in Torchlight 2 for example. 5/10\n\nGameplay: Rather slow-paced hack'n'slay, compared to Diablo and Torchlight. The characters can be handled comfortably while sometimes the menus feel clumsy and outdated. Combat is fun, especially when you try out the many types of weapons and sorts of magic. The flow of the game is very good all in all, and with character progression and tons of loot you got to try out various play styles in a single play-through. 8/10\n\nCharacter classes: Eight unique classes (two from the expansion) that feel and behave very distinctively. The war/combat-mage-hybrid is arguably the most fun character class in video game history when it comes to preset ones. Even then, there is a lot of customization to be done, skills to experiment with and tactics (especially in later new game plus). The balance has no flaws, in my experience, and you just wanna try out every character with every single play style. 10/10\n\nComplexity: This game is deep, even deeper than your first play-throughs will make you think. New game plus holds a bunch of surprises later in the game and weapons and skill runes work together in a perfectly balanced and intriguing system, though the game is not hard to learn. You get into it and discover what it has to offer over time. Equip sets, customization, smart combining of equip and skills, varied enemies that need different approaches to be defeated, lots of secrets, skilling needs to be thought through thoroughly unless you wanna be smitten later in the game...\nThe game is as complex as one would expect from a good RPG with focus on looting and leveling. 10/10\n\nWorld: The world is huge, diversified and has tons of secrets to show to an attentive adventurer. Monster types are far from being copy-paste and the art style is nice, as mentioned somewhere above. The problem is that it might become a repetitive experience in later play-throughs, without level-generation (- except from the highest difficulty mode that holds surprises, as I also said earlier on.) The settlements and castles deserve to be emphasised when I talk about the world, they are big, you can enter every building and they are full of stuff to do and see. Also, the world isn't vast at all. In Torchlight, for instance, I miss a huge map showing me the land that I shall care about and defend. 9/10\n\nQuests: Several quests are humorous and most of them are nicely written. Unfortunately, there is much stuff to be fetched, quests just lead to new areas and actually earn you very juicy rewards. There's quite a lot of quests to do, you can just do them on the run and have a good grin here and there when you track down someone's rabbit or speak to the "more simple" folks. Sometimes you make decisions. 7/10 in a game of this genre.\n\nPrice: 10 $ or 2.50 $ on sale, pretty good deal.\n\nReplayability: I bet you won't discover everything there is to see in the game during your first play-through, or in the second, or third. At least you will want to try out different character classes and/or play styles. Expect the game to let you grind monsters for a couple of minutes here and there in new game plus, that can be a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• if you're out for the best set equip. My 26 hours on Steam so far have been one play-through of the first campaign as an experienced player for nostalgic reasons (and trying to get the multiplayer to work), I could leave out a lot of stuff I didn't want to do for the tenth time. You can easily waste one hundred hours or more in this game - on one high-level character, that is. In later play-throughs, your equip and skills still really advance fast and give you the feel of becoming more and more powerful even after countless hours. 8/10\n\nMultiplayer: Online is dead. You can get it to work on LAN, however, up to four players if I recall it correctly. It then works absolutely fine, but it's not comfortable to set up. 1/10\n\nThis game is the best of its genre, in my humble opinion, and a cult classic. You should play it. I will ignore my listing and give it a 10/10. Alright, there IS nostalgia involved. The metascore of 74 is reasonable. Give it some points up if you like this type of game and have fun in a game that is rather generic fantasy but excels by having great gameplay, complexity, character classes and an interesting open-world.","February 22, 2015","true","25.9"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","39","40","2","0"

Very simple and mindless, easy to learn, but with challenging bosses to randomly come across and lots of interesting monsters and quests.  Lovely and diverse landscapes and regions which are fun and rewarding to explore and a decent storyline and lore to uncover as you progress.  It's pretty cheesy sometimes and mechanics (if any lol) are very generic, occasional glitchs here and there, but I still really recommend it if you want something calm and slow paced.  I can play for hours and be perfectly content, definitely one of my favorites for it's simplicity.  :)","November 5, 2014","true","104.3"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","38","40","0","0"

Run it, and check '32 Bit Color Depth.' Otherwise, the game will default to run in a 16-Bit-Color-Depth mode, and will probably freeze during loading, or crash. Sacred Gold v2.28 ran on my 64-bit Win 8.1 and 64-bit Win 10. I did not use compatibility mode at all. However, the game frequently crashed, so I had to quicksave quite often...\n\n\nPros:\n+ Several characters to choose from, each with his/her distinctive advantages and drawbacks\n+ Replayability: characters start in different locations, have different backgrounds, and some different quests\n+ Numerous weapons, armour types, spells, items, and whatnot...\n+ Countless ways of developing your character during gameplay (by developing favourite skills, attributes, and combat arts, as well as modifying properties of your armour and weapons...)\n+ You can create combos\n+ In addition to the traditional swords and bows, there are firearms, muskets, and mines...\n+ There is a huge area to explore\n+ There are a great number of quests\n+ There are portals to facilitate travel between distant areas\n\n\nCons:\n- You only play as one character and can't create a permanent team. Sometimes an NPC may join you, but only temporarily, and you can neither control him/her nor have access to his/her inventory\n- Monster respawning can sometimes be a real pain in the neck... There's too many of them, too often...\n- The manual doesn't explain some aspects of the game well. Before you commit yourself to playing the game seriously, it's a good idea to read some extra information on how things work and how to develop your character on the Sacred wiki or find some good forums\n- Although the expansions - e.g. Sacred Underworld - introduce some interesting areas and quests, my overal impression was that they were worse thought out than the base game, with fewer good-quality quests or areas\n- A few quests broke becasue I accidentally started them "from the end," e.g. I found an item at the beginning before a quest was officially initialised; then, when the quest officially started and I was supposed to find the item, the game acted as if I had not found it, even though I already had it. The result was I couldn't finish the quest. However, I experienced very few quests like that (2 or perhaps 3...)\n- Remember that it's a 2005 game, so graphics are a little dated\n\n\nTo conclude, despite a few problems, it's a solid RPG worth getting and spending hours of your life playing it.","November 18, 2015","true","147.4"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","39","42","0","1"

It might come off as a bit archaic initially, and it certainly has its quirks, but the world is still as massive and open and with all its countless side quests, secret caves and hidden treasures still as much fun to explore as I remembered. Ultimately, it's an incredibly addictive experience that'll keep completionists occupied for a very long time.","June 17, 2015","true","36.0"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","34","37","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fidansenova/recommended/12320/","fidansenova","Pianticella","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fidansenova/","175 products in account","I used to play Sacred roughly 10 years ago, before the expansion pack or Sacred Gold even came out. I was absolutely in love with it, and spent ages playing.\n\nThe world of Ancaria always had a special place in my heart, so I decided to buy it again now and get back into it.\n\nIt is true that getting it to start on Win 8.1 needs some arrangement, but this is fairly easy and you can do it in about 15 minutes maximum. (The description will be at the end of this review.)\n\nNow, on to the game:\n\nWhen looking at this game, we need to remember that it's a decade old. Even with that in mind, it is still much better than some RPGs that they put out today.\n\nThere are 8 characters that you can use: Gladiator, Seraphim, Wood Elf, Battle Mage, Dark Elf, Vampiress and 2 that came with the Underworld expansion pack: Daemon and Dwarf.\nThey each have pros and cons, and various combat arts. I have played with all of them, my personal favourite is the Dark Elf. (I prefer a more aggressive approach, no shields or two handed weapons, instead dual wielding+poison+fast attacks and traps)\n\nThe map is huge and there are various kinds of lands to discover. (Tundra, desert, forest, underworld etc.) There are portals throughout the map to help you navigate more easily.\n\nThere are tons of missions, named and unnamed sidequests which will occupy completionists for a long time.\n\nThere are 5 difficulty levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Niobium) The ones after silver only become available if you completed the game with the previous difficulty level. Advancing through the levels is necessary to face some real challanges, especially after you character is moderately leveled.\n\nThe level cap is high (216, if I'm not mistaken) which means you can finetune your character as you wish.\n\nThere is A LOT of loot, which is both a good and bad thing, as it can be overwhelming. I personally find having all these options very entertaining. There are set items, which if you wear together gives you really good bonuses.\n\nYou get to have companions throughout the game (some immortal, some can die) and although they are not usually very strong, they still provide some support.\n\nYou get to have a horse. I love games that gives me access to animals. (Also the Vampiress has a wolf and 2 bats) The horses have many different stats, the most important one being speed. Also, they can ram opponnents, which is useful especially if you are cornered while on horseback. Mounted combat is also an option.\n\nThe characters have many spoken lines (Which is important in my opinion, for example Dragon Age: Origins -another game I really like- only has a couple of lines for the player controlled character, which get really boring to hear after a while "Can I get you a ladder, so you can get off my back?" Ugh.)\n\nThere are TONS of pop culture references all over the world. I strongly recommend going grave-robbing.\n\nI have found 3 easter eggs by myself, and have read about others. So go exploring off the beaten track.\n\nThe graphics are not the best, but considering how old the game is, I think it's pretty good. It's enjoyable.\nOverall: The game has interesting characters, huge world and mythology to discover, entertaining sidequests and storylines, good leveling mechanic and a lot of items to work with. I bought the game on a sale, but I still think it deserves the price it has now.\n\nDon't bother with any other Sacred games though, this one is the best. It all goes downhill from here.\n\nAnd here is the Windows 8.1 guide, ask if you need help with any of the steps.[/b]\n\nUpdate your graphic card drivers.\nGo to the Local Files of the game.\n(Right click the game in your library, click properties, then local files, then browse local files)\nThere are 4 exe files there (config, game server, sacred, testapp). Change all of their settings so that they Run as Administrator always, and that they run in compatibility mode to Win 7.\nClick the "config.exe" and select "32-bit" and "video compatibility mode" They need to be checked.\nEnjoy the game!\nAt first the game didn't run for me, and after that I had a graphics glitch. They were both fixed by these steps. There are some alternatives, ask if you wish.","October 15, 2015","true","51.3"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","1"

That's right, I never played Diablo at the time even though I'm old enough to should have been doing that back then. But somehow I skipped it and it was this game that taught me what I was missing out on, and then some. Highly addictive gameplay, appealing graphics (there is something about the grittiness of Sacred 1 that I really prefer to its smoothed out successor), badly voiced but fun characters. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time may provide some challenge, especially early on if you want to advance too far too soon.\n\nThe skill progression is simple yet diverse. The difference in skills and weapon use are well implemented; each character does feel unique. After finishing the main Ancaria campaign (which took ages since I felt I had to explore every inch of the map)  I must admit I didn't have much interest left to complete the Underworld campaign. To me it didn't feel as a real part of the game, both storywise and mapwise. But I do love the two extra characters, they are both my favorites to use. The demon's spells are interesting to play around with (more then just your common fire ball, you'll need the battle mage for that kind of work) and the dwarfs cannon gun and use of mines is quite satisfying.\n\nI like both Sacred and Sacred 2, but this is the game that will remain somewhat special to me. Even though by now I do understand what Diablo (1 & 2) is all about. So yes, of course I would recommend this game, play it!","December 9, 2013","true","7.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/12320/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Creeping slowly and stealthily under the shadows of many contemporary upcoming games, Sacred never really generated much media hype prior to its release. What we have on our hands here, folks, is an action RPG coming from European development team at Ascaron Entertainment. Sacred uses the all too familiar design pattern long-establish by Blizzard's original Diablo. Basically, you have your average heroic fantasy tale, an ultimate evil unleashed by a dim-witted wizard, tons of monsters to mow down, and plenty of quests. More than anything else, this game focuses on character development and classic hack'n'slash gameplay. Still, you will find a bit more than that, so I'd advise you to read on.\n\nComing up with a decent and innovative fantasy-style storytelling is definitely a difficult task these days. So, in all honesty, it would be deceitful to claim Sacred entails an exciting plot. Players are presented a rather basic and straightforward fantasy-themed storyline. The introduction sequence offers precious little to let you know exactly what the hell is going on. An evil wizard Shaddar summons an ancient evil and unleashes its devastating powers upon the Kingdom of Ancaria. Someone, naturally, has to put a stop to the chaos and disarray engulfing the unfortunate inhabitants of Ancaria. The first couple of quests won't reveal much of the story either, I'm afraid. In other words, it's actually pointless to seek some deeper meaning in the narrative since it remains somewhat scarce and incomplete throughout most of the game. But, believe it or not, the omission of a profound tale never appeared to bother me much during gameplay, given that all my attention was directed towards tearing monsters apart and leveling up my character. There were also some surprising moments of humor in the game. Opening graves and crypts, for instance, prompts amusing lines like, "In memory of all the monsters we have killed for experience points." The developers weren't too lazy to throw in a little something for Lord of the Rings fans. A certain stone ruin marked the following words: "Et Earello Endorenna utulien..." - for those of you who watched Return of the King, this is the beginning of the verse Aragorn sang at the end of the movie. This has nothing to do with the game, but it's still a nice and fun touch for all fantasy fans.\n\nAt the beginning all you have to do is select one of the six available characters: a robust sandal-wearing Gladiator, a mysterious Battle mage, a sharp-witted and sinister Dark Elf, a light-hearted and valiant Wood Elf, a charismatic Seraphim, the tempting Vampiress, and the dark yet sultry Daemon. Each class concentrates on a unique combat style, either through magic and ranged attacks, or via melee attacks. The Gladiator, Battlemage, Dark Elf, and Wood Elf, offer a pretty standard range of abilities and skills we've already experienced in games like Neverwinter Nights, Diablo, Dungeon Siege, and so on. The Seraphim, Vampiress, and Daemon however, involve a few pleasing novelties combined with classic RPG character advancement. Although I was pleased with the statistics and overall appearance of all races, I somehow felt drawn towards the incredibly alluring Vampiress (what can I say, I just cannot contain my bloodlust anymore). Also, I got a bit fed up with spells, bows, and throwing knives, so this was just right... for me anyways. I'm sure all of you will find what you're looking for in other character classes, since they're all quite suitable for various styles of play.\n\nI think most RPG fans would be interested to know more about the regions of Sacred. The most commendable aspect of the game is the elimination of loading areas. Up to 70 % of the existing world map is accessible at the beginning of the campaign which comes as most appreciated gameplay element and allows players to choose multiple paths towards their primary destination. Another helpful addition is the world map which specifies exactly where your character can locate blacksmiths, merchants, etc. Additionally, each initiated quest is highlighted on the map, so there's no chance of getting lost even if you wanted to. There are many helpful additions to the gameplay. Each town, for example, features a chest in the center where low-level characters may lay down extra items which can be used later on during the game. If you find a ring, sword, or any other item you don't have enough experience to handle, just store it in one town and then pick it up in the next when you've leveled up the character. The journey between the towns should give you enough experience points so you can upgrade to the next level.\n\nUsing the interface and inventory system should be a piece of cake for any gamer. Everything ran smoothly - upgrading general skills and specific combat abilities can be done quite easily, which also goes for exchanging items, upgrading weapons and armor, etc. As for the controls, about 80% of the game boils down to mouse-clicking (well, as you'd expect it from any Diablo style RPG).\n\nApart from solving quests and slashing your way through swarms of goblins, orcs, gargoyles, thieves, assassins, and other baddies, the game will have you concentrating on using the most out of your character's capabilities. Beefing up armor and weapons is not the only thing you get to do. There's also an intuitively designed combat system at work, involving special moves, combos, and so on. Another appropriate moment in combat is the addition of horseback riding. Characters can purchase various breeds of horses which in turn helps them get around a lot quicker and gives them leverage during combat (provided they advanced the right skill).\n\nVisually, Sacred boasts a pleasing mix of 2D landscapes and fully modeled 3D characters and creatures. Even though the backdrops appear slightly outdated, especially when you zoom in, there's a pleasing amount of nicely drawn out details, such as trees, flowerbeds, bushes, and so on. Water surfaces look cool as well, and there's a whole choice of impressive and colorful spells to see. The camera allows you to zoom in on the action at any given time... even then the models appeared to show a meticulous approach in design and animation.\n\nThe game's audio is quite good. Gamers will be immersed the whole time thanks to a jumble of realistic ambient noises and a range of sweet tunes. The voiceovers are okay, but there's really not much to involve you there I'm afraid. Everything else seems to be in place.\n\nIf you decide to purchase this game, you won't regret it. There are no breakthroughs in terms of general design involved, but the open-ended gameplay and an admirably lengthy single-player campaign is enough to the fancy of any gamer. If we disregard the relatively weak plotline, this is really an enjoyable RPG experience with enough content and replayability to keep you occupied for days. Plus, this is one of those rare games I feel the incentive to play again after I'm done with the review...\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 29, 2014","true","19.1"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","27","40","0","1"

Well... both. It depends what you're looking for, though.\n\nSacred's an old game. Like reaaaaally old. This brings with it some issues, unfortunately. The game itself is good, but the problems may be off-putting, so let's cover the technical issues first as they can be a dealbreaker for many people given what they are.\n\n\nFirst off, Sacred is hard-coded to be 1024x768 resolution; this means that, under normal circumstances, it will fill a 4:3 square on a widescreen monitor with large black boarders on the sides. There are a few workarounds, but the largely involve forcing it to stretch out the horizontal which makes everything look remarkably fat. This also means that the resolution can't normally be increased, and it won't get prettier or fit more stuff on the screen.\n\nThe second major issue is that multiplayer is not naturally supported by steam, steam does not give out CD-keys when you buy the game, and it's irrelevant anyway because the servers for the game are down regardless. Hamachi, Gameranger, and most other options will flat out not work. Evolve, found at evolvehq.com, is the only one known to be able to run it (though some have reported that Hamachi can run it by changing some setting, but I don't speak german so have no idea what they changed). Evolve, however, can link itself to your steam account which... is a little unsettling. I didn't want to play sacred with friends quite THAT badly, so for me, it's stuck being a single player game.\n\n\n\nWith that out of the way, if you're still interested in the game despite the technical difficulties and problems with it being ancient, let me state that the game itself is actually quite good with nice gameplay elements.\n\nYes, it's old, and no, it won't be better than Path of Exile (which is free), but it has a certain charm and feel to it that makes it quite enjoyable. If you pick it up for $5 or under, it's probably worth the cost.\n\nA few major things:\n\n- There are quite a few different classes in the game (races, acutally...) and each get their own unique set of spells and melee attacks. They each play fairly differently, and have enough customization that each playthrough can potentially feel quite different even if playing the same class.\n\n- Skills are a bit odd in that you don't get access to all skills; each class begins with two skills and get a number of new skills unlocked at levels 1, 3, 6, 12, 20, 30 and 50. Interestingly enough, you just get to PICK a new skill at these levels (starting at 3) but have more options than you can choose from, so you customize your character each time you play. This means you can have a melee mage or a fire mage or a mage that specializes in a wide range of elements or one that spams out a small number of choice spells more often, one which autoattacks, or one which utilizes combo attacks as their primary method of damage, or even one which tanks (well, alright, not so much a tank mage =P ). The point is, you get some pretty good customization so two players can both pick to be the seraphim and play her entirely differently and not step on each other's toes. Assuming you get the multiplayer to work from the earlier issue. *Cough*\n\n- Mounts exist in the game and you can ride a horse. In fact, you can even learn mounted combat, use your horse to charge over people, or teach it to run faster. It's kind of a neat system, but isn't really explored too much, yet moreso than probably any other game of the genre.\n\n- Combat's pretty fluid, enemies have easy to see radial healthbars around their feet which indicate their relative difficulty, level and remaining health clearly. You can highlight items on the ground as well, which is handy. It's especially fun to bounce around the battlefield unleashing multihit combos and seeing your character do more than just overhand swing 5x in a row, but instead actually use a variety of strikes from different angles, and some will even perform acrobatic attacks, backflips, and so on.\n\n- The storyline's not the best the world has ever seen, but it's certainly not awful, and by diablo-style dungeon crawlers, it's way above average. There's actual reasons for going through the various quests, the world opens up in a reasonable manner as you complete them, bosses tend to make you want to slap them good and hard before you even fight them... generally it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do.\n\n- The spells in the game are pretty varied, and the characters do distinctly feel different from one another, even if they have a similar role. Sure, the vampiress and daemon are both female melee characters, yet the vampiress gets to change between a knight form and vampire form, preferring physical or magical abilities in nature, can summon wolves and bats to help her, drain health and so on. The daemoness, in contrast, gets things like the ability to fly over terrain, attach elemental properties to her weapons, fling fireballs and enact creepy japanese hentai tentacle porn scenes with dead bodies. No, I am not making that up, and my nightmares would prefer that I were. Alright, they're not nightmares. >.>;;\n\n- Individual classes have different item slots available to them. Most of them tend to share similar gear, though there are a few bits which are very specific to certain classes, such as say... the iconic seraphim's wings.\n\n- Money MEANS something. Zoh. Mah. Gerd. Know how in Diablo 2 and such, you'd get huge stockpiles of gold that were worthless? Or most any other diablo-style game? Yeah, turns out that you can actually buy uniques and set items off of vendors. In fact, if you get the skill for it (sacrificing a combat skill...) some classes can even actually increase the quality of stuff that merchants will sell (along with reducing the cost of such, and increasing the sale price of vendor trash, yay!), making it actually reasonable to build a set to some degree and not feel like your gold is worthless.\n\n- Big bosses. If you fight a dragon, you know bloody well you're fighting a dragon because it tends to not exactly fit on the screen. There's things like "don't stand in the fire" on bosses as well, stuff that needs to be dodged and so on. As in things that you didn't actually see until much later games for the most part. Sacred's not quite as great as a modern game, but compared to anything else from it's timeframe, it was quite a few years ahead of it's time in this regard.\n\n\n\nOverall, it's dated. Sacred has low graphics, major technological problems, and some real massive flaws to it... but compared to other games of it's time, I'd honestly recommend it and say it's quite a lot better than it had any real right of being. It's enjoyable for awhile, and worth a good $5 or so. As of the moment of this review, it's on for $2.49, and for the single player game, I'd say it's well worth the cost. It probably won't be a regretable purchase, as it's really not that bad and does a lot of good things that even many of the modern diabloesque games fail to live up to.\n\nIf you ever want to go down a trip on nostalgia lane and play diablo 1 for some reason (I get that every few years myself =P ) I'd honestly recommend playing Sacred for your binge this time around. It's the better game of the two in large part, and has some really attractive features to it. It has some nuisances as well, but hey, it's old, give it a break. NO! NOT THE HIP!

The 8 different characters all play completely unique and allowing for a huge amount of different builds.\n\nA special recommendation to german players, as this is the original language and the game absolutely shines. Brillant voice-acting of the characters (Willis' german voice etc.) and awesome dialogues.\n\nStill a solid 7/10, 7 because of obvious lacks in comparison to more recent games.","September 26, 2014","true","27.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

So, as people say that Sacred is the best clone of Diablo I would agree. Sacred doesn't have them dungeons and tunnels with limited open spaces everywhere; it's an open map, free to explore, a lot more to explore if one sticks only to the main quest, comparing to Diablo. So it's a different type of gaming experience. A lot of easter eggs in game (proporcional to the ammount of bugs, but the final version here in steam is quite good) which makes You wanna explore the map, find all the side quests.. Most quests are like "kill this thing", "bring that thing", but there also interesting ones and You have to look for them - that's the fun here.

Atmospheric sound effects and voice acting are good.  The graphics are sufficiently detailed not to look dated.  Quests are non-linear, but some quest hubs will require backtracking to grind the odd extra level or two.  There are a good variety of characters to choose from.  Some weapons and armour are class specific.  Certain weapons and armour can be crafted, enhanced or customized.  The skill tree is interesting and offers many specialization choices while forcing trade-off decisions.  The map is a lot larger than it appears to be at first glance, which should become evident some hours into the game.  Mobs and bosses have good AI and will sometimes flee when injured.  Often pursuing a fleeing imp draws you into line of sight of additional mobs.  Overall the game is enjoyable and can keep a player engrossed for many hours.  Challenge and difficulty scale moderately so that one's character never feels insanely over-powered or unfairly overwhelmed.  Sacred is one of the games that slipped under the radar because Diablo 2 was the de-facto standard in the genre.  This game is really good and it is a pity so many players never noticed it.","December 31, 2013","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'll throw it in the Diablo category but saying it's better than D2/LOD is more of a preference than fact. Unlike Sacred 2: Fallen Angel (or D2 for that matter), it's not heavily focused on character builds. If anything it's pure dungeon crawling that's comparable to Titan Quest. I haven't finished it yet but 10 hours logged, I find it to be a great game.\n\nCan be a bit tricky getting it to work on Windows 7 though. Major negative with it is there's no option to change your resolution or many graphics settings (all the files are hardcoded, sadly). For all of you with widescreen monitors, you'll want to run this in a window. I have a quad core CPU and my framerate jumps between 25-40 but I'll say it's more of a OS compatibility issue, not directly hardware; even if you force XP Service Pack 2/3.

Sacred has a ton of quests, and divergent story lines for different classes, but it's not a very attractive game (in 2012), and the interface is really clumsy. the skills trees don't seem very well thought out.\n\nNewer ARPGs do everything that Sacred does, and do it better.

It was given free with a games magazine in my country that I was buying. So every month I would put the game in my pc and try it. Mostly it was games I wasn't interested in but one particular month they gave away this game. So I put it in and the rest was history. Countless hours played, countless heroes made, including a level 80 gladiator and a level 70 mage, this game was my favorite game of all time and is still on top 10. And although you might not give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about my favorite games of all times list you can't argue with the user reviews of this game.\n\nA game with a huge world with lots of different scenery including but not limited to: snowy mountains, forests, desert and even a volcano. Play with a variety of races and skills and get your chance to kill hords of different enemies. If you like hack n slash a-rpg you HAVE to try this. No other a-rpg has a fanasy world this beautifull (dispite the outdated graphics) with this much of it to explore. The dragon hunting in this game is real! 10 dragons for you to find, hunt and kill. No other game has made me so eager to go exploring. Just go and explore. See things, places, small villages in the mountains or big cities, rivers and even an aabandoned city in the desert.\n\nI was told it works in windows 7 so if you have windows 7 and you like hack n slash a rpg buy this game.\n\nWARNING: In windows 8/8.1 you can only play it in window mode it doesn't work in fullscreen and it's probably the same for windows 10 although I haven't tried.\n\nedit: Ok I tried it and it works! At first it started crashing but if you find config.exe in the game files and run it I have these settings:\n\nFullscreen yes\nPlay movies yes\n32 bit color depth yes\nall the other no\nsound yes\n\nWith those settings mine works fine\n\nedit 2: But I have noticed some issues.

You play in a free world - as in no loading sectors - and the map isn't a simple trail to follow. There are many side quests to do while working through the main story. Every NPC speaks and their stories for the quests are dynamic in that they say more than just the objective. There are many chests, barrels, boxes to open, every single building can be entered and explored, and nearly everything killed drops items with that chance of something super rare. The funnest part of the game is the randomness. There are many dragons out there and you never expect to find one when it happens. They tend to be hard to kill and are very rewarding when killed. The game is more addicting than Diablo 3 and Sacred 2, and deserves a better rating. I've been playing this game for two days straight and I haven't even made it through a quarter of the game. The graphics are very good because the style is well done. The architecture of all the buildings, trees, etc is amazing - props to the artists. I wouldn't just call this game a game, it is a work of art in design, story, and addictiveness. If I chose one game to die with this would be it. If I were to make one last wish before I died I'd wish for online multiplayer to come back and for more expansions for this game.  I don't care about the starving children in Africa, or global warming, or the unsustainable deforestation and water use, I want Sacred Gold to be reborn like the way Age of Empires II The Conquerors has been!","March 30, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But some fun stuff also.. you can ride horses! except that kinda eliminates a lot of fun abilities your character can do, which they can't do for some reason on horseback lol.

There's a lot of optimizing issues the game has currently, so you'll run into random lag spikes that last a moment, particularly when running full screen. However, when it came out, the graphics were wonderful, and the animations very satisfying (the spell animations still are satisfying, just dated). So, with the age of this game in mind, I was a little more lenient.    Gameplay  9  Sacred is a classic hack-and-slash, and you will enjoy every darn minute of it. With a huge open world to explore, you can sink hours and hours into exploring every nook and cranny. While not being randomly generated, as several games in this genre now are, you will still find yourself exploring everywhere you can, time and time again. With 7 different classes to choose from, each with a unique playstyle, you won't get tired of booting this one up over and over.    Story  5  The story eeks by just enough to drive the game forward, but other than that, you won't find yourself caring that much. However, keep in mind this game has a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, and treats its story as such. Thus, I give this on an even middle ground.    Multiplayer  7  Fantastic multiplayer, if you can get it to work. This would be a 10 if the darn thing worked well. Given the age of Sacred, it is a royal nightmare to get this one working correctly. But if you can manage to join a game together, you are in for one of the best times you've had gaming. (Due to the difficulty of joining multiplayer together, I have not included it in the overall score)    Replayability  8  With 7 classes, come 7 different playstyles, and a world large enough that you can just keep on going. I've owned this game since it game out, and I still find myself coming back to it over and over.I would come back even more if the multiplayer worked properly.    Overall  7.5/10  A long time favorite of mine, Sacred stands in a class of its own. I have plenty of fond memories playing this game with my Father and family over Christmas breaks. A lot of hack and slashers now and day are called Diablo-clones, but calling Sacred such a thing would do it a great injustice. With an expansive, sprawling world that puts Diablo to shame, and much more riveting gameplay, Sacred is not a game to be missed on any count. The multiplayer is outstanding and incredibly fun as you and your friends grow and battle in the world around you, saving it from the dark forces that are at play.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","December 11, 2010","true","5.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

This doesn't hinder the experience because the moment that the game opens up, and it does early on, you will pour hours into it.

When they added the expansion it made the game too easy imo. That being said the game is still awesomely fun and it is COOP too. I am not sure if they fixed the game but I had to disable my multi-processor function for the game to play and connect with my local LAN. In other words, it does not support multiple cores. Not when I played it before.\n\nSo let me add to my review:\nThe graphics are dated but still crisp and beautiful in their own way. The combat is pretty easy to get used after playing for a little while. Your finger may tire because you mouse click a lot in the game.The skill tree is good and balanced I think. You can go different ways with your characters but staying on par with your race is probably best. The expansion kind of beefed up the toons a bit imo and made the game lupy and much easier. If you can play the game without enabling or installing the expansion then do that first to get a feel for the difficulty of the game. Play it through that way and you will appreciate it more. Still a game worth buying for 9.99 or less for sure. It is a game that will outlast a generation unless of course we actually do go VR all the way.

I have been playing Sacred long-long times ago, still this is the first time I play with the Underworld. The game's just not Sacred. Tons of useless enemy hording you ALWAYS, you make two-three steps and again, eight enemies running on you. Merchants are nearly impossible to find on the whole freaking map!! This goes to the blacksmithes too... Nonetheless to say, you have to go always really huge distances and as I think, there is only, quite small city in the whole game. I loved in Sacred that there were tons of villages, towns and cities. Here's nothing. Just hack 'n slash, lacking any senses. Underwold just a boring something.

Although the graphics have obviously dated the game still looks smart and is very playable with a massive map to explore and tons of missions and item drops.\n\nThe world is a living breathing one with people and wildlife going about their business. There are a set of heroes to choose from although a dwarf and elf are hardly original but you need to forgive that and look beyond.\n\nI do have some minor gripes such as the AI path finding which can sometimes lead to a companion getting stuck. Its not a game breaker though as if you wander far enough away they will catch up. Just irritating sometimes.\n\nThe horses are a nice touch considering you can carry out mounted combat where as other similar games just use them for cosmetics or fast travel.

You choose your warrior and head into the world, travel through a bunch of dungeons, slay monster mobs, try to find or buy better items and equipment for yourself.\nThere is NO FRESH THOUGHT here though.  None.  Even so, it is a fun little dungeon-crawler.  Worth it for a couple bucks, but don't spend more than $5 on this one.  In fact, get the Sacred collection that includes all three games and even then don't pay more than $12 for the whole thing.","March 15","true","57.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I get the feeling that it's hand-drawn maybe. They give the games a certain charm, the visual design is quite brilliant.\n\nI highly reccomend this game, it is one of the most fun RPGs I have played in years.","February 19","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Servers are 100% gone and I don't believe there's a way to bypass this.\n\nLook, I know the game is likely fun solo and I totally understand that but me personally I play these games with friends as that really makes them fun, otherwise it feels a bit tedious much like Borderlands 2, Torchlight 2, Diablo etc.\n\nIf there was a way around this sorta thing, like locally hosting then I'd recomend this, as it stands? No...These games need multiplayer to be fun as that's what's half the fun.\n\nEdit:\nWow, lots of people don't seem to like this review.\nLook, I get there's hamachi and all that...But that's not going to ressurect the community, the ease of finding new people nor is it easy for everyone to set up. I'm able to do it, but I don't feel like tutoring all my friends how to do it when we can boot something like Torchlight and have a game going in under 2 minutes.\n\nIn otherwords 3rd party software that requires setting up does not make up for a fault for a game. This is a review for a game, not a game and 3rd party software.  I personally do not reccomend this game for the reasons above, feel free to disagree, that's totally fine but this is how I feel on it and I know some people look to these games for the same reason and I do not feel this is a good option given you need to dive into 3rd party software to bypass a flaw with the game- that being no more official multiplayer support .","May 23, 2014","false","11.4"," 27 of 58 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","27","58","0","10"

Sadly, much like me dreams of winning the lottery, those hopes will never be realized.\n\nThe game is just too un polished, the combat hardly carries the satisfying feel of DIablo, DIablo 2 or Torchlight and it lacks the strategic elements of say Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's gate.. The look and feel of the game in general has a weird paradox. The modeling is certainly top notch but the animation is laughable. Just watching your character run is enough to give a laugh.\n\nMaybe it improves with the later installments but after seeing this.. I'm not particularly motivated to try.\n\nNot to say it is  a bad game really. There are certainly worse and there was genuine effort put in but I think this is one occasion where the attempt at more 'realistic' aesthetics needlessly hobbled the overall game. A more stylized version may have lent itself to more dynamic and fluid animation which would have made the combat a bit more satisfying.\n\nSo count this as a borderline review.","July 7, 2014","false","18.7"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","6"

Maybe this was supposed to be funny or endearing, but it's nothing more than another turn off among a litany of problems.\n\nThere is NO sense of progression as it's saddled with the obscene habit of leveling everything always and forever to the point of your character, the bestiary is lame, uninspired, and copy-pasted to the umteenth exponent, you can never get ahead of the curve no matter how much time you waste grinding, leveling up barely gives you anything to work with, and this has perhaps the worst item system I've ever tried to put up with.\n\nEndless streams of items labeled "crappy broken crap of crappyness", half of which you arbitrarily can't use because of idiotic class restrictions. Items which should stack don't, and again, this is not excusable by the game's age, and there's no clear rhyme, reason, or again, progression behind any of it.\n\nThis is an endless, grindy treadmill without any reward or satisfaction, plagued by terrible systems, low quality design, and a bad interface. This game is awful, and I pity the soul who pays full price for it.\n","September 5, 2014","false","7.3"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

The reason is because I am running windows 8.1 with a a high end gaming machine.  I should be able to run any game.  But not this one.\n\nIf I play this game in full screen mode it gets very choppy and is not playable.  If I play it in windowed mode it is nice and smooth but now and then a light grey haze apears across the screen and I have to restart.  I can deal with the crashing but I can not deal with playing it in windowed mode for more than 10 minutes because I feel like I am playing a game through my cell phone screen and that is just not fun.\n\nI wish they would remake this game in high resolution because it looks to be one of the best games I have seen in a while due to the fact it is an open world sandbox game.  Something most programers these days seem to not get.  Players want OPEN WORLD GAMES!  Not sacred 3 linear boring like watching a movie game that I would not pay more than $5 for.  But if this game was remade I would pay the $49 for it.\n\nIf anyone can tell me how to run this game in full screen with smooth graphics I will change my rating to a thumbs up.","October 1, 2014","false","8.9"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

As you level up, you get to branch out into all kinds of passive skills, from Horseback Combat to Dual Wielding, allowing you to really customize your character in addition to the usual Strength, Agility and Intelligence attributes. To level up skills, you need to find "skill-items" or whatever they are called. These items are class-specific and these are the sources of your skills. You can obtain them en-masse from quests. You can right click these items if they belong to your class and consume them, gaining a point in that skill. If you find the skills of other classes, you can trade them in various amounts to the Gandalf wizard and he will give you a skill of your own class.\n\nYou can also string your abilities together to create some basic combos (skills don't really synergize with eachother). Only negative things I can say is that it's clunky as mentioned above, is extremely hard in the early stages and items are rather scarce. You will be lucky to find an unique in one playthrough, and even luckier if it belongs to your class since a lot of items are class-specific. Angels can't wear pants for instance.","October 18, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're wondering wether to get Sacred Gold or Sacred 2.. get Gold. Sacred 2 was a major punch in the nads for oldschool fans.\n\n\nI've replayed this game a million times over the years, and it never really gets boring. Sure, there's bugs and glitches and whatnot but there's something about it. I can't really explain it, it's one of those games I keep going back to like Diablo 2 - pure hack'n'slash but the skill tree is slightly different from any other game, the skills are interesting.. and it's funny. It's worth it, definitely worth it. I've actually paid for this several times, boxed editions, gifts, you name it. I can't really put my finger on it, it's just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing brilliant.\n\n","January 31","true","44.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably some nostalgia is involved here.\n\nAs far as top down RPG's go this is a really good one though.\n- Hack and slash,\n- choose and level skills and attributes,\n- find cool weapons,\n- hack and slash bigger stuff.\n- Open world.\n- Different environments: grassland, swamps, deserts, dungeons, big cities.\n- Great 2D drawn world.\n- You can zoom out further than in the screenshots here.\n- Story driven. Story isn't bad.\n- If you look hard enough you find dragons. DRAGONS. And kill them.\n\nPersonally I waited for a sale. Recommended.","January 29","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay works alot like Diablo 2 but with a few exceptions, such as alot more stats to keep track of, and a very different talent system where you level up specific talents by picking up random runes instead of the set-in-stone talent tree Diablo 2 has. I can understand why it could tick off some players, but I like that each playthrough of the game encouraged to try out new builds and abilities you may not have used much before.\n\nOverall great game and a must have for any A-RPG fan in my opinion.","January 30","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
