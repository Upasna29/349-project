"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miamari/recommended/467530/","miamari","Ugly ☹","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miamari/","277 products in account","This game is entirely based on timing your shots right. The game that comes to mind first when playing"atorb" is the game "Zuma" without the combos. Atorb is a game where you have multipe rings that correspond with a color, you then have orbs or balls that you must get ONTO those color corresponding rings. You have an orange orb you must get it onto the orange ring, you have a blue orb you must get it onto the blue ring. It is a fun and simple game that can test your patience at times (:\n\nTo go into a depth a little more there are 3 difficulty settings easy, normal and hard.\n-Easy / You can shot the colored orb onto the correct ring in any area to pass the level\n-Normal / You must shoot the orbs into predetermined spots on each ring (no punishment for missing)\n-Hard / You must shoot the orbs into predetermined spots on each ring WITHOUT missing, if you miss you must restart the entire level.\n\nI think the game so far from what ive played is fun the music is soothing and a nice color scheme. I purchased the game for 2.50 USD and the full price is 3.00. Not an expensive game and I think its well worth the money!\n\nSolid 9/10 for what it is.","May 7","true","4.2"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","26","30","2","0"

More orbits are added later on, and their speed increases as well. In fact, it becomes quite challenging after a while, since your reflexes and coordination are put to the test when everything is spinning really fast.","May 25","true","4.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Playing atorb might look like solid boredom from the outside, but once you start playing yourself and see just how addictive the whole thing is, you might see its purpose. There are many examples like this, so it’s up to everyone to choose one game that helps them relax. atorb do it right.","May 25","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In short, your goal is to shoot colored circle onto the correct orbits, while avoiding the differently colored blobs that are already spinning around. Naturally, this sounds a lot like Zuma, but there are key differences that make the experience unique and quite pleasant.\n","May 25","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Thankfully, the game features a few other gimmicks as well, such as three different difficult levels. Hence, more mechanics are added if you decide to raise the bar. As an example, the highest difficulty demands that you shoot each circle in a specific spot, otherwise the whole level resets and you have to try again.","May 25","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
