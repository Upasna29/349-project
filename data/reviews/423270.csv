This is an underappreciated element of videogames, and let me tell you why: Most developers simply don't have the time. No matter the era, developers are constantly faced with impossible deadlines. Basically, not every "i" is going to be dotted, nor will every "t" will be crossed. However, if developers had the time to make even the slightest adjustments, they could turn a good game into something even better.\n\nSince this is a review, you already understand where I'm going with this. Zheros is a nice beatemup. It has a solid foundation, some good ideas, and it can be pretty entertaining. However, this is a game that deserves a good polishing. The problems with Zheros could be measured in fractions and decimals. These issues are so slight, so miniscule, that people are liable not to notice them, but they'll still realize that something's wrong when they're playing the game. They'll say things like "What?" and "That doesn't make sense." or maybe just "Bullcrap!"\n\nJack and Dorian are a couple of Zheros out to stop Dr. Vendetta from doing evil things. Dr. Vendetta? I guess Captain I'mABadGuy and AdmiralBoneToPick weren't available. Anyway, the two playable characters team up to deliver fists of justice to a massive number of aliens and robots, over the course of 18 levels. Despite being a beatemup, this game is fairly long. Many of the levels can take more than 10 minutes to beat, some even as much as 30! In the time it takes to beat one level, you could probably play through the entirety of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or some other classic arcade brawler. Needless to say, it's greatly appreciated that progress is saved, after the completion of every level.\n\nWith the beatemup genre, we can expect at least some level of repetitiveness. Thankfully, Zheros does its best to keep things interesting with a large variety of enemies to battle. Jack and Dorian also have a wealth of combos they can perform. To add to this, the good guys can deflect both bullets and blows with a well-timed block. The brawling itself is serviceable, and it's fun just pounding baddies by the dozens. However, as you progress through the game, you're also liable to notice all of the little problems. At first they feel like nitpicks, but these complaints add up and start tearing away at the game. Allow me to share with you some of the issues that I've run into.\n\nA lot of the enemies have melee attacks that are hard to read. The most common enemy is a small robot. Aside from firing their laser rifle, they also kick and swing their gun at the player. In the heat of the fight, it's never really clear what they're doing, and their range is so short you'll hardly be able to tell they're doing anything. Other, even smaller robots on wheels are harder to focus on. They rear back and do a lunging attack, but the lack of movement doesn't help them stand out. It's also annoying that the heroes drop everything, just to kick the bombs that these "dog-bots" drop. Kicked bombs don't suddenly explode and damage enemies, they're just moved to a different spot.\n\nWhat you're more likely to notice is all of the damage you'll take while on your back. Certain larger enemies are capable of doing knock-down attacks. When they gang up on you, they can knock you to the ground, then continue hitting you. There's nothing you can do about this. It's a rare occurence, but if their attacks are timed at the right moment, they can deplete your health fairly quickly. While you can also knock the enemy down and continue hitting them, the larger foes can block your attacks at random. I've had my attacks completely deflected, even when the foe was lying down! Some other enemies will repeatedly dodge your moves, which is also annoying.\n\nWhen enemies aren't randomly blocking your attacks, they can do a fantastic job at countering you. While the game would probably be too easy if your attacks had all of the priority, I'm of the camp that believes in "some is better than none". Your combos will get stuffed by enemy attacks at a constant rate. When foes group together, you'll find that it's extremely hard to get some moves in to spread everyone out. On the other hand, I think this aspect of the game adds a little depth. Beatemups are really enjoyable, when you have to work for those openings in the enemy's onslaught. Although, I also think that the heroes should yell "OUCH!" or "OOF!" when they take damage. Even when they're getting pummeled, Jack & Dorian don't utter the slightest grunt.\n\nIn level 1-8 "The Shelter", there is a section where you have to hit a button. This button causes a shutter to close, which keeps intense heat from sapping your health. However, this shutter re-opens in just a few seconds, which isn't enough time to get more than a couple punches on a huge cyborg bullman. This is one of those moments where two seconds, yes, two additional seconds of closed-shutter time, would have made that section far more manageable. Instead, you're going to be constantly distracted by the shutter, and trying to babysit it while also not being obliterated by one of the toughest enemies in the game.\n\nThen there are the bosses. I didn't really enjoy fighting these clowns. Most of your attacks just don't do much damage. I had the most success with the Y, X, X, X, X, X, etc combo. Oddly enough, I had the least amount of trouble with the final boss, and that's because his attacks are the only ones that can be shut down by the block. The other two bosses require liberal use of the dodge button, and even that isn't guaranteed. On the brightside, there are plenty of health items, and the bosses don't do an excessive amount of damage.\n\nWhat's telling about most of these complaints, is that all of them could be fixed via minor adjustments. Let's say that some attacks give the player 1 or 2 frames of invulnerability, or allow them a half-second to recover after being knocked down. The second boss would ever-so-slightly pause before their double axe-handle, allowing the player enough time (if they're paying attention) to get out of the way. The player should be allowed a distinct audible cue when their hero is getting hurt. These are all little things, the ones that are most likely to be overlooked, but they have a sizable impact on the game.\n\nDespite my many complaints, Zheros is a perfectly serviceable way to spend a weekend or two. If you have a friend to play co-op with, then it's all the better. If you're flying solo and are prone to aggravation; consider sticking to the easy difficulty. This game's polish deficiency will cause you to repeat some headache-inducing sections, and there's no way to change difficulties, without restarting the entire game. That said, if you do decide to tough it out and play on normal or hard, you could eventually become accustomed to the wonkier aspects of this game. It might take longer than it should, but this game will "click" for you, if you allow it to.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 29","true","8.7"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","32","34","0","1"

This time, they are facing the evil Dr. Vendetta who wants to mutate every living creature and transform them into his minions. This is definitely not going be a walk in the park; it will be a challenging mission for “Zheros!”\n\nZheros is an action / 3D beat’em up game where you play either Mike or Captain Dorian from the Zheros squad in single mode, or you can play with someone else on a local co-op mode. This game is absolutely frantic from the start. You will face several types of enemy as you progress into the game. The most comment one will be the white robots with a triangular shaped head, but you will encounter other really tough ones like the “Space Cow”. As in all good beat’em up games, you have to maximise your combos to get as many points as you can. On top of that, your character will have a shield to protect him/her from projectiles and punches, as well as a mounted gun on his/her forearm to use if you are in a pickle (they are plenty in this game)!\n\nCollect all the golden tokens by destroying the orange boxes and do not forget about the golden star; there is one hidden in each level. At the end of the level, you will be able to see how many tokens you have collected and how many RP’s you will get for them. You will need RP’s to upgrade Mike and Captain Dorian’s abilities; more moves, better shield or more damage with your mounted gun.\n\nAlso, there are blue, green and red cylinders; the blue one will help you with your ammunition and the green one will regenerate your health. All I can say for the red cylinder is shoot at them when your enemies are close to them…hehehehe, BOOM!\n\nLevels will also have obstacles, electric grids, lasers and more.\n\nI really enjoy the 3D cartoonist graphics in this game and the animations are fabulous. The levels are fun and challenging. The controls are really responsive. The soundtrack will keep you pumped and help you to beat the upcoming levels.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great 3D cartoonist graphics\n-	Fun, fast and frantic gameplay\n-	Really good animations\n-	Plenty of moves\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	RP not equally distributed in Co-op mode\n\nA great, fun and fast 3D beat’em up game to have in your library. Highly recommended!\n\n8.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

The developers of ZHEROS have a great sense of humour as some of the cut scenes are hilarious and priceless. :)\n\nYou battle your way through the sci-fi setting using brute force or some occiasonal weapons. You want to to try and maximize your combo moves to boost your score. I really liked the way the controller layout in the settings illustrates with pictures exactly what each button will do for you so you can pick it up almost instantly and be an efficient brawler right away.\n\nAs you make your way through you can continue to develop your characters skills and improve their abilities. I have played with Mike only so far and I'm quite happy with his current skill set. You will also unlock some weapons and gear as you work your way through the levels.\n\nWhile the combat is challenging I would have liked to see more from the computer AI as I find the bulk of your battles is just facing ever increasingly larger mobs of minions that come at you in waves and this can get to be a bit repetitive after awhile.\n\nVisuals are very impressive and again I liken it to a saturday morning sci-fi cartoon which I love. Music and effects are upbeat and well suited for this type of game.\n\nThere is no online multiplayer but there is a local co-op which I'm sure this would make it even more fun but unfortunately I haven't had anyone here to play with yet but I will get my son to try it out with me when he comes home this weekend.\n\nOverall I have enjoyed this game to date and it has served as a trip down memory lane for me as well. Even if beat'em up games are not your thing I encourage you to try this one as the story, humour and visuals might be enough to change your opinion of the genre.\n\nTwo thumbs up!!","February 20","true","9.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The gameplay is very satisfying and I'm sure you'll fall in love once you start playing.\n\nAs I mentioned, the gameplay is very satisfying.  Overall the combat is solid and very well done.  It is your typical light attack, heavy attack, but with some other goodies mixed in such as being able to actively dodge, blocking/parrying enemy attacks, and you can shoot enemies with your sidearm.  There are a variety of combos that you can pull off by stringing light attacks, heavy attacks, AND your ranged weapon, each combo has it's own unique style to them so you won't get bored watching the same thing over and over again.\n\nAlso you have an energy bar, using your ranged weapon will slowly deplete this gauge.  The bar will regenerate slowly over time, but can be refilled quicker by finding energy pick-ups.\n\nLastly there are two characters you can play, their fighting styles are different from eachother, one is more punching-oriented while the other kicking-oriented.  Nonetheless, both are very refreshing to play.\n\nThe level design is somewhat linear that are broken up into fight segments, where you have to defeat all enemies in an area before you can proceed.  Throughout the levels there are collectible items such as health pick-ups, energy pick-ups, and coins which contribute to your overall score.  you can find these in crates in which you can break open.\n\nA nit-pick I have with the game is how some fight segments are too short mainly due to enemies being too squishy.  Honestly it's not that big of a deal, but if I had to say something this would be it.\n\nAs for the price-to-hours ratio, I'd say it is decent and you will definitely get more hours than it is worth, or definitely break-even.  The gameplay is good enough though so you'll for sure get your money's worth, especially if you're playing with friends/partner/wife/husband/kids.  From a singleplayer standpoint, the value is still there and you will for sure get your money's worth, it may not be as much as playing coop though.\n\nOverall very great game, you don't see very much good beat-em-ups nowadays, but then you have Zheros which came in guns blazing showing that this genre is still alive.\n\nI hope this review helps you in deciding whether to purchase this game or not.\n","February 15","true","8.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The performance is fine and it has the basics of the PC options you'd expect, but it's control scheme is 100% designed for a controller and a keyboard (you dont use the mouse) does't have the same tightness of controls. Also all tooltips and explainations use XBOX icons, instead of your (partially) rebindable keyboard keys.\n\nAlso a big drawback is a lack of online co-op (couch co-op only) and a lack of online leaderboard.\n\nSee the video review for indept commentary of this summary & gameplay impressions.","February 15","true","19.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

If you play it solo it’ll feel more like a tech demo than an actual game.\n\nBasic Game Review\nOVERVIEW\nZheros is a game starring a Macho Man and a lithe and flexible Female as they beat-up the robots of an evil genius. The story is told through small cutscenes that completely lack voiceover. There isn’t much to the story besides these two people that want to beat the crap out of a villain… so no worries there.\n\nVISUALS\nZheros contains some fantastic graphics with a Science Fiction backdrop. What you can expect is a beautiful brawler with fast and responsive combat. The combat is all about punching and kicking various robots in the face with a variety of combo strings and air juggles. Increasing talents will unlock more elaborate combos to perform on the various enemy types in the game.\n\nThe backgrounds are dominated by constant moving parts like a rich Sci-fi skyline. The combat in the foreground tends to be a bit too moderate in comparison. When playing alone the characters tend to face off against a small amount of opponents in short waves. The robots take a lot longer to dispatch and the combat becomes tiresome even after only an hour of play.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nWhen playing solo, the enemies lack the aggression we’re used to in older more rambunctious 2D brawlers.\nOnce another player has stepped up to bat, the game changes to a hectic brawl of life and death. Players will be on their toes constantly as they face endless waves of enemies. The combat bumps up significantly with two-players and it’s usually a battle of attrition to try and survive. It’s much more thrilling to play cooperatively as the enemies tend to keep the players on their toes.\n\nI have two things I don’t like about cooperative play. First, it’s only local-coop and since this is the best way to play the game… it’s a strange omission. Secondly, the only way to obtain talent points is to pit the players against each other. The player with the highest score earns the most RP and the player with the lowest score earns none. This stops the second player from earning skills to increase their combos and damage, which in turn makes that player weaker in the long term. This is counterintuitive to a cooperative style of play and is damaging to them team dynamic.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion. The solo game is all about short bursts of combat in rather boring environments that don’t look much different from the last. However, once two players are involved in the brawl the background disappears among the waves of enemies trying to destroy you. To be honest, Zheros is a game that can only truly be played cooperatively. Playing this game solo is a bore, but with two players you’re in for a slightly interesting experience. Since the game is local play only though, I’d wait for a sale unless you have a friend that’s always on hand.\n\n*This game was provided to us by the developer*","February 15","true","2.3"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"
