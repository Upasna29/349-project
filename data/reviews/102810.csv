You now have Gatling Gears!\nWhat a great twin stick shooter from Vangaurd Games! It's a BLAST to play!\nMy nephew and I had so much fun, we completed the entire game in one day!\n\nGREAT NEWS! The game no longer requires any additional DRM from EA!\nIt plays just like any other game on Steam! SUPER NICE!\n\nPros +\n\n+ Local Co-Op - You and a friend can battle the evil empire from the same couch!\n+ Colorful World - It sure is pretty and filled with vibrant color!\n+ Visual Upgrades - Your walker not only gets stronger, the upgrades can be seen too!\n+ Boss Battles - Each boss is dangerous and just when you think you have won...\n+ Solid Design - Single, Multiplayer, Survival mode, lengthy campaign and a diverse menu.\n+ Difficulty - Easy, Normal, and Hard modes cater to different skill levels.\n+ New Game+ - Everything you have unlocked can be used again at the start of the game!\n\nCons -\n\n- Visual Noise - This my ONE and ONLY problem. Not to worry! It's an EXTREMELY TINY gripe about how stunning the world is. The game looks fabulous and it is filled with tiny details. Some players might have trouble knowing where certain attacks are comming from because of how "cluttered" the screen can get. I hate to mention this because of how much time and effort was put into creating this beautiful game.\n\nThis is a very easy choice for any one who likes video games.\nSpend $10 and buy this now!","September 13, 2015","true","20.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

Gatling Gears is a top down, "two joystick" (you can move and shoot in different directions) action arcade game with very modest level-up RPG elements. The campaign is a respectable +6 hours. While the narrative is rather vapid, it's hard to notice since the action is perfectly paced and the levels are solid. The only other thing that is lacking is the number of players ready for co-op - multiplayer is essentially limited to local games only, since there is no drop-in multiplayer mode. Had this game been released in the arcades, I would have probably spent a ton of money plugging quarters into a Gatling Gears arcade machine.","May 29, 2012","true","9.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

Features familiar to this genre include dodging insane amounts of enemies and projectiles mid-combat as the camera forcefully pans horizontally or vertically.\n\nGatling Gears mixes the formula up by letting the player drive a ground-based machine. This not only heightens the player's maneuverability, but it also allows him to control the pace of the camera - a nice addition that aids the less hardcore audience.\n\nFor combat, there are a total of four different weapons at the player's disposal, three of which are upgradeable by collecting gold scattered through the levels. Using them skillfully is pivotal to maintaining a high multiplier which will boost your ranks in the leaderboards and unlock aesthetics.\n\nIn terms of a bullet hell shooter, Gatling Gears is arguably the most beautiful.

Overall a very solid game with minor flaws of aggressive forced scrolling and a little sluggish turning on your character.","December 10, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While admittedly pretty simplistic, I like the cartoony graphics and it's a solid twin-stick shooter.  You have an arsenal of four weapons from the start and unlimited/regenerating ammo for each - there are no weapon/ammo pickups in the game.  While I like the upgrade system for your weapons, I don't understand why the upgrades are purchased with the gold bars placed through each level instead of the parts or "gears" that you're already collecting from everything you destroy - it seems that would create more incentive to try and destroy everything (at least, as much as possible) in each level.  Regardless, I still think it's an incredibly fun game, though challenging enough to not be completely mindless.  I definitely recommend this to fans of twin-stick shooter action games.\n\nNote: I've only played with keyboard/mouse so I can't speak to controller functionality.\n\nUPDATE: The one big thing that annoys me about this game is how you can't go backwards.  As you advance through the (completely linear) pathway, the camera moves to follow you so, if you miss a gold bar and walk too far ahead, you're out of luck until you play through the level again.  However, I read somewhere that there are more gold bars in the game than it takes to fully upgrade your mech so it's not that big of a deal but it still delays your ability to upgrade if you miss some gold.\n\nSomething else that may be of interest to some prospective players is that there seems to be little if any replay value to the game.  The entire game is very straightforward and totally linear so the only reasons I can see to play through again would be 1) to collect any gold you may have missed or 2) to try a higher difficulty setting.  Of course, this depends on what type of player you are - it's feasible that you could love the rampaging shooter action so much that completing the game once just isn't enough.  If you think a single play-through is kind of a ripoff, you'll probably want to wait for a sale.","February 12","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
