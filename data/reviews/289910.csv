The most important features such as the construction and placement of the ropeways and stations themselves, as well as the economical bussiness management are well polished and offer decent gameplay for your money.\n\nIt does limit itself in overall content but if you're a fan of the genre you won't be dissapointed!\n\nRopeway Simulator earns a 7/10\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PB2meWuNGc","December 31, 2014","true","26.1"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","25","33","4","1"

THe graphics are acceptable (not brillant, but good.)\n\nCons\n\n- Very tedious. Building the ropeways is hard as the angles have to be perfect.\n- Very basic tutorial system.\n- Limited Ropeway locations, you cant just build one, it can only go in the spaces the game allocates.\n\nPros\n- If you like tedious projects, this one's for you.\n\nIts a good game, the idea is there. I lost my desire to keep playing after 30 minutes trying to just build one ropeway, by readjusting tower heights and base angles.\n\n7/10.","December 13, 2014","true","6.2"," 38 of 59 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","38","59","4","0"

It's just about building ropes and buying hotels. Unfortunately there is no intelligent business or economics mechanic behind. You can't even see the profit of a hotel or single rope and optimize your business. Furthermore there isn't any chance to influence the amount of visitors in your area. This leads to huge and expensive rope construction that nobody uses.\n\nOverall impression: ok, but neither entertaining nor realistic.","March 7, 2015","false","8.3"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

For example is smally unrealistic ammount of pylons sometimes (It can happen that you need to build only one pylon and ropeway is complete).\nBut if you ever wanted to be a ropeway builder itÂ´s game for you.\n+ Big ammount of ropeway types from chairlift to funiculars or cargolifts, you can ever choose from.\n+ Summer and winter scenario.\n+ Many areas where to build.\n+ You can set many things from gondola ammount, color, lift speed...\n- Sometimes too easy.\n- Zooming on hotels or ropeways bases is after 20 minutes of playing really boring.","January 20, 2015","true","22.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

However, I just really could not get into this game. It's not so much a simulation game, but more of a puzzle... There is hardly any freedom to create as you wish, but instead you're set with the task of trying to evenly space-out support poles over a distance that I can't even adapt.\n","June 16, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
