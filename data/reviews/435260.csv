I was heavily involved in testing the game since the early alpha. Most balancing and fixes were made with my input. I wrote the accompanying manual and the current wording of all cards in the game. However, I have no financial stake in the game’s success, so I don’t feel disqualified from writing a review. I can only praise the developer for being so accepting of my input.\n\nPlanet Stronghold Colonial Defense (PSCD) is developed by Winter Wolves, who are mostly known for visual novels with varying degrees of gameplay and an emphasis on romance. Earlier games such as Loren the Amazon Princess and the original Planet Stronghold had RPG elements. PSCD, a prequel to Planet Stronghold, is a visual novel with card battles, like a collectible card game (CCG). Prior knowledge of Planet Stronghold is not required.\n\nBeing a story driven single player card game means that it isn’t a traditional CCG. You don’t buy booster packs, all cards in the game are unlocked by progressing through the story. After a number of tutorial games, you do build your own deck though, within the restrictions of the game, which can vary from mission to mission.\n\nYou have three difficulty modes to choose from, and a visual novel mode that completely removes the card game, for people who are just interested in reading the story. If you’re at all experienced with CCGs or strategy games in general, you should play the game on Hard. All missions and cards have been balanced to fit Hard mode. Normal would be for people unfamiliar with this type of game or insecure in their strategic abilities. Easy is mostly for people who don’t want to miss out on the gameplay, but are mainly playing for the story.\n\nWinter Wolves are known for being very LGBT friendly, and this game is no exception. You choose your gender from two predetermined characters, and can romance men, women, an alien, or even a robot. The story revolves around your character leading the only human colony on a hostile alien planet through a number of battles and intrigues.\n\nPlaying the card game is very intuitive if you’ve ever played Hearthstone, Magic the Gathering or any similar CCGs. Following the tutorials and paying attention to card text should teach you most of the game, but just in case, there is also a complete manual distributed with the game (found in the installation folder). It’s a good place to go to understand everything completely, and as a reference for various card abilities that aren’t always spelled out on the cards.\n\nThe card game is fun, sometimes challenging and very varied. Because it’s a single player game, many battles are sort of mini puzzles where the player needs to figure out what cards will be best suited to win the fight. Since there is no need for balancing decks against each other, the AI has access to some very strong cards to give it an edge over the player.\n\nIf I have a point of critique it’s mostly that I don’t feel the tone of the story is quite right for the game. There is very little sense of drama, as most of what goes on is “slice of life” style talks between your team members as they go on picnics, play in the holoroom and flirt with one another. It’s a little hard to feel the tension one would expect from a lone colony on a hostile world. Note that I am not slamming the writing, it’s really good with a lot of great details and clever dialogue. I just personally would expect a more dramatic story with fewer slice of life moments.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with an interest in single player CCGs. Strategy gamers will definitely also find something here to keep them entertained. If you’re more interested in the story, just be aware that it’s mostly slice of life style writing, but if that’s up your alley, you can dive right in and not even worry about the card game, as it can be turned off completely!","March 9","true","5.7"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","29","42","0","4"

I wish there was a -neutral- rating system (neither highly recommend or not recommend).\nStill? I believe it deserves a thumbs up. Part of my time with the game was while still in testing (from first to last version) though I've had a closer look and playthrough of the final version as well\n\nIt's the second game in the series, a prequel as the setting takes place years before the original Planet Stronghold (VN with RPG tactical turnbased battles).\n\nThe two major differences between the games are the battle syste , this is a card battle game, and very well balanced on at that (imo), as opposed to turnbased rpg\n, the card art is really well done, and the battles require you to think.\nThe other significantt difference is the art.\n\nThe decks you are handed are based on decisions you take in the story. Though I played the VN mode (omitting the cardgame bit) I came to realize that the card battles is probably this game's greatest strength.\nI've never been into those kind of games before, and it took me a long time to figure out how to play, yet when I did?\nIt was totally worth it.  It's fairly complex (for a N00B!!!) to the genre at least, though the tutorial got increasingly better through testing.\n\nIF you like cardgames, I think you'll like this one  (9/10)\n\nThe graphics and artwork take a more "realistic" style  compared to the (still great) than the manga/anime style used in the first Planet Stronghold.  Some might like ,some might not, admit I missed the charm of the old graphics, though PS:Colonial Defense' s is still really high quality.   I want to perhaps especially point out the ending artwork (different style but beautifully done).  HUD / card artwork is perhaps the ones I appreciated the most.  (artwork 7/10 => on account of my personal taste, didn't love the artwork, even if it was well done)\n\nThe story however?  I found part of the reason I regretted not paying more attention to the cardgame, was that ..it was the game's strongest side.\nThe overall  plotline is what you'd expect,  defending the colony against numerous threats, some forces visibly hostile from the start, and some that might surprise you.  This isn't where the game suffers.\n\nThe characters, there's quite a few of them, some what you'd expect, officers serving at the colonies, techies, science personell, and then some.  Mid missions is where the "VN-part" of the game takes place, and it's during these scenes you get to know your fellow personell / citizens of the colony.\n\nOne of the main problems here is you'll be bombarded by characters from day one,  you were just attacked?  Groups of 4 + will be there to comment, quite often their only "facetime" is tossing in funny (or not so funny, given the gravity of the situation) comments.   Your psionic has gotten ripped up by living crystals?  Jokes......    Part of the base destroyed? Jokes.....\nFar too often these attempts to lighten the mood made me feel less of the characters making them.  Not bad people necessearily, but I wished I (as Captain, and colony leader) could say  "That was out of line",  "that comment was uncalled for",  or "Show some respect, people died here".\nYou aren't allowed to shut the banter down, given other settings, being out for a drink with one of the people in question, those comments or "insights" might've been okay.\n\nSome of the characters are certainly more enjoyable than others, some are actually funny, some obnoxious, some are downright creepy.\nI sometimes struggle to find the logic in what your crew here say.  At one point you hear "Lucius the android never complains, and is so polite"  (or similar)\n:p Lucius the android complained -all- the time about his lot in life, of being forced to follow robot laws (think i-Robot) ,like ones where he's not allowed to harm human beings. He's constantly testing his boundaries and complaining when he doesn't get his will.  Almost every conversation with that one character is about how he yearns for more freedom to do whatever he please.\n\nThe characters (how they acted) and the conversations is what I liked the least about this game, -yet- I admit I'm not an expert on games like these, I know how much I liked VN's and perhaps especially Winterwolves' in the past exactly because of the character gallery.   VN-part : 5/10\n\nMusic?  Ambience and combat music is really well done, soothing and of high quality.  Admit the theme song might not be quite....my favourite genre, something I'd expect in some anime ,but not here.   8/10\n\nWell polished and good value overall I still recommend the game, just don't expect many similarities with the original\n\nFeeling generous I'd give it a 7/10 on my personal scale (though closer to 6 => just above average)\nThe cardgame is FUN","March 14","true","1.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I played it at the easy level since I’m not really into card games and the difficulty was just right for someone like me who’s mainly interested in the story but still wants to experience the battles firsthand (in my opinion the game feels slightly unbalanced in pure visual novel mode, without the card battles to provide some rhythm).\n\nThe main strength of the visual novel part is the worldbuilding, with no less than a dozen of characters (most of them romanceable) and four races of aliens you can interact with and who have distinct traits. The moral choices you make outside of the romance paths can be pretty heavy especially when they relate to the war going on in Stronghold and they influence the card battles as well (as you make alliances with/try to destroy other aliens). The writing is good on the whole; it is at its best in witty scenes or banter between characters (which is probably why there’s so much of it) and can fall a little flat at other times, especially during the romance paths (the sex scenes tend to be…a bit excruciating). The romances are otherwise really cute and straightforward.\n\nOverall I’d recommend trying out the demo to see if the VN/card game mix works for you. I definitely enjoyed this one.","April 17","true","19.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's also pretty easy to pick up if you are familiar with other card games of similar nature. (120 unique cards)\n+ Various dialogue options, and romance options later in the game\n+ Interesting characters with unique personalities\n+ Good soundtrack\n\n- I feel like the card game could have been split into a separate game.

The first is a visual novel dating game type thing, pick a person, talk to them and potentially pursue a romance. The second, a visual novel telling the story of you, a commander of an earth colony beset by aliens both friendly and less so. And the last, the "fighting" second of the game, a turn based card game. The decisions you make in the first two sections can alter the resources and cards available to you in the last - as well as which missions you go on.\n\nThe good news?\n\nThe card game is *very* entertaining. Easy mode makes you feel super powerful as you mow through the enemy, hard mode makes you feel like your victories were hard earned, and normal is ... well normal. And if the card game doesn't interest you at all, there's a visual novel mode that let's you skip it. The plot is engaging enough to make you want to find out more, the characters you meet and interact with are interesting, layered and believable, and the setting is vast and detailed.\n\nThe bad news?\n\nThe art is a bit uncanny valley. It is by no means bad, and it does grow on you, but there is an adjustment period. The character interactions can catch you off guard with the wacky (all be it entertaining) hijinks coming from seemingly nowhere. And the game has a desperate need for a universe database - or at very least a cast list. The setting is very detailed and all the information is delivered in an organic and natural way, but with the vast cast, the changes to human society, and all the different alien races, it can leave you scratching your head as you try to remember who everyone is.\n\nTo sum up?\n\nThe good stuff is gooder than the bad stuff is bad. The game is entertaining once you get into it, and has enough variety to sustain replay. plus best of all, there is a demo available on the developers website so you can try before you buy.\n","April 23","true","9.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Compared to the standart rpg fights in similar games where you have 3 or 4 different spells or attacks and you just have to see which type of elemental damage does the most harm and spam that and throw in a heal or stun from time to time, the card battles feel more challenging. On the highest difficulty level you actually have to think about which cards suit in which situation. Also it kinda suits the theme. While in fantasy settings I prefer the party of heroes wandering around fighting its battles itself, here it feels more like you are the base commander managing troops and resources of your colony and thinking strategically.\n\nThe artstyle, writing, setting and music don't mesh that well at times. It allready begins, when you fire up the game and the opening theme begins to play. While the girl that sings it is probably as cute as a button, it just doesn't really fit the game and artstyle in my eyes. It would be better suited for some high school dating sim with manga art where everyone and everything is just kawaii. Or maybe I'm just a dumb ignorant german, with a bad taste in music. Music during the actual game and card battles fits just fine, no problem.\nSame goes for the dialogues between the characters, for this setting they are a bit too often on the light hearted side for my taste. Overall the writing is pretty comparable to Planet Stronghold 1, just improved. Not really a bad thing and I don't want to sound too critical here, since I definitely have fun with it just with the more realistic look maybe writing should have changed a bit in a different direction at times.\nArtstyle is hit or miss, I didn't like it at first, but the longer I played the more I like it. The characters just lack the cuteness that you can find in many other winter wolves games. But I must say charlotte is still pretty nice to look at, just in a different way and at least most of the time. Because Facial expressions look more often than not odd. No sugarcoating here, thats definitely not one of its strengths.Alien models on most part look improved, the only ones that I don't like better than in the first game are the marada.\n\n15 years ago, I would have gladly paid double the price for that if it came out with a nice box and manual that contains all the informations on the different alien races and characters. Today like most I'm more on the cheap side, but I can say its pricing is appropriate. PSCD is well made, contains interesting mechanics like the card game and lots of unique characters and on top of that is also quite long, I think I have read it contains over 200k words thats like double of that what most other VN contain. Also the developer will patch some more content in, like some more romances and maybe some kind of free battle mode and a few more cards. And you can even romance an android, if thats not a must buy then I don't know.\n\nWhats missing? Well personally for myself the free battle mode, where we can make our own decks and play vs the ai and some incentive to play through the story more then just once. I know there are achievements ingame and on steam and more romances and other choices and all of that together, but it would haven been nice if there was a way to earn a few more special cards. Like winning some of the battles on hard mode under certain conditions would reward you with a special card or with a card that previously only the enemy had access to. That way I would have enough incentive to play through the story with its different choices again and also sit down and fiddle about my strategies for those battles.You know people like to collect things, whether its steam cards or stamps or troll dolls.\n\nBut all in all a good game. If you interested but unsure, maybe try out the demo first, its only 80mb to download and some of the biggest concerns I had (mainly with the artwork), just vanished after a while.","April 29","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
