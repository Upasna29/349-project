I purchased the early access so that I could be part of the development process, which I was expecting to last 12-18 months. Here we are a month or two later and its considered "retail" ready. No, this is yet another embarrassment to the Early Access/Kickstarter way of doing things.\n\nIf you are looking for a "simulator" do not buy this. Anybody that considers this as a simulator doesn't know the meaning of the word as it has no simulator aspects to it.  I am very disappointed in the game, the developers and Steam for continuing to allow developers to release early access games that they have no intention of finishing and just want to make a quick buck. If the game remained in Early Access I wouldnt have an issue, but this is not a finished product.\n\nEarly Access and kickstarter products like this are legalised theft, that is all I have to say.\n","February 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 354 of 394 people (90%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","90","354","394","16","8"

But, maybe I can help you save a few hard earned dollars).\n\nI have a decently beefy machine.  Not a monster computer, but a 6 core 4.2ghz machine with an AMD R9 200 series video card and 8gb of RAM.  It doesn't struggle with any games I play - except this one.  The frame rate is just horrid (sub 10fps).  And changing the video settings doesn't seem to do anything for me.\n\nAdditionally, the gameplay is, well... lame.  I absolutely love sim games (days of play time on ETS2), but this is a huge disappointment.  Other ships in the harbor will run right into you, even if you run your horn.  The controls are poorly implemented, in that you can't easily reset them to "0" by adjusting them left or right, as you do to increase the throttle.\n\nI haven't played a ton so far, because it is frankly frustrating to play.  I was suckered in by the decent reviews that were likely posted with this being an "early access" game in mind.  Now that it is a real release, I can only call B.S. on this one.\n\nDevs - feel free to credit my account for my $20.  I know you won't, but that'd be the right thing to do.","February 20, 2015","false","1.1"," 207 of 242 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","207","242","11","14"

Arguably, there was an effort by the Euroboat team to make it appear that way. Unfortunately, with European Ship Simulator, what you get is a shallow experience at best without any campaign mode, meaningful objectives, or even a sense of immersion to say the least.\n\nI've completed 4 of the missions so far, successfully I might add, and it wasn't challenging at all. You have a short selection of "Missions" along side a mission editor. I started off with a tug boat mission. The tug boat itself was sufficiently detailed and breaking into open sea from the harbor was satisfying, the choppiness kicked up and there seemed to be correct current physics to deal with. That, unfortunately, was about all there was to be impressed by.\n\nDropping the tug was a simple press-this-button, which displays a bunch of balloons around your boat. All I had to do was select one of my ballons, and click on the balloon from the ship I would be towing. This easy process connects the two balloons together with a rope, instantly. At this point I'm ready to tow. The massive tanker's front end would dip inappropriately into the sea while towing, which was weird. The physics aren't perfect but I can get passed it. There is no complicated mooring procedure either once you get to your destination. You simply float to the next arrow and you're done. Congratulations. *yawn*\n\nLater, I tried the speedboat. A speedboat mission! My objective was to drive my speedboat to a yacht and pick up a rich lady in distress. On my way, I clipped through just about every bit of ocean, I was practically a submarine. Additionally, the reaction of the boat to the choppy water felt so unauthentic that it made me feel like the developers included this irritation just to force me to press the A and D keys a whole bunch of times and not fall asleep.\n\nTo spice things up, I tried the cruise liner. I figured, this should be a challenge. Wrong again, and that brings me to my conclusion. European Ship Simulator is a disaster at the price it is asking. I've played more complex and immersive sims on the iPad. I don't know how some people came the the conclusions they did by recommending this game, it really does make me wonder. The game offers you nothing in return for your effort. It is over-simplified, unrealistic and broken. Wait for the massive content update it needs and in the meantime there are better boating simulators out there.","February 23, 2015","false","0.8"," 140 of 161 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","140","161","7","4"

Also, there is very little actual game here, even for an early access title. You have very constrained mission areas to play around in, no roaming the high seas. The largest area is a trip across the English Channel at night.\nAlso, the physics are somewhat suspect, as your boat cannot so much as touch anything else without sinking, no matter how gentle the inpact.\nAnother black mark is that the UI and menus are very unpolished, and very little exists in the way of tutorials. Even yourincoming radio messages are simply texts, with no voice acting. You truly feel alone in the world they are presenting.\nEven though the game doesn't feel in the least bit like a finished game at this point, it is leaving early access.","February 7, 2015","false","3.2"," 52 of 66 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","52","66","4","1"

The graphics, especially of bridge interiors, are excellent. While I'm not an expert on ship physics, they seem pretty good. The learning curve for this game is not too steep, by and large, and after a couple of early failures, I have played about 75% of the missions and passed them all. However, the game does have one or two little bugs, and there are some areas where it could improve:\n\n1) The text goes weird when you try to change the settings. It's OK initially, but when you go back a screen after making your desired change, it all gets screwed up somehow.\n\n2) Ships seem rather too fragile. You can sink by hitting a pier at low speed! The level of damage needs to be more realistically adjusted.\n\n3) The AI boats behave strangely at times. In the cruise liner mission for example, a boat that appeared to be going past me suddenly turned in a sharp circle right in front of me! They are also unrealistically indestructible - bump into one, and you'll sink, but it won't!\n\n4) In the "berth the ferry in a severe storm" mission, the weather is actually perfectly calm!\n\n5) As others have mentioned, there is no career or campaign mode. This would boost the game enormously, as currently there's not a lot left to do after you've played the missions (although you can supposedly make up your own, or edit existing ones, with the Mission Editor).\n\nI also think the game could possibly benefit from time being sped up a little à la Euro Truck Simulator, or maybe players could be given the choice between "real" time and "fast" time. Some missions kind of drag a bit, even when you're going at your boat's maximum speed. But these bugs and irritants notwithstanding, the game is generally good fun, which is why I recommend it overall. Also, it is a fairly new product that the developers are giving a lot of time to right now. Already since I bought it, there has been an update. So hopefully this promising game will soon be even better in the future.","March 25, 2015","true","21.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The morse code being send is perfect morse & says LEDU  wonder what that stands for? To the game developers, I would like to see a few people walking around the docks & onboard vessels. The thrusters should be marked BOW THRUSTER (left side) & STERN THRUSTER (right side thruster). Single thruster vessels should be marked BOW THRUSTER. Looking forward to the game developing further.","January 30, 2015","true","8.1"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","27","44","4","2"

You can see there's been a lot of thought and detail put in so far. You can control your ship via keyboard or just using the mouse to handle the levers and switches yourself. Being able to walk around the bridge is awesome too. You get a nice sense of scale when captaining a large ferry that I really enjoy.\n\nYou're currently limited to 3 missions, which is understandable given it's Early Access, each with a different boat and in different conditions. Involving both Dover and Calais. I take this route a lot and can say attention has been made towards the skylines of both these towns and ports, which again is a nice touch.\n\nYou can even sink the ship and stand on the bridge as you witness the area filling with water, if that's something you're into.","November 21, 2014","true","2.3"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","27","44","4","1"

It's in early access so there is still a ways to go for this game but it does show some promise.\n\nGraphically the game looks mostly top-notch. The interior of the ship's cabin are well detailed with high resolution textures and great quality models. You'll find all the small intricacies that you would in a real ship, switches, knobs, GPS, etc, which helps with immersion. The water and weather effects are also some great stuff as well. Though the ship's interior, and the ships them selves show some good quality, the game isn't 100% consistent at the moment. Some of the environmental models, such as buildings, the docks, and streets, are very low polygon and features low resolution textures. I'm hoping that these lacking elements in the visuals are just place holders until a later / final build. Audio wise I got no complaints as the sound effects are realistic with great background noises from the boat's motor and the sounds of the ocean itself keeping you company.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, It's surprisingly easy to learn and to get adjusted to, as the main controls is "WASD". Some ships will feature the option of more intricate controls with the num pad, allowing you to manipulate each of the ship's engines individually. Even at it's early stage, the game does a good job at simulating what it's like to drive a ship...for better or worst. I say this because, though the game achieves good results as a simulation, due to what it's simulating it may make it an incompatible for some gamers. Unlike Euro Truck Simulator, where you have the micromanagement of traffic, following traffic laws, avoiding cars, etc, European Ship Simulator is mostly "set sails to full" then auto-pilot straight. There will be lulls where you are simply doing nothing but watching the waves as you wait for your ship to arrive in a straight line to your destination. For enthusiast of simulation games or sailing, this won't be an issue, as that demographic probably already understand this before jumping in, but for the average gamer who is just curious to this game, know that this is a simulation before it's a game.\n\nCurrently at the time of this impression (version 633), there isn't much in the way of options, graphics, or audio, and there is only 4 missions available with no linking campaign or side features. This is early access I do understand, but at the same time I think it's fair to let people know that in it's current state, it is the bare minimum.\n\nOverall, European Ship Simulator shows a lot of promise, that I think will shape up to be some thing quite interesting. But currently, it does feel rather unfinished. If you are a simulation game or ship/boat enthusiast, it might be worth your cash to check it out, even in it's early stages, but for every one else, keep an eye on it, but wait for later versions or even it's final release.\n\nPros:\n- Mostly realistic and high quality visuals\n- Feels realistic\n- Varied amount of ships are enjoyable to cruise around in\n- Shows promise of a bright future\n\nCons:\n- Visual quality not 100% consistent\n- Feels very incomplete currently (ver: 633)\n- Subject matter might not be as universally appearling as Euro Truck Simulator","December 1, 2014","true","2.5"," 38 of 65 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","38","65","7","0"

The ships are beautiful and the water looks amazing. The landscape is also ok. Furthermore the ships are moving quite realistic! *You feel a bit like a captain*\n\nNegative: At the moment the whole game is a bit bugged and about three minutes after starting the game it crashes.\n\nAll in all I recommend it because the animations are great and I hope that the bugs (especially the crash after three minutes) will be fixed soon.\n\nEdit:\n\nSince the last update it isn't crashing anymore and now all graphics work very well! But it is still a bit laggy although i changed the graphic settings on "low" (but that is maybe my computer...).\n\nI also made now some playing experiences:\n\nPositive: The animation of the ship, the water and the ports are great. You might think it is real. Furthermore the sounds are also very good.\n\nNegative: In my eyes it is a bit too easy to sail the ship. All moves, like acceleration, breaking, turning and so on, are performed very fast by the ship (quite likeley that those movements are performed too fast for a big ship like the ferry). Furthermore the ferry mission is very easy; I don't even have to stand close to the port to finish the mission. It is enough to get close to the port with the back of the ship.\n\nAll in all, I keep recommending the game because the animations are awesome and I think/hope that there will be coming way more content in the future.","November 27, 2014","true","7.0"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","14","20","3","2"

I am pretty sure my graphics are on high / ultra, and it looks like it was made back in the 12th Century. It is possibly the slowest, most tedious game i have ever played to date. The missions are not too bad i guess, but they take ages to complete, and the control over the ships is awful. They are really slow, which wouldn't be so bad f the scenery was nice, but even that is a pixelated blob of colour. I will be honest, i don't have a moniter, i use a TV screen, that is like 7 years old, so that may explain a bit of the bad graphic quality, but nonetheless, it is not a game that grabs me. Better off getting Euro Truck Simulator, though by now i imagine most people that will see this have already got Euro Truck Simulator 2. Oh well, American Truck Simulator cam out the other day, get that instead.\n\nP.S. I have not played American Truck Simulator long enough yet to comment fairly on it, so maybe wait until i give the all clear :) Or just...you know, read someone elses review of it :)","February 4","false","0.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Now that early access is here with three missions to play I must say the wait was worth it. From the graphics to the physics of the ships to the ambient sounds makes this title very enjoyable so far.\n\nAs will all early access games there will be some glitches that appear in the game and the devs encourage reporting these as they happen to help remove them from the final product.\n\nI preview the Tug Boat mission on a Lets Play and really enjoyed the mission. There could be some minor tweaks on the ropes that connect to the ships that you are tasked to tug and  I am sure that the devs will continue to strive to perfect this game.\n\nOverall this game has so much potential and I encourage anyone who enjoys simulator games to give this a try- you wont be disappointed in my opinion.

The graphics are excellent, and it is a challenge to operate your ship right. Being a game in development, there are still some things to work on. Based on my limited experience with the game I do have some thoughts. See my comments in the suggestion forum.\n\nMy concern is that this game becomes just a mission oriented simulator. Driving the same ship, over the same course, at the same time of day, with the same weather, with the same AI ships in the same positions, with the same sea state… you get the picture. It will quickly get put away and not played.\n\nIf it becomes a true simulator, with a purpose for my ship to leave the harbor, and ability to sail to multiple ports in a variety of conditions, then this sim will be fantastic.\n\nI always thought: build it and they will come. Look what happened to MS Flight Simulator and Kerbal Space Program when they opened it up for developers to mod! Wow!! Both are sensational products. ESS has the same potential. Let’s see where it goes….  It all depend on the budget and capabilities and desire of the producers.\n\nFor now I like what I see.\n\nGrandpa1955.","December 31, 2014","true","10.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","1"

However, the game could have been so much more, but a dispute during development spoiled all that.  I had no trouble installing or playing the game.  I have decent frame rates on the highest settings and have not had a crash as of yet.\n\nPros:  The graphics are very good and easily on par with FSX and are more like Silent Service 5.  The bridges are very nicely done indeed and remind me of some of the addon planes cockpits that I have for FSX.  Highly detailed, large in some cases and very nicely executed.  The exterior orbit camera mode is very nice too and the ships look very good.  I am not a sailor, but the player ships do seem to move very well and are not overly responsive.  There are even seaguls flying around the ports.\n\nCons:  No freeroam mode with missions only.  There are not a lot of missions either, but there is step by step guide on the Steam Forum to teach you how to create your own missions.  I could not find any downloadable missions, addons or mods on the internet.  You are locked into the bridge and cannot wander about the ships (fair enough - you are stuck in the cockpit in FSX as well).  There is no career mode or campaign.  The water within the ports should be far calmer than the outside sea.  That is the whole point of the water break haven walls!  The water break on the bows of the ships is static and stays in place even when the bow is lifting up out of the sea on the crest of a wave.  It does not move with the level of the sea.  There are no other crew members or people to be seen, nor is there any radio traffic, so it is a bit lonely and quiet.  There is no full world out there (hence no free roam), just some routes built in to enable travel to and from specific ports only.  The other AI ships have a ridiculously amazing ability to turn on the spot at speed.  Not very realistic to watch a large container carrier turning on a sixpence like a jet-ski.  There are far too many controls, buttons and screens in the bridge which do not work and are not interactive.  Lastly, the Time Jump button is only active for a short time.  If you do not use it in time, you will have to do the entire voyage in real time!\n\nConclusion:  This game by graphics is streets ahead of it's intended successor 'World Ship Simulator' which looks very childish and rudimentary by comparison to this game.  The fact is, this game could have been so much more.  The day will come when someone finally makes a ship simulator along the lines of FSX and X-Plane.  This game could have a full world out there, with more controls working in the bridge.  It could have been done in such a way that other developers get involved with building addon ports, ships with fully working bridges, interactive port communications as per FSX, etc and giving some of the take to this games developers.  Just as we have with FSX.  A missed opportunity there.  I have Ship Simulator 2008 which is let down by it's old graphics and I also have the early access 'World Ship Simulator'.  So far, European Ship Simulator knocks the socks of those in terms of beauty and bridge detail.  For it's current price of £5 ($7.50) on sale at time of writing, it is well worth a look.","May 28","true","8.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The third scenario (bulk carrier) from Calais to Dover was slightly difficult to find the right position for the scenario to end, but I did it in the end.\n\nGameplay is really good; at the moment it's more about manouvering your ship around port, as you can skip the bits at sea. Would be nice to see some traffic on the channel since as well as being one of the busiest sea lanes in the world, it is meant to be quite challenging to cross with traffic coming from all directions. I'm sure things like this will come in time though.\n\nSome tips:\nThe green arrow on the map points at where you need to go, not the direction of the ship (which is the black underneath). You can hit 'P' to get a waypoint marker, but it's usually off-map, and the green arrow is less obtrusive.\n\nLearn the keys - they aren't that complicated (basically WASD and keypad) and it makes it much easier to control the ship precisely.\n\nWhen you do the tug mission, click 'T' produces some markers on your boat. You then need to drag a line to the vesselyou are towing to connect a line. Don't make it too short like I did, otherwise you end up pulling the front of the vessel down as you tow it :-) You can also push with the tug boat.\n\n","November 22, 2014","true","7.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

I would say that if you are looking for a fast and furious action type simulation, this game isn't for you.  I you are looking for a realistic simulator designed to test your skills at navigating ships, then this is one to buy.  The graphics are good for an early release game and the physics of the ships seems pretty accurate.  I have owned boats most of my life and I would day that they control pretty much as I would think a ship would with the exception of the tug boat which seems a little overpowered.  The modeling of the water is incredible.  You really get the feeling that you are out on the ocean in the weather and waves.\n\nHere is my wish list for this game:\n\nThe ability to visit different ports to pick up jobs instead of having the game be all mission based.\n\nIf the game is going to be mission based, include a mission builder to allow third party down loadable missions.\n\nIt would be nice to have the ability to walk around the entire vessel instead of being confined to the bridge.\nImproved physics for the tug boat so that moving a large freighter isn't as easy as it seems now.\n\nI look forward to the updates to see what the developers have in store for this game!","December 24, 2014","true","18.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Anyway I bit the bullet and am very pleased.  I have a fairly average PC, but it has still allowed me to crank the graphics right up.  Admittedly, there was some chop in early 'missions' immediately after installation, however, a full defrag and restart cured that.\n\nI work in the commercial shipping industry, and quite enjoy this game.  As far as "simulation" goes, it is a nice simplified ship driving game without too much depth that I use to kill time.  Do not expect procedural realism, but you will get a genuine appreciation for the techniques required to move the included vessels around in their daily work.\n\nIf you are wondering about your PC specs, I have an AMD A10 processor, 8GB DDR3 and an ATI R9270 and it works perfectly with room for more.  The difference between the LOW and HIGH graphics options in-game isn't huge either so most modern PCs should run it with nice visuals.","March 12, 2015","true","9.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

It's a fair amount of fun if you're into this kind of nerdy stuff. The only concern I have right now is the fact that the devs have already fully released this game.\n\nI bought this game while it was in Early Access because it seemed very promising. It's a decent simulator with devs that listened to input from the community. When I opened up Steam to see that this game had been released like I ♥♥♥♥ a brick. This game is in no way ready for release. I expected to put another few months of work into this game before releasing it. Right now, there is a minimalistic amount of content, and there are just way too many things that need to be polished. Seriously, it's currently an unfinished game. Until new content comes out and this game becomes a proper simulator, I would not really suggest you buy it unless you're so strapped with cash that you roll your joints with hundred dollar bills. I'm disappointed in the devs for releasing this game so premature, but seeing that they still have new content coming, maybe it's not so bad.\n\nDEVS CAN YOU FIX THE WAKE BEHIND BOATS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS QUITE UGLY.","February 20, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Considering it's a simulation I expected a lot more realism and attention to detail. Now it's basically a "go from point A to B" kind of game and all-in-all everything feels very unrewarding.\n\nI was really hoping I would be able to navigate my ships through some rough waters, battling the waves and fighting with the forces of nature. But the water in this game is pretty static and the weather effects are (as far as I can tell) purely visual.\n\nGraphically everything looks very unpolished. The bridge interiors and ships look okay, but other than that everything looks pretty bland and unfinished.  The UI is horrendous and handling the controls is very tricky. The graphic options are limited and not what you would expect from a current generation game (for example: no real-time shadows, no AA, low resolution reflections).\n\nThe developer has announced that this game will leave early access soon, which seems odd because there's still a lot of work to be done before it can leave the alpha stage.\nDefinitely not worth the money at this point.","February 14, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","1"

As other reviewers have said, there is almost no actual game here to play. Essentially, every single "mission" is just "go from marker A to marker B. Done. Now go from marker B to marker C. etc." There is no real difference in playing the various ships (from a speedboat to a tanker vessel) other than their speed in getting from point A to point B. This game needs a lot more content, mainly in the form of context and rewards for getting from point A to point B, before it will be much fun.","March 8, 2015","false","2.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Said it was coming out in Augest but actuly came out in November, but toataly worth the wait. I have spent a lot of time getting use to at first, seeing that I crashed into the pier the first few times. Only three big suggestions I would make at this point. They are:\n\n1.ADD A TUTORIAL! There is no real tutorial at the start, you are just expected to know how to play.\n2.Add a free drive mode. Have a free drive mode were use can just drive a speedboat around or something.\n3.Add controler support.

A couple glaring issues is the physics model.  When making quick S turns in a small boat, the boat will tip from side to side.  In this simulator the boat stays perfectly level which is highly unrealistic.  The other thing I noticed was a lack of options?  Where is the anti aliasing?  Turning it on via the Nvidia Control Panel doesn't seem to work for this game.   Now I'm not totally negative, I do like the selection of ships, and the models look very nice.  I also enjoy the ship traffic, and the weather modeling is very good.  So this game does definitly have some things going for it.  I hope it continues to be worked on and patched and more features added.  I really wish that it hadn't been released prematurely.

The first being the inclusion of independent control for port and starboard azimuth steering units, as found on the Tug, though unfortunely let down by the clear fact this game's developers obviously don't know exacly how these units work in real life. The second, possibly more obvious one, being the distinct lack of bugs which were a notorious problem with the Vstep simulator. As far as thing go thats about it for being ahead of it's (dormant) competition.\nWhere graphics are concerned this game isn't too bad, all things considered, it's fairly level with the Vstep one, though I would consider Vstep to be slightly ahead. So far I can't say I've found much in the way of issues with the physics, but I may be wrong. However there are a few things with the physics and general effects that could do with attention, such as for some reason the ships seem to create a bow wave when going astern (reversing), and one thing I found when I came along side the cargo ship in the first tug mission, I lightly brushed the side of the ship with the side of the tug, a move that would be fairly common place in reality, resulted in severe damage and caused me to sink. In reality the tug would be fitted with rubber fenders, as can actually be seen on it's sides in the game, which are there to dampen any very light brushes resulting in minimal damage, if any.\nThis game has a little more in the way of interactive/functional controls on the bridge, though frankly their functions being fairly unrealistic, such as light and horn switches. The horn seems to operate on a repeating pulse setting when turned on and won't stop until turned off again. Personally I think they missed a trick here as they could have opted for a selective horn signalling system as used on real ships, one-uping Vstep. The lighting is something they really put no though into as it only turns on a few deck lights, not the more obvious navigation lights.\nThe steering isn't that great, though thankfully is much better than the horrible control setup of Ship Simulator:  Maritime Search and Rescue. One rather nice touch with the controls is that both the throttle and steering are set so that they take time to complete their movments, as in real life, rather than just instand full rudder or power. The steering/rudder angle on the featured ships only goes up to 10 degrees in either direction, both poor and unrealistic as the typical maximum rudder angle for the average ship is 40-45 degrees, as reflected in the Vstep game. As I mentioned before, the developers of this game decided to include the use of azimuth steering units with certain vessels, as did Vstep, but unlike Vstep did have enough of a brainwave to program in individual steering control, but unfortunately They don't actually know how these units work, where as Vstep do. Just to clear up, an azimuth unit is effectively a pod fitted with a propeller mounted under the ship which can be rotated though 360 degrees thus eliminating the need for a rudder or reverse gear and giving the ship better agility than with a conventional rudder and fixed-shaft propeller setup.\nJust like the Vstep shipsim, this on comes with a mission editor. At first it seems quite simple to use but I still haven't got the hang of it, so I suspect looks may be deceiving, also not really helped by the camera being in a fixed birds-eye-view, only the height above ground being ajustable. Good luck to anyone who can figure it out.\n\nTo sum it all up this game does have potential here, but I'm not convinced by it. The best thing the developers of this game could do is have a good long shot with Vsteps (now possibly abandoned or furgotten, jugging by their website) Ship Simulator series and see where this game has to improve. So I don't recommend this game, at least not yet.\n\nInstead I recommend you try out one of the Ship Simulator series from Vstep, The newest one Ship Simulator Extremes (2009 release) being available on Steam, but be prepared for bugs/glitches which are likely to appear.\n","February 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The Ship Physics are totally unrealistic, and a lot of People ( i included) told the Developers in the Forums, that some things a more then wrong, but they did not change it. One simple thing is, that the Engine from (i think it was the ferry) goes up to 4000 RPM, and that is totally unrealistic (the real Maximum of a single Marine Diesel is aprox. 650 RPM). The Speed must be shown of the propeller shaft and not such Fantasy Values like 4000 RPM. Then its funny, that you can drive the heavy Ships like a Car, and the Steering of a heavy weight Ship is like driving a Go-Cart. All this shows me, that the Developers never really invested Time to make some inquiries about the Physics and Basics of a real Ship. Also funny is the Cruise Ship, if you have 0% Power on the Engines, the Ship brakes immediately like a Car within a few Meters. Everybody who has a little bit physical appreciation knows, that you cant stop such a big and heavy Ship within a few Meters so easy.\n\nWell positive is, that the Graphics are better as in SSE, and that they implemented some famous Ports in Europe, like Rotterdam, Hamburg and Rostock.","February 26, 2015","false","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its not really a simulator and the missions are lacking details, and its boring with little replay value - Even completing a mission gives no rewards (its just misison over) or even a points or scoring system. Other ships have no AI and use predetermined parameters meaning they go the same way every time and physics between the different boats does not seem to change much (they all seem to turn too quickly). Its also far too easy to sink a ship by tapping a dock. Game optimization is awful with task manager showing it using 1.8GB RAM and 93% CPU (on a Core i5) taking my CPU to 100%. Judging by the other games the Developer has made (one where Speed Bumps was one of the major features of the game) I now get the impression they do not have the technical skill (or finances) to make this game have the basic features the community have been asking for (realistic physics, steering wheel support, in cockpit HUD, Maps), where this game is missing many basic features that were present in the last generation of Ship Simulators. I will however praise the dev for updates and being active in the games forums and replying to people (I wish all companies were like this), although more often than not the reply is negative, stating they are a small team with little finances and the feature will not be added. These days any kind of simulator is a massive undertaking as ETS2 has really raised the bar. I just get the feeling they are in a bit over their heads and a game like this is too ambitious for this developer.","March 6, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My personall favorite thing to do is sink a ship full of passengers. The game is pretty enjoyable at times, and can be fustrating when new to the controls. If a free roam/open world element were to be added where you could explore the open sea and own your own boat buisness and start by driving other peoples boats until you have enough money to buy your own and then you could hire others to work for you, and then when you get to a certain point in the game, just explore without the worry of losing money since your employees will be making you endless amounts of money. Or a Euro Truck Simulator but with boats. It's definitally worth a buy if your into boats and driving them.\n\nTL;DR?\n7/10, would sink again.","January 20, 2015","true","0.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","1"

For these people, it'll probably be like heaven. At first. Currently there are only a few missions to play but since this is an Early Access-game, it's totally understandable. Some missions have a time limit, if you exceed it by 1 second, it doesn't matter if you played for like.. 2 hours. Mission failed, that's all, plus an immediate return to the homescreen. The graphics are still quite buggy and unoptimized. But hey, it's Early Access.\nWhat really annoys me though is that the developer seems to focus on new content, not on bug fixes. And of course, it takes a loooot of time to create new content. Meanwhile you have a buggy game with a couple of missions, and perhaps every month a new mission. That is what I see here right now. CTDs are quite common, happens to me 70% of tries to play a mission, it crashes within the first 10 seconds.\nWhat I fear is that the game might become like the other ship simulators. Buggy, repetitive games with minimal content in terms of different things to do on the vessel.\nAlso, there are only the Steam Forums to communicate with the developer and well, I haven't seen him responding to any recommendations whatsoever on what to change in the game.\nI think it is great that there's finally someone who wants to bring a new ship simulator to the market, but at the moment, I cannot recommend the average player to buy it, especially at this price. Wait a couple of months until major enhancements have (hopefully) been made so that you can see in which direction the game goes: the old Ship Simulator games or something new and really different.\n\n// Update: 13.02.2015 - I was quite astonished when the developer announced that the game will leave early access next week, which means that it'll be on steam as an officially finished game. Although the developer said that they'll "continue to work" on it, I do not think that this is a good way for a game. It still has minimalistic content and is very unoptimized, containing disastrous bugs such as the horizon which is full of weird blue lines, flickering around and destroying the game's atmosphere. They have not been able to fix these for months. And how can you say that the game is finished when even the menus of some indie games made on unity look better than this one?","December 20, 2014","false","7.3"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","4"

Criminally unstable and buggy, and I say that not because I don't expect an alpha game to be buggy, but it often makes to where 5% of my mission attempts actually let me finish a mission without crashing or locking up. There is also no save function(manual or automatic, so you will lose your progress.)\nThere is also effectively no settings menu. Low, Medium, and High and none of them seem to affect how the game looks. No vsync, reflections, distance, AA, nothing.\n\nThe game certainly looks pretty, water reflections and physics are nice. Sitting inside the tug boat out in the ocean feels very realistic, however the actual buildings and cities a long the coast look like something from HotWheels Crash. It performs really well on my system, but that's something I'd expect, again looks nice, but not amazing.\n\nThe game has nice sounds, the roar of the engines below and the horn on the ships all sound fitting, though that's mostly all you'll hear. That and seagulls for hours because the skip time function will probably break for you as well.\n\nLike I started with, it's a decent start, but under no circumstances would I suggest a casual player to purchase this. Only someone who is a big fan of ships and ocean simulators. Even then, they will probably go through all the content very quickly.\n\nLaunching February 2015 seems pretty soon, wait for launch before taking the dive off the starboard.","November 30, 2014","false","3.7"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","3"

It would be really fine if it was still under Early Access, but sadly it is not anymore. This is not the final product I was expecting.\n\nHere's an example, starting my tug mission at somewhat 13:00 hours, it should be bright outside. But it feels like dusk. The brightness and daylight is wrong. I start moving my tug to two ships that collided a few miles from my position. The movement of the ship in the water feels superficial, as there is no proper wake and although the bow wake seems fine, it still needs work. The water displacement, which you would expect from a couple of tons ship is barely noticeable. There is also water transparency missing.  A few other simulator and games have done a better job at wake too, like Total War: Rome 2, Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm, Silent Hunter Series, and even Spintires(The best water simulation and wake I've seen in a while).\n\nMoving forward...\nThere is no depth radar, and only basic instrumentation. Reaching the two ships I receive the order to attach my tug boat to one of them. Sure, the line attached to my boat is also bugged, as in it doesn't look tied but like a big gigantic straight piece of rope glued to the ship.\n\nMoving on, a few minutes later a Coast Guard ship collides with the ship being towed. Showed no desire to slow down or deviate from the collision. In fact, it kept going even when it still collided to my towed ship.\n\nA few minutes later, my ship and the towed ship jumps around and I'm suddenly sinking!\n\nI hope the devs doesn't get dishearten over their product, because there are still a lot of love in it.

A few games that managed to nail wakes, that I've seen are Silent Hunter 3/4/5, Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm(dynamic wakes) and Spintires(Dynamic wakes), and I would love to see that beautifully well-formed foam around the ship, giving a sense of movement, or that you are displacing tons of water.\n\nAnd the developer's approach to the community and how they are handling criticism, suggestion and even the comments are very commendable.

I have helmed ships big and small in real life and have to say that the reactions to engine and helm are spot on. This is the best shipping simulator I have been on. Graphics are brilliant, plenty of single player missions and the ability to build your own missions as well. The 3d enviroment within the bridge of each ship is stunning, and controls whilst simplistic, are sufficient for anyone. The introductory mission of tug and tow, is quite accurate, and the final "nesting" of the  cargo freighter into its assigned berth is testing but fun using both towing skills, knowing when to drop the tow, and final pushing along the hull to adjust freighters position. In real terms, these jobs on full size vessels must be done slowly and with care to avoid accident or damage, this is reflected in what you do here. For a fun game simulator, I was a bit dubious about purchasing at firest, but now I am glad that I got it.","March 15","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the game is playable but it lacks depth in the missions with little more than different routes to sail. This game could be great but in its current state it's a little lack luster for a full released game.\n\n-----\n\nReally enjoying this simulator so far. Many simulations dissapoint but not this one. The developers want to create the best ship simulator and they are off to a flying start.\n\nAs of release there are just 3 missions allowing you to get inside the vessel and become a captain. Graphics are great, can you change views from inside and outside the vessel, gameplay is smooth, and no crashing or problems with the simulator.\n\nIf you like ETS2 you'll most likely enjoy this too!\n\nKeep in mind this is currently in alpha so it's in early stages of development and not finshed. If you want all the bells and whistles of the sim then wait till development is complete.\n\nOtherwise come on board and sail the seven seas!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKmiHiXQKtc","November 24, 2014","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
