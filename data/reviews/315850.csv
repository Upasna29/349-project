The goal is simple; save your dad, the King. And to do this you’ll have to get past castle levels with icy floors, spikes and water streams that slow you down, among a bunch of other environmental hazards, and all of this while fighting off enemies.\n\nThe thing that makes this platformer stand out from other platformers is the fact that you, besides using a sword to eliminate enemies, can kill enemies by throwing them into one another and that way create combos. But both methods can be used to do this.\nThe higher the combos the higher the XP you receive. Don’t think this is yet another game with RPG elements in them, because it’s really basic and you could hardly call it an RPG element if you know what it’s precisely used for. You see, the XP you receive will level up your character but instead of gaining extra strength, more stamina or I don’t know what, your character will just gain 2 extra health points every time she levels up. Health is one of the key factors of the game, because there are a lot of enemies and, with a few exceptions, they all have their own moves. So you have to take into consideration that an enemy standing on a platform above you could easily hit you with an arrow or that another creature could send a wave of flames your way while you’re standing on a small ledge. The enemies get tougher as you progress so it’s only natural that you grow ‘stronger’ too. Later on you might think 2 health points is really too little and I’d have to agree with you. It’s practically nothing because all of the enemies inflict more damage than that. Still, things shouldn’t be too simple and replaying certain parts of a level is part of the game’s design. Completing a single level will allow you to level up quite a few times mind you.\nThere are several checkpoints to be found in every level and you’ll continue the game from the last checkpoint should you choose to quit the game. No need to replay the entire level again, which is a big plus.\nBut around level 3 or 4 the game will also rely on some trial and error aspects that I’m not a fan of (dropping down and hoping you’ll fall where you’re supposed to go). Thankfully you’re usually near a checkpoint when that happens so it should only take a couple of tries, but it’s a cheap gameplay tactic that this game doesn’t really need.\n\nAmazing Princess Sarah takes a lot of time getting used to control wise. No, the controls aren’t hard at all. But if you’re going to play this with a controller the analog stick is best avoided because it’s highly inaccurate. Instead of using the stick use the D-Pad instead, it works so much better, especially for sections where you have to jump from tiny platform to tiny platform (sometimes even with enemies on them). You wouldn’t believe how many times I fell off or slipped off a ledge because the game didn’t respond to my key presses quickly enough. Rage Quitters, beware.\n\nGraphically it’s nothing amazing. It has pixel graphics which look alright, but I’ve seen many other games with better graphics than this. They do, however, fit the game, like many other games in this genre. Pixel graphics just seem like a popular choice among platform games in general. The bosses, on the other hand, seem to use a different kind of art, and it’s noticeable and even a little bit distracting.\nThe quality of the sounds is also fairly basic. Your character will make a sound when hit or when she dies and then there’s the game over sound and the sound you make when throwing stuff. That’s about it I think. Then again, this is pretty usual stuff for games with visuals like this.\nThe music is, unfortunately, also nothing to write home about and feels generic. Well, to me at least.\n\nThis is not a big game. It has just 5 levels, each one ends with a boss fights, and each level will take about 30-45 minutes to complete. So in total it has 3-4 hours of playtime. I personally think this is the ideal length for a game like this. Any longer and the game would’ve lost its charm (i.e. the game mechanic of throwing around enemies would’ve worn thin by then).\nFortunately, for those that can’t get enough it the developer has integrated New Game+  into the game which should give you a better ending (that is what’s being implied) while also throwing some new stuff your way, like adding a chasing ghost of Sarah (which you have to avoid) or giving you the ability to double jump, at the cost of having enemies with more health and/or that you can’t use your sword.\n\nThe Amazing Princess Sarah doesn’t do anything to reinvigorate the genre, but it’s a fun game nevertheless and short enough so that anyone can pretty much finish it. I enjoyed it for what is was, but just remember to play this with a controller and, most important of all, with the D-Pad. It will save you a lot of frustration, trust me.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","August 18, 2014","true","4.9"," 87 of 101 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","87","101","2","3"

But there is no option to disable vsync.\n* The jump has a fixed height. You have air control, but the movement feels fast and imprecise. Good luck jumping on moving and disappearing platforms.\n* The melee attack has a very short range. Since you move too fast, sometimes it is hard to get close enough to attack without being hit.\n* You can jump on top of some enemies, but that just bounces you back up; it does not damage them. However, given how imprecise the controls are, it is very likely you will miss and get hurt.\n* You can pick up some objects or dead enemies and throw them. However, the throwing has a fixed angle/distance, you can't throw in any direction. Also, some objects/enemies are heavier (but some stuff that looks large and heavy is not heavy, such as a table, a wardrobe or a clock).\n* When there are multiple overlapping objects/enemies to pick up, Sarah never picks up the one that I expected.\n* There is a water river in castle 3. The water current will move you, but it won't move any object or dead enemy. That's an arbitrary design decision that makes no sense and breaks the player intuition.\n* The water continues to move you sideways even while you are jumping and not touching the water anymore.\n* The fire enemy survives water.\n* The camera tries to help by moving a bit further while you are moving, but the effect is that the camera looks drunk. Also, there are many traps outside the camera view.\n* Unskippable cut-scenes that pause the action for too long with nothing happening. That intro animation before the main menu shows up? Unskippable. That boss animation? Takes a while doing nothing. That Game Over screen? Get used to it, it takes a while to get back to action.\n* Cheap traps, such as a dozen moving platforms with random bats moving around and spikes at the bottom.\n* Bosses requires too many hits, so that the boss fights become boring.\n* Bosses feel unpolished. The lava attack from the flying demon boss destroys any enemies, even those that are safe under the platform. However, in the Cursed mode, bats still spawn behind the lava and you can't see them until they hit you. The head animation from the knight from castle 5 is buggy (it starts flying back even when the player is picking it up, and then it teleports back to the player; a second head drops down even after the boss is defeated if it is defeated while throwing the head).\n* Very disappointing true last boss fight.\n* Random crashes.\n\nOverall, this game induces rage-quit feelings. It is not complete garbage, but it is not polished enough.\n\nOn the bright side, the graphics are good. If this game was made by just one person alone, congratulations! Making and releasing a game is not easy.","January 28, 2015","false","16.4"," 61 of 74 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","61","74","0","1"

You look at the title-screen for this game and what do you see? A Princess. That's right, Sarah is a Princess, she's got the tiara, that's her castle in the background, and she's the daughter of a king. Now that we're done establishing the obvious let's talk about the game.\n\nPLOT: The King has been kidnapped by liliths, are you a bad enough princess to save the king?\n\nWhat makes Sarah so amazing is that she lifts. No really, she can hoist furniture as well as corpses over her head and toss them around. She also has a sword, which is used to make corpses. Depending on the type, enemy corpses have different properties when they're thrown. The most devastating are the liliths, as their bodies are highly volatile and damage everything on-screen. There are five stages, five bosses, a few hundred enemies, a bunch of checkpoints. I did the math and came to the following conclusion: getting through this game should be easy peasy lemon squeezy.  Turns out the math was wrong, Amazing Princess Sarah isn't that easy (that didn't sound right).\n\nThis isn't Super Meat Boy, let alone I wanna be the Boshy, but the enemies do hit hard, pits are on the prevalent side, and you have to make do with a fairly limited pool of health. Candles hold life-replenishing hearts, but uh...they restore 2 HP. Sarah can also level-up, which adds....2 HP. Seriously though she also gets stronger, allowing her to do more damage with her throws and sword. The first play-through is liable to be a bit of a struggle. Eventually however things start to click. Enemies operate by specific rules. They don't attack unless they're facing you, so you can sneak up behind them with murderous intent. Archers only fire where you're standing, so move an inch and watch that arrow pass you by. You'll even figure out the trick to avoiding the stage 5 boss as he stomps around. Holding onto a corpse for the right situation can also prevent a headache or two.\n\nBut that's not enough I'm afraid, you have to play New Game+ if you want to end the lilith menace once and for all. Hey, New Game+, play through the game again with all your level-ups? It's going to be Weekend at Bernie's! Well yeah, it is, except you're Bernie. There are multiple NG+ modes, and they get more difficult as you progress. In the first one, an invincible ghost follows you around. In the second , you're drunk, and it looks like your castle is on a boat in the middle of a storm. The third time around you receive a sweet double-jump, but get slapped with a stringent time-limit. Fourth time around? Your sword is only good for killing bats, and bats are lousy weapons. At this point I'm just doing my best to skip past enemies. I still have a few more play-throughs to go, but they all sound even worse.\n\nAmazing Princess Sarah is a follow-up to Akane the Kunoichi, same engine and everything. In every aspect it's an improvement. The controls are less slick, there's a better sense of challenge, and it's less repetitive. Yes, even though I've played through this game 4.6 times it's less repetitive than a game I played through once*. Some parts of the game can be frustrating, mainly when it involves picking up an object, hurling it, and it collides with a low ceiling instead of a monster. There are a couple other issues, namely crashes (at the 5th boss usually), and the stage 4 music is LOUD.\n\nThis is a good game. Just do yourself a favor and look past the fact that she's a princess. Is it really that big a deal?\n\n\n\n*If you're going to be that guy and check my Steam achievements, I played through the Xbox Live Indie Games version of Akane the Kunoichi. I even got all of those freakin' kimonos.","November 8, 2014","true","10.2"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","37","46","7","0"

Isnt that a gurly game?"\n\nI really liked Akane the Kunoichi and while looking on the store I found Amazing Princess Sarah which was also made by Haruneko Entertainment. So I thought to myself "Lets buy this game dude!". Unlike some other people who have posted bad reviews about this game I quickly switched the default controls into something more realistic because I can honestly say that the default controls were really bad. Best way to play it is to use a Xbax controller anyways.\n\nThis game pretty much blew my mind on so many levels of happiness and frustration. The game is surprisingly fun to play and will pretty much kick your ♥♥♥ over and over again. In this sidescroller you play as Princess Sarah and need to save your father(The King) from the demon mistress Lilith.\n\nSarah's main weapon is a sword. The button can be tapped fast to multiple fast hits. Sarah also has the ability to pick objects and fallen enemies up and throw them.\n\nThere are 5 castle levels and each end with a big epic boss fight. The levels contains your standard enemies in the form of skeletons, zombies, flying demon chicks(They are hot), dudes that walk back and forth while dropping bombs, Big dudes that walk really slow unless they see you, flame sprite chicks that throw fire, archer dudes that shot arrows through the walls and ground, ghosts that walk around in armor, some flying ghost thing that you cant hit with your sword and those BATS THAT FLY ALL OVER THE ♥♥♥♥ING PLACE!\n\nThe enemy and level layout is planned really well and killing an enemy makes it possible to pick their body up and throw at other enemies. Throwing some enemies like for example the flaming sprite chick will cause a fire attack to hurt the enemies that it hits. There is sort of a rpg element because get xp from killing enemies and you can level up which makes you gain +2 health points to your health bar.\n\nThe game reminds me alot of Castlevania: Symphony of the night the way the game pauses for a moment when you level up and the design is simulair. You can also break candles to get hearts out of them to recover your health.\n\nSince my last reviews ive gotten some real constructive critisim that I will take use of now. So I will mention the Pros and Cons ^^.\n\nPros:\nFemale protagonist\nVariety in levels\nReally epic and fitting music on some levels\nEpic boss fights\nGreat gameplay\nUnique gamemodes that you can unlock after you beat the game.\n\nCons:\nHealthdrops(Hearts) recover 2 hp.\nThe music fades out to nothing before fading back in.\nTo short recovery time after being hit.\nSome huge objects can be throw far and others not.\n\nI have still not fully beaten the game since when you beat it the first time you unlock a new gamemode and after beating the game on that gamemode you unlock another gamemode and Im on the 5th gamemode so far and there is 2 more that I have yet to unlock so I guess its 7 gamemodes in total. Each of these gamemodes gives you a new challenge by adding a twist to the game. Some of these gamemodes adds a positive twist as well.\n\nOften when I start this game up or simply when im just playing it people ask me "Skill why you play that game? Isnt that a gurly game?" and other times people mention the boob art on the title screen like "Woah Skill its that boobgame!". Please dont base your judgement on names or apperences. Sure there are as a matter of fact boob physics on Sarah and even the enemies in the game. But lets not attract the videogame journalists shall we?\n\nI give this game a 8/10","January 23, 2015","true","26.4"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","41","53","8","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/recommended/315850/","shoggofu","YouTube shoggofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/","257 products in account","I've played this game for two hours so far and made it to the third of five castles. It's pretty good.\n- It's has a simple concept, aside from being able to hurl fallen enemies it's a very basic platformer\n- Platforming is challenging, I died a lot, sometimes it was frustrating but it's reasonably fair and it didn't make me want to quit\n\nhttp://youtu.be/IZQkEcFtg3s\nAside from throwing bodies you can jump and use a basic sword attack. There is a good variety of enemies from the very beginning and throughout the game. This helped to make it more interesting.\n-----Platforming was hard. You have to avoid and deal with various enemies while you are jumping around, which made things complicated. There were several sections which I had difficulty with, at each one I died at at least 10-15 times. In the first castle there is room in which you must scale a series of small moving platforms. I constantly fell off them back to the bottom, just touching the stick on my gamepad slightly would often send my character dashing off these surfaces. This is the reason I say platforming in this game is *reasonably* fair not simply fair. I felt that the in that section the platforms might need to be a little bit bigger. But aside from that, yes I do think the platforming is fair. I enjoyed platforming in later sections more.\n-----Okay there is one thing that I think the needs to be changed, the bats. I spent 15 minutes trying to do another one of those moving platform sections and was failing over and over again. The bats that fly at you make it very difficult. Unlike other enemies they continually respawn. They move up and down so it’s really hard to time your attacks to hit them sometimes. It is especially difficult to kill bats when you are standing on a platform. If you turn around to face the right direction you will fall into a pit of spike and have to start the section again. So I think they should at least not respawn.\n-----There are checkpoints which are reasonably frequent. You have unlimited lives so you can return to them as many times as you need. Sometimes the game is a bit cruel though. For example I was caught unawares by some bottomless pits at the end of a long section before I reached the checkpoint so I had to start that bit over again. And after another particularly difficult section it is possible to miss the checkpoint at the end if you jump the wrong way. You can't actually see what's at the bottom of some falls. I think I would have cried if I jumped the wrong way after that lol. That definitely would have been unfair!\n-----Your character actually earns experience points by killing enemies to gain levels. At higher levels you have more health points and I think you might do more damage. I felt that this balanced out the difficulty because it meant the more you died the stronger you became. This is because during every attempt you make at a section you are killing monsters and leveling up. So each time you level up the game get's a little bit easier. I had trouble surviving sections with 80 health at around level 30. I would have had an extremely hard time if I only had the 20 health you start the game with.\n-----Surprisingly the boss battles were actually a relief from the difficulty of the platforming. I fought two of the bosses and I found them quite easy. I only died once at each one and was able to figure out how to beat them quickly. I don't know if they are intentionally easy. But it was a nice change of pace for me.\n\nI liked how the game looked. It reminded of a lot of various old titles, such as Dangerous Dave. It was pretty good nostalgic experience.\n\nI recommend trying this game out. It was fun and challenging. At the rate I was going I think you should be able to get your money's worth out of it in terms of hours of entertainment.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 18, 2014","true","4.2"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

The game is hard but not to the point of utter frustration. The mechanics are simple and familiar, requiring no tutorial and letting you jump right into the game. There are only three main actions, jump, attack (simple left or right jabs) and the main gimmick, being able to throw fallen enemies and background clutter. The fallen enemies each have a set attack that is performed when you throw them, making them useful as a one-time special attack to get through the levels.\n\nThe platforming requires a lot of precision and seems to have little forgiveness or feedback for making a mistake, if you go just a little too far to the left or right while jumping you may end up having to repeat a whole section. Check points are fortunately well spaced and each one leaves you breathing a sigh of relief once you reach it.\n\nThe combat is perhaps what takes the most getting used to, your basic sword attack lacks any sort of real punch though you can kill well enough with it, the main mechanic is throwing things and finding out the best place and time to do so. It takes some getting used to but is fun all the same.\n\nFinally the visuals are pretty good, the backgrounds are a bit lackluster but get the job done and the level design is very game-y there for pure challenge, and lacking true aesthetics. The sprite work is top notch and each enemy is well drawn and animated. There is quite a bit of fan service in the designs but not so much as to turn off those who might otherwise be distracted by it, I rather enjoyed it though.\n\nThere's not much of a story to speak of, the game is just pure clean (or maybe dirty) fun!","August 25, 2014","true","6.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Amazing Princess Sarah feels a lot like Super Mario Bros. 2 / Doki Doki Panic; you can pick up and throw neutral objects like clocks (aka turnips) and enemies themselves to use as weapons. You can also jump on a bunch of the game's enemies without issue (the fire elementals have flaming heads, fire hurts), and the platforming feels super smooth and fast-paced throughout.\n\nFirst playthrough is decent, with learning how the stages are laid out and the patterns the bosses have. After that you get SIX more playthroughs to look forward to before you finally take down Lilith, and each one has its own flavor to it:\nAngry: A ghost version of Sarah follows you endlessly, mimicing the Mario Bros-like ghost enemy you encounter. Has a huge amount of health, but if you kill her you end up dying. Mildly annoying at best, enemies and layouts exactly the same.\nDrunk: Super annoying to people who can't deal with the way the screen moves. Can cause motion sickness. Otherwise exactly the same as the prior two.\nCursed: Double jump implemented! Enemies are one rank stronger, by this time you're already like level 40. Speed run mode; that timer runs out you're dead. Makes for some clutch boss fights who have way too much HP.\nBat: The WORST of the modes (unless Drunk makes you sick). Only bats take damage from your sword, causing you to rethink how you do everything, on top of the double-jump and enemy power-up.\nNaturist: Sarah is naked as hell and everything is in love with her. No sword, so 2 damage slaps, and you get only half your max HP or so (went from 180 to 104). Kinda easy, since boss HP is dropped to compensate and most enemies stop moving if they see you. Makes enemies like the Fatties REALLY easy to deal with.\nVampire: Enemies drop hearts that heal for varying amounts when they die, they're two ranks higher now, and they respawn as soon as they're off screen. Some parts of stages are complete orgies of violence and pain.\nOther than the effects on Sarah and the enemy difficulty nothing changed. Enemies always in the same places, level layouts exactly the same, bosses behaved exactly the same. Rather repetitive after the first couple of runs, variety or not, and is pretty weak in attempting game longevity.\n\nStill a fun title in the end, nice to play a platformer that has some Mario Bros. 2 feel to it, and it's nice to play as the princess and not her hero for a change. Worth picking up!","December 1, 2015","true","17.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

You run, jump and fight with a sword but the real gimmick of the game is your ability to pick stuff up and throw at enemies - you can even pick up previously defeated enemies and throw them as well. Different items enemies have different effects too, not just size or weight but throwing archers will create a rain of arrows on impact, throwing a succubus will act like a smart bomb and damage everything on screens, throwing ghosts allow you to hit enemies through walls et cetera.\n\nThe game has a cutesy 16-bit look that makes it look like a Snes game and the difficulty is quite brutal, like many old-school platformers.\n\nWorks really well with a 360 pad.","September 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I think it's because the controls felt a lot more responsive than in that game.  Though having though back to that game it did have its fun points too.\n\nAnyways, Amazing Princess Sarah (APS) is a platformer that sorta has some RPG elements included.  You gain experience while killing enemies but you don't really gain a whole lot from it (your sword does a little more damage, and your hp slowly increases).  There is some replayability to this as when you beat it the first time around you unlock a New Game + (NG+) mode....Drunk Sarah.  It is the same levels over again, but with the screen tilting side to side like, well, you're drunk or something.  Each of the additional modes have their amusing quirks which adds to the charm.\n\nFor the most part there isn't anything TOO difficult though the monsters can be pretty trolly at times.  Like in many platformers, as long as you are patient you'll find your way through whatever section is bothering you.  The bosses end up being rather amusing and include some simple strategy to discover to beat them. This strategy can vary on each playmode as well, so it's not a complete rerun of the same thing over and over.\n\nWhile I was sorta disappointed with the final ending (after playing through all the variations), it was satisfying to finally beat it.  The achievements themselves aren't a huge issue to complete as most are just progressing through the game anyways which I definitely prefer over how many games include a TON of farming/weird action achievements (there is 1 of each for this game but they're not bad).\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty nice as well.  There's one track that sounds eerily like a song from a well known band but the other songs are fun to listen to and add atmosphere at various points.  Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot but like many platformers...just be patient (seems to be a thing on my reviews lol).","November 16, 2014","true","18.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Sarah, the buxom princess of this sordid tale, will have many wanting to gauge their eyes out of their head in frustration. This is without a doubt one of the most irritating and frustratingly retro-platformers this side of rubbing chilies into your eyeballs whilst trying to make a leap across a vast chasm. Browsing the Steam store page for Haruneko games reveals another game in their litany called Arkane the Kunoichi which sadly I already own. One thing is certain...I won't be rushing off to my library to install that one anytime soon.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=344593071\nTaking on the role of a young princess called, you guessed right, Sarah - your task for the excruciating length of this original XBOX 360 downloadable title will be spent traversing the games various castles (there are 5 castles to explore with unimaginative boss battles at the end of each) to save your father's hide from the evil clutches of the demon mistress Lilith who has somehow seduced and kidnapped him. Armed with a double-barreled chest, a sword and the ability to pick up heavy objects like tables and cupboards and stone statues with which to throw at your enemies (seems like those boobs you are greeted with at the start of the game has resulted in incredible upper body strength for our young charge) the game also includes an entire shopping list of the worst things to crop up in any platformer multiplied by ten. Enemies materializing from underneath you - check; enemies flying zig zag across the screen - check; disappearing platform tiles with pits of spikes below - check; enemies clumped together in ridiculous numbers - check; enemies that can shoot through walls - check.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345739594\nI am all for difficult platformers that provide a challenge but when a game has to continually level you up with health just in order for the player to transition through its stages, that is never a good sign. Your frustrations are bound to run high with this one...trust me! Amazing Princess Sarah would be half bearable if the controls worked but they don't which often results in hundreds of unfair deaths. Unresponsive controls will become your biggest enemy in a game that often requires pin-point accuracy. Lots of cussing and hair-pulling will ensure. Thank the gods Amazing Princess Sarah is over in about 3-5 hrs but even that is too long a slog to endure. The only thing I really enjoyed about the whole experience was the original OST for the game. The music is excellent and the composers should be commended for doing a great job. It is such a pity its paired with such sub-par gaming.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=343800247\nConclusion\nIn a year that saw the excellent retro platformer Shovel Knight make its debut, Amazing Princess Sarah is like drinking a nice cup of malted hot-chocolate thats been filled with razor blades. If you are a sadist I would say go for it but for everyone else you are better off putting your money on something (anything) else that has the word retro and platformer tagged onto it in the Steam storefront just not this one as unfortunately there is nothing Amazing about this title or Princess Sarah other than her two gigantic boobs.","November 22, 2014","false","7.7"," 71 of 135 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","71","135","9","9"

It can feel very fun and incredibly rewarding. Then in almost an instant, cheap and poorly designed. This game is VERY HARD. It seems to use some old platformer tropes in good ways and bad. Enemies are placed in spots that require platforming and are seemingly random, or there are moments of unavoidable damage as you are swarmed by enemies, or knocked into a pit. It uses a very interesting mechanic that involves throwing items around you (furniture, rocks, statues, ect.) and also fallen enemies that yield different powers. Archers will explode in a hail of arrows, the flame monsters will shoot fire to each side from where they land. This little mechanic can make dealing with a group of monsters feel very rewarding with the right strategy (when the game isnt out right being unfair). The graphics are nothing special.

There are a lot of moving/disappearing platforms with instant death as the consequence, and they are made worse by bats that are constantly flying across the screen, and also by a quirk of the engine that doesn't preserve your momentum:  if you are on a moving platform and you jump, you are suddenly going straight up.  Also, using your melee attack while jumping feels awkward.  Really everything about the jumping could use some work.\n\nThere is a cool mechanic where you kill enemies and throw dead bodies at more enemies.  Indeed, its necessary even, because your melee attack doesnt do much against harder enemies.  Unfortunatey you don't get much room to play with it; you are constantly dealing with whatever ridiculous terrain problem they have you doing.\n\nHealth power ups are rare and disappear in about 2 seconds.  Some puzzles nearly require throwable objects to complete, but throwable objects don't respawn.  Deadly falling spikes are not rare and do respawn rather briskly.\n\nThe gameplay seems to be designed around playing for a very small amount of time and then dying, and then repeating that about a thousand times.

With this being said it’s a game I am yet to just quit and forget about, all the deaths which occur seem fair and I was able to get on with the game even if I muttered a few choice words under my breath.\n\nLet’s start with the controls! The default controls themselves are horrendous, but after I spent some time changing the binds around until I found a control scheme which fit the way I play I was able to play with some modicum of ease. Controllers are also supported however I haven’t played with one and so I can’t say anything regarding this method of input. The game also seems to be really picky about the location which you need to stand in order to pick up bodies and objects; you may first think that to pick up an item you need to stand to the side of it as you would in other games, however in Amazing Princess Sarah you are required to stand in the dead centre, which is either in front of it for a game object or on top of it for a body and if you are off slightly you just won’t pick it up – there is no room for error. This mechanic bugs me a lot. On a certain level you are required to pick up and then throw bodies and objects to defeat a boss whilst being on the run the entire time, if you miss even a couple of bodies you’re going to be out of luck and will have to restart the fight; coupled with this awkward mechanic it took me quite a few attempts and several swears to be victorious.\n\nWith regards to the controls again, even after rebinding them to suit my play style I still had a lot of trouble stopping in the right places because Sarah seems to have banana peels for shoes, causing her to slide and have trouble stopping where you want her to as well as accurately performing jumps, however that last one might just be because I’m terrible.\n\nI also noted that a quote from the review by digitallydownloaded.net described the game as “One of the best Castlevania-inspired titles”. If they were referring to the awkward controls that these generations of games had then they are dead on, unlike the jumps I attempted to make.\n\nI know what you’re probably thinking now. “Why would I want to spend my time playing a game with bad controls and awkward mechanics? Why should I bother buying this game now?” Well, allow me to continue.\n\nDespite having extremely awkward controls and mechanics the game is very enjoyable and takes absolutely no prisoners regarding the mechanics and enemies. Save points in this game are statues which automatically save the game as soon as you are close enough, however the trouble with this is that the levels are fairly large and the statues scarce. This means you may have to clear a large section of the level to get to a save point and if you die before you manage to reach one you go straight back to your last save point or, if you haven’t reached one on that level yet, back to the start. You have a set amount of health which increases as you level up and as far as I am aware there is no way to restore your health midgame other than getting a Castlevania-style heart to drop from a defeated enemy or a destroyed game object, however this seems a fairly uncommon occurrence and eve then your health isn’t replenished by much. This isn’t too bad as the enemies don’t deal a great amount of damage but the enemies who do can easily be avoided or killed from a safe position, in fact the only way you die instantly is to pitfalls deaths.\n\nThe game has a variety of different enemies ranging from zombies and skeletons to demonettes and fire elementals each of which have their own attacking style. When an enemy is killed you have a window of time to pick up the body before it fades away to use it as a weapon, when you want to use it as a weapon you throw it using the key you normally use to attack, when the body collides with a solid instance it actives in a unique way for each enemy. I won’t say anything else regarding this in fear of spoilers and to allow you, a potential player, to find out for yourselves and figure out in what situation a specific body would be beneficial. The final enemy I will mention are the Bats, which are seemingly everywhere. There is what appears to be an infinite number of bats flying about on each level in fixed paths and positions whose sole purpose is to distract and infuriate the player by dealing damage to Sarah and knocking her off the platform she just jumped too all the way down to the bottom, this definitely adds to the difficult and charm as well as adding a Castlevania-style feel to the game. If you don’t spend at least 20 minutes trying to navigate a set of platforms in one particular level then you must have hacked the game.\n\nSarah’s only weapon is a sword which doesn’t do a great deal of damage but can perform critical hits which make up for this. Environmental objects can also be picked up such as grandfather clocks, tables and chairs which can all be thrown at enemies to deal greater amount of damage as well as being able to perform critical hits which deal a very high amount of damage to all enemies. This mechanic is something very out of place in a game about a Princess but it works and it adds to enjoyment of the player and without it the gameplay itself wouldn’t stand up to much.\nAmazing Princess Sarah is a very standard 2D platform game with slight RPG elements. Slight elements being you have health which increases as you level up, you gain XP for defeating enemies and you are able to level up to an infinite level. Your goal is to save your father who was seduced and kidnapped by Lilith and to do this you must fight your way through 5 castles. Why 5 castles? The only reason I can think of as to why the developers would make it castles is due to her being a Princess and her father the King. But why would Sarah need to fight her way through 5 different castles to rescue her father? Doesn’t she know where Lilith’s castle is? No could be an appropriate answer for this question, but the concept itself is fairly weak, flawed and quite standard when it comes to these types of games. However this again adds to the nostalgic feel that you are playing an older game.\n\nThe game itself is also quite humorous and got a couple of giggles out of me. For one the characters breasts are animated along with her sprite meaning that they move as you move, this is the same for the other female enemies in the game such as the fire elementals and demonettes who also scream for help when you pick them up to throw them. The bosses are very different to what you might expect and are completely out of place for a Princess game, but that’s what makes this game what it is and that is a fun, challenging, frustrating 2D platform game that you’ll want to continue playing until you complete it.\n\nI would recommend this game if you like 2D platforming games, don’t mind the fact there is no way to change the difficulty which is essentially based on your own skill which builds up as you play, and if you don’t mind the story and enemies which make little to no sense.\n\nIf you don’t like difficult and challenging games or 2D sprite based platformer games then this game isn’t for you.\nI do believe that anybody can enjoy this game if they are willing to spend time playing it and that if you see it on sale you should definitely pick it up if you’re unsure about it.","December 21, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But this game is by no real means a "bad" game, but it's not really a grand game either. It's in that grey zone of "eh, it's not great, it's not bad, it's just....par".\n\nThe game gives you two methods of attack, a tiny butter knife called a sword that does barely any damage, and being able to pick up dead foes and random objects for the real attack power. Each foe has special properties to them that makes this title stand out a tad bit, but the same enemies are in every stage, and they don't start doing pallete swaps until stage 3, which makes the previous stage feel a tad dull. On the bright side, though, it enables you to learn and plan use of your foe's corpses.\n\nThe game also has a neat handicap mechanic, as I like to refer to it, where you can level up by killing foes for exp. This makes it where every time you die, you retain your gained exp and can take a few more hits and deal some more damage so you can shrug off foes easier, but if you're good at the game, you'll have a harder time because you won't absorb as much exp. Thus why I refer to it as a handicap, and I approve of this.\n\nHowever, due to the same enemies appearing over and over, and there not really being any sort of mechanics besides "throw foes, hit switches, jump on platforms", this game is pretty dull. But hey, if you're desiring a platformer and have a few bucks, then I guess I can suggest this.\n\nPlus, there are extra game modes once you beat the game once, so there's...I guess replayability.

The biggest problem is that Haruneko spent too much time slicking up their game engine and not nearly enough designing interesting levels for their new product.  The stages are generic, overly long, and too claustrophobic for Sarah's genuinely cool throwing attack to shine.  Extra emphasis on "generic": without exception, the levels are cramped and twisty pseudo-mazes that vary only in length and color.  Thankfully, the short main campaign ended just as boredom began to grip me in earnest.  I wasn't about to go for the "true" ending, which requires you to play through the same bland levels about 12 times with the added aggravation of various wacky handicaps (no sword, drunk filter, etc.)\n\nSarah is not truly bad though, it's simply middle-of-the-road.

Otherwise when you try to do the platforming sections with the analog stick you might get the impression that Princess Sarah is permanentely part of "Holiday on Ice".\n\nSpeaking of ice: The environment of each level is different and has an unique impact on the plaforming and the combat.\n\nThe combat itself is quite nice as well. You can either mash the attack button to kill enemies or alternatively you can pick up enemy corpses or level decoration, such as furniture, and throw them into the enemies to create combos. Since every enemy has a unique impact when being thrown into another one, you can imagine that there are a plethora of ways to create bigger and more unique combinations which yield more experience than just outright killing enmies one after another.\n\nThis segues quite nicely into the next thing I'd like to talk about which is XP. You'll get XP for killing enemies, that's it. And, as in most games, getting XP means that you will get a level up from time to time. Leveling up in this game is a fairly fast and uncomplicated process: You get 2 more HP and a little damage boost. This allows the game to throw progressively stronger monsters at you without being unfair.\n\nLast, but by no means least, we take a look at the audiovisual presenation of the game. The graphics are fairly simple, but they fit their purpose in this case. The animations are fluid and look quite neat.\nAudiowise it has to be said that the sound effects get repetitive after some time, but this just pales in comparison to the soundtrack which is, as with most indie games, in my opinion good enough to be sold on its own.\n\n\nSo we come to the conclusion: Is the game worth it.\nI will hold myself briefly and say: 5€, at this point you can buy it full price.","August 19, 2014","true","2.0"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","11","21","2","0"

One might think that voids my right to have any criticism at all. No because time is also invested and that's even more important than money.\n\nAmazing Princess Sarah is a platformer with a few pretty good ideas to it that ultimately spits in all their faces. An EXP system lets our cantaloupe-chested heroine get stronger and have more HP. Although you have a sword it's far more beneficial to pick up objects or fallen enemies to throw. This is the game's primary mechanic and it works great because different downed enemies have different behaviors when thrown. The ogres slow you down, limit your jumping but do loads of damage. Bats fly far and fast when thrown. Elementals send a magic wave left and right. Succubi clear the screen. And there are enough different enemies to warrant some varied playthough for the raw-fighting areas.\n\nThe platforming is average, which would no doubt drive most players crazy. I can't count the number of times a bat or stray arrow knocked me off a cliff but it'd be somewhere between Castlevania 1 and Whomp`Em. But lives are infinite and checkpoints are fairly frequent (often just before and just after a brutal area) so the frustration is far less than it would've been in the early console era.\n\nGraphics-wise the game is good enough. That titlescreen is beautiful and truthfully foretells the fanservice level. While the monsters themselves are generic flair they're well-made. There's only so many ways you can design a skeleton or zombie after all. I will give the bosses some flack though since most of them just look out-of-place. I understand that sprites that huge could be a problem but each time I saw one I was reminded of an old flash game I tried to make once where I was very lazy with the enemies.\n\nWhen you beat the game it implores you to try Newgame+ to see the true ending. Upon entering Newgame+ you find a game mode selection with most of the options locked. I think there was 7 or so total. You can view the descriptions of the modes and they do things like warp the screen, give you time limits, have a ghost haunt you (that behaves like a regular Boo enemy). It seems like a pretty good way to advance the gameplay experience. Beat the game twice, get the true ending and final boss and then for those challenge-lovers you can try the harder game modes, possibly for other rewards...\n\nExcept that's not how it works. You actually need to beat ALL modes to get the true ending. I tried mode 2 (haunted) for a bit but had other things to do so I put it up for a while. Then while I was telling a friend about the game he explained that he saw a youtube video of it and told me not to bother going for the true ending. I did my own research and found a video with the final battle and true ending in it and I was actually stunned for a bit. You do all that work for a meh boss fight and the lamest ending ever? Seriously, ANY endings to a game I've seen in the past I'd say 15 years is more fulfilling than that. Had I sunk the time into getting that ending, I would've been furious. I was expecting at least another art piece on par with the titlescreen or even some fun credits music but there's not even end credits.\n\nThere's so many things that could've fixed this. Art of the king and his daughter. Maybe something showing or saying that the kingdom was being rebuilt since from what the intro tells us the denizens of hell were apparently made it all the way to the throne room. Maybe jack the absurd comedy up a notch and have Sarah pick up the whole castle and carry it farther away from the demon's realm.\n\nBut it really feels like the developer just stopped caring about his own project. That anyone who played it that far was rewarded solely by the challenge and not any hope of a decent conclusion. And that feeling, that knowing that NOTHING of value awaits me challenging those harder modes makes me not care either. I won't say I want my money back because $2 was fair for that gaming experience. But if I'd played through even one newgame+ mode I would've wanted my TIME back.","November 1, 2015","false","3.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Old-school platform jumping game that feels right at home with anything from the SNES/Super Famicom, Genesis/MegaDrive, or TurboGrafx/PC Engine era. It plays like a cross between Super Mario Bros 2/ Doki Doki Panic and Castlevania. You throw things at the baddies, or whack them with your sword to drop them, then pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can bounce off the heads of some enemies, while others hurt you. Don't touch enemies, spikes, or hazards. Whack torches to gain health pickups.\n\nThe controls are okay but not excellent, which, I suppose is typical for the kinds of games I'm comparing it to, but compared to the really good games of that time, it is somewhat lacking. For the record, I'm using an XBox 360 gamepad.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent, easily up to SNES-par, but the sound effects are okay-but-not-great (notice a theme here?). The protagonist makes a lot of low-fi noise, but I suppose you can turn it down if it's bothering you.\n\nThe graphics are a mixed bag; the sprites are very colourful, but not very detailed most of the time. I'd give them a Genesis rank. The level designs are not very colourful, but they are SNES-level detailed, some with some effects in the background, and even have an active effect on the player, with icy patches, watercourses that push you back, and so on. The character designs are of TurboGrafx vintage; lots of anime boobies everywhere. It's not evocative, it's not racy, it's not offensive, it's actually just silly, and a bit comical, which is good because it keeps you laughing at that instead of raging at the terrible level design.\n\nOh that level design. Whomever was responsible for the level design needs to be dragged out into the street and flogged. There are lots of "gotcha" tricks and just plain mean enemy placement choices that would be fine if you could see it coming and avoid it, but most of the time you can't. Almost evey level has a section where there are bottomless pits with enemies flying at you that make this NES-era Castlevania enthusiast boil with ineffectual gamer-rage. There are a lot of moving or disappearing platforms over spike pits that force you to redo the entire section, or just die a slow, spikey death if you make even one mistake. I cannot understate how obnoxious the levels are.\n\nThe enemies are all varied, each with their own trick, which in turn, provides the player with said trick if they are used as a weapon (kind of the whole schtick of this game). The bosses are screen-filling monstrosities that each have a gimmick to defeating them. They all have tells to avoid being hit, though sometimes it's unclear what will damage you and what won't.\n\nOverall, given the inexpensive cost of this game, I'll give it a pass, but just barely. It's not, and I mean NOT up to modern standards, even for a game of this kind, but if you want a hit of newstalgia, or if you are too young to remember the NES era, if you want to know what it was like, then this is worth checking out, but do yourself a favour and wait for a sale.","January 4","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Challenging; apparently addictive once you beat it the first time.  Decent music, genuinely like the boss music.  Pleasant sound effects.\n"Highly detailed pixel-art graphics" is just, not really close to correct, as you can see from the screenshots, but graphics are fine.

Amazing Princess Sarah.\n\nAmazing Princess Sarah is a decently fun action platformer game created Haruneko Entertainment. I've played Akane the Kunoichi on XBOX 360 and finished that game 100% and I thought I may enjoy this game as well, since I actually did 100% Akane the Kunoichi.\n\nThe game is decently long, but it's filled with a bit of artificial longevity. The way the game works is that you go through the main campaign and then it pretty much throws you back to the beginning of the game, tells you there's a new rule or implacable enemy or some other caveat has been added, then asks you to play the game through its entirety again with that rule.\n\nFor sake of simplicity (and because I actually haven't done the NG+ system too much), this opinion is only for first playthrough.\n\nSo my opinion is... It's not a bad game. It's taken up 2 hours of my life and I didn't regret it at all. I think that with the way the game is, $4.99 may be a little much, but any sale on this game ever would make it a decent buy.\n\nThis has been a Robot Maid Review.

Correct me if I am wrong about this one, but everyone that had the issue reported to have an AMD card.\n\nThe issue is the screen will change to black in every stage at random intervals. Forcing you to pause and hit the F12 button to fix it, until the next time it happens. This problem never occurred once in Stage 4 and it doesn’t happen on boss fights either. Still, when I end my gaming session and see two dozen blank screenshots, it is a little infuriating that I had to do that.\n\nIf you played this during the time that this game was a slip and slide fest, you probably didn't enjoy it too much. This has since then been remedied. Amazing Princess Sarah will frustrate you depending on your level of skill with platform games. There are seven game modes to play through counting the initial play through.\n\nEach one offers a unique approach to completing the game, which recycles the same five levels each time. This is not really a bad thing, but for some it is not a good thing either. Knowledge of the level layout came in handy for the more tedious game modes.\n\nAmazing Princess Sarah isn’t really groundbreaking or new. It takes elements from Mario 2, Kirby, and Castlevania to provide an amusing adventure. The price is fine for what you get, but snag the game on sale if you can hold off. I enjoyed the game, but I can’t suggest anyone else buy it.\n\nEven though this review has been positive for the most part,  I can't suggest this game to anyone. Fun, frustrating, and repetitive is how I would describe this game in a nutshell.\n","August 24, 2014","false","18.0"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

I really did. However, this game feels unfinished in general.\n\nThe game has a number of small missing details from a complete game, such as music during game over or when the levels are cleared. Instead, it cuts the music entirely. Likewise, there isn't much in the way of enemy variety. The few that exist are merely recolored over and over to indicate that they're stronger/faster. Levels go on far too long, and are poorly designed. Even the basic concepts like the combo system is poorly implimented. THrown enemies, for the most part, can only kill one enemy when they hit them. Theres no domino effect to kills, nor any reliable ways to get high combos beyond meleeing enemies in a small group cluster. All in all I'd say avoid this game. It feels like someone's first project in game maker, rather than a completed game.","November 6, 2014","false","1.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I can tell that this could have easily been a good game but the makers of the game spent to much time trying to make it like other games and on the pixel ♥♥♥♥. They could have put in some story and given the character something that makes them an actual character, but they felt making moving pixel ♥♥♥♥ more important. People will mistake this game for being 'hard' but it is not hard, it is just cheap (and yes there is a difference between cheap and hard). This game took the worst bits of Castlevania, Mario, and other classic games and combined them into a single game. I like a game that is challenging, not one that is almost broken at some points with how cheap it is. The soundtrack is some awful generic guitar that, even though i love rock and metal, just gets so irritating after a short time that it makes it even harder to keep playing this game. I will say that the first level was well made but after that it just becomes so god damn cheap that it's not even funny. One of the worst parts was in the third level where, if your not standing in just the right spot when you hit a lever, you fall into spikes and then have to sit and listen to the 'character' make the pained noise until you run out of health.\n\nI also refuse to acknowledge the 'character' as a gender becsause there is no actual personality.\n\n\n♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME.

Indeed, all thetypical things AVGN complained about in his game reviews can be found in this game:\n- awkward controls? check. You can't even move while attacking with your sword\n- bats? check\n- terrible scrolling/unable to see bottom for safety? check\n- etc etc etc\n\nThis game is good for a laugh but definetely not something to take seriously and complete to the end. I can't recommend this as long as the controls are as poor as they currently are. I suggest the developer buy super meat boy and play it to understand what good controls in a 2d platformer are. Super meat boy is and always will be the benchmark for 2d platforming controls.\n\nThis is still the best 2d "female protagonist" game on steam so if you are looking for a sexualised platformer, this is the best one to pick, ultionus is horrible and timespinner is not out yet.\n\nEdit: Apparently there is a better 2d female protagonist game on steam..... Don't buy this game. Don't listen to the boobs. Don't let super mario bros 2 nostalgia bait you into getting this.\n\nEdit2: There is a small redeeming quality to this game that anyone who makes it to the end of level 1 will immediately notice.

The goal is simple; save your dad, the King. And to do this you’ll have to get past castle levels with icy floors, spikes and water streams that slow you down, among a bunch of other environmental hazards, and all of this while fighting off enemies.\n\nThe thing that makes this platformer stand out from other platformers is the fact that you, besides using a sword to eliminate enemies, can kill enemies by throwing them into one another and that way create combos. But both methods can be used to do this.\nThe higher the combos the higher the XP you receive. Don’t think this is yet another game with RPG elements in them, because it’s really basic and you could hardly call it an RPG element if you know what it’s precisely used for. You see, the XP you receive will level up your character but instead of gaining extra strength, more stamina or I don’t know what, your character will just gain 2 extra health points every time she levels up. Health is one of the key factors of the game, because there are a lot of enemies and, with a few exceptions, they all have their own moves. So you have to take into consideration that an enemy standing on a platform above you could easily hit you with an arrow or that another creature could send a wave of flames your way while you’re standing on a small ledge. The enemies get tougher as you progress so it’s only natural that you grow ‘stronger’ too. Later on you might think 2 health points is really too little and I’d have to agree with you. It’s practically nothing because all of the enemies inflict more damage than that. Still, things shouldn’t be too simple and replaying certain parts of a level is part of the game’s design. Completing a single level will allow you to level up quite a few times mind you.\nThere are several checkpoints to be found in every level and you’ll continue the game from the last checkpoint should you choose to quit the game. No need to replay the entire level again, which is a big plus.\nBut around level 3 or 4 the game will also rely on some trial and error aspects that I’m not a fan of (dropping down and hoping you’ll fall where you’re supposed to go). Thankfully you’re usually near a checkpoint when that happens so it should only take a couple of tries, but it’s a cheap gameplay tactic that this game doesn’t really need.\n\nAmazing Princess Sarah takes a lot of time getting used to control wise. No, the controls aren’t hard at all. But if you’re going to play this with a controller the analog stick is best avoided because it’s highly inaccurate. Instead of using the stick use the D-Pad instead, it works so much better, especially for sections where you have to jump from tiny platform to tiny platform (sometimes even with enemies on them). You wouldn’t believe how many times I fell off or slipped off a ledge because the game didn’t respond to my key presses quickly enough. Rage Quitters, beware.\n\nGraphically it’s nothing amazing. It has pixel graphics which look alright, but I’ve seen many other games with better graphics than this. They do, however, fit the game, like many other games in this genre. Pixel graphics just seem like a popular choice among platform games in general. The bosses, on the other hand, seem to use a different kind of art, and it’s noticeable and even a little bit distracting.\nThe quality of the sounds is also fairly basic. Your character will make a sound when hit or when she dies and then there’s the game over sound and the sound you make when throwing stuff. That’s about it I think. Then again, this is pretty usual stuff for games with visuals like this.\nThe music is, unfortunately, also nothing to write home about and feels generic. Well, to me at least.\n\nThis is not a big game. It has just 5 levels, each one ends with a boss fights, and each level will take about 30-45 minutes to complete. So in total it has 3-4 hours of playtime. I personally think this is the ideal length for a game like this. Any longer and the game would’ve lost its charm (i.e. the game mechanic of throwing around enemies would’ve worn thin by then).\nFortunately, for those that can’t get enough it the developer has integrated New Game+  into the game which should give you a better ending (that is what’s being implied) while also throwing some new stuff your way, like adding a chasing ghost of Sarah (which you have to avoid) or giving you the ability to double jump, at the cost of having enemies with more health and/or that you can’t use your sword.\n\nThe Amazing Princess Sarah doesn’t do anything to reinvigorate the genre, but it’s a fun game nevertheless and short enough so that anyone can pretty much finish it. I enjoyed it for what is was, but just remember to play this with a controller and, most important of all, with the D-Pad. It will save you a lot of frustration, trust me.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","August 18, 2014","true","4.9"," 87 of 101 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","87","101","2","3"

But there is no option to disable vsync.\n* The jump has a fixed height. You have air control, but the movement feels fast and imprecise. Good luck jumping on moving and disappearing platforms.\n* The melee attack has a very short range. Since you move too fast, sometimes it is hard to get close enough to attack without being hit.\n* You can jump on top of some enemies, but that just bounces you back up; it does not damage them. However, given how imprecise the controls are, it is very likely you will miss and get hurt.\n* You can pick up some objects or dead enemies and throw them. However, the throwing has a fixed angle/distance, you can't throw in any direction. Also, some objects/enemies are heavier (but some stuff that looks large and heavy is not heavy, such as a table, a wardrobe or a clock).\n* When there are multiple overlapping objects/enemies to pick up, Sarah never picks up the one that I expected.\n* There is a water river in castle 3. The water current will move you, but it won't move any object or dead enemy. That's an arbitrary design decision that makes no sense and breaks the player intuition.\n* The water continues to move you sideways even while you are jumping and not touching the water anymore.\n* The fire enemy survives water.\n* The camera tries to help by moving a bit further while you are moving, but the effect is that the camera looks drunk. Also, there are many traps outside the camera view.\n* Unskippable cut-scenes that pause the action for too long with nothing happening. That intro animation before the main menu shows up? Unskippable. That boss animation? Takes a while doing nothing. That Game Over screen? Get used to it, it takes a while to get back to action.\n* Cheap traps, such as a dozen moving platforms with random bats moving around and spikes at the bottom.\n* Bosses requires too many hits, so that the boss fights become boring.\n* Bosses feel unpolished. The lava attack from the flying demon boss destroys any enemies, even those that are safe under the platform. However, in the Cursed mode, bats still spawn behind the lava and you can't see them until they hit you. The head animation from the knight from castle 5 is buggy (it starts flying back even when the player is picking it up, and then it teleports back to the player; a second head drops down even after the boss is defeated if it is defeated while throwing the head).\n* Very disappointing true last boss fight.\n* Random crashes.\n\nOverall, this game induces rage-quit feelings. It is not complete garbage, but it is not polished enough.\n\nOn the bright side, the graphics are good. If this game was made by just one person alone, congratulations! Making and releasing a game is not easy.","January 28, 2015","false","16.4"," 61 of 74 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","61","74","0","1"

You look at the title-screen for this game and what do you see? A Princess. That's right, Sarah is a Princess, she's got the tiara, that's her castle in the background, and she's the daughter of a king. Now that we're done establishing the obvious let's talk about the game.\n\nPLOT: The King has been kidnapped by liliths, are you a bad enough princess to save the king?\n\nWhat makes Sarah so amazing is that she lifts. No really, she can hoist furniture as well as corpses over her head and toss them around. She also has a sword, which is used to make corpses. Depending on the type, enemy corpses have different properties when they're thrown. The most devastating are the liliths, as their bodies are highly volatile and damage everything on-screen. There are five stages, five bosses, a few hundred enemies, a bunch of checkpoints. I did the math and came to the following conclusion: getting through this game should be easy peasy lemon squeezy.  Turns out the math was wrong, Amazing Princess Sarah isn't that easy (that didn't sound right).\n\nThis isn't Super Meat Boy, let alone I wanna be the Boshy, but the enemies do hit hard, pits are on the prevalent side, and you have to make do with a fairly limited pool of health. Candles hold life-replenishing hearts, but uh...they restore 2 HP. Sarah can also level-up, which adds....2 HP. Seriously though she also gets stronger, allowing her to do more damage with her throws and sword. The first play-through is liable to be a bit of a struggle. Eventually however things start to click. Enemies operate by specific rules. They don't attack unless they're facing you, so you can sneak up behind them with murderous intent. Archers only fire where you're standing, so move an inch and watch that arrow pass you by. You'll even figure out the trick to avoiding the stage 5 boss as he stomps around. Holding onto a corpse for the right situation can also prevent a headache or two.\n\nBut that's not enough I'm afraid, you have to play New Game+ if you want to end the lilith menace once and for all. Hey, New Game+, play through the game again with all your level-ups? It's going to be Weekend at Bernie's! Well yeah, it is, except you're Bernie. There are multiple NG+ modes, and they get more difficult as you progress. In the first one, an invincible ghost follows you around. In the second , you're drunk, and it looks like your castle is on a boat in the middle of a storm. The third time around you receive a sweet double-jump, but get slapped with a stringent time-limit. Fourth time around? Your sword is only good for killing bats, and bats are lousy weapons. At this point I'm just doing my best to skip past enemies. I still have a few more play-throughs to go, but they all sound even worse.\n\nAmazing Princess Sarah is a follow-up to Akane the Kunoichi, same engine and everything. In every aspect it's an improvement. The controls are less slick, there's a better sense of challenge, and it's less repetitive. Yes, even though I've played through this game 4.6 times it's less repetitive than a game I played through once*. Some parts of the game can be frustrating, mainly when it involves picking up an object, hurling it, and it collides with a low ceiling instead of a monster. There are a couple other issues, namely crashes (at the 5th boss usually), and the stage 4 music is LOUD.\n\nThis is a good game. Just do yourself a favor and look past the fact that she's a princess. Is it really that big a deal?\n\n\n\n*If you're going to be that guy and check my Steam achievements, I played through the Xbox Live Indie Games version of Akane the Kunoichi. I even got all of those freakin' kimonos.","November 8, 2014","true","10.2"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","37","46","7","0"

Isnt that a gurly game?"\n\nI really liked Akane the Kunoichi and while looking on the store I found Amazing Princess Sarah which was also made by Haruneko Entertainment. So I thought to myself "Lets buy this game dude!". Unlike some other people who have posted bad reviews about this game I quickly switched the default controls into something more realistic because I can honestly say that the default controls were really bad. Best way to play it is to use a Xbax controller anyways.\n\nThis game pretty much blew my mind on so many levels of happiness and frustration. The game is surprisingly fun to play and will pretty much kick your ♥♥♥ over and over again. In this sidescroller you play as Princess Sarah and need to save your father(The King) from the demon mistress Lilith.\n\nSarah's main weapon is a sword. The button can be tapped fast to multiple fast hits. Sarah also has the ability to pick objects and fallen enemies up and throw them.\n\nThere are 5 castle levels and each end with a big epic boss fight. The levels contains your standard enemies in the form of skeletons, zombies, flying demon chicks(They are hot), dudes that walk back and forth while dropping bombs, Big dudes that walk really slow unless they see you, flame sprite chicks that throw fire, archer dudes that shot arrows through the walls and ground, ghosts that walk around in armor, some flying ghost thing that you cant hit with your sword and those BATS THAT FLY ALL OVER THE ♥♥♥♥ING PLACE!\n\nThe enemy and level layout is planned really well and killing an enemy makes it possible to pick their body up and throw at other enemies. Throwing some enemies like for example the flaming sprite chick will cause a fire attack to hurt the enemies that it hits. There is sort of a rpg element because get xp from killing enemies and you can level up which makes you gain +2 health points to your health bar.\n\nThe game reminds me alot of Castlevania: Symphony of the night the way the game pauses for a moment when you level up and the design is simulair. You can also break candles to get hearts out of them to recover your health.\n\nSince my last reviews ive gotten some real constructive critisim that I will take use of now. So I will mention the Pros and Cons ^^.\n\nPros:\nFemale protagonist\nVariety in levels\nReally epic and fitting music on some levels\nEpic boss fights\nGreat gameplay\nUnique gamemodes that you can unlock after you beat the game.\n\nCons:\nHealthdrops(Hearts) recover 2 hp.\nThe music fades out to nothing before fading back in.\nTo short recovery time after being hit.\nSome huge objects can be throw far and others not.\n\nI have still not fully beaten the game since when you beat it the first time you unlock a new gamemode and after beating the game on that gamemode you unlock another gamemode and Im on the 5th gamemode so far and there is 2 more that I have yet to unlock so I guess its 7 gamemodes in total. Each of these gamemodes gives you a new challenge by adding a twist to the game. Some of these gamemodes adds a positive twist as well.\n\nOften when I start this game up or simply when im just playing it people ask me "Skill why you play that game? Isnt that a gurly game?" and other times people mention the boob art on the title screen like "Woah Skill its that boobgame!". Please dont base your judgement on names or apperences. Sure there are as a matter of fact boob physics on Sarah and even the enemies in the game. But lets not attract the videogame journalists shall we?\n\nI give this game a 8/10","January 23, 2015","true","26.4"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","41","53","8","5"

It's pretty good.\n- It's has a simple concept, aside from being able to hurl fallen enemies it's a very basic platformer\n- Platforming is challenging, I died a lot, sometimes it was frustrating but it's reasonably fair and it didn't make me want to quit\n\nhttp://youtu.be/IZQkEcFtg3s\nAside from throwing bodies you can jump and use a basic sword attack. There is a good variety of enemies from the very beginning and throughout the game. This helped to make it more interesting.\n-----Platforming was hard. You have to avoid and deal with various enemies while you are jumping around, which made things complicated. There were several sections which I had difficulty with, at each one I died at at least 10-15 times. In the first castle there is room in which you must scale a series of small moving platforms. I constantly fell off them back to the bottom, just touching the stick on my gamepad slightly would often send my character dashing off these surfaces. This is the reason I say platforming in this game is *reasonably* fair not simply fair. I felt that the in that section the platforms might need to be a little bit bigger. But aside from that, yes I do think the platforming is fair. I enjoyed platforming in later sections more.\n-----Okay there is one thing that I think the needs to be changed, the bats. I spent 15 minutes trying to do another one of those moving platform sections and was failing over and over again. The bats that fly at you make it very difficult. Unlike other enemies they continually respawn. They move up and down so it’s really hard to time your attacks to hit them sometimes. It is especially difficult to kill bats when you are standing on a platform. If you turn around to face the right direction you will fall into a pit of spike and have to start the section again. So I think they should at least not respawn.\n-----There are checkpoints which are reasonably frequent. You have unlimited lives so you can return to them as many times as you need. Sometimes the game is a bit cruel though. For example I was caught unawares by some bottomless pits at the end of a long section before I reached the checkpoint so I had to start that bit over again. And after another particularly difficult section it is possible to miss the checkpoint at the end if you jump the wrong way. You can't actually see what's at the bottom of some falls. I think I would have cried if I jumped the wrong way after that lol. That definitely would have been unfair!\n-----Your character actually earns experience points by killing enemies to gain levels. At higher levels you have more health points and I think you might do more damage. I felt that this balanced out the difficulty because it meant the more you died the stronger you became. This is because during every attempt you make at a section you are killing monsters and leveling up. So each time you level up the game get's a little bit easier. I had trouble surviving sections with 80 health at around level 30. I would have had an extremely hard time if I only had the 20 health you start the game with.\n-----Surprisingly the boss battles were actually a relief from the difficulty of the platforming. I fought two of the bosses and I found them quite easy. I only died once at each one and was able to figure out how to beat them quickly. I don't know if they are intentionally easy. But it was a nice change of pace for me.\n\nI liked how the game looked. It reminded of a lot of various old titles, such as Dangerous Dave. It was pretty good nostalgic experience.\n\nI recommend trying this game out. It was fun and challenging. At the rate I was going I think you should be able to get your money's worth out of it in terms of hours of entertainment.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 18, 2014","true","4.2"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

The same style is used to introduce the bosses.\n\nWhere Sarah is frustrating, is in the level design. Even for a game in the platformer genre, there is a LOT of backtracking here as you mainly fight your way to a switch, flip it, then backtrack to a previously locked wall/passage and continue.\nEnemies respawn throughout so you are always in danger, luckily save points occur frequent and are mostly well placed so you don't have to repeat particularly difficult sections too often.\nMost annoyingly, flying enemies and enemy projectiles go through walls, and as you'll be spending a lot of time passing through narrow corridors next to other sections you've either already visited or will visit next, there are a lot of cheap hits as a result. Luckily there are also sections where you can just dodge or kill enemies without worrying about cheap hits too much.\n\nOverall the experience is a good one. A well made game and worth the (low) price.","April 1, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The game is hard but not to the point of utter frustration. The mechanics are simple and familiar, requiring no tutorial and letting you jump right into the game. There are only three main actions, jump, attack (simple left or right jabs) and the main gimmick, being able to throw fallen enemies and background clutter. The fallen enemies each have a set attack that is performed when you throw them, making them useful as a one-time special attack to get through the levels.\n\nThe platforming requires a lot of precision and seems to have little forgiveness or feedback for making a mistake, if you go just a little too far to the left or right while jumping you may end up having to repeat a whole section. Check points are fortunately well spaced and each one leaves you breathing a sigh of relief once you reach it.\n\nThe combat is perhaps what takes the most getting used to, your basic sword attack lacks any sort of real punch though you can kill well enough with it, the main mechanic is throwing things and finding out the best place and time to do so. It takes some getting used to but is fun all the same.\n\nFinally the visuals are pretty good, the backgrounds are a bit lackluster but get the job done and the level design is very game-y there for pure challenge, and lacking true aesthetics. The sprite work is top notch and each enemy is well drawn and animated. There is quite a bit of fan service in the designs but not so much as to turn off those who might otherwise be distracted by it, I rather enjoyed it though.\n\nThere's not much of a story to speak of, the game is just pure clean (or maybe dirty) fun!","August 25, 2014","true","6.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Amazing Princess Sarah feels a lot like Super Mario Bros. 2 / Doki Doki Panic; you can pick up and throw neutral objects like clocks (aka turnips) and enemies themselves to use as weapons. You can also jump on a bunch of the game's enemies without issue (the fire elementals have flaming heads, fire hurts), and the platforming feels super smooth and fast-paced throughout.\n\nFirst playthrough is decent, with learning how the stages are laid out and the patterns the bosses have. After that you get SIX more playthroughs to look forward to before you finally take down Lilith, and each one has its own flavor to it:\nAngry: A ghost version of Sarah follows you endlessly, mimicing the Mario Bros-like ghost enemy you encounter. Has a huge amount of health, but if you kill her you end up dying. Mildly annoying at best, enemies and layouts exactly the same.\nDrunk: Super annoying to people who can't deal with the way the screen moves. Can cause motion sickness. Otherwise exactly the same as the prior two.\nCursed: Double jump implemented! Enemies are one rank stronger, by this time you're already like level 40. Speed run mode; that timer runs out you're dead. Makes for some clutch boss fights who have way too much HP.\nBat: The WORST of the modes (unless Drunk makes you sick). Only bats take damage from your sword, causing you to rethink how you do everything, on top of the double-jump and enemy power-up.\nNaturist: Sarah is naked as hell and everything is in love with her. No sword, so 2 damage slaps, and you get only half your max HP or so (went from 180 to 104). Kinda easy, since boss HP is dropped to compensate and most enemies stop moving if they see you. Makes enemies like the Fatties REALLY easy to deal with.\nVampire: Enemies drop hearts that heal for varying amounts when they die, they're two ranks higher now, and they respawn as soon as they're off screen. Some parts of stages are complete orgies of violence and pain.\nOther than the effects on Sarah and the enemy difficulty nothing changed. Enemies always in the same places, level layouts exactly the same, bosses behaved exactly the same. Rather repetitive after the first couple of runs, variety or not, and is pretty weak in attempting game longevity.\n\nStill a fun title in the end, nice to play a platformer that has some Mario Bros. 2 feel to it, and it's nice to play as the princess and not her hero for a change.

Different items enemies have different effects too, not just size or weight but throwing archers will create a rain of arrows on impact, throwing a succubus will act like a smart bomb and damage everything on screens, throwing ghosts allow you to hit enemies through walls et cetera.\n\nThe game has a cutesy 16-bit look that makes it look like a Snes game and the difficulty is quite brutal, like many old-school platformers.\n\nWorks really well with a 360 pad.","September 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I think it's because the controls felt a lot more responsive than in that game.  Though having though back to that game it did have its fun points too.\n\nAnyways, Amazing Princess Sarah (APS) is a platformer that sorta has some RPG elements included.  You gain experience while killing enemies but you don't really gain a whole lot from it (your sword does a little more damage, and your hp slowly increases).  There is some replayability to this as when you beat it the first time around you unlock a New Game + (NG+) mode....Drunk Sarah.  It is the same levels over again, but with the screen tilting side to side like, well, you're drunk or something.  Each of the additional modes have their amusing quirks which adds to the charm.\n\nFor the most part there isn't anything TOO difficult though the monsters can be pretty trolly at times.  Like in many platformers, as long as you are patient you'll find your way through whatever section is bothering you.  The bosses end up being rather amusing and include some simple strategy to discover to beat them. This strategy can vary on each playmode as well, so it's not a complete rerun of the same thing over and over.\n\nWhile I was sorta disappointed with the final ending (after playing through all the variations), it was satisfying to finally beat it.  The achievements themselves aren't a huge issue to complete as most are just progressing through the game anyways which I definitely prefer over how many games include a TON of farming/weird action achievements (there is 1 of each for this game but they're not bad).\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty nice as well.  There's one track that sounds eerily like a song from a well known band but the other songs are fun to listen to and add atmosphere at various points.  Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot but like many platformers...just be patient (seems to be a thing on my reviews lol).","November 16, 2014","true","18.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Sarah, the buxom princess of this sordid tale, will have many wanting to gauge their eyes out of their head in frustration. This is without a doubt one of the most irritating and frustratingly retro-platformers this side of rubbing chilies into your eyeballs whilst trying to make a leap across a vast chasm. Browsing the Steam store page for Haruneko games reveals another game in their litany called Arkane the Kunoichi which sadly I already own. One thing is certain...I won't be rushing off to my library to install that one anytime soon.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=344593071\nTaking on the role of a young princess called, you guessed right, Sarah - your task for the excruciating length of this original XBOX 360 downloadable title will be spent traversing the games various castles (there are 5 castles to explore with unimaginative boss battles at the end of each) to save your father's hide from the evil clutches of the demon mistress Lilith who has somehow seduced and kidnapped him. Armed with a double-barreled chest, a sword and the ability to pick up heavy objects like tables and cupboards and stone statues with which to throw at your enemies (seems like those boobs you are greeted with at the start of the game has resulted in incredible upper body strength for our young charge) the game also includes an entire shopping list of the worst things to crop up in any platformer multiplied by ten. Enemies materializing from underneath you - check; enemies flying zig zag across the screen - check; disappearing platform tiles with pits of spikes below - check; enemies clumped together in ridiculous numbers - check; enemies that can shoot through walls - check.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345739594\nI am all for difficult platformers that provide a challenge but when a game has to continually level you up with health just in order for the player to transition through its stages, that is never a good sign. Your frustrations are bound to run high with this one...trust me! Amazing Princess Sarah would be half bearable if the controls worked but they don't which often results in hundreds of unfair deaths. Unresponsive controls will become your biggest enemy in a game that often requires pin-point accuracy. Lots of cussing and hair-pulling will ensure. Thank the gods Amazing Princess Sarah is over in about 3-5 hrs but even that is too long a slog to endure. The only thing I really enjoyed about the whole experience was the original OST for the game. The music is excellent and the composers should be commended for doing a great job. It is such a pity its paired with such sub-par gaming.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=343800247\nConclusion\nIn a year that saw the excellent retro platformer Shovel Knight make its debut, Amazing Princess Sarah is like drinking a nice cup of malted hot-chocolate thats been filled with razor blades. If you are a sadist I would say go for it but for everyone else you are better off putting your money on something (anything) else that has the word retro and platformer tagged onto it in the Steam storefront just not this one as unfortunately there is nothing Amazing about this title or Princess Sarah other than her two gigantic boobs.","November 22, 2014","false","7.7"," 71 of 135 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","71","135","9","9"

It can feel very fun and incredibly rewarding. Then in almost an instant, cheap and poorly designed. This game is VERY HARD. It seems to use some old platformer tropes in good ways and bad. Enemies are placed in spots that require platforming and are seemingly random, or there are moments of unavoidable damage as you are swarmed by enemies, or knocked into a pit. It uses a very interesting mechanic that involves throwing items around you (furniture, rocks, statues, ect.) and also fallen enemies that yield different powers. Archers will explode in a hail of arrows, the flame monsters will shoot fire to each side from where they land.

There are a lot of moving/disappearing platforms with instant death as the consequence, and they are made worse by bats that are constantly flying across the screen, and also by a quirk of the engine that doesn't preserve your momentum:  if you are on a moving platform and you jump, you are suddenly going straight up.  Also, using your melee attack while jumping feels awkward.  Really everything about the jumping could use some work.\n\nThere is a cool mechanic where you kill enemies and throw dead bodies at more enemies.  Indeed, its necessary even, because your melee attack doesnt do much against harder enemies.  Unfortunatey you don't get much room to play with it; you are constantly dealing with whatever ridiculous terrain problem they have you doing.\n\nHealth power ups are rare and disappear in about 2 seconds.  Some puzzles nearly require throwable objects to complete, but throwable objects don't respawn.  Deadly falling spikes are not rare and do respawn rather briskly.\n\nThe gameplay seems to be designed around playing for a very small amount of time and then dying, and then repeating that about a thousand times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodgameclosealmostatie/recommended/315850/","goodgameclosealmostatie","Black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodgameclosealmostatie/","455 products in account","After reading through negative reviews I came to the conclusion that they didn’t seem all that fair and so I decided to write this review which I will aim to keep reasonable short, concise and fair.\n\nThe first thing that I think I should mention is that this game is hard and, at times, extremely frustrating; however please don’t write it off just for this reason. With this being said it’s a game I am yet to just quit and forget about, all the deaths which occur seem fair and I was able to get on with the game even if I muttered a few choice words under my breath.\n\nLet’s start with the controls! The default controls themselves are horrendous, but after I spent some time changing the binds around until I found a control scheme which fit the way I play I was able to play with some modicum of ease. Controllers are also supported however I haven’t played with one and so I can’t say anything regarding this method of input. The game also seems to be really picky about the location which you need to stand in order to pick up bodies and objects; you may first think that to pick up an item you need to stand to the side of it as you would in other games, however in Amazing Princess Sarah you are required to stand in the dead centre, which is either in front of it for a game object or on top of it for a body and if you are off slightly you just won’t pick it up – there is no room for error. This mechanic bugs me a lot. On a certain level you are required to pick up and then throw bodies and objects to defeat a boss whilst being on the run the entire time, if you miss even a couple of bodies you’re going to be out of luck and will have to restart the fight; coupled with this awkward mechanic it took me quite a few attempts and several swears to be victorious.\n\nWith regards to the controls again, even after rebinding them to suit my play style I still had a lot of trouble stopping in the right places because Sarah seems to have banana peels for shoes, causing her to slide and have trouble stopping where you want her to as well as accurately performing jumps, however that last one might just be because I’m terrible.\n\nI also noted that a quote from the review by digitallydownloaded.net described the game as “One of the best Castlevania-inspired titles”. If they were referring to the awkward controls that these generations of games had then they are dead on, unlike the jumps I attempted to make.\n\nI know what you’re probably thinking now. “Why would I want to spend my time playing a game with bad controls and awkward mechanics? Why should I bother buying this game now?” Well, allow me to continue.\n\nDespite having extremely awkward controls and mechanics the game is very enjoyable and takes absolutely no prisoners regarding the mechanics and enemies. Save points in this game are statues which automatically save the game as soon as you are close enough, however the trouble with this is that the levels are fairly large and the statues scarce. This means you may have to clear a large section of the level to get to a save point and if you die before you manage to reach one you go straight back to your last save point or, if you haven’t reached one on that level yet, back to the start. You have a set amount of health which increases as you level up and as far as I am aware there is no way to restore your health midgame other than getting a Castlevania-style heart to drop from a defeated enemy or a destroyed game object, however this seems a fairly uncommon occurrence and eve then your health isn’t replenished by much. This isn’t too bad as the enemies don’t deal a great amount of damage but the enemies who do can easily be avoided or killed from a safe position, in fact the only way you die instantly is to pitfalls deaths.\n\nThe game has a variety of different enemies ranging from zombies and skeletons to demonettes and fire elementals each of which have their own attacking style. When an enemy is killed you have a window of time to pick up the body before it fades away to use it as a weapon, when you want to use it as a weapon you throw it using the key you normally use to attack, when the body collides with a solid instance it actives in a unique way for each enemy. I won’t say anything else regarding this in fear of spoilers and to allow you, a potential player, to find out for yourselves and figure out in what situation a specific body would be beneficial. The final enemy I will mention are the Bats, which are seemingly everywhere. There is what appears to be an infinite number of bats flying about on each level in fixed paths and positions whose sole purpose is to distract and infuriate the player by dealing damage to Sarah and knocking her off the platform she just jumped too all the way down to the bottom, this definitely adds to the difficult and charm as well as adding a Castlevania-style feel to the game. If you don’t spend at least 20 minutes trying to navigate a set of platforms in one particular level then you must have hacked the game.\n\nSarah’s only weapon is a sword which doesn’t do a great deal of damage but can perform critical hits which make up for this. Environmental objects can also be picked up such as grandfather clocks, tables and chairs which can all be thrown at enemies to deal greater amount of damage as well as being able to perform critical hits which deal a very high amount of damage to all enemies. This mechanic is something very out of place in a game about a Princess but it works and it adds to enjoyment of the player and without it the gameplay itself wouldn’t stand up to much.\nAmazing Princess Sarah is a very standard 2D platform game with slight RPG elements. Slight elements being you have health which increases as you level up, you gain XP for defeating enemies and you are able to level up to an infinite level. Your goal is to save your father who was seduced and kidnapped by Lilith and to do this you must fight your way through 5 castles. Why 5 castles? The only reason I can think of as to why the developers would make it castles is due to her being a Princess and her father the King. But why would Sarah need to fight her way through 5 different castles to rescue her father? Doesn’t she know where Lilith’s castle is? No could be an appropriate answer for this question, but the concept itself is fairly weak, flawed and quite standard when it comes to these types of games. However this again adds to the nostalgic feel that you are playing an older game.\n\nThe game itself is also quite humorous and got a couple of giggles out of me. For one the characters breasts are animated along with her sprite meaning that they move as you move, this is the same for the other female enemies in the game such as the fire elementals and demonettes who also scream for help when you pick them up to throw them. The bosses are very different to what you might expect and are completely out of place for a Princess game, but that’s what makes this game what it is and that is a fun, challenging, frustrating 2D platform game that you’ll want to continue playing until you complete it.\n\nI would recommend this game if you like 2D platforming games, don’t mind the fact there is no way to change the difficulty which is essentially based on your own skill which builds up as you play, and if you don’t mind the story and enemies which make little to no sense.\n\nIf you don’t like difficult and challenging games or 2D sprite based platformer games then this game isn’t for you.\nI do believe that anybody can enjoy this game if they are willing to spend time playing it and that if you see it on sale you should definitely pick it up if you’re unsure about it.","December 21, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But this game is by no real means a "bad" game, but it's not really a grand game either. It's in that grey zone of "eh, it's not great, it's not bad, it's just....par".\n\nThe game gives you two methods of attack, a tiny butter knife called a sword that does barely any damage, and being able to pick up dead foes and random objects for the real attack power. Each foe has special properties to them that makes this title stand out a tad bit, but the same enemies are in every stage, and they don't start doing pallete swaps until stage 3, which makes the previous stage feel a tad dull. On the bright side, though, it enables you to learn and plan use of your foe's corpses.\n\nThe game also has a neat handicap mechanic, as I like to refer to it, where you can level up by killing foes for exp. This makes it where every time you die, you retain your gained exp and can take a few more hits and deal some more damage so you can shrug off foes easier, but if you're good at the game, you'll have a harder time because you won't absorb as much exp. Thus why I refer to it as a handicap, and I approve of this.\n\nHowever, due to the same enemies appearing over and over, and there not really being any sort of mechanics besides "throw foes, hit switches, jump on platforms", this game is pretty dull. But hey, if you're desiring a platformer and have a few bucks, then I guess I can suggest this.\n\nPlus, there are extra game modes once you beat the game once, so there's...I guess replayability. There you have it.","December 27, 2014","true","15.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The biggest problem is that Haruneko spent too much time slicking up their game engine and not nearly enough designing interesting levels for their new product.  The stages are generic, overly long, and too claustrophobic for Sarah's genuinely cool throwing attack to shine.  Extra emphasis on "generic": without exception, the levels are cramped and twisty pseudo-mazes that vary only in length and color.  Thankfully, the short main campaign ended just as boredom began to grip me in earnest.  I wasn't about to go for the "true" ending, which requires you to play through the same bland levels about 12 times with the added aggravation of various wacky handicaps (no sword, drunk filter, etc.)\n\nSarah is not truly bad though, it's simply middle-of-the-road.  It's still enjoyable enough to spend a few bucks on if you are a platform-lover (it kept me amused on my stationary bike a good three sessions).  I was just really disappointed with this since I loved the mildly glitchy but well-designed Akane.  Perhaps Haruneko's next game will be something really special since their engine is all polished up and ready to go.","January 5, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Otherwise when you try to do the platforming sections with the analog stick you might get the impression that Princess Sarah is permanentely part of "Holiday on Ice".\n\nSpeaking of ice: The environment of each level is different and has an unique impact on the plaforming and the combat.\n\nThe combat itself is quite nice as well. You can either mash the attack button to kill enemies or alternatively you can pick up enemy corpses or level decoration, such as furniture, and throw them into the enemies to create combos. Since every enemy has a unique impact when being thrown into another one, you can imagine that there are a plethora of ways to create bigger and more unique combinations which yield more experience than just outright killing enmies one after another.\n\nThis segues quite nicely into the next thing I'd like to talk about which is XP. You'll get XP for killing enemies, that's it. And, as in most games, getting XP means that you will get a level up from time to time. Leveling up in this game is a fairly fast and uncomplicated process: You get 2 more HP and a little damage boost. This allows the game to throw progressively stronger monsters at you without being unfair.\n\nLast, but by no means least, we take a look at the audiovisual presenation of the game. The graphics are fairly simple, but they fit their purpose in this case. The animations are fluid and look quite neat.\nAudiowise it has to be said that the sound effects get repetitive after some time, but this just pales in comparison to the soundtrack which is, as with most indie games, in my opinion good enough to be sold on its own.\n\n\nSo we come to the conclusion: Is the game worth it.\nI will hold myself briefly and say: 5€, at this point you can buy it full price.","August 19, 2014","true","2.0"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","11","21","2","0"

One might think that voids my right to have any criticism at all. No because time is also invested and that's even more important than money.\n\nAmazing Princess Sarah is a platformer with a few pretty good ideas to it that ultimately spits in all their faces. An EXP system lets our cantaloupe-chested heroine get stronger and have more HP. Although you have a sword it's far more beneficial to pick up objects or fallen enemies to throw. This is the game's primary mechanic and it works great because different downed enemies have different behaviors when thrown. The ogres slow you down, limit your jumping but do loads of damage. Bats fly far and fast when thrown. Elementals send a magic wave left and right. Succubi clear the screen. And there are enough different enemies to warrant some varied playthough for the raw-fighting areas.\n\nThe platforming is average, which would no doubt drive most players crazy. I can't count the number of times a bat or stray arrow knocked me off a cliff but it'd be somewhere between Castlevania 1 and Whomp`Em. But lives are infinite and checkpoints are fairly frequent (often just before and just after a brutal area) so the frustration is far less than it would've been in the early console era.\n\nGraphics-wise the game is good enough. That titlescreen is beautiful and truthfully foretells the fanservice level. While the monsters themselves are generic flair they're well-made. There's only so many ways you can design a skeleton or zombie after all. I will give the bosses some flack though since most of them just look out-of-place. I understand that sprites that huge could be a problem but each time I saw one I was reminded of an old flash game I tried to make once where I was very lazy with the enemies.\n\nWhen you beat the game it implores you to try Newgame+ to see the true ending. Upon entering Newgame+ you find a game mode selection with most of the options locked. I think there was 7 or so total. You can view the descriptions of the modes and they do things like warp the screen, give you time limits, have a ghost haunt you (that behaves like a regular Boo enemy). It seems like a pretty good way to advance the gameplay experience. Beat the game twice, get the true ending and final boss and then for those challenge-lovers you can try the harder game modes, possibly for other rewards...\n\nExcept that's not how it works. You actually need to beat ALL modes to get the true ending. I tried mode 2 (haunted) for a bit but had other things to do so I put it up for a while. Then while I was telling a friend about the game he explained that he saw a youtube video of it and told me not to bother going for the true ending. I did my own research and found a video with the final battle and true ending in it and I was actually stunned for a bit. You do all that work for a meh boss fight and the lamest ending ever? Seriously, ANY endings to a game I've seen in the past I'd say 15 years is more fulfilling than that. Had I sunk the time into getting that ending, I would've been furious. I was expecting at least another art piece on par with the titlescreen or even some fun credits music but there's not even end credits.\n\nThere's so many things that could've fixed this. Art of the king and his daughter. Maybe something showing or saying that the kingdom was being rebuilt since from what the intro tells us the denizens of hell were apparently made it all the way to the throne room. Maybe jack the absurd comedy up a notch and have Sarah pick up the whole castle and carry it farther away from the demon's realm.\n\nBut it really feels like the developer just stopped caring about his own project. That anyone who played it that far was rewarded solely by the challenge and not any hope of a decent conclusion. And that feeling, that knowing that NOTHING of value awaits me challenging those harder modes makes me not care either. I won't say I want my money back because $2 was fair for that gaming experience. But if I'd played through even one newgame+ mode I would've wanted my TIME back.","November 1, 2015","false","3.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Old-school platform jumping game that feels right at home with anything from the SNES/Super Famicom, Genesis/MegaDrive, or TurboGrafx/PC Engine era. It plays like a cross between Super Mario Bros 2/ Doki Doki Panic and Castlevania. You throw things at the baddies, or whack them with your sword to drop them, then pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can bounce off the heads of some enemies, while others hurt you. Don't touch enemies, spikes, or hazards. Whack torches to gain health pickups.\n\nThe controls are okay but not excellent, which, I suppose is typical for the kinds of games I'm comparing it to, but compared to the really good games of that time, it is somewhat lacking. For the record, I'm using an XBox 360 gamepad.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent, easily up to SNES-par, but the sound effects are okay-but-not-great (notice a theme here?). The protagonist makes a lot of low-fi noise, but I suppose you can turn it down if it's bothering you.\n\nThe graphics are a mixed bag; the sprites are very colourful, but not very detailed most of the time. I'd give them a Genesis rank. The level designs are not very colourful, but they are SNES-level detailed, some with some effects in the background, and even have an active effect on the player, with icy patches, watercourses that push you back, and so on. The character designs are of TurboGrafx vintage; lots of anime boobies everywhere. It's not evocative, it's not racy, it's not offensive, it's actually just silly, and a bit comical, which is good because it keeps you laughing at that instead of raging at the terrible level design.\n\nOh that level design. Whomever was responsible for the level design needs to be dragged out into the street and flogged. There are lots of "gotcha" tricks and just plain mean enemy placement choices that would be fine if you could see it coming and avoid it, but most of the time you can't. Almost evey level has a section where there are bottomless pits with enemies flying at you that make this NES-era Castlevania enthusiast boil with ineffectual gamer-rage. There are a lot of moving or disappearing platforms over spike pits that force you to redo the entire section, or just die a slow, spikey death if you make even one mistake. I cannot understate how obnoxious the levels are.\n\nThe enemies are all varied, each with their own trick, which in turn, provides the player with said trick if they are used as a weapon (kind of the whole schtick of this game). The bosses are screen-filling monstrosities that each have a gimmick to defeating them. They all have tells to avoid being hit, though sometimes it's unclear what will damage you and what won't.\n\nOverall, given the inexpensive cost of this game, I'll give it a pass, but just barely. It's not, and I mean NOT up to modern standards, even for a game of this kind, but if you want a hit of newstalgia, or if you are too young to remember the NES era, if you want to know what it was like, then this is worth checking out, but do yourself a favour and wait for a sale.","January 4","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Amazing Princess Sarah.\n\nAmazing Princess Sarah is a decently fun action platformer game created Haruneko Entertainment. I've played Akane the Kunoichi on XBOX 360 and finished that game 100% and I thought I may enjoy this game as well, since I actually did 100% Akane the Kunoichi.\n\nThe game is decently long, but it's filled with a bit of artificial longevity. The way the game works is that you go through the main campaign and then it pretty much throws you back to the beginning of the game, tells you there's a new rule or implacable enemy or some other caveat has been added, then asks you to play the game through its entirety again with that rule.\n\nFor sake of simplicity (and because I actually haven't done the NG+ system too much), this opinion is only for first playthrough.\n\nSo my opinion is... It's not a bad game. It's taken up 2 hours of my life and I didn't regret it at all. I think that with the way the game is, $4.99 may be a little much, but any sale on this game ever would make it a decent buy.\n\nThis has been a Robot Maid Review.

Correct me if I am wrong about this one, but everyone that had the issue reported to have an AMD card.\n\nThe issue is the screen will change to black in every stage at random intervals. Forcing you to pause and hit the F12 button to fix it, until the next time it happens. This problem never occurred once in Stage 4 and it doesn’t happen on boss fights either. Still, when I end my gaming session and see two dozen blank screenshots, it is a little infuriating that I had to do that.\n\nIf you played this during the time that this game was a slip and slide fest, you probably didn't enjoy it too much. This has since then been remedied. Amazing Princess Sarah will frustrate you depending on your level of skill with platform games. There are seven game modes to play through counting the initial play through.\n\nEach one offers a unique approach to completing the game, which recycles the same five levels each time. This is not really a bad thing, but for some it is not a good thing either. Knowledge of the level layout came in handy for the more tedious game modes.\n\nAmazing Princess Sarah isn’t really groundbreaking or new. It takes elements from Mario 2, Kirby, and Castlevania to provide an amusing adventure. The price is fine for what you get, but snag the game on sale if you can hold off. I enjoyed the game, but I can’t suggest anyone else buy it.\n\nEven though this review has been positive for the most part,  I can't suggest this game to anyone. Fun, frustrating, and repetitive is how I would describe this game in a nutshell.\n","August 24, 2014","false","18.0"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

I really did. However, this game feels unfinished in general.\n\nThe game has a number of small missing details from a complete game, such as music during game over or when the levels are cleared. Instead, it cuts the music entirely. Likewise, there isn't much in the way of enemy variety. The few that exist are merely recolored over and over to indicate that they're stronger/faster. Levels go on far too long, and are poorly designed. Even the basic concepts like the combo system is poorly implimented. THrown enemies, for the most part, can only kill one enemy when they hit them. Theres no domino effect to kills, nor any reliable ways to get high combos beyond meleeing enemies in a small group cluster. All in all I'd say avoid this game.

I can tell that this could have easily been a good game but the makers of the game spent to much time trying to make it like other games and on the pixel ♥♥♥♥. They could have put in some story and given the character something that makes them an actual character, but they felt making moving pixel ♥♥♥♥ more important. People will mistake this game for being 'hard' but it is not hard, it is just cheap (and yes there is a difference between cheap and hard). This game took the worst bits of Castlevania, Mario, and other classic games and combined them into a single game. I like a game that is challenging, not one that is almost broken at some points with how cheap it is. The soundtrack is some awful generic guitar that, even though i love rock and metal, just gets so irritating after a short time that it makes it even harder to keep playing this game. I will say that the first level was well made but after that it just becomes so god damn cheap that it's not even funny. One of the worst parts was in the third level where, if your not standing in just the right spot when you hit a lever, you fall into spikes and then have to sit and listen to the 'character' make the pained noise until you run out of health.\n\nI also refuse to acknowledge the 'character' as a gender becsause there is no actual personality.\n\n\n♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME.

Indeed, all thetypical things AVGN complained about in his game reviews can be found in this game:\n- awkward controls? check. You can't even move while attacking with your sword\n- bats? check\n- terrible scrolling/unable to see bottom for safety? check\n- etc etc etc\n\nThis game is good for a laugh but definetely not something to take seriously and complete to the end. I can't recommend this as long as the controls are as poor as they currently are. I suggest the developer buy super meat boy and play it to understand what good controls in a 2d platformer are. Super meat boy is and always will be the benchmark for 2d platforming controls.\n\nThis is still the best 2d "female protagonist" game on steam so if you are looking for a sexualised platformer, this is the best one to pick, ultionus is horrible and timespinner is not out yet.\n\nEdit: Apparently there is a better 2d female protagonist game on steam..... Don't buy this game. Don't listen to the boobs. Don't let super mario bros 2 nostalgia bait you into getting this.\n\nEdit2: There is a small redeeming quality to this game that anyone who makes it to the end of level 1 will immediately notice.

She just slashes a pathetic distance with a sword and throws things. She can't duck, her animations suck and she has nothing special about her what so ever.\n\nOverall the game is generic, poor and uninteresting BUT that's only half of where my complaints come from; the other half of my complaints come from the disgusting amount of white knights, feminazis and trolls that the discussion/community page this game has. "HUR DUR WHY DOES SHE HAVE LARGE BREASTS?", "HUR DUR WHY IS FEMALE PROTAGONIST A TAG WHICH IS JUST HIGHLIGHTING HER SEXUALITY AS THE MAIN PLAYING POINT!" ♥♥♥♥ off, you autistic ♥♥♥♥♥; it's a ♥♥♥♥ing game!\n\nWorse community for a game i have ever seen and i've played some really bad games. I just thank the devs for not making this game have multiplayer; that's the one compliment i have for this game.","August 19, 2014","false","0.6"," 7 of 31 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","7","31","0","2"

My biggest complaint would be that it isn't very challenging. Some of the more difficult parts of the game can be bypassed by running through them and taking damage. The spikes should be less frequent and instant kills.\n\nPros:\n-Nice art design\n-Excellent controls\n\nCons:\n-Too easy, not much challenge\n-Level design conflicts with core gameplay. If the central theme is picking up and throwing items than the tight corridors aren't very conducive to that.","January 6, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some very hard levels and 6 new game plus settings, with really hard challenges.\nYou will laugh, swear, despair but mostly you will carry onward and finish it eventually.\n\nEDIT: enemy variety is the weak point of this game with only 7 enemies being constantly recycled as a different color, and as of the third stage that happens so fast you lose track of which is more powerful than the other. END EDIT\n\nYes I would recommend this game, and will give a big shootout to the developer Haruneko to change the Boxart as is pretty misleading.\n\nOh! and play it with a controller!","January 7, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Brings me back to my childhood. Takes after Castlevania and Super Mario Bros 2. It starts out kind of easy, but the challenge picks up in a hurry. The checkpoints save you from getting frustrated later, if you die, you don't lose your level ups, so if you die, you'll eventually get through it due to your level ups. The game is 16 bit graphics intentionally with a fantastic soundtrack and sound effects. I'm loving every minute of it, don't understand the mixed reviews.","January 23, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
