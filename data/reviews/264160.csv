"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vill311/recommended/264160/","Vill311","Thor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vill311/","4121 products in account","The most appealing part of this game for me is the smooth transition between action and strategy. You can be running down a hallway and mowing down goblins, then suddenly you're inches away from a giant, sifting through your inventory and trying to decide which item is the most likely to prevent his club from crushing your skull. Do you have a sleeping potion to throw at him? Maybe this unidentified scroll can teleport you to safety? Your wand of polymorphing might turn him into something that can't wield a club...\n\nLooting is another big part of the game that stands out for me. Almost every enemy drops something, often many somethings. My inner hoarder can't help but squeal in delight when I've finished slaughtering a battallion of gnomes and find myself standing knee-deep in daggers, various wands, and a pile of tiny outfits. You have a fair bit of inventory space, and it's surprising how fast this can fill up with scrolls, potions, books, gems, weapons, rings/amulets, armors, foods, etc. Then you have to decide what you want to identify, sell, drink, read, or keep for emergencies.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, having hundreds of items and unlimited time to think doesn't make the game get any easier as you go further down. Enemies become stronger and spawn more quickly, until you're fighting your way through waves of liches, giants, skeletons and demons. Your stockpile of healing items, wands and scrolls can be quickly depleted if you don't plan ahead or if you just have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ luck. Beating the bosses and making it back to the top is a major accomplishment, one that you'll only experience after you have a good grasp on how things work and what the best ways to approach situations are. Even then it's still a rather rare experience, especially with the most difficult characters.\n\nThere are only a few games that I can say I've put hundreds of hours into, and I'm proud to say that this is one of them.\n\nTL;DR - Replayability, looting, inventory-management, strategy.","February 17, 2014","true","61.9"," 127 of 144 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","127","144","0","0"

I was gifted this game for Christmas by a friend and I've played 78 hours in less than a week. That should tell you something. This game is digital crack, it's that addictive. I'm low on sleep and my left eye has a nervous twitch now but who cares? It's back into the dungeon for me. I highly recommend this to those that like true roguelike games such a Nethack or Tales of Maj'Eyal and/or dungeon crawlers in general. In short this game is just pure fun.\n\nPros:\nThe game is like peeling the layers of an onion. It seems easy to get into, but then you die. And die again. And huh, how about that, I died again. Before long you find new things about the game. Then more new things. And more. And then you start doing better and hey, I may just beat this game after all. Thinking is required to win. You can hack away and have fun, but to stay alive and win you must use everything you have.\n\nTons of items, content, creatures, equipment. Lot's of cool hidden little things to find out.\n\nVery good graphics and engine for a game like this. The semi-realtime works perfectly and is a great innovation.\nCons:\nCaution: Requires willpower to force yourself to take a break to eat or sleep. If you're like me you may not be able to tear yourself away from the game.","December 31, 2014","true","177.5"," 70 of 80 people (88%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","88","70","80","29","0"

If you're a fan of NetHack then you'll immediately find yourself at home as the game mechanics are pretty similar to the old classic. This game is basically a 2D turn based game. Time only passes when you move or take action, so you can take your time and plan ahead to your hearts content.\n\nThis game is hard like any other roguelike out there, so if you're not into hard or challenging games, then don't pick it up. You'll have a pretty good time trying to get past that 300 feet mark or to survive the depths without dying of starvation.\n\nThe game also features over 300 different items, and every time you die all the items/potions/weapons/armor will be randomly generated and have different stats. There are also several different classes to chose from and both the male and female version of the class start with different equipment. Playing as a wizard can be extremely hard, but it's also a lot more rewarding later on into the game.\n\nWazWaz has been the lone developer of this game for a very long time already and he has done a phenomenal job so far. Some people might be put off by the "grotesque" or "lacking" graphics, but hey, you're playing a roguelike here.\nIt's not like graphics matter when you are looking at a genre based around depth in gameplay and game mechanics.\n\nTake your time, plan ahead, always carry with you some items which can help you escape (like teleport scrolls or wands) and learn from your mistakes,you'll soon come out victorious!\n\nAnd remember: dying is part of the "fun".","February 18, 2014","true","8.6"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/recommended/264160/","FlyingShisno","Flying Shisno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/","769 products in account","I originally bought this game when it was released on Desura close to 2 years ago, and have put many hours into it.\n\nIt's a "pseudo-turn-based" game, where you can run around with the WASD keys like a platformer, but enemies/NPC's only move and attack while your moving and attacking. While you are not doing anything, neither is the enemy. In a way, it's kinda like FTL in that regard. Kinda.\n\nFor those familiar with roguelikes, Wazhack, as the name suggests, takes a lot of inspiration from Nethack, to the point where it might be easier to describe it  "2.5D Nethack". You can see it in the items; the way they are identified, cursed, blessed, enchanted, etc..\n\nThat's not to say that it's a clone though, Wazhack has MANY of it's own features that I don't want to spoil for everyone, and even has branch dungeons and many different enemy models and spells.\n\nThere's even going to be a multiplayer like feature, though not in the traditional sense.\n\nIf you like roguelikes, Wazhack is definitely one to pick up.\n\nEDIT: I hadn't played this game for about 5 months, and the game is even better than it was back then. Loads of new content, including items, events and even classes were added. There's also been even more balance changes. The game was far more fair than Nethack ever was, and now even more so. Just the right amount of fairness and challenge.\n\nFor beginners, the Barbarian/Vandal is a great class to start with due to their high health, damage, and starting weapon. You'll have trouble finding armor due to their large size, but their high health makes up for it. By the way, you can tell if your Barbarian/Vandal can use armor if the armor in question has something along the lines of 'very large' in parenthesis underneath it's name.\n\nThe only thing I really consider bad in this game is the pet AI(every class starts with a pet). While it's certainly leagues better than Nethacks, they're terrible when it comes to running across ladders, though they're better now than the last time I've played. I also wish you could set their aggressiveness like in Torchlight 2. Honestly, they're not all that useful, but they're nice company in that lonely dungeon. I also wish you could choose which pet to take, rather than each class having it's own pet, though I understand the reason behind that.\n\nFor those who want to try before buying, go to it's Desura page here: http://www.desura.com/games/wazhack\n\nOn that page, click the blue "Free" button next to demo. If you don't want to use Desura, simple click the Free Button and look for the link that says "Download Direct", and you'll be able to download the standalone demo installer.","February 17, 2014","true","24.9"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","33","41","0","0"

So after many hours I took down the end boss. I thought it will now be easy to get back to the top. Well, all of hell came down on me. My heart was pounding after all my heal potions were gone and I was left with little health to make it out. With an epic dash I got out for the win. Whats the big deal some might say. The big deal is that you can invest 6hrs in the game only to lose it all. There is no old save to fall back on. Its old school perma death. Aside from the main quest and the chance of dying a few hundred times the game has many cool extras. Such as the chance to find epic loot like the classic Excaliber or some good old +3boots of speed. There are also a few optional bosses as well, like the God of Wine or the Gnome King, each with their own side dungeon.

I picked it up in a recent weekly sale on a whim, and I'm glad I did.\n\nI find there is something charming about the graphics, it reminds me of 90's prerendered 3D sprites or something, and has some cute item physics and corpse ragdoll.\nSound effects are adequate, although the small amount of music quickly led me to turning it off.\nThe mobile version is also surprisingly good and controls well, and you can play the first few levels for free if you insist on trying it before you buy.\n\nBut the most important thing is the gameplay, randomisation and discovery, and that's where it shines as a true rogue-like. At first you have no idea how to deal with all the different items, but with each run you learn a bit more, and discover a little more of the hidden attributes, details and interactions. Sometimes I find this kind of hidden information frustrating, but so far in WazHack the discovery and new possibilities you learn has been really fun.\n\nI'm informed that WazHack takes a lot of inspiration from NetHack, and while I've played various rogue-likes, and a lot of Angband (which I finally beat recently), I never really played NetHack. I like WazHack enough that I'm thinking I probably should have played NetHack more, but for now I expect to enjoy a lot more hours in WazHack.","February 12, 2015","true","38.0"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

Classes are pretty well-balanced. Blends in some modern mechanics, while keeping to the genre. Good cheese. No spoon-feeding.\n\nCons: Could use more content. It isn't as rich in items and monsters as many rogue variants (nethack, angband, moria, and tome), or as other modern "roguelikes" that don't stick to the classic formula.

Make no mistake though getting said amulets will require hours and hours of effort into learning strategies/game mechanics so you can increase your odds of survival.\n\nThe RNG isn`t unfair in this game, that said in some runs you may get ultimate items on the first floor or in another room more than half of the stuff you pick up is cursed(cursed means the item will probably do something you hate like for instance if it is an equipment it will be glue to you, if it is a potion the effect will be diminished) BUT make no mistake a good player is capable of prevailing against odds if he knows what he is doing.\n\nThere are tons of classes each with a diferent playstyle, you have wizards,rogues,archers,knights and the variants like barbarian(a big warrior that has issues to wear armor due to his big size).\n\nabout equipments, it is possible to equip 2 rings,1 cape,boots,gloves,armor and a helmet(just like any rpg you ever played)\n\nnow for some PROS and CONS\n\nPros\n-Huge replayability(look my playtime)\n-Interesting game mechanics(won`t spoil much find about it yourselves)\n-Randomized dungeon/items assures you no playtrought will be the same\n-Has Online coop\n-You can save during the game\n\nCons\n-Huge difficulty(your first tries will always be failures, unless you know what you are doing the game can be pretty unfair at times)\n-There are no diferent difficulties to the game(in other words you can`t choose between easy,medium,hard, the game has only 1 difficulty setting)\nNeutral\n\n-It is a roguelike so every run you only get one life\n-The only thing you carry over trought playtroughs is your intelligence(in other words you should learn from your mistakes and always strive to go deeper)\n\nWith all that said, i truly enjoyed wazhack, and i had a blast playing it with a friend it is only one of the few games in my library that i have invested soo much time, for an indie game developed by just one guy i truly i got way more than my moneys worth.\n\nIf you are a fan of roguelikes buy this, if you are a fan of rpgs buy this, but if the idea of permadeath turns you off you should play stay away from this game","October 16, 2015","true","114.7"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

There are over a dozen classes to choose from, each with a skill tree with unique (or at least varied) skills to level up to improve your chosen character.  Along the way I'd run into leprechauns and psychadelic fountains that caused the entirety of my game to look like I was tripping on acid while I did battle with floating shapes and swirling colors.\n\nUnfortunately, the game quickly gets old.  In reality, the characters don't -feel- much different from one another once you're in the dungeon.  Unlike other rogue-likes, where you will die and go, "Oh man!  I should've done <enter alternative course of action here>" and give the game another go, I felt frustrated more than anything with this particular game.  It seemed like all too often my death was unrelated to anything done on my part and more of a roll of the die that resulted in an overpowered monster showing up or a weapon that was cursed that I never had the opportunity to uncurse on that particular run.\n\nIn the end, the game isn't -bad- persay.  I might even install it and give it another go in the future when I'm feeling bored.  I don't recommend this game, however, because there are far better rogue-likes out there to play that are more fun and have a much longer longevity to them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geggiis/recommended/264160/","geggiis","geggis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geggiis/","331 products in account","One of the biggest surprises of last year for me and easily one of my games of 2013. Wazhack is an unusual roguelike (like, a real roguelike, not a roguelike-like) because not only does it feature full 3D animated visuals, lighting and physics, it’s also a side-scroller instead of the traditional top-down fare.\n\nWazhack wasn't one of my games of 2013 just for its unusual appearance for a roguelike though, I loved it so much because it was the source of many an unexpected and grim tale (as roguelikes often are) thanks to its careful, tactical play and many emergent systems and mechanics. Here are a few choice screenshots from my time with the Android version, complete with anecdotal captions:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/hpm80\n\nWazhack is full of these moments and often ones that aren't so easy to relay in single screenshots.\n\nGranted, the game's graphics are very… particular, and certainly not for everyone (I personally find them really charming and they look tactile as if they've been handmade), but because everything is in 3D the game can afford certain luxuries that a frame-by-frame pixel art roguelike can't, so for example you can see what gear enemies are wearing and wielding at a glance, while your own character’s appearance changes depending on what you equip. When you sell stuff, you also see it populating the shopkeeper’s shelves, racks, pots and busts (which is a really neat touch). And of course the physics and lighting work with the 3D too: loot explodes and tumbles from enemies, their limp bodies slump and slide, amulets around your neck jostle about, lit lamps illuminate your way, arrows ricochet off surfaces (and can be retrieved), capes flap and fall (yes, there are capes in Wazhack). It's just nice to play a roguelike that can be easily read.\n\nWazhack is absolutely worth your time if you’re wanting something that's meaty and rich that you can play in short (or long) bursts. It's ideal on handheld devices too. The original PC version here looks a lot better and is easier to use with mouse and keyboard, but the Android and iOS versions are portable gems in their own right.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Waz (the developer) has been improving and adding to Wazhack since it was released back in 2012 and only recently he added another 8 classes and overhauled the talent system!\n\nTL:DR - Charming, solidly designed, accessible, deceptively deep, surprising, extremely challenging and replayable, funny, tactical and just bags of fun, Wazhack is a bit of a desert island game for me now and one of the genre’s best kept secrets. The game is available on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS and can even be played (and trialled) in your browser at: http://www.wazhack.com/play.","February 17, 2014","true","5.1"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","25","42","0","0"

A lot.\n\nThat you'll (very, very) often die in unexpected and hilarious ways may or may not make the game more attractive to you.\n\nThe game is, in essence, Nethack with a slightly fancier graphic interface. Don't be fooled by this into thinking you're playing anything but a turn-based game, however. If you stop, the action stops. As the tagline says you have "all the time in the world" and that's true as far as it goes. You're free to walk away from the PC for an hour while an angry Dwarf Lord is staring you in the face, axe poised to cleave your skull in two, and rest assured that he'll still be there when you return, just as short and belligerent as he was when you left.\n\nThe classes you have to choose from run from the rather humdrum Knight to the ever-faithful Wizard to a singing Bardess, each of whom is endowed with the sort of standard STR, CHA, DEX etc. attributes common to most dungeon-themed games. The starting attributes can be tweaked, to an extent, but each character has certain minimums/maximums in each category that cannot be exceeded. Likewise your alignment can be changed, but again only to an extent. Not all characters can be played as "Chaotic Evil", for instance.\n\nThe game itself is set up as a simple dungeon, into which depths you must descend in increments of 100 feet, with 3 floors per "level". Enemies will scale both according to level depth, and according to your character's current attributes and abilities. The strong you get, and the deeper you go, the tougher enemies you can expect to encounter. The entire dungeon consists of 3000 feet, i.e. 90 floors to explore, at the bottom of which you'll encounter one of several varieties of the game's main Boss.\n\nTo help you get there you'll have an inventory in which you can store a limited amount of items and equipment such as spells, potions, armor, weapons, food and magical items. How much you can carry is determined by your CON attribute, and as this varies from character to character you'll find that different characters require different strategies in terms of what you'll decide to hold onto and what you'll have to discard. Your Barbarian or Vandal may be able to hold on to an astounding number of items, but your White Witch will find herself quickly over-encumbered and see her attack speed and movement speed reduced as a result. Choose wisely, in other words, both your character and their possessions.\n\nThe inventory is/can be quite large, but since you're playing a turn-based game there's nothing stopping you from taking what time you need to sort through it. By default the game allows you to sort items by weight at the click of a button, or to sort by category such as "tools" etc., in the same way. There are also items to be found in-game that can give you the ability to sort by "value" or the like, but access to these isn't guaranteed.\n\nCombat is performed by either magical or physical means. You have the standard health and mana meters, which will scale both according to your character's level and are also dependent on a few other factors such as potions/drinks or various things and places you can interact with as you progress. Spellbooks abound, as do various wands, all flavored toward "evil" or "good" uses, as well as "dark" and "light" magic. Your ability to use these and the strength of the corresponding effect are seperate attributes that are improved with use, and they are mutually exclusive of one another, meaning if you increase your ability to perform "light" magic you will lessen the maximum possible ability that you could obtain in "dark" magic, or vice versa.\n\nWeapons range from the humble staff to the mighty Excalibur to your bare fists, if you're so inclined. Weapon proficiencies, like those of spellcasting, are increased as you use a given weapon category such as Bows or Two-Handed swords or staves and so on. Some enemies are more susceptible to magical attacks than physical, while some operate on the reverse principle. Knowing what to use against a given enemy comes through trial and error, and in this game "error" means a quick and not necessarily painless death.\n\nThere are various NPCs spread throughout the dungeon, though their number, the cost of their services, and their attitude toward you and your quest are all  dependent, at least in part, on your particular character's CHA skill. A higher CHA means more NPCs, so again some characters can expect to be able to take advantage of more variety of services than others.\n\nThe game also includes two "side areas" in every dungeon. Their location is somewhat randomized, but there is always a Gnomish Mine to the left and a Roman Fort to the right. When or if you decide to go in them is entirely optional, although the Mines provide some very useful resources for the late game. The Roman Fort is often avoided entirely, as most players consider it to be far more difficult to complete then the base game, and I tend to agree. I only enter the fort *after* I've completed the full 3000 foot base challenge, and only then if I'm feeling very powerful and am prepared to die in a hail of arrows if I make a single mistake.\n\nThe game is difficult, to be sure. Many say exceedingly so, and the word "impossible" comes up rather often in conversations dealing with the game. If perma-death isn't your thing you should probably avoid this at all costs, but if you're prepared for a challenging environment, a large variety of enemies, and a moderately healthy dose of RNG, you could do a lot worse than Wazhack. Personally I enjoy the hell out of it, deaths at 100 feet from club-wielding Kobolds notwithstanding. My first success didn't come until I'd clocked 100 hours in the game, but by then I was well hooked and a taste of victory only prompted me to try again with a new class, and a new strategy.\n\nIf you do try it, above all keep in mind that despite the graphical interface this is 100% a turn-based game. Don't get suckered into thinking you have to rush anything. When you encounter difficulty stop, look through your inventory and give some thought to what item or scroll or potion or wand, etc, will offer you the best chance at coming out of the fight alive. Sometimes you won't discover anything that will work for certain, and you'll be reduced to quaffing a random, unidentified potion in the hopes that it will heal you, or zapping the enemy with an unidentified wand in the hopes that he'll just die already, but other times you'll realize that the key to survival is right there in your pocket, and then you can congratulate yourself and move on, probably right  into the face of an even worse enemy.\n\nEnjoy!","February 21","true","401.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

I was fairly new to rogue-likes at the time- I had only really delved into the survival genre (UnReal World and Cataclysm: DDA) after becoming perma-death obsessed through playing Don't Starve and FTL, but I had stayed away from hardcore dungeon crawlers and *hack games. I've since played nethack and other dungeon rogue-likes, but I just keep coming back to Waz. It's so simple to play compared to other rogue-likes in this genre because of the more tangible graphics and absence of the constant need to input keyboard commands.\n\nDon't let the user-friendly design and graphics put you off if you are a true rogue-like fan, as this is not a "rogue-lite" at all, but a full-on hardcore adventure complete with emergent gameplay and those grand educational experiences (death, death, and more death) that you expect from these games. Your have the same overall controls over your character that you do in nethack, all items are unidentified, scroll names are obfuscated (again, just like nethack), and like half of the items are cursed.\n\nIt might not have some of the features of nethack (religion is absent, at least in the form it has in nethack, and there aren't as many classes) but I wouldn't be surprised if the dev worked that stuff in eventually as it seems development is ongoing. It used to be a good bit easier than nethack (actually got the amulet once but died soon after...didn't ascend) but it appears the dev has ramped up the difficulty in more recent updates and I'm having trouble consistently getting characters to 600 ft.\n\nSome people criticize the graphic style but I don't mind it and actually find it amusing. Same goes for sound but it does its job. rogue-likes have never been known for graphics and sound anyway.\n\nIf you don't know anything about rogue-likes, this would be a great place to start as it's a "real" rogue-like in a user friendly package that gives you easy acces to the "core experience" of this genre.","April 13, 2014","true","23.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Rogue-like perma-death I understand and expected.   But this is a game where the designers exercise arbitrary control over every choice you can make, and it isn't the better for their choices.\n\nThe mechanics and the attack/spell visuals for all the different "classes" are the same.  Their starting stats are pretty much all the same.   And limited by the game -why?  If I want to play a wizard with Intelligence 13 and Strength 15, or a barbarian with constitution 9 and wisdom 16 - why stop me?  The character may die faster, but that's my choice.  And it might make starting a new character every 15 minutes a bit more interesting.  Or at least give the illusion of player control.\n\nBut when my pet dies from MY attacks (because I have no control over it and it won't attack but also won't move away?)  I get tired of that pretty quickly.   When you pass a side door the game asks "Investigate Yes/No?" but your answer doesn't matter- either way the monsters come out. In large numbers.  Behind you.   Right on top of your pet, if they're still alive.  (Yeah, every time over at least 20 rounds of play...wth?)\n\nWhen one of my characters dies because a merchant insists I pay for damages from a dwarf attacking ME - and I sell them everything I'd collected, then try to run - and go through every healing I have, a speed potion, all of my attacks,  and even lead the merchant through a trap (which zaps me but doesn't affect the merchant).   And perhaps I wouldn't really mind that if at least it was my character who had broken the merchant's goods!\n\nWas it exciting for two minutes? Yes.   Did I make me want to try again?  No.   That's where this game falls on it's face.\n\nI don't expect a game to be fair, and games can be arbitrary - up to a point.  But if you want my time there has to be something about it that's rewarding to me.   If there is nothing under my control as the player that can change the presentation of the game, the mechanics, or the outcome then why give you my time?\n\nTorchlight on insta-death mode offers much greater variety of classes, skills, creatures, customizations, mods and settings.","January 4, 2015","false","93.0"," 31 of 54 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","31","54","5","3"

You'll find that the gems of the game aren't right on the surface. Indeed, it is seemingly just a side-scroll roguelike (or roguelite or roguelike-like for people concerned with semantics). But Waz didn't just make a smash monster, grab loot game. There's unique ways of identifying items, unique combinations of item/spell usage, and unique tactics for various situations. Many of the concepts in Wazhack were carried over from Nethack, but it avoids being quite as complex. I found myself engrossed in this game when I had it on tablet (more so than many other roguelikes) and it still makes an excellent PC game (for casual or serious dungeon runs).

I've been recently playing nethack on vulture before i found this and what a great surprise! Combining the easy feel of platform games with the rougue like gaming on seemingly endless map scenarios. My favorite thing is how they have kept to the title name with the naming system. I was hoping for some prayers because they help you out of some sticky situations in the original game and the lack of the pickaxe for crushing walls is to bad but other then that its true to the original with so many classes to choose from and random levels, it offers great replayabilty which is somthing I often look for in a game.\nSo overall I would have to say that it a good 9 out of 10 for me.","March 13, 2014","true","14.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

That is the nature of the genre--a careful balancing act between the influence of luck and of skill. Initially, after some "unfair" deaths, you will think the game is all about luck. This is an illusion. WazHack does involve quite a bit of skill, but in ways that are not apparent until you have braved the depths repeatedly. You will die, often. You will make mistakes. But unlike a lot of games, growing from those mistakes is not an automatic, subconscious affair. As the great yoshimitsu once said, "overconfidence is the greatest enemy".\n\nHow then, do you reveal the skills involved in WazHack?\n\nEasy. You think. Every item carries a risk, and managing those risks is something learned by practice... By glorious, stupid deaths from a wager failed. Do you try on every piece of equipment you find? Bad move. You just equipped a cursed -3 helm, sucker. Good luck getting that off. Do you equip every amulet or ring you find? Sorry, that was enchanted with polymorph. You are now a rat. It seems random, and to an extent it is. But through play, patterns emerge. Starter pets growl at cursed items as they approach. Traps on the ground could burn, inflict sleep, teleport... Why not jump over? Hm, there's a door here... If I open it, enemies spawn. But if I defeat them all and check once more, I am rewarded.\n\n\nSo yes, WazHack is a game of chance. Every rogue-like is, to varying degrees. But it is also a game of skill. Don't forget it.","February 26, 2014","true","7.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If youve played one, you know how they work. Unidentified potions, scrolls, random magic items, monsters, one keypress is a turn, ect.\nThis is pretty standard, neither as expansive as ADoM or (Z)Angband, with all the races, caves, world, item permutations, monsters and so forth that those games have. Compared to many other 90s and later roguelikes, its pretty simple.\n\n8 classes, each with a male and female type and a pet (the pet is not pickable - each class has their pet). Male and female types are slightly different and have slightly different skills and starting inventory. Stats are customizable by clicking on the stat box, and so is alignment( which I havent found a use for, yet)So really, 16 classes if you wanted to nit pick.\n\nThey are Sorcerer/Sorceress - a monster summoner and "dark magic" type, Wizard/White Witch - a typical spell caster, Knight/Valkyrie- your standard "warrior in shining armor" although the Valkyrie starts with crap armor, Rogue/Thief - Stealthy and thiefly class, Hunter/Huntress - Ranged weapon fighter, Barbarian/Vandal - Huge and strong but no or very little armor, Bard/Bardess (Bardess!?) - plays magic musical instruments, and Druid/Druidess - nature magician.\n\nTheres a nice balance of classes, although I do wish the pet was choosable, or more exotic. I want my Huntress to have a cat! The Thief's monkey is cool and unique.\n\nOther than that, theres just the procedurally created dungeon, no towns, quests or NPCs besides a shopkeeper of Arabian Nights extraction that can be found randomly in the dungeon. The items are what youd expect from a traditional roguelike, althpough there are some pretty cool effects and things you can find. The sounds are just the grunts, thwacks and clangs youd expect from a swordfighting game and theres no music.\n\nSo what makes this game cool?\n\nTwo things. One, unlike most traditional style roguelikes, its not top down but sidescrolling. And 2. No tiles or ASCII - Its graphical with decently rendered graphics for an indie game. Pick up a plaid cape, and put it on, and your PC is wearing it. A "smoking potion" is rendered smoking, fire burns, traps explode, arrows shoot ect. Although there are other graphical roguelikes out there, I personally have never seen a traditional one done like this. Step on a potion, it topples over, throw a dagger and it clangs and slides on the ground before stopping. Also, it is still turn based. When youre not moving, the mosters dont move. It gives it this weird red light, green light (that old children's game) effect that I personally like.\n\nAl in all, its a cool game. I still think the asking price is a bit high at $9.99 for what you get (After all, there are much more complex roguelikes out there for FREE). But I dont mind paying for it, the rendering is nice. And way better than squinting at "@"s and "k"s. If youre a die hard traditional roguelike fan, pick it up, especially if you can find it for 10% or better off!\n\nEDIT: Really weird. I alt-tabbed back to the game, and theres music? There hasnt been any music before this time (and yes, I had the sound on). It just suddenly appeared. So as for the music, its decent. I turned it off though because I was so used to playing that I found it destracting.","February 18, 2014","true","74.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Ugh!  Wahahahahahahaaa!!  WAAA!!\n\nAnd so it goes.  :)\n\nIf it was much easier, the **TENSION** in the game would be lost.  But when it's really close, when both your main character and the pet kitten are both suffocating and losing health and there's no way to know how long it's going to last, and after a while they can both breath again - that tension makes for good stories.  This is what makes the game shine.  And then that acid blob killed my kitty while I was fiddling with putting on some ring of levitation.  NO!!  NOT KITTY!!!\n\nThe dying and losing is also really well done - the humor, the slo-mo... it just gets it right and it's not a mechanical play it over and over again thing like other rogue-likes I've seen and tried.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- the game is impossible, which produces very good tension\n\n- high content (many different potions, scrolls, spells, weapons, armors, game mechanisms, secret knowledge, tribal knowledge, stuff you need to learn to get anywhere)\n\n- the game seems to generate stories even at the very earliest levels (which is as far as I've gotten).  There's some sort of landscape story in there too (i.e. there are some gnomish mines, and some other area with special gods or something).  But besides the landscape story, there is the game mechanism story which randomly "happens" while playing, which makes plays memorable.\n\n- there is an element of survival.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- It's almost certainly unfair.  Oh no I already said that in "Pros - the game is impossible"!\n\n- Wizards are possibly really unfair, and just a random dice throwing insanity machine among other difficult classes, while Barbarians and Knights seem to be "oh you have to play these because the other ones are so hard".  I'm not sure - maybe it's fair.  But probably not.\n\n- Way too much whiney fans?  I asked for an easy setting and got all this "oh no we don't want the option to play it easy" bullshh.  Way too much belief there's something really being accomplished here other than burning away countless hours rolling dice over and over and learning arbitrary game mechanisms.  Guess what?  It's just a game.\n\n\nDeep Tactics:\n\nIt's just a game?!  Okay maybe that misses it.  There is a sort of religious fervor that gets ignited in players, and it won't make any sense after playing for only 10 hours, or maybe even 20 hours.  But there are really deep tactics learned while playing - the game is brutal and there is real hesitation to offer an easy mode just because learning those tactics can be really rewarding (this really cannot be underestimated).  I'm on the fence between "are you wasting your life away learning arbitrary game mechanisms?" and "would I miss the deep tactics that emerge from playing over and over?  Aren't they what create these beautiful stories?"\n\n\nSon, Let Me Tell You About Your Late Uncle:\n\nWhile playing, tactics emerge.  Some get posted in guides and some are only visible in the forum.  Game lore.  This morning I read about someone enchanting a sword, only to find out the sword became sentient as a result and immediately killed the player!  So reading these sorts of posts becomes little mental notes in a Boy Scout Survival Manual in the back of my mind "never enchant  a weapon unless you are prepared to have it try to kill you".  Most of those tactics emerge internally and become an order of priorities as opportunities arise.  Are they good strategies?  Has something been overlooked?  Every move seems to have risks associated whenever bad assumptions are made.\n\nIf you are "lucky", those bad strategies will be punished early and swiftly and impact your own strategy to learn more caution, and possibly to create a systematic approach to every situation.\n\nThe brutality is only for a certain, very special student.  It reminds me of some prestigious religious monasteries, doors always closed, only allowing the most persistent of passerby in who never leaves until the doors let him in, through rain and bad weather, while the ordinary average people only wonder who would ever want to go into such a strange and forbidding place, or have presented to them a very different picture to have them complain and finally leave the serious students alone to find their own accomplishment in peace.\n\n\nTLDR:  Play the demo here http://www.wazhack.com/play","October 16, 2015","true","34.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","1"

With a great engine, (unity 5/1.3 beta 1) it's on android and steam. My buddy says he doesn't like the wonky animations, but compared to ASCII roguelikes and Pixel graphics, Wazhack is a VERY welcome breath of fresh air.  I recommend this steam version (though I have both,) because you don't have to buy the classes separately, and the controller support works like a dream.  Bind some stuff to the right stick, and you're set.  Where scrolls and potions are unidentified, weapons could be cursed, or the legendary Mjolnir for example, leads for some delightfully hilarious gameplay mechanics.  You can find a wand of create monster, bounce it off the walls and make literally dozens of creeps for you to either mezmerize to join your posse, or pierce with a single magic missile to get massive amounts of XP.\n\nIf you like class-based item collecting dungeon crawlers with seemingly endless amounts of replayability via procedural generation, then Wazhack is for you.","June 24, 2015","true","33.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Today is your birthday, but you are 21 years old. You are mighty, charismatic, and healthy. You have perfect blonde hair and use a lot of gel. You've never been one to read books, but you are somehow well trained in handling swords. The pointy end goes into the squishy flesh of evil doers.\n\nOn this beautiful day, you close your eyes and say a prayer to the Big Guy in the cloud to lead you to adventure. The Big Guy has always been with you since you were born, and always tells you what you should do. For example, he might say go left or go right.\n\nWhen your eyes open, you realize you don't know where you are. Some other adventurous looking types are standing around a hole in the ground. The Big Guy calls out to you by name. Everyone stares at you. He says go right; then you should go down. You are uneasy with this path, but left is so very dark. You ask your trusty dog Fido to come along. You like Fido because he growls whenever there is danger nearby. Fido has been your trusty dog for about three seconds. Somehow, this is okay.\n\nAs you head right, you notice broken egg shells around a hole not far from where you stand. Thinking this is quite odd, you approach and peer inside the hole. A ladder descends into the darkness. The Big Guy tells you this is the legendary dungeon of WazHack. He says it contains the amulet of Zaw, and he wants it, NOW. For some reason, you feel like somewhat like committing senseless acts of violence, and invading the homes of others, and robbing them. Next move?\n\nRUN AWAY: The Big Guy is furious at you. If you told your tale of cowardice to your dear mother, she would be deeply saddened. Thankfully, that will never happen. After you turn away, a kobold head pops out of the hole you were looking down. It waves a shiny pink stick at you. A magical missile flies at your head. *Sneak attack, critical damage.* You have died. Try again?\n\nCLIMB DOWN: You congratulate yourself on being a brave adventurer and following the advice of your beloved deity, the Big Guy. Your dog falls to the bottom of the ladder. It doesn't even yelp. Good dog! You reach the bottom and peer around a torch-lit hallway. The Big Guy says go left, no, no wait a second, go right.\n\nGO LEFT: The Big Guy said left first, and there might be something shiny to the left. The Big Guy can't always be right! What does he know? Fido follows behind you very carefully, sniffing for a place to use the bathroom. You don't sense any immediate danger as you walk. Happy that you picked a safe path, you listen to the rhythmic pattern of your boots on the floor. You walk some more, and suddenly an orange haze appears around you. The room starts to fade. You close your eyes reflexively. Your insides yank down. You feel like your stomach is going to come up through your mouth.  When you open your eyes, you are in another room. A feeling of panic builds inside you. Fido is not here. Oh Fido, where are thou hiding? Silently, from across the chamber, a glowing floating sword, stained with blood, flies at you rapidly.  You do not notice because you are staring at an odd sign. It reads 800 feet. That's strange! You only see two feet in the room. You smile and close your eyes to ask the Big Guy for advice about the 798 feet. He just curses and forsakes you. *The flying +3 enchanted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sword swings and executes a critical hit.* You have died. Try again?\n\nGO RIGHT: The Big Guy sees that you follow his advice. He casually mentions everyone deserves a copy of WazHack. The ramblings of your benevolent deity make no sense to you, but you continue on your quest for the amulet and eternal high score glory.\n\nEPILOGUE: To spare our readers from ruining the adventure, we suggest that you spin up ye old computer and tell Sir Ralentine what to do next. An adventure will indeed take place, and many more may follow.","May 23","true","175.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a bit more user-friendly than someone might be used to roguelikes being, and I'd imagine it'd make for a very useful diagnostic for someone's interest in the genre, as a first experience.  For more initiated players the two-dimensional perspective is definitely an interesting novelty, and the somewhat-simpler mechanics than the genre-standard make for a more-leisurely and less-taxing, if also consequently less-engrossing experience than games like Stone Soup and Nethack.  The inclusion of multiplayer definitely helps make the game more distinct.\n\nThe demo is the best way to determine your interest in the game, as it starts as it means to go on; the first three floors of the dungeon are a worthy preview of the next twenty-something.","February 19, 2014","true","73.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can buy it while it's on sale I would definitely recommend it. The graphics are really smooth and aesthetically pleasing, and the gameplay is different every time, even once you find a class that you work well with.\n\nIt feels like literally anything can happen. I saw the picture someone uploaded of the potion of hallucination. Accidentally drank that while I was fighting goblins and they all turned into weird 4D cubes with really weird names. Not something that is going to wreck your whole day, you can jump right in. And when you don't feel like playing anymore, you just let yourself die or just save and quit. I would describe it like a game of Baldur's Gate II where the goal isn't RPG so much as "Just how far can you delve into this dungeon."","February 20, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For example, combat is "time-based" - denizens of the dungeon only attack and move when you do, meaning a dagger-wielding monster might get 2-3 swings in for your every one staff swing - a very nice evolution of the old-school tild-based movement and turn-based combat.\n\nIt's a roguelike with lots of loot to find, monsters to kill, and deaths to experience. I've put a decent amount of hours into this game and still see something new almost every round. Each death teaches you something which helps you get further next time. With how addicting this game is, you can bet there WILL be a next time.\n\nWith so much replayability and difficulty, this game is going to last me a loooooong time. I only wish I could get the game for free on my iPad after purchasing it for Steam, because I won't be able to resist having it on the go.","February 20, 2014","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

PLEASE IGNORE THEIR HORRIBLE MOVIE. I know it looks bad... and the pictures do not do it justice. Trust me on this! They have so much incredible game mechanic genius in this little gem that I'm surprised it isn't on the top 10 yet.\n\nGameplay: Basically, you move around the dungeon trying not to die, picking up as much loot as you'd like (you usually know what you want to pick up based on your style of play, and encumberance usually isn't an issue). The game lets you think about what you're going to do next, because bad things only take action as you take action. This has the effect of giving you that "Oh S*%#" moment when you get surrounded by spiders, a few short actions from death. You get to cast a crap ton of interesting and funny spells, via scrolls, tomes, wands, etc. Items are super interesting, because you never know what you're going to get. The very starting room could have a skeleton key, which allows you to lock away difficult monsters and open anything up at all. Truly, the various gameplay complexities are too numerous to go on about. You will most likely learn something new every play through.... just don't expect to win your fist play through or anything. You will die.... brutally.\n\nLimitations: Alright, so I've never been a fan of hunger mechanics in any form, but WH does alright with it. You learn quickly that just resting after every encounter isn't the best strategy unless you have a feast to rely on. Balancing hunger/gluttony is a big limitation to the gameplay, as you'll find far too many times that you're out of food, getting hungry, and those damn monsters are not dropping any food. Another limitation is the drop off in spell viability in the later parts of the dungeon. You know that amazing spell you've used the first 10 floors? Yeah... about that... you're going to die soon if that's all you have. As such, as a mage your late game strategy usually encompasses being tricky with teleports, or being super lucky and finding the right spells for late game. Another limitation is how risky it can be to equip stuff, because they can be cursed. I once equipped an amulet that seemed to have an interesting art model, and it turned out to be a strangling necklace. This killed me horribly. To counter this, you have to either identify items with somewhat rare methods, or have a pet around that hogs your precious food. While some may think of these limitations as classic additions to the rogue rpg genre, I call them slight annoyances and detractions to the main point of the game (killing stuff and getting stronger through skill). It can be pretty funny sometimes, though.\n\nVerdict: Absolutely will be playing this many many more hours than the price should allow. You really get your amusement value of the cheap price point. Don't let the apparent graphics deficit dissuade you from a smart purchase if you in any way like heavy emersion, high difficulty, luck base RPG's with plenty of insane loot, spells, monsters, and game mechanics.\n","February 20, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, the visuals are overall pretty unappealing. The character models are pretty ugly. I find it sort of charming and you may too.\nThat being said, this game is worth purchasing based solely on how funny it is. Out of all of the current gen roguelikes, this game has arguably some of the funniest deaths. Maybe some wouldnt agree, but I cant help but laugh at my misfortune in this game.\nSomething about the way the damn potions and scrolls are all random. Is it a healing potion or poison? You may become desperate enough to find out the hard way! It's a little frustrating, but it's all in good fun and it cracks me up. What's that gemstone? Is it useless glass? Maybe you should just drop it! Maybe you just blew yourself up!\n\nIf you enjoy laughing at your own misfortune, you will probably enjoy this game a lot.","March 24, 2014","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's simple yet engrossing, cruel but leaves you craving more. The mix of strategy and action is on point. Attacks are an almost entirely automated affair, but the game nails that way of making you feel like you're doing something even though you really aren't which makes hack 'n' slashes tick. Thanks to the brilliant 'time only moves when you do' system, the game moves as quickly or as slowly and carefully as you choose for it to. And while death is permanent, you can exit mid-run and come back to your game later, which is a welcome feature on the off chance you've actually managed to go more than twenty minutes without dying.

It would have been far better with A) more content, B) unique monsters, C) different names for the scrolls (and maybe a second identifier on potions) since they're lifted right out of Nethack, and D) MORE CONTENT.\n\nI do like the side "rooms" you can "investigate" for monster waves. Maybe I am passing judgement way too soon since I've only made it about 300 feet in. What wikis I found didn't seem populated with content, making things seem sparse.\n\nHad this been a "standard" dungeon crawl game and not such an obvious overglorified nod to Nethack (right down to water nymphs and fountains), I'd probably enjoy it more. But it's a fun little diversion, so I'll keep playing. The amount of effort going into this to get the right feel shows, so that is worth something. And a 3D roguelike never hurts, it is a nice change from the pixel art of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and others.\n\n$10 is... a bit steep.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sterlander/recommended/264160/","sterlander","Sterlander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sterlander/","168 products in account","WazHack was a game I saw on yogscast a couple years back, and it looked fun. I saw it was on steam greenlight a few months later, and thumbed it up. A year later it made its silent realease on steam. I was happy it was on steam, yet for some odd reason didn't buy it. A year later, I bought the game at last. I had almost known this game for 3 years, and I haden't even played it! It was time to sink my teeth into the huge world of WazHack\n\nThis is a roguelike dungeon crawler. It's like most dungeon crawler games, but one quirk makes it diffrent from the rest. "All the time in the world". This means that when you move, so does the world, and when you stop, so does the world. This means that you can take your time in combat, and situations, and I love that. The fact that I have time to contemplate my next move, is really cool. And let me tell you, you NEED to think about your 'next move', because this game has perma-death.\n\nThis game has many diffrent characters to play as, each giving its own unique since of play style. You could be a knight, that uses melee weapons, and is a tank. Or, you could be a fragile wizard, that attacks from a range, and hits with staffs.\nThis will give you a lot of reason to replay the game, even after you've beaten it.\n\nThis game will make you question everything about the enviroment around you. You have to question every item you pick up, and every piece of food you pick up. Why? The walls could have hidden spike traps, that amulet could strangle you to death, and that apple could be poisoned. Everything has a fair chance of being dangerous, so you must be cautious.\nOne time, I decided to use a scroll, and guess what it did? It destoryed my armor, and I died shortly after. You have to make sure what you wear, or even look at, is safe, and I love it.\n\nThis game has such a large variety of items to find, and discover. Maybe you'll find a lute that puts even the fiercest of beasts to sleep. Maybe you'll find a gem, that turns out to actually be a worthless piece of glass! Maybe you'll find a sword that allows you to levitate, and shoot magic missles! It's you're job to find the right items that will help you, and the items that will destroy you! You have to paly the game for quite a while to even get an idea of what each item does. Unless you google it. Then you've taken all the fun out it it. Good job.\n\nThis game has an RPG-like system. Everytime you level up, you get to upgrade a skill (each skill is unique to every character). Perhaps you want to upgrade your duel wielding skills. Or maybe you would rather upgrade your first aid skill, so you don't die as fast. The choice is up to you.\n\nThey are currently updating the game every so often with a bunch of new content, so there will always be something new waiting for you!\n\nCONCLUSION: This is an underated gem on steam, and I recomend it to everyone who has 10 $ to spare. And make sure you have some free time as well, because you are gonna get lost in this game. You will lose track of time. I started the game up at 1pm, and the next thing I know its 2 in the morning","June 15, 2015","true","11.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had always played it during my Home room class. I had grew on to the game and enjoyed it. I later bought the game on Steam and never had time to really play it on here so disregard my hours on here and focus on my phone playtime.\n\nThe game had a good set of RPG skills. You could even make the game harder as it all ready is. I had loved this, RPG's have always fascinated me. You leveled up in a skill gorup of the weapon you had used through out the game. You leveled your spell base on the spells you used. (Dark, Life). Basically you leveled things in the game by what you use. You could choose your own perks though.\n\nIt's completely free choice. You can attack merchants to gain their whole inventory! (Beware, low levels will most likely get 2 shotted.) It's extremely balanced, you control on what you do. Food is extremely important. Always have food in your inventory when exploring. You will most likely not be able to find loot for a good couple hundred feet.\n\nThe only bad thing I can think about the game is that, it's unfair when a merchant bugs and kills you randomly on the mobile. Otherwise I recommend this game to anyone who loves Platformer and RPG's.","September 15, 2015","true","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

These are the reasons I kept WazHack in my wishlist for weeks.  When I finally came around to purchasing it, my experience was less than stellar.  I later grew to like the game after the issues below soured my first impression.\n\nHere are the top reasons I was more frustrated with Waz rather then enjoying my experience.\n- Game says it has full controller support.  Lie.  In the game you have to aim to shoot your bow, spells and to throw things.  Your controller cannot aim AT ALL.  You basically have to use your mouse to aim, and if you're using a controller, we all know how annoying that is.  The whole point to using a controller is to lean back and relax.\n\n- Some classes are just downright pointless!  Bard and bardess for example.  They either charm monsters or put them to sleep.  For the bardess, mobs put to sleep immediatly wake up when attacked.  So since you can only have your harp out and no other weapons, you just stand there and have your pet attack the mob.  Problem is, you don't get xp for mobs killed by your pet.  So I take it the developer figured bardess was hard mode because you'll  never level up.  Other than that, she can identify items a little better.  The bard charms mobs.  It's the same thing with this guy where you can only have your guitar out and nothing else.  So again, relying on your pets to attack other monsters.  The problem with this mechanic is, every time you want your pets to attack anything, you have to go to another screen and select "Entire Entourage" then select attack.  It is VERY tedious and ruins the fun.\n\nI had more frustration with the controller than the mechanics of the game.  Going through the game menu's was clearly thought of with a mouse and keyboard as there are several items to look at and scroll through.  I get it, you're playing on PC, why use a controller?  For alot of gamers, we don't like being hunched over a keyboard for longer than an hour.  It's just not comfortable.\n\nAs for the RNG.  I like.  I have no problems with RNG in most games (other than Darkest Dungeon).  This is a dungeon crawler.  Which are meant to be difficult.  My issues above slightly ruined my initial first impression but I grew the love the game after I put in a few more hours.\n\nNow, if you don't mind using kb&m, and enjoy dieing to RNG, then you will thouroughly enjoy WazHack.

The randomness of the layout means you might have a dry hard time of it with few drops by chance. Theyre is little clear or obvious in how blessed or cursed items clearly work, the knowledge button is tucked away in inventory and is sort of pointless unless you have everything identified anyway and a pain to dig out and even then it tells you nothing numerical or clear most of the time, even the wazhack wiki is player done and has huge holes in it in terms of information, I dont buy a game to waste large amounts of my time browsing a user generated wiki? when ive identified something at least give a clear "tooltip" of what is does in practice. This game is effectively like being slapped in the face by randomness continuously - if you enjoy the idea that the application of skill should win out, do not buy this game, as skill has little impact, this game is an afrront to the idea of skill and if your the kind of person whose happy to press a lever and hopes the next time will be the time - you get a cookie in terms of drops and the layout of the map etc, then i guess you will be fine with this game, but you will waste 100 of hours until the stars align and you get the randomness going in your favour for once\n\nAlso spell casters start off with no spells or wands ? meaning as a class they are gimped, you may not get spellbooks or wands in the first 10 floors that are useful offensively its completely random meaning you choose caster and end up playing melee ? as no offensive spells may drop and no matter what level you become half the useless spells you can get are often too advanced and rubbish or remain too chancey to cast, you get advice like play a melee class for an easier time - melee should not be the only option to progress to begin with, any knowledge or skill you learn in this game is of little relevance, on the basis each play session everything is so totally randomised. This game should have various randomness levels which moderate the "extreme level of randomness", provide some basic spells for casters to start with and maybe a beginner mode that gives you three ressurects per character until you learn the game.\n\nTo make this entire game so restart heavy and so damn random, means although I can clearly see theyre 'could be' a fun game to had in here, the game stubbornly refuses to let you have access to anything but a randomised slot machine of aggravating frustration. I stear clear of any game when youve played 2 x 4 hour play sessions and your still not able to break free and clear from the heavy effects of the dice ruining your game, then its not a game its a random gambling dice simulator to be avoided at all costs, an abusive time sync that works on the random reward principal. cynical rubbish. And worst its a wasted mistaken investment - As I can see getting little pleasure from the money I spent on it, This game isnt old school unforgiving and hard like say dark souls becuse in Dark souls the application and development of skill means the game rewards you - wazhack on the other hand is just plain random ghastliness, the good reviews for this game must come from people who had games where the stars aligned in the randomness or are generally masochists, the game is certainly random enough that even if they imagine its their skill it may well not be.","August 9, 2014","false","7.9"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","14","33","0","0"

Sounds awesome! But WazHack struggled to live up to my expectations. WazHack is a platforming dungeon crawler set in an epic dungeon called WazHack which I suspect was once part of an epic sewer system.\n\nLike old-school dungeon crawlers, when you’re not moving, neither is anything else; items are numerous and often cursed and likewise with the enemies (numerous and cursed that is, since they’re all skeletons). Why didn’t this game hold my attention? It turns out that WazHack is also available as a phone game and the graphics don’t translate well onto 32 inch monitor. The interface is a little clunky. A little more than clunky. While moving around and attacking was easy enough, using, equipping and consuming items was an ordeal of scrolling through menus, reading stats, and on-screen text.\n\nI did not enjoy my time playing this game. Considering the nature of roguelike games is that you die a lot and have to restart, there has to be a huge motivator to compel you to keeping playing. Going lower and lower into  a dungeon is just not enough to compel me.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/07/02/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-wazhack/","July 8, 2014","false","4.4"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","5","21","0","0"

It's a rogue-like (no, not rogue-lite) dungeon crawler Basically, you're in a dungeon, you need to fight your way to the bottom. The way you do it will almost always depend on what you find on the way down. With plenty of variety each run can be significantly differnt, even if you play the same character... except the barbarian/vandal. That goes one way; Smash-Smash-Smash-loot-smash!  You're a mage and can't find spell books? then you'd better hope you can find some strong wands or, gods forbid, learn to use a sword. You're a bard and you learn the "wizard lock" spell? then you're not gonna need that storytelling perk this run!\n\nAs you may expect, the game gets harder the deeper you go, but you'll usually find enough just assistance, be it loot to sell, a bakery fend off starvation or a prisoner to release (they'll fight alongside you). The stat customisation is just the right balance of freedom to make you own character and being bound by the class you choose. E.g. your strongst White Witch will be far weaker than your weakest knight, but just as much smarter, yet you could still build a melee focused witch or a spellcasting knight.\n\nThe biggest strength of the game is the randomization of the items - Any specific potion could be healling one round and acid the next and you won't know until you drink it or learn to identify it. the scrolls, wands, jewelry, musical instruments and spellbooks are similar. Even weapons and armour are only identifiable by style, the Stats could be anything. Anything could also hold a magical effect or be blessed for bonuses or cursed as your pet might tell you, and you can't unequip anthing cursed. You can throw pretty much anything at your enemies as long as it's not cursed (then it just gets stuck to your hand), distance depends on weight and strength.\n\nStats don't seem to rise as you level (except health and magic) but theres other ways to make you tougher. You can become more skilled in your weapons or magic, or pick a good perk every level, but all in all you just need to play smart to survive\n\nSo in summery.

Throughout your journey you will meet all kinds of creatures, items and people. This game is about surviving and making the best out of the situation. Scavenge for food and better equipement in order to stay alive, sometimes you might be lucky and somtimes you die pretty fast. Such is the nature of this game.\n\nBut it's not frustrating, the game has a lot of options in terms of combat and choices. You get stronger by leveling up and getting better gear. Very typical stuff.\n\nThe great thing about Wazhack is that is has quite a humorous character to it, some situations can be ridiculous and some effects might alter your game into insane situations. It keeps the game fresh and has always something up it's sleeve to screw you over. This is the biggest draw for me personally as it doesn't get boring and keeps you motivated.\n\nThe only thing I dislike about the game is the awful aesthetics, I don't mind outdated graphics but I think the art style is just ugly.\n\nDefinitely worth a buy, especially if you like roguelikes.","January 6, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game would be AWESOME to play with a friend, but that ain't what I call co-op... is it? That said, great game for fans of rogue-likes.

Love the random dungeon and items; every time you play it's a step into the unknown. Really great game for teaching cause and effect to my 6 year old nephew, as every decision you make has consequences. You have to eat, so you have to find food. You need better gear, so do you risk equipping that sword you found or wait to identify it? Swarmed by monsters, do you fight it out or try to escape? Also, the game has a lot of text, so it forces him to play attention and read in order to know what is going on. It that a cursed sword, or a blessed sword? It that a scroll of identify, or of destroy armor? Game also has no blood and is not scary, so very kid friendly while still being a very hardcore rogue-like game.

Gameplay leans heavily towards strategy and planning and it has a pretty steep curve in how difficult it gets as you descend the dungeon levels, but it never really get's frustrating. I don't want to say too much more since discovering it for yourself is a big part of the experience.\n\nIf you're unsure there's a demo you can try out at www.wazhack.com\nOne quick tip: if you buy it and you don't have an arrow on the right on the character select screen to load the second set of characters, you're stuck in demo mode.

Like many roguelikes, it is turn based. Unlike most roguelikes, there is a time factor going on behind the scenes that make some characters get more "turns". When you are hasted you get more. When you are encumbered, you get less.\n\nBecause the turn based nature of the game is somewhat hidden, you get the sense that it is a more action adventure game than it really is. Time flows by smoothly while you act, and it stays completely still while you do nothing. You can stop and ponder your move as long as you need before moving on.\n\nOn the downside, Wazhack has a steep learning curve. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to winning is the fact that Wishing is almost a requirement unless you are very lucky, patient, or both. However, the wish system is not transparent at all. Protip? Dip coins in the well. The wiki page on wishing is recommended reading for you. Nothing else, just the wish page.\n\nThe magic system and weapon system is involved. Magic falls on two diametrically opposed scales. Light versus Dark and Life versus Death. THere are five levels available on each scale, and you cannot have more than 5 total between each side. Since some spells are Level 4 and need Level 4 to use to full effect, fully mastering all forms of magic is impossible. Weapons work in a similar way; there are only so many 'upgrades' available for your spell and weapon skills, and once you run out that is it. However, weapons have no opposition; each type has 5 levels of skill.\n\nLike a true roguelike, identifying items and figuring out their properties is a huge part of the game. Don't be surprised if you put on a cursed item that won't come off really quick into the game. It happens. Curses can be removed, though so don't despair. Read the scrolls until you find the one that removes curses.\n\nAh, yes, about that. What color potion has what effect (same for scrolls, wands, types of jewelry) change from one character to the next. The game randomizes it. The only constants I have seen in potions is that potions of oil and ink are always black, and potions of water are always clear. However, there is also one randomized clear and one black potion in the dungeon. Have fun in the dungeon! Or is it the fungeon?\n\n(Overall 8/10, Story 2*/10, Gameplay 9/10, Graphics 6/10, Sound 6/10, Replayability 10/10)\n*I don't include story in the final rating of roguelikes","March 21, 2015","true","56.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No.  It's a simpler, sillier game.  And Nethack was pretty silly to begin with.   It appears as a 2D game, but I think it's closer to 1 and half.  The majority of the gameplay happens on levels, with ladders connecting them.  Mobs can follow you up and down the ladders, no stairscumming here, but for the most part it plays like a 1D leveler.  With Nethack rules.\n\nMostly.  It's indisputable roguelike in its permadeath and its randomly generated items.  It's indisputable hacklike in its choice of items, punishments for testing scrolls and potions, and there are so many elements taken directly from hack it's beyond mistakable for anything else.  However, some of the most defining elements of hack are missing: prayer chiefly among them.  No more turn count, no more hoping your god will uncurse that item, and no more foodless achieves.  The E-Word is also unavailable, as are most of the options that were available from the # menu in hack.\n\nBut it isn't Nethack, it's Wazhack.  It's added so many new things, it's got its own flavor.  The cartoony graphics are fun, especially when hallucinating.  The different classes are really different, even the male and female versions of a class have different playstyles.  I've only been playing a short while, but it seems balanced and just the right amount of accessibility.  It's hard, but I don't think it's too hard.  If you play it like an action game, you will lose.  If you play it like a roguelike, you'll have fun.\n\nIt's not Nethack.

It's a rogue-like (no, not rogue-lite) dungeon crawler Basically, you're in a dungeon, you need to fight your way to the bottom. The way you do it will almost always depend on what you find on the way down. With plenty of variety each run can be significantly differnt, even if you play the same character... except the barbarian/vandal. That goes one way; Smash-Smash-Smash-loot-smash!  You're a mage and can't find spell books? then you'd better hope you can find some strong wands or, gods forbid, learn to use a sword. You're a bard and you learn the "wizard lock" spell? then you're not gonna need that storytelling perk this run!\n\nAs you may expect, the game gets harder the deeper you go, but you'll usually find enough just assistance, be it loot to sell, a bakery fend off starvation or a prisoner to release (they'll fight alongside you). The stat customisation is just the right balance of freedom to make you own character and being bound by the class you choose. E.g. your strongst White Witch will be far weaker than your weakest knight, but just as much smarter, yet you could still build a melee focused witch or a spellcasting knight.\n\nThe biggest strength of the game is the randomization of the items - Any specific potion could be healling one round and acid the next and you won't know until you drink it or learn to identify it. the scrolls, wands, jewelry, musical instruments and spellbooks are similar. Even weapons and armour are only identifiable by style, the Stats could be anything. Anything could also hold a magical effect or be blessed for bonuses or cursed as your pet might tell you, and you can't unequip anthing cursed. You can throw pretty much anything at your enemies as long as it's not cursed (then it just gets stuck to your hand), distance depends on weight and strength.\n\nStats don't seem to rise as you level (except health and magic) but theres other ways to make you tougher. You can become more skilled in your weapons or magic, or pick a good perk every level, but all in all you just need to play smart to survive\n\nSo in summery.

Everything, and I mean everything, is determined by random number generators. You never know what something does until you either identify it or test it out. A wand of magic missile may become a wand of polymorph in another playthrough. You may get extremely lucky and find a genie lamp on floor 1, only to find out that it's cursed and the genie inside isn't too pleased with you summoning it. No matter how many times you play it, it's always a new experience.\n\nThis game really stands out to me because of its unique take on 'turns'. Nothing moves until you do. As long as you don't perform an action, everything stays still as a statue. Every action, whether it's eating, equipping, attacking, or casting, takes up a certain number of frames, and monsters can take that many frames to act as well. It's an incredibly tense experience. Just imagine this: You're surrounded by kobolds and goblins, and you need to guess which unidentified scroll will teleport you out of there, or pacify all of the monsters, or, more likely, do nothing to help you, or even get you killed.\n\nWazHack has put me in some pretty incredible situations, both good and bad. More than once, I've tested a wand on a monster, only for it to summon three more, or transform a rat into a troll, or something to that effect. On the flip side, I've had runs where I found incredible items (like a ring of invisibility, an amulet of life saving, or wands of death) early on and had a fantastic time destroying everything... only for a wildly ricocheting magic bolt to end me. This game is all about the stupid deaths, and learning from your mistakes, and planning for the unknown so that you may find the elusive Amulet of Zaw and emerge from the dungeons victorious.","June 1, 2014","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The creater of the game is apparently one of those who had worked on nethack. The Dev is still updating the game with a patch adding a chunk of content a few days earlier, for those who wish to contact the dev with ideas or bug updates he can be found in the steam fourms and reddit fourms.\n\nFor those who have not played a rogue like before, the goal of the game is to get to the bottom of the dungeon and defeat the final boss. The hard part is not defeating the final boss but survivng your own stupidity, often deaths are completely avoidable. For those who are looking for detailed skill trees do not have high expecations, the skill choices for each class are pretty shallow. This is not a gamed where the character is heavily defined by skill choices but is heavily defined by what  character you role, as they come with different restrictions. One example is barbarian who is easy to play with but can equip very little of the armors found which makes it harder to survive.\n\nThis is not a game that you purchase for a nine year old unless he was born with a computer in his hands. The game requires the ability to learn from mistakes, and the lifeskill of being able to continue something that they do not succeed at first attempts.\n\nPros:\nRoguelike\nDifferent dungeon every time\nHard\nFair\nBe able to ride pets hatched from eggs found in dungeon, or have your other hatched pets ride your pet.\n\nCon:\nHard\nTakes time to learn how to play\nGraphics are not the prettiest nor the cutest, although it is not horrendous.\n\n","November 28, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love the random dungeon and items; every time you play it's a step into the unknown. Really great game for teaching cause and effect to my 6 year old nephew, as every decision you make has consequences. You have to eat, so you have to find food. You need better gear, so do you risk equipping that sword you found or wait to identify it? Swarmed by monsters, do you fight it out or try to escape? Also, the game has a lot of text, so it forces him to play attention and read in order to know what is going on. It that a cursed sword, or a blessed sword? It that a scroll of identify, or of destroy armor? Game also has no blood and is not scary, so very kid friendly while still being a very hardcore rogue-like game. Highly recommend for both big boys, and little kids. :)","November 18, 2015","true","33.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fact that it is available on Android as well has no impact at all on the quality of the game. The art is very good and the gameplay is pretty strict roguelike.
