It is relaxing and has a slow pace, and has some interesting gadgets and gizmos involved with the puzzles. Above is a short video of a few levels being completed and below are my initial thoughts on the game.\n\nTheHiddenLevels.com was provided a review copy by Sunlight and KISS and for that we thank them.\n\nI personally was excited to see a marble madness type game, but realized quickly that this isn't quite that. It's a very easy going puzzler that tickles the brain for a short bit, without driving you mad. The puzzles provide enough of a challenge that you have to use some ingenuity and creative thinking, so don't assume casual means easy.\n\nThe simplicty of the game is nice, the artwork is part of that, simple but relatively elegant, good for its purpose certainly.  The ball has an odd almost space like gravity, which makes for a slow movemet. It's part of the puzzle, but I did keep wanting to see the ball move faster, or to have a speed up button available.\n\nI can say if you are a fan of puzzle games this is a unique one, and it's worth picking up at some point. If you need super fast paced action, this might not be the ball for you. I'd reccomend this to casual puzzle game fans without a doubt.\n\nThanks for reading and watching, visit www.thehiddenlevels.com for news and reviews!","November 22, 2015","true","0.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

In your way you will find a lot of barriers what you should avoid, to do this in every level you have a different items in your inventory (like a jumper or speed booster etc) to beat this barriers. In a game you will find more than 100 levels, the difficulty grow well and do a game enough challenging.\nThe game graphic looks nice and a sounds also good.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+challenging\n+tons of levels\n+good tutorial\n+nice graphic\n+steam trading cards\n\n-no steam achievements\n-no steam workshop\n\n\nSo if you are like a good and challenging puzzles, this one is a good choose for you. This game can be a good relax and brain trainer for you in a couple time. Also if the developers decide add to game a steam workshop and with this ability for community create own levels its been even better.","March 26","true","5.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

Experts will probably not find the challenge they are looking for. Even though I am more of an advanced player, it is important to note that I never felt that my time was wasted. The puzzles did increase in difficulty and length as you progress\n\nThis is one of those quality puzzles that you need to buy and play it.

It has a clean, straightforward interface,\n\nFor each puzzle your task is to get the ball to the flag. Your are given various tools on each map to use to accomplish this. The interface is basic, with only a few minor problems, such as the inventory space closing automatically, and no ease of access when it comes to manipulating the map, which I detail in the video. Minor inconveniences, not game breaking. The music that accompanies the puzzles  is very fitting, helping you to relax and focus on each problem instead of making you feel rushed.\n\nThe puzzles are geared more towards beginner and intermediate puzzlers. Experts will probably not find the challenge they are looking for. Even though I am more of an advanced player, it is important to note that I never felt that my time was wasted. The puzzles did increase in difficulty and length as you progress. Having a speed toggler to advance to the area you are working on would have been a great add-on to the game, instead of having to watch the ball go through the entire puzzle, but again this is not a game breaking problem.\n\nI found this to be a simple yet enjoyable game with decent music, that doesn't waste the players time. It's not perfect, and not the most challenging in difficulty, but overall was a very enjoyable experience. With all of that I can easily recommend this game.\n\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\n\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","November 15, 2015","true","8.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There is 100 puzzles.\n\nI beat the game in 9 hours or so and could be solved faster.\n\nDownside:  There should be more puzzles.  It felt really fast for me.\n\nThere is a ton of glitches that can happen.  Picking up the pieces of machines can be a daunting task.  I fairwarn you!  The game is fun, but not super smooth.  Things will launch in ways that are not consistant with each other.  If your level glitches while your in the middle placing objects, I suggest quitting the level and then restarting.  You don't lose much on any level if you restart.  There is a lot of spelling errors in the translation of this game.  It will annoy you if that thing annoys you?  Thought Id mention it.\n\nI wrote this as a positive comment to show I played the game and thoroughly enjoyed it, just wish it was longer.  Maybe some new levels can be released as DLC.  Would be worth it for another 100.","October 27, 2015","true","10.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The fun bit is you will have to overcome obstacles, but do not despair, as you will have an inventory of goodies to reach your goal. Well, sometimes I wish I had a lot more options but I guess that is the challenge - to see it through.\n\nYou will have to beat 100 levels and the difficulty will increase fairly and steadily as you progress through the game. Keep in mind that the first 10 levels are actually tutorials. At the start of each level, check your inventory of goodies (up to 30 different one in total) and put them in the right place to hit the flag.\n\nThe graphics are relatively simple but nice, and to be honest it’s one of the game’s charms. The zoom in and out is not as smooth as I was expecting but it is ok. Audio-wise, it is the same music over and over; nice - but I have a tendency to turn the volume down in this type of game.  In terms of pricing it is worth $9.99. The only thing for me to do is to find someone who can replant the small amount of hair that I previously had! Well, I had to think outside the square! Didn’t help, though!\n\nPositive:\n~~~~~~\n\n-	Good and fun puzzles game\n-	100 levels to beat\n-	Progressive increasing difficulty\n-       Trading cards\n\nNegative:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	No achievements\n\nOne Hundred Ways is a fun puzzle game where each level is getting harder to beat!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/404630/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","I hate to open any ‘Steamified In a Nutshell’ with a negative but I just have to do it because it was so poignant to my experience with One Hundred Ways. If there was ever a game that would be made even better with a little bit of intrinsic Steam magic then it would be this game. Please consider adding Steam achievements to your game, Sunlight Games. It’s a great puzzle game – may even be one of the best that I’ve played within this very specific subgenre of level completing puzzle games – but without achievements there isn’t enough reward for those who like to get a little extra for their playtime. To be perfectly honest I my automatic pilot assumed that there would be achievements before I began so when I defeated the first ten levels – the levels that constitute the tutorial – I thought that I had earned my first achievement.\n\nAnd really that is it. I’m done knocking this game. Anything else would, in my opinion, be considered harsh or trivial. A couple of the reviews on Steam, including the positive reviews, have nitpicked at this game more than it deserves to be. The one thing missing in this puzzler is achievements. Otherwise, Sunlight Games, you deserve to feel mighty proud of what you’ve accomplished with your game. It’s engrossing and it’s challenging. The game possesses progressive difficulty. Some challenges will stump you for a few moments until you work out the trick to the puzzle. Some may even stump you for longer. Or in the case of having an over eager partner who was able to seamlessly pick the puzzle while watching briefly over my shoulder until they make you feel downright silly. But that’s a good thing from time to time.\n\nOne Hundred Ways is really that relaxing time that used to be spent filling in logic puzzle books. That was quite probably before most of our reader’s times but I suppose the modern day equivalent would be the Sudoku puzzle in the newspaper. Yes, I know there are Sudoku puzzle games on Steam but I can assure you that they’re not as enjoyable as One Hundred Ways. It’s a real pity that more people have yet to play it. Well, if you enter our giveaway below you may win yourself a copy or alternatively there are much more worse things that you can put your money into on the Steam store.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please keep an eye on http://www.steamified.com/","January 8","true","7.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashesforpresident/recommended/404630/","ashesforpresident","Ashes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashesforpresident/","396 products in account","The game itself can be enjoyable, however there are a bunch of things holding it back:\n\n- The camera control is super clunky and sluggish, no way to rotate too.\n\n- No speed-up time feature, you have to watch the ball slowly make its way to the end every time, if you failed too bad you're gonna waste your time just sitting there watching the ball again.\n\n- Every time you place something you gotta click on inventory to open it then click on the thing, over and over, doesn't matter if you're gonna place the same kind of gadget. It sounds minor, but gets irratating after playing for like 15 minutes.\n\n- Sometimes the ball would stop moving for no reason, and you have to reset the level and watch it slowly make its progress again.\n\n- Gadgets glitch out and you can't click on them after reseting the ball, so what you need to do is reset the whole level and place every gadged again.\n\n- The ball is constantly slow-ish, no matter if it goes through speed boosts.\n\n- There is no indicator of how far the ball will be thrown by some of the gadgets, so you're left experimenting until you get it right, not because the puzzle is hard, but because the game failes to give you useful information.\n\n- First 30 or so puzzle were really easy, don't know if they become hard at some point, but I personally don't have the patience to play anymore.\n\nThat being said, the game can be enjayable for those with patience and high tolerance. I personally won't play much more and can't recommend it because of the reasons stated above.","June 4","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
