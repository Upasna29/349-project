However, this is not what you will be purchasing. I cannot believe the audacity of these developers to no only release alternative free versions of the game and to make me pay, but to also outright con people into buying their stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hints too. I am absolutely infuriated with this as I feel you should not make people pay for a free game and then also include the micro-transactions too. This is abhorrent that someone actually gave the idea the go-ahead. Someone at JoyBits deserves a jolly-good sacking. Also, when you're presented with the sounds absolutely tearing through your speakers, you either can turn them off or continue to have your eardrums ruptured. The Steam achievements don't even work (at the time of writing this) and that's without mentioning the annoying ♥♥♥♥ing animation that plays whenever you combine things that takes you straight back to the menu so you have to click a ♥♥♥♥ ton of things to go back to being able to combine again. This is without even metioning the Hiroshima-style release that can only be defined as a disaster. It's not every day that a developer forgets to upload THE EXECUTABLE to the Steam servers on release. If this doesn't reflect the attitude the developers have towards this ♥♥♥♥♥how of a port, then I don't know what does. I could not recommend this money-grabbing, eardrum-splitting, outlandish 'Steam version' (totally not a ♥♥♥♥-poor mobile port or anything) any less and is logically, physically and practically possible.","September 25, 2015","false","6.7"," 491 of 531 people (92%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","92","491","531","17","11"

Seeing a barren world gradually become populated with some of those newly created elements makes one feel like they're really creating something.\nMost of them show funny quotes and proverbs when created to add more flavour, and the intro scenes for each chapter are usually funny.\n\nOnce you run out of the initial logical and fun way to combine elements (and patience), you're mostly stuck using brute force combinations or a guide. Once that happened, it became quite tedious.\n\nPuzzles and side games are a nice addition, especially the puzzles. Elements have to combined in a specific manner to form the required final element.\n\nOverall, can be quite tedious and frustrating, but it's still a good game.

These efforts always result in dumpster fires of failure. It isn't that mobile games are necessarily worse than their more traditional counterparts, just that different audiences expect differetn things from their gaming experience. People that want to waste a couple of minutes on the ride to work aren't going to want the same exact thing when they actually sit down and play something in their own free time, and Doodle God is just the latest example of that.\n\nDoodle God, however, is just a mess from top to bottom. I don't understand how even mobile gamers enjoyed this. If you took a point-and-click adventure game item combination puzzle, and removed the context, goals, story, fun, and coded it entirely in goat's blood, you'd get Doodle God. You start with four elements, and start combining these elements to make more elements. These elements can then be combined with other elements to make more elements, and these elements can then be used to finally get you to the end goal: making more elements. That's all there is to the game. Rubbing two items together, hoping they work, and then seriously reevaluating where your life went wrong.\n\nYou may think that combining elements to make more elements (made so you can make more elements) might sound pointless and boring, but you're wrong. It's also frustrating too. Unlike most games where you're combining things, the game doesn't really give you any hints as to what you should be making. The game has you making stuff like octopi and ghouls, but other common items aren't in the game's dictionary. However, the game doesn't actually tell you it wants octopi and ghouls, and you just sort of have to guess. This is fine in the early game when you don't have many objects, but at some point you have over 100 at one time and without the game hinting what the hell it actually wants you to make you just sort of have to guess. Doodle God is that annoying partner you had back in college that always wanted to go out to dinner but wouldn't tell you what he or she wanted until you actually guessed it.\n\nAnd to top it all off, a lot of the combinations don't make sense. Alright, so a warrior and a firearm makes a soldier. I suppose I can see that train of logic. But a fish and knowledge makes an octopus? What the hell does that even mean, Doodle God? "Just gotta keep on reading to the fish...gotta make them an octopus through education... hmm," one of the developers overheard an insane man mumbling to himself on the subway one day and that idea made it into the game somehow. Since some of these combinations were seemingly just pulled out at random from a hat, inevitably you will reach a point where you just need to randomly start combining things and hoping for the best. Or you could just wait until the hints refill and do it that way. Or you can close Doodle God, delete it from your computer, then burn your computer on the off chance some of the awfulness from this title somehow seeped its way onto your harddrive.\n\nI'd recommend the third option. Or, the vastly superior option, never buying or downloading this in the first place and doing something better with your time like playing any other game available on Steam, going outside, or sitting perfectly still and allowing your mind to slowly deteriorate. Any of those option are better than ten minutes with Doodle God.","May 10","false","19.5"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","27","29","5","0"

The developers disgustingly put in microtransactions, asking players to pay for important functions which should be free from the getgo, and in turn stopped Doodle God from being the good game that it should be.\n\nFull Review:\nTo be honest, I am pretty disappointed with Doodle God. It is actually just a Steam port of their mobile app. Seeing as how this has a higher asking price, I assumed that the game would already contain the additional useful functions which you had to pay extra for in the app and free flash versions. Appallingly enough, they still aren't made available to you despite the fact that we have paid a higher amount for almost the same game!!\n\nThe functions that I mentioned are the ability to have repeated reactions disabled and to show which elements still had combinations available. Now, if you have never played any of the games in this series, let me sum up the gameplay briefly: You start off with a particular set of elements, and you combine them in the hopes of creating new ones. As you create new elements, more and more potential combinations are made possible. At first, its easy to keep track of which combos you have already made, but when you have, say, 75 elements, available, it becomes difficult to continue keeping track. After a while, Doodle God becomes less of a game and more like mere tedium. Doodle God is tagged as being casual, but instead of being that it ends up simply brainless. This is largely due to the fact that those aforementioned functions aren't available to us. Had we been given them, the experience would be MUCH more enjoyable.\n\nAs if asking us to pay for those functions weren't offensive enough, the developers had the audacity to PUT A PRICE ON ADDITIONAL HINTS. Do you really think anyone would pay money for hints when they can just search up solutions/walkthroughs online for FREE?\n\nThe only difference between this game and the mobile version is the Tournament mode which is not that fun to begin with due to it being buggy. There is no incentive for players to participate because it gives the top ranked players a useless prize, additional hints. I assumed that seeing as how they are selling it for an increased, they would give players access to disabled repeated reactions and the border guides, functions which you would have to pay for on the mobile and free flash versions.\n\nI won't deny, there are plenty of clever, funny moments in this game. However, the microtransactions and the withholding of functions that should be free, left a terrible taste in my mouth, despite being a fan of the series. It had the potential to be a nice, light, casual game. Hopefully the developers see our dissatisfaction with this and changes this, because right now, I cannot recommend people to pay full price for this. Just play the app or free flash version if you are REALLY interested. I wouldn't recommend buying this :/","October 1, 2015","false","9.3"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","23","30","2","0"

So much so that I played them through several times. So much so that I wanted to at least like this "2".\n\nI did not.\n\nYes, the first part ('episode') was fun enough. Makes sense, since it's basically the original Doodle God game. But the fun ended a long time before I finished it.\n\nWhen playing the original, I remember people wanting to see the world being built. Yeah, that was a fun idea. The execution... nope. It's plain annoying to get redirected to see a mindless little twinkle of an animation on the globe after making certain combinations.\n\nThe episode structure disrupted the game experience. I know this plus this makes that, but I flippin' well can't make it because I'm missing that one thing to unlock episode II. Unneeded. Unlocking the higher episodes your elements get reshuffled under different groups. That's mighty convenient, nothing better than searching Fire for 20 minutes 5 hours into the game. Also, now that you mention it, I really did want to make that disappearing Ice three times.\n\nThe quests and puzzles and artifacts? Yeah, not really feelin' 'em. The Island one had promise, Inventions was surprisingly fun too. But they all felt like the results of a brainstorming session titled 'so what are we gonna do to make this feel new and exciting? we need their cash. anyone?'.\n\nMost people seem to be mad about the microtransactions.

I figured any game that could keep a special needs child entertained and quiet (and not poking his neighboring van mates) during an hour long ride home AFTER being coped up in school all day had to be worth looking into.  The game is certainly mind absorbing, with all the combinations of "elements" that can be combined in the main game alone (249 total).  Now add to that all the other "mini" games that can be played.  Hours of entertainment, or at least mind absorbing nullness.\n\nFor those who do not know about Doodle God.  It is a game of combining "elements" such fire, human or zombie with other "elements" like water, apple, or internet to make new elements.  In the main game there are 4 stages, ultimately working up to a total of 249 elements.  Some of the combinations are very logical while others are not.  The main game is basically a game of elimination where the player takes a single element and combines it with every other element to see what happens.  Then repeat with a new element.  (Special thanks to MakoSipper and their achievement guide God of Patience.  I am quite certain without this guide I would have never gotten that achievement.)\n\nBeyond the main game there 7 Quests, 14 Artifacts, 11 Puzzles, an on-line Tournament, and an Encyclopedia (a compliation of every element and element combination from all the games (main, quests, artifacts and puzzles).\n\nThe Quests are specific scenerios such helping Santa build a sleigh or surviving on a desert island.  Artifacts is simply a puzzle where the player takes three elements and combines them to make a particular object like Stonehenge or a Light Saber.  (The best guide for this is Quests & Artifacts by ReivaX.)\n\nThe Puzzles are more active thinking then simply random combinations.  The player must use the correct combinations to achieve the desired outcome such making a firecracker or a Jack O Lantern. It is easy to make the wrong combinations and get stuck.  If stuck, undo combinations or start again. (I made a visual guide for the Puzzles since there was not one already.)\n\nThis game is not for everyone, and requires patience, tenacity and perseverance to get through (and/or earn all the achievements which is a different sort of patience, tenacity and perseverance.)","April 16","true","19.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I had played Doodle God very early on as a flash game with little updates, and never played the mobile one. So coming from that it's a huge upgrade with a bunch of stuff to do and is very fun.\n\nHOWEVER, while the game itself is good, it does two things that negatively effect it.\n\n#1: As you can see from all the negative reviews already, there are micro transactions in the game. They all cost $0.99 USD, cheap, but not needed in the game. While I myself don't have a problem with this because it doesn't effect gameplay at all basically, it's good to keep in mind that it's in bad taste for a game that's already asking for money up front. Just a bad business practice, and if you don't like that don't buy the game.\n\n#2: It's a direct mobile port. From the text saying "tap" to even the app pop ups saying "RATE OUR GAME". While it doesn't run bad on PC and the buttons still feel ok for the most part, it's still annoying that they just ported the game over.\n\n\nIn my personal opinion I like this game. I don't mind the micro transations because they don't effect the game, they just make it a bit easier if you want to buy them. I also don't mind the direct port from mobile since the buttons are still ok.\n\nAs someone who never played the updated version of this game on mobile compared to flash, I think it's worth the 5 bucks to play.

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\n[There are two things that I want to point out about this game. First thing: Is that there's already a free version of this game on the internet. Second thing: This game has micro transaction but it isn't necessarily to spend real money in order to play the game.]\n\n"Doodle God" from the developer JoyBits. This game strangely similar to a mobile game called "Alchemy." And so the concept should be more or less the same thing.\n\nMain Quests: There are four episodes to play through. Progressing through of them is a lengthy process. Due to numerous combination for each of the elements.\n\nArtifact Quests: There are at least thirteen different artifacts to make. These artifacts can only made if the element(s) has been discovered in  "Main Quests."\n\nPuzzle Quests: There are at least seven different puzzle quests to complete. These puzzles can be solved rather quickly than the ones in the "Main Quests."\n\nTournament: Online mulitplayer. Compete against other players in creating elements within given time-frame.\n\nEncyclopedia: Collection of facts on the elements from the game.\n\nThere are twenty-two different achievements can be earned from the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements to completed before they can be obtained.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, I felt that this game is good, but it can get tedious somewhat; discovering what is the best combination to create new elements. As for the game's replay value it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.","January 19","true","25.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","6"

This paying version has a lot of added content: a world map and tons of minor minigames with the same basic game mechanic.\n\nThe Good:\n+ It can be fun for a short while to try to combine random stuff, and sometimes succeed to make new random stuff out of them.\n+ The world map is pretty, and populating it adds a sense of progress.\n+ Each combination comes with a quote and a link to the Wikipedia article of the item :D Almost feels educational.\n+ In this version you can look up items by initial. Yay, no longer have to memorise which semi-arbitrary category each item happens to be in!\n\nThe Bad:\n- The gameplay quickly becomes monotone, especially as many of the combinations feel arbitrary. Thus it's easy to get stuck, and to get the achievements in any timely manner, following online guides is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately this makes the game even more boring.\n- The minigames are fun in the beginning, but they have an even greater sense of arbitrariness to them than the main game, items often being in different categories and require different combinations than in the main one. Following guides is even more crucial to get anywhere.\n- F2P elements (daily visit bonus, limited stock of hints) in a paid game.\n- Many of the quotes are sexist.\n\nVerdict:Unlike similar casual games this is not even a good timewaster, as it becomes boring and frustrating really quickly, and from then on it feels like a chore to go through a guide and unlock each item.","February 11","false","3.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadow_frax/recommended/348360/","Shadow_frax","SHADOWFRAX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadow_frax/","109 products in account","Having read other reviews, it seems that the main criticisms levelled against Doodle god are that a) it contains microtransactions even though you've already paid for it, and b) it's pretty much a port of the mobile version, which is cheaper (albeit containing even more microtransactions)\n\nI must say however, that even though you can pay for hints to help you solve the game's puzzles, it's by no means necessary to do so. The hints recharge at a fairly decent rate and so you basically get them for free anyway, paying for them is just a way of hurrying things along and so there's no need to shell out any more cash than you've already spent.\n\nTrue, there is a cheaper version for mobile devices, although I can't verify that it's exactly the same... From what I can surmise the Steam version contains a bit more content and doesn't require you to pay any where near as much for what you basically should already get in a bought game.\n\nThe above issues aside, Doodle god is actually a pretty decent example of this type of setup. It looks great, presentation is superb and playing it is a pleasure. I love the way that as you progress, your creations start to appear on a nicely illustrated planet and the game consistently rewards you when you get things right. The music is relaxing and never grates on the ears. The only thing I would say though is that there is no volume control, no excuses for that really!!\n\nThere's quite a bit of gameplay to keep you going, the main quest will probably take you 8 hours and then there are extra quests to do which will probably take you a few more. The puzzles for the most part are fairly logical but some can be a bit off the wall.. For instance Corpse + Electricity = Death metal?? I mean, I get it but.. I wouldn't automagically think to make that one.. It is a game that is suited to playing in bursts of about an hour at a time, but it's pretty addictive and you'll probably find yourself going back to it to catch 'em all.\n\nOverall it's quite a decent game for the price and I'll give it 6.8/10, I've had a lot of fun with it, but it's marred by annoyingly unnecessary microtransactions and a lack of volume control. If the developers change these aspects then the figure will rise.","October 19, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitalhead/recommended/348360/","digitalhead","Digitalhead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitalhead/","315 products in account","Doodle God is an interesting and fun puzzle game. The puzzles and combinations are generally good. Some combinations don't really make sense sometimes, but you'll have that.\n\nWhen compared to the version I played on Android a while back, some of the additions for this version can be a little annoying. The world view frequently pops up, taking you away from play in the main game. There are a lot more combinations and groups here, which makes it endlessly more difficult to find something specific if you haven't been using it since nearly the beginning of the game. It also doesn't help that things get moved around in the last section of the game. The only thing that saves this is the search, but the search goes away as soon as you click. It would be nice if I could keep the search open on both sides and drag directly from them.\n\nThe quests, when done right, will tell a neat little story, such as saving a princess or getting stranded on an island and getting rescued (if you play that one right). They're a nice addition. The added content in general sometimes feels like it's purely to extend gameplay though. It does mean that there's a lot more stuff to play around with and discover in the game.\n\nYes, it offers microtransactions, that you would have to turn on to be able to get. It's only for people that don't want to solve the puzzles. You can get the same stuff by just playing, or if you don't feel like discovering stuff on your own, you can use a walkthrough, which there are many out there for Doodle God.\n\nThere are several things I don't like about the game, but at the core, it's still a fun and interesting game. The good of the game really does outshine the mild annoyances I find in it, so it gets a thumbs up from me.","November 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game has microtransactions and they will attempt to bleed you dry! The game uses a hint system where you can pay money for hints for how you should combine elements to make new elements. You get some free hints handed out to you like coupons, but they run dry super fast. This is not really something that belongs on Steam if you ask me, but I stomached it... But only until I completed the first episode! For guess what!? The episodes are gated behind artifact puzzles where you have to combine 3 elements to create an artifact. The problem with these artifact puzzles is that it matters which element is placed first, and the order makes no logical sense, and to make matters worse the hint that is supposed to help you by telling you which category the elements belong to places the group order all wrong. So the hints are borderline non functional in these puzzles, and oh boy are these puzzles contrived and convoluted, practically forcing you to buy the hints! And the interface changes to a long list of elements in alphabetical order instead of the previous element groupings, making it a pain in the ♥♥♥ to find the element you are looking for or to scan them at a glance. This was the point where I got fed up with the microtransaction system... And here I thought the build times in Godus was bad, imagine if the houses in Godus required you to complete a borderline functional puzzle with some hints not even working... I have requested a refund, but I doubt I will get it...\nShame... I really liked the flash game, but this is a damn scandal and I bought the game so I have a damn right to complain! I asked Steam for a refund, I just hope they will grant it... I played for 4 hours(the time it took to get to the puzzle) so it doesn't look good for me... :(","October 1, 2015","false","3.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

If your stuck, you can simply use google, or try different combinations. And B, the game does not push the microtransactions at you. It's a meaningless detail in this game, unlike so many others. Don't review negative just because your an imbecile.\n\nI first played this game on an ipod touch, and much has changed since it came out. But the basics are the same.\nYou combine various elements to create new elements. In the beginning you have fire, earth, air and water at your disposal. And then it's up to you to create just about every element there is in the game. And there are many. And almost every time you discover a new element, you will also read a quote that's related to the element at hand.\n\nThe main game spans over four episodes. The Beginning, Technology, Modern Age, and The World of Magic.\nAs you combine elements and creatures, tools and buildings, the once barren landscape beneath you comes to life. Snow and grass begin to cover the landscape, and animals and mythological creatures roam the world. This game looks good, and much attention has been put into the art that's basicly everywhere.\n\nWithout saying too much more, I'd like to point out that there are also six quests, which work as individual mini-episodes, with a focus on a specific area. Save a princess from a dragon, counter the sins of doodle devil or 20'th century inventions.\n\nThere are also Puzzles, which are even smaller, and possible to fail. (and start over)\n\nThere will probably be more content for this game, and since they've released it for free for so many, why is it wrong to allow them to actually sell their game to the people who are willing to pay?\n\nBut yeah, you can probably find this game for free if you look for it.\n\nMore than aight/10","September 25, 2015","true","8.3"," 16 of 87 people (18%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","18","16","87","6","0"

You have a book of elements, with pictures of said elements. You can match 1+1 together and discover a new element, and that's the whole game. Discover more and more elements, yes they have a story and several quests etc. but it's not quite a game, not quite a puzzle. It's just think and click, or don't think a spam click. Alot probably remember that game was out for free on appstore etc. and it might feel bad to pay 5.99:- for it. Another big problem people seem to have with this is the in-game purchase, but I don't see this as a big problem. What I have problem with is games that won't allow you to continue without buying more energy, gold or time. In this it was just hints you could buy. You don't need that to play the game. Just use one of the helpful guides if you feel stuck, so for me this isn't an issue. It's just, that the game don't have any variety what so ever that bums me. It's interesting in the beginning, but gets old fast. Still, it's not a bad game, it's just hardly a "game" for me. I recommend it only, if you get it cheap and is really intrigued by what this is. 5.2/10","March 19","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The further you get in though, the more obtuse they seem, and you end up relying on hints or a guide.\nHowever I did enjoy this, and while I feel it isn't worth the full asking price it's a fine addition to a bundle or other cheap deal.","May 20","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played it way back when it first came out of iPhone and it has held up pretty well over the years. I do find the seperation into chapters a little confusingly unnecessary, but it allows the game to go into two different directions, so whatever floats your boat. It does get repetative though. What was easy to do on a phone with swiping one element to another is a little bit slower and more tedius with a mouse. The puzzles and quests were really fun, and (with help from guides) achievements are all pretty attainable.\n\nIf you can see past its flaws and enjoy a game that is quite repetative in nature, then Doodle God may be for you. If not, definitely avoid it as it will probably be another title that ends up collecting dust in your library.","June 5","false","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
