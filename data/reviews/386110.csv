People get a lot more for less begging on the streets and holding up a sign so I'm not going to complain about $2. Also, You can take this positive review because I understand that even though the game was one of the worst I've ever played, it took you time to make it.\n\nSome of the issues wrong with this game are pretty much 100% everything that everybody else who left a negative review on it already stated as well as some other gamebreaking bugs. I got 75% through the game and had to start over because I purchased a weapon and didn't have enough money to purchase a goblin suit to get past the guards. The vendor also would not let me sell any of the items I had picked up throughout the game so I had no way of earning the money and was forced to start over.\n\nOverall the game took about 40 minutes to complete from start to finish while reading all of the dialogue and exploring unnecessary areas.\n\nDefinitely a game that shouldn't have been on steam, it isn't finished but I'm glad you posted it as a learning lesson for both you and I. I got some positive information out of the game and it was worth my $2 so thank you, I appreciate it.\n\nI recommend this game if anyone wants to have a good laugh and enjoys playing terrible games, or if they plan on making their own games and want to see what an epic dumpsterfire looks like.\n\nI feel like an awful person leaving negative feedback on this game, but in all honesty I'd say its warrented for releasing a product like this for sale.\n\nI look forward to playing Raywin 2.\n\n1/10 would play again.","September 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

It took me a while longer than it should have because I had to contact the dev to figure out a bug. A regular play through would probably take 45 minutes at the most. First things first, the dev is very helpful and great. Unfortunately the game has a ways to go before it's worth buying.\n\nThere are some glaring problems, and I'll try to make this review as constructive as possible so hopefully Raywin 2 addresses these problems.\n\n1. There is no tutorial to learn the controls. They are easy enough but you first need to try all your keys to see if they do anything.\n\n2. Items don't tell you what they do. You have a healing potion? Great! But it doesn't tell you how much it will heal you. Vegatables? Fun! What are they even used for? I didn't use an item throughout the entire game.\n\n3. You can't see the HP of the enemy. How am I supposed to know when to heal/attack? So far I just attack and eventually win, and have some NPC heal me. Not much strategy.\n\n4. Wall/noclip glitches everywhere. Doesn't feel like a complete game. Not to mention, 95% of every shop screen is empty space. There is no decoration, and on the off-chance there is decoration, half the time you can walk right through it.\n\n5. Can't go back to places already visited. Found that out too late, so I think I missed some content.\n\n6. The "quests" are as simple as "walk 5 spaces and click 'space' 8 times then come back". Another quest you literally turn into a rock, for no good reason, to sneak by some guards. That's the only time you turn into a rock in the whole game. I would understand if it the game was introducing a new mechanic, but it's not. I just don't get it.\n\nOne nice part about the game is the leveling system. It seems really cool, but since you only defeat maybe 5 enemies (you can avoid the rest without problem) you don't really get to try it out. At the end, each of my characters levelled one.. to level 2. I feel like this would have been a fun part of the game, I just wish I was able to take advantage of it!\n\nOverall, not a very gripping game. Needs a lot of work fixing some bugs. I don't recommend it in its current state.\n\n**To get into the museum, you need to press space to enter. This is a confirmed bug so may not be relevant if the dev fixes the bug before you read this review.","July 29, 2015","false","1.4"," 84 of 95 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","84","95","6","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenGamer37/recommended/386110/","GreenGamer37","GreenGamer37","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenGamer37/","130 products in account","The key for this game was indirectly given to me by the developer for review purposes but it will not change the tone of my review\n\nRaywin is a 2D JRPG made on RPG Maker. Just as the name of the game suggests, the story is focused on the hero Raywin who according to a prophecy must defeat Salemsun. The game is just bad even if it is the first game that the developers made and this is supported by the fact that one of the game's selling points is having "‚òÖ Over 40 items" which isn't even that much compared to other RPG Maker games. Let me start of by saying the game is incredibly short and overall not a fun experience.\n\nWhere do I start with the flaws of this game.... First of all the game has tons of nonclip/wall glitches and bugs, the first one being on the first room, yes it is on the first room. I know it‚Äôs the first game they made and they used floor tiles to give the walls effect but still they should have tested it before the game‚Äôs release. One bug that I encountered is that you need to press space to enter the museum.\n\nSecond, the items, Oh great! a monster dropped an orange maybe I could use it to heal one of my characters but wait it doesn't tell you how much it will heal, same goes with the monsters whose health you cannot see so you don't know when to heal/attack.\n\nUh.... the quests which may be the worst part about the game. The quests just involve you going to some place , rescue a person or get an item for someone and maybe fighting a monster along the way.\n\nGraphics wise the game is okay, the sprites are basic and what you would expect from an RPG Maker game, nothing special but dear god.... the chat faces and monster sprites just look horrendous. If a game has its entire overworld pixelated then keep the graphics the same at least, though this is entirely my opinion.\n\nSpeaking of monsters, they do not pose any threat, just attack and heal if anyone is hurt. I had to fight like what? Only 8 monsters including the bosses throughout the game! On a sidenote the game is barren, huge houses with one or two NPCs with bland surroundings.\n\nBefore I end the review I would like to mention that the story is nothing innovative, just the same old chosen one story which might I add has been outdated since the dawn of the fourth generation of gaming consoles! Yes, I do my research.\n\nThis game though being the developers first try to make a good game is just an unfinished sloppy RPG Maker test project. The only good thing about the game is that you can get an extra perfect game because all the achievements in this game can be earned throughout the game which is about 1 hour long.","August 18, 2015","false","5.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","18","21","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kimchitea/recommended/386110/","kimchitea","Kimchi Tea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kimchitea/","1820 products in account","Saw all the negative reviews and thought, "Oh, it can't be that bad. People are probably just being harsh because it's an RPGMaker game."\nGot the game in a bundle.\nStarted it up.\nFirst room, immediately climbed up the wall.\n-_-\n\nShort version: it is that bad. Like, if other bad RPGMaker games are Twilight bad, Raywin is legolas by laura bad. It's so bad I now feel guilty for every other negative Steam review I have written.\n\nThere's no intro or tutorial or anything, the game just starts with you standing in a room. I know what the default RPGMaker controls are, so I'm not going to complain about that. I will complain about not being able to interact with anything in the room. Trying to talk to your father does nothing. You have to try to leave the house for his scripted dialogue to pop up. (And of course all the dialogue in the game is full of typos and poor comprehension of how English works.)\n\nOh, and you can walk up the walls. This isn't a one-off thing; it happens in every room and dungeon. Consider it a feature, I guess. The prophecy foretold of the one with magic wall-walking powers. It makes as much sense as your random ability to turn into a rock later on.\n\nSecond town map, "The door is locked," you're told upon trying to enter a house that has no door. And you pick vegetables by walking over them and pressing Z, and why did I even bother because it's just some random filler side quest?\n\nThen I realized the main quest and story has about as much depth. Like, you're the chosen one of prophecy (the game helpfully informs you in a brief text scroll) because you're a fighter traveling with a mage, which has somehow never happened before in RPG Cliche Land. And... that's it.\n\nThe maps are all poorly designed, particularly the stores and houses, which are big, awkward empty spaces apparently designed by someone who's never seen the inside of a building. The best/worst is one store that's literally just a full screen of empty wooden floor and a counter, with a bed in the top corner. When the storekeeper goes to give your Healing Macguffin to the girl in bed, he's so far up the screen that his head is cut off.\n\nOh, and the bed with the girl just disappears. "Oh, who cares," I thought at this point. "At least I can just continue with the game." Except the quest reward was only one half of what you need to continue -- apparently you can't open the plot door with your locksmith tools unless you have a pouch to put them in. (And you can't walk around the door, either, even though it's just a regular house-sized door lying in the middle of an open gate that's three spaces wide.)\n\nSo I wandered around trying to find a locksmith tools pouch and got attacked by eye beasts. One at a time, because I guess programming more than one enemy sprite on the battle screen was too difficult?\n\nAnd why eye beasts? If you're going to face hordes of enemies that have no special abilities, do negligible damage, and go down in like three hits, why something that looks so alien and dangerous? (Why am I trying to apply logic to Raywin?)\n\nIf you get past those, you have to guess your way past a riddle, go into a labyrinth (which is actually just a room) and rescue a "Preist," who gives you the locksmith tools pouch, and blah blah blah, you get on a ship, you have to catch stowaways from the Clan of Stowaways, who show up and join your party before you actually receive the quest to find them. I was going to say at least the game doesn't bug out completely, but then I was told to take off my stowaway disguise that I had to put on to infiltrate the secret stowaway meeting, and the game just froze, and this is the point where I just give up and idle the game for cards.\n\nThis is the kind of game you label "Unfinished Test Project" and release for free to get feedback, only to delete later out of embarrassment. The fact that someone looked at Raywin and thought, "Yes, I deserve money for my efforts," is ludicrous. Either they're straight up delusional, or they're just taking the p*ss.","October 10, 2015","false","2.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","13","14","5","0"

It plays like a "My first RPGMaker game", except it probably took about a weekend to make.  The controls are unresponsive, the plot is incomprehensible, and you clip through most everything.

People get a lot more for less begging on the streets and holding up a sign so I'm not going to complain about $2. Also, You can take this positive review because I understand that even though the game was one of the worst I've ever played, it took you time to make it.\n\nSome of the issues wrong with this game are pretty much 100% everything that everybody else who left a negative review on it already stated as well as some other gamebreaking bugs. I got 75% through the game and had to start over because I purchased a weapon and didn't have enough money to purchase a goblin suit to get past the guards. The vendor also would not let me sell any of the items I had picked up throughout the game so I had no way of earning the money and was forced to start over.\n\nOverall the game took about 40 minutes to complete from start to finish while reading all of the dialogue and exploring unnecessary areas.\n\nDefinitely a game that shouldn't have been on steam, it isn't finished but I'm glad you posted it as a learning lesson for both you and I. I got some positive information out of the game and it was worth my $2 so thank you, I appreciate it.\n\nI recommend this game if anyone wants to have a good laugh and enjoys playing terrible games, or if they plan on making their own games and want to see what an epic dumpsterfire looks like.\n\nI feel like an awful person leaving negative feedback on this game, but in all honesty I'd say its warrented for releasing a product like this for sale.\n\nI look forward to playing Raywin 2.\n\n1/10 would play again.","September 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"
