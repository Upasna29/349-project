You play an old-tymey metal-helmed submariner, exploring a sunken ship all by your lonesome. I don't need to tell you that something sinister happened there, because the sights and sounds will clue you in to that in short order. While the design isn't quite as immersive as something like CAPSULE, there are plenty of ominous creaks and flickering shadows to keep your pulse elevated. You'll also find journals and letters from the crew that reveal the circumstances of the ship's demise, and it's some quality horror to delve into.\n\nThe one gimmick the game has is that you can switch your headlamp off (complete with an adorable knock on your giant helm), which can allow other light sources to reveal different aspects of the ship. This is used to great effect in exploration, and also in a few platformy crate puzzles for a little variety. There's a good bit of navigating samey halls, crate pushing, and lever throwing, but as short as the game is, they won't really wear you out before the end. My one gripe is with some of the encounters, which I thought were lazily designed and not very scary at all. They're a stark contrast to the few others which provided some serious jumps, so just be prepared for an uneven level of terror.\n\nThere are three chapters which should take you 20-30 minutes to clear, depending on how much exploring you do. It's absolutely worth your time if you like spooky subnautical adventures, with only a few minor wrinkles in an otherwise clean package.","December 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","43","45","0","0"

The atmosphere is great as you move through rooms with only your light providing some illumination: not knowing what might be lurking a few feet from you can get genuinely unsettling when you consider the great sound design.\n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty simple and boils down to exploring, jumping through a few platforms, pushing blocks and/or use levers to solve puzzles and escape the occasional danger. If you die you'll start at a checkpoint and there's quite a few of them so that things don't get frustrating. Do take note though that you'll have to clear a chapter if you want your progress saved, if you quit to desktop you'll start from the beginning of your last level: thankfully each one takes only about 30 minutes to clear though.\n\nReveal The Deep comes fully recommended due to its great atmosphere and fairly intriguing story, its extremely cheap price makes it a true bargain.","December 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","0"

It’s got the atmosphere, mystery and puzzles to keep you hooked, but it isn’t void of flaws.\n\nThe story is interesting in its own respects. You play as a diver, exploring the carcass of a sunken ship at the bottom of the sea. Notes are scattered about each of the 3 levels, explaining how the ship got all the way down there. Basically, explorers discovered an island which once held an entire civilization. Now, only abandoned temples and villages remain. Of course, the explorers take an array of mysterious artifacts home. But, low and behold, the artifacts are cursed, and everyone on board is in for a bad day.\n\nGameplay is fairly straight forward. You’ll encounter some obstacles and puzzles throughout the game, but nothing too challenging. Reveal the Deep relies on its puzzles the most. Thankfully, the devs have implemented a really cool trick to keep gameplay fresh. At certain times, you’ll be able to jump between alternate realities. Swapping realities changes the map’s layout. Platforms may disappear, certain objects react differently in each reality, and hidden items, such as notes, can only be accessed by utilizing this mechanic. This ability is one of the game’s saving graces and it keeps things interesting.\n\nThe graphics are what they are: very simple pixel art accompanied by a small collection of animations. At first, it really is nice on the eyes. Tiny bubbles plume from your helmet, and the light blue tinge of your flashlight illuminates the corridors ahead, but not enough to uncover what horrors dwell beyond. But after an hour or so of gameplay, the charm starts to fade. After Reveal the Deep’s first chapter, you’ve seen almost everything in the graphics department.\n\nThankfully, sound design is top notch. Each step vibrates throughout the ship’s iron tomb like the beat of a gong, and deep sea ambiance drives home the feeling that you’re all alone. It managed to keep me on edge from start to finish and is done exceptionally well.\n\nReveal the Deep isn’t a “must buy” experience, and it’ll only take you a little over an hour to complete. But it’s got the atmosphere, intriguing story and thoughtful puzzle solving to warrant a buy. It’s only 99 cents, so there isn’t much of a gamble to be had. Who knows, it just might be worth your time.","January 9","true","1.5"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","37","40","3","0"

Best 70 cents I've spent in a long time. I've just finished the first chapter and the atmoshpere is solid, as well as everything else you could expect from a 2D game. The sound is really good, and generally speaking you don't come accross too many horror games, let alone 70 cent ones. I had a huge-♥♥♥ jump scare, but that's okay. I was planning on changing my underwear anyways..\n\nThe verdict so far: If you are down with indie horror, then this game is a must have. You won't break the bank. Save that trip to 7/11 for a hotdog, and pick this game up instead, you won't be dissapointed.\n\nReview Criteria: Price per hour value. Does this game get my 1$/HR value? Yes.\n\nDoes this game have game-breaking bugs? Probably, but I haven't encountered any yet, just have read about them.\n\nIs there replayability to this game? Maybe. Depends on whether or not the devs add more chapters. Up to them, I suppose!\n\nAnd most importantly.. is it FUN? Yes!\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\n\nThis is from Chapter 1, in case you want to see how well the game plays:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVU2CIIs0ZY","December 6, 2015","true","2.2"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","97","28","29","12","0"

Plus... it's the price of a hot-and-spicy!\n\nGAMEPLAY:Gameplay really is something different, it's unique in it's own way, and it really does contribute to the game's atmosphere. Real-time physics are implemented with only contributes to the immersion, I found myself cowering in the corner because I accidentally toggled my lighting off. Anywho, you have two sets of lights on your helemt, and toggling these bring up different stories (literally). You have your regular flashlight, and then you have the 'flashlight' that turns any room with bulbs into a blast-from-the-past. By switching between these two modes, you discover a unique story, dark secrets, and why you decided to travel to the abyss.\n\nSTORY:I'm not going to spoil much of anything here, because that would ruin the fun (really, it would). But what I can tell you is that it is well (in its-self) worth more than $1. The year is 1901, you, your wife (Alice), and a friend of hers, Beatrice. As you find more and more of these 'books', you uncover that somethng tragic and horrifying had happened then, and there.\n\nART:The art is something that will absolutely CONSUME you, it really makes this game stand out (and immersive). The coloring is done like it should be, unique and dynamic shadows based off of your helmet's light, the fact that they got the whole 'underwater ship' done right (lots of games don't do this), and this is all geared towards atmosphere. If your flashlight produces shadows, you produce a 'weakness'. The atmosphere in this game is absolutely terrifying, being 'locked' in an underwater ship with monsters, BOOKS, and other things that go bump in the night, is absolutely terrifying.\n\nMUSIC & SOUNDS:The music is absolutely beautiful, in a creepy-like way. The screen will ocassionally shake and scare the living hell out of you, and this is a good thing. The sounds and music make up 1/2 of the atmosphere (duh, art), and it's easy to see WHY it does. My first time getting into an elevator in 'Reveal the Deep', I almost screamed like a little girl. The screeching and the sudden change of pace gameplay left me having a heart-attack.\n\n10/10\nThe highest possible rating I can give, it easily earns this score. Not only is it cheap, but you get hours of unique and compelling gameplay, a creepy-atmosphere, ominous music, and the story (which is HNK amazing). There's absolutely no reason NOT to buy this game.","December 5, 2015","true","2.3"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynarayan/recommended/411560/","ladynarayan","Narayan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynarayan/","393 products in account","Reveal The Deep is a creepy exploration game with minor puzzle and platforming elements. It takes place underwater in a huge derelict ship, and right of the bat player notices that something is not quite right ... Visuals are dark & atmospheric with only your headlamp to guide you. But what really makes the mood are the amazing environmental sounds (especially the metal affected by the water pressure) and various sudden effects (gave me nearly a heart attack, twice).\n\nYou learn what happened by reading scattered journal pages from the point of view of 3 passengers/ expedition members, and by examining some objects (flavor mainly). There are areas that seem to be some sort of an echo of the past, that you get to phase into when turning off your headlamp. It not only allows you to read into the events, but also affects the platforming part, as the environment shifts its layout a bit sometimes. The story itself gives off a mild Lovecraftian vibe. It seems interesting, so there is a motivation to pursue it, but in the end there is something a bit lacking & it "ends" abruptly (although it makes sense). While it's nice to discover who you are and roughly what transpired, I wouldn't mind more details and depth with other plot points covered.\n\nThe platforming itself is easy, and requires just a handful of precise jumps. The difficulty comes from the exploration part. The area seems huge, and there is no map. You have to remember by yourself all the passageways, what might opened what, which paths to take in order to maybe get where you want, etc. I caught myself running in circles a couple of times. But on the upside it seems like you can't get stuck (there is always a way to back out or push further) and you're able to open up some shortcuts, so people with good orientation won't have to run around so much.\n\nOne major flaw is no saving from inside a chapter. There are 3 chapters, roughly 1 hour each, and the game only saves in between chapters. If you quit in the middle of one, you have to start over from the beginning of that chapter, which frankly stressed me out the wrong way: what if my computer resets? what if the application malfunctions? how much more till chapter ends? - I wanna go to sleep XD <- that last thought from when I started the game late at night for the first time not knowing what I'm getting myself into & I felt compelled to sit it out, in order not to repeat quite lengthy chunk of my gameplay. Getting lost in the game's huge environment and missing a vital element for the n-th time is particularly frustrating when you're trying to push through to the next chapter to finally get the game saved.\n\nSaving issue aside, I've quite enjoyed the game. :) The mood is really nice, and setting fairly uncommon. Many of the game design elements mesh well together.","March 31","true","2.7"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

Exploration feels oddly risky, as you're unable to see the full scope of a room before you enter. Little things seem to dart in the corners of your eyes which builds the suspense even more. The first time you see a creature, it's illuminated by the shafts of light from your torch that pierce through the gaps between stairs, and you'll feel that frisson of nervous excitement. The second time you see a creature, you might feel a little bolder, might want to get up close to see what will happen.\n\nGo on, see what'll happen.\n\nHighly recommend this game, especially considering how cheap it is. My only concern would be the lack of saving mid chapter, as it locks you into finishing chapters in one fell swoop. This will probably help prevent people running off when they get spooked then coming back and reducing the charm of the horror though so I can't complain too much.","February 6","true","0.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

But to my surprise, this game was one of the best i've played in a while. Just a small project done with someone who knew what they were doing, and made that specific thing flawless.\n\nI absolutely love the artstyle of this game, there's something about the more detailed pixelart style like SNES era that really draws me in, and luckily games like that seem to come more and more often.\n\nWhile not being -that- long it is surprisingly long for being a good looking game and really cheap, often with a combo like this it's either a long game with horrible quality or a high quality game which is just really really short. Sure, the first chapter took me 0.6 hours, which isn't alot of time compared to what you might be able to put in a tripple A title, but with there being 3 chapters (from what i've heard) then the game will give you at least a good hour of playtime.\nWhat i really love about this game is just being surounded by darkness, with only the small light coming from your diving helmet to light up your path as you explore a strange sunken wreck and with only the sound of the ocean floor and creeking parts of the wreck to be heard, no eerie music, just the noises you'd expect from actually being in a place like this.\n\nThe game is short, but i bet you that if exploration and atmospheric games interest you, then that dollar couldn't be spent better anywhere else.","January 20","true","2.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

The narrative reminds me of the last moments of "The Temple", a short story from author H.P. Lovecraft that also brings the scuba-esque descent into underwater abysses to question; Lovecraftian's also the note-fragment system, as the story is told through written documents left behind by the victims of a dreadful end. The mechanics are as simple as they should be, with the smart use of few abilities to overcome various puzzles and obstacles. Also notable is the 2D, pixel-based scrolling, that works perfectly well with the setting and the narrative - a 3D rendition would simply not workin this case.

I have spent about 30 minutes to get past the first chapter; 5 of those were afk and about another 5 getting to the conclusion of how to pass a monster.\nThis game, for me, has come out of the blue. The 'trailer' and pictures gave me a sense that this would be a good game. It broke those expectations of just being a good game. First through the game they have a good tuturoial bit that pushes you straight into exploring the ship. You soon learn how the dev(S) have utilized a certain control to change your entire enviornment at times. It's breath takinging if you ask me. This begins to allow you to be emersed in the story, or more so the history of the ship. Charcters begin to pop up in this history and whoever drew them, great job!! The characters had a sense of looking of their era while also giving off personaility traits. Somthing like that in an indie game is superb. Among the scenery you also have lighting that ties into the control I spoke of before. Again emersing you into the history. Most of the time though you are just left with the creepy sounds of a ship, along with sounds of being watched?? It's all simple yet so complex in it's own way for story telling. If that makes sense. Some reviewer said "you get an empty vibe". And that is exactly how I would explain it.\nAnywho some more downsides of this. Since it doesn't have a save feature sometimes it can be a bit weird. Some animations and pixels are just a bit eh but most are really fluent and fun to watch. Srsly though, go get the game. It is more worth 2$+ if you ask me but I guess having it this low right away will help get the game publicity and the developer.\nSecond monster ♥♥♥♥ed me up with my heart pouding for a good minute, simple yet complex, no save only between chapters, super awesome, puzzles can make you think, go get this. 9/10 maybe for the type of game it is. 8.2/10 for overall ness if that makes sense. :D","December 5, 2015","true","2.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I'm only in chapter 2 of 3. The puzzles are challenging but fun. The ship is a maze but there are just enough differences to begin to keep track of where you are in the map. I didn't manage to die in the first chapter (though there are oppourtunities to be in real danger). There are a few traps in chapter 2 that killed me multiple times. The game would really benifit from either a save feature or checkpoints within the chapters. I'm not a slow puzzle game player and chapter 1 took a few hours. My option was to leave my laptop running or loose all progress, not a fun way to play. A player guide would be great or a tip guide could really help at a couple points. Does anyone who finished the game have a tip on getting past those dang seaweed (?) blockages. The atmosphere is great, the graphics are simple but do a good job of making you believe you are trapped in an old ship at the bottom of the ocean.","January 7","true","19.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

If you enjoy exploring the unknown, then you will most likely appreciate this game.\n\nCheck out my Quick Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0hLT7Jv_Ac\nThe game completely revolves around exploration, and finding out where you need to go, and then how to get there. You move around underwater and explore the sunken ship. Wherever you are facing with your light is all that you can see. You can turn your light off or on, and you will sometimes see different things or different paths you can take to keep progressing.\n\n\nPros:sound effects in the game REALLY set the atmosphere and make the game what it is\ngreat use of lighting that fits really well to keep the atmosphere set by the audio\ninteresting story, if you took the time to explore and learn the backstory\nCons:lacks control customization, and controller support\nlacks replay value if you explored thoroughly on the first play-through\nIt took me less than an hour and a half to complete all 3 chapters, while trying to explore everything I could.

It has an incredible atmosphere and the art and sounds really bring this to the forefront. Excellent story as well. This is a definite buy, especially considering the insanely low price for such a nice little game. I can't say too much, as it is heavily dependent on exploration and story. So go, don't delay, and enjoy the scenery. I know I did.

Without spoiling too much, it's about a deep sea diver exploring and revealing the mysteries of a sunken explorer ship from the 19th century.  In this 2 hour adventure, you will be doing some light platforming (although there is one frustratingly difficult jump at the very end), some puzzle solving (often involving pushing crates, pulling levers or stepping into an alternate reality), enjoying a wonderful spooky pixel setting that scares without being too oppressive and revealing the rather Lovecraftian fate of the derelict you are in.  The game could definitely benefit from controller support (which currently only works if you manually map your controller to keyboard controls) and some tighter platforming, but Reveal the Deep asks for neither much of your time or your money for what it offers, and I think you should play it.","February 8","true","2.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

In general I felt the game has an atmospheric underwater setting with nice lighting effects and ambient sounds.\n\nControlling the diver character is easy enough (with use of arrow-keys and a couple other keys for interaction and toggling a light), though I found it can sometimes be a little fussy with jumps in some spots.\n\nThe shipwreck seems quite large and I like exploring it. There's a bit of a story that is reveled by finding the occasional letter or note. So far the puzzles I’ve encountered have usually been easy enough to solve with a bit of experimenting and exploring.\n\nOne weak point I may mention (as I write this review) is a lack of an option to save the game. This can mean that if one had to or wanted to close the game for whatever reason, then progress in a level would be lost, requiring that the whole level would need to be started from the beginning again when next playing. Hopefully the Developer will consider to add in a save option (or at least make some regular checkpoints).\n\nDespite some shortcomings with the game, overall, and considering the rather low-price, I think it’s a fun little game. If this type of game interests you and you’re considering to get it, then I would recommended it.\n\nHere’s a video of my first look at Reveal the Deep:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=571995189","December 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","I don't often get dollar-store games from Steam because they tend to be often underdeveloped products and/or not worth my time. Reveal the Deep is something I would consider underdeveloped, yet I felt my time was respected. (For the most part.)\n\nPrice is something I don't often take into consideration for reviewing the game's quality. However, I do think for an indie team's (or lone developer's) first game on Steam, the price point is low enough that if the game doesn't interest you then you won't have much buyer's remorse.\n\nWith all that being said, I hope Lazy Monday Games learns a lot from this project to create something more substantial gameplay like The Swapper while also keeping all the great aspects made in Reveal the Deep.\n\nA Little More than A Walking Simulator\nUnlike games like Home where it has more left to the imagination about horror and the gameplay boiling down to one or two choices, Reveal the Deep has some gameplay and horror elements into its gameplay design. None of which make this game into a full puzzle game, yet it's more enjoyable to play than to watch.\n\nThe best design decision for RD is how levels/chapters give the impression of free-form exploration without feeling more linear than it actually is. Messages, items, new pathways that lead back to previous areas, etc. improve an otherwise boring experience of going down a linear corridor with horror-ish moments.\n\nOn a second playthrough, I would probably find the level design more linear than first impressions; however, that's okay because exploration is all about the sense of discovery, which is what the game excels at for its short time.\n\nOne huge oversight in exploration is how areas are split into chapters. There is nothing of a Metroidvania design between each level nor any reason to replay a past level for deeper insight into the narrative. It also means when you want to quit you'll have to restart the area you last played, which is mitigated by how small these areas are when you rush them. So you'll only have to replay 10 mins at most.\n\nThe other downside to Reveal the Deep's core gameplay is that other than the exploration there's little else to keep your interest. The puzzles are far too bland and simple to keep you engaged.\n\nNeeds A Little more Spark\nThe game's biggest problem when it comes to its puzzles is not that the ideas behind them are terrible; the problem is that they have nothing unique to them or added to make the conventional puzzles act differently.\n\nRD's main puzzles boil down to pushing/interacting with blocks either by pushing them or turning on and off your light source. Other puzzles with light horror elements involve using the headlight to fend off monsters. Lights also seem to have a space-time effect for revealing new passageways to explore or notes to read.\n\nThe light gameplay gimmick could've been enough to make these puzzles more interesting on their own, but the game never commits enough to the idea to make them original. (Similar to a game like Glare that uses the light-mechanic at the start and then completely forgets about it.)\n\nThis issue is why, if the developer(s) took some lessons from The Swapper, they could center a main mechanic for an entire game as well as giving more playtime for their product while not artificially expanding the game. They could also offer a greater sense of challenge, exploration and character to the gameplay.\n\nThey could also learn some ways to avoid some of the obvious pitfalls for storytelling in these exploration, horror, puzzle-games that have become all to common tropes now to be avoided.\n\nNarrative Quibbles as a Player\nI won't be mentioning spoilers in this section. These are rather criticisms I noticed by how the game reveals its narrative, mechanically as well as the content you find. I'll try to limit my examples to the most obvious problems with some specifics mentioned.\n\nThe biggest trope this game stumbles across is the same thing you have to ask yourself with H.P. Lovecraft's work: Who is taking the time to draw/write out these notes? Many messages you come across have some detailed images of horrific situations (or make the reader question why are they writing this stuff down) that get in the way of the story. It's easier to swallow when it's some crewmember bored out of his mind doodling some of the crew but harder to accept when tragedies occur.\n\nOn a similar point, some of the written material is weird. The ending line for all of Isaac's letters is hard to ignore when the events become more immediate. Context clues you find from exploring can be pure nonsense. One example is a random note you'll come across, "The dinosaurs used to have ears--something that is forgotten by fossil records." Most of the early clues you find, either environmental designs or the protagonist's thoughts, are relevant to the story in some small way. This is in a stark contrast to these meaningless thoughts.\n\nThose are problems I can point to as objective faults of the narrative's design. They don't need to be overhauled, they just need to be handled better so every detail is important and there's just enough explained to keep some mystery in check. (For example, why is it that turning off the light seems to take us back in time? The game never explains this in any way.)\n\nOn a more personal note, I would advise not following the staple "Mind is superior to the body; spirit is stronger than physical means" meaning you find in a lot of artsy games. I've yet to find one game where the handling of that idea wasn't pretentious and it wasn't at odds with what the rest of the game is focused on. Unless there is an immense amount of theming into that idea, then adding it in for the hell of it is worthless.\n\nMy advice to create a game with meaning is simply this:  Stick to creating a story that has details hidden beneath the surface, leave some details open to the imagination, then let the reader/player come to the conclusions of their own. Those types of stories will ALWAYS be more impactful to the reader, and you won't come off as standing on a soapbox; you'll be making people believe their own messages through your game.\n\nGameplay Nitpicks\nJumping off a ladder at the very top is sometimes need to reach the other side or other ladder. This never felt polished to execute properly.\nGauging distances for jumping sometimes required the most pixel-perfect jumps to land. It felt out-of-place for this game.\nMoments where you need to shine in two directions can seem to be trial-and-error sections.\nThe light-on and light-off animation can feel too slow for some puzzles.\nIt's Not the Best, It's Not the Worst; It's Okay\nAll these criticisms are said with admiration for what has been achieved so far. I am more often not a fan of horror games, and even the staple jump-scare tactics were effective here as well as the atmospheric horror of the unknown. So coming away from this game with a positive outlook has to mean something from me.\n\nIn the end, Reveal the Deep is a game you won't regret purchasing if you have some level of interest for its narrative. It won't end with a satisfying conclusion but the hour and a half of playtime you'll experience will be sublime with the feeling of exploration.\n\nEven when restarting a chapter, you'll probably beat this game under two hours, which makes me worried for the developers' sake. This is another reason why I think they should take the ideas that work here and make a full-blown game to warrant more purchases as well as people retaining their interest with it.\n\nQuality made games like this one need to be commended more often, especially when they don't waste the player's time.","March 12","true","1.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game has so far been the best horror game i've played in a long time, not only for it's use of audio to make you jump or the visuals (which are amazing for pixel graphics I might add with the whole blue underwater scenary you'll fall in love with), but for it's use of lore to drive the player into looking deeper into this story and the ship itself. The letters left behind by passagers of the ship plays a huge part when it comes to the scares because of the way it's introduced and how it affects you overall. The game overall is short and isn't noticed as much, but it should get more attention for how amazing all of this has been crafted together to make this game.

I don't give the game a bad rating, it's just not a fun one. The price is good, the atmosphere is interesting, and it's a pixel horror game that does what it sets out to do, I suppose. Unfortunately, it just never engaged me with interesting narrative or tension. If you're looking for a casual, pixel-horror, narrative style horror game, I suppose one could find some enjoyment in it, but it didn't work for me. It should take players around two hours to complete, and I found it more an exercise in tedium than anything. Good graphics, some interesting content, and a solid indie horror effort, it just falls flat in the execution.","December 26, 2015","false","3.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The story you get from it actually might keep your attention for  the whole thing, although that may not be to hard seeing as the game is very short, about 15-25 minutes a chapter.  The controls are simple which is good seeing as there's nothing that you need to do that you wouldn't expect.  Along with moving you can interact with certain objects using E or RIGHT SHIFT, and you use SPACE to toggle your light.  The only problem that I have with the controls is that UP ARROW or W are jump, but it isn't any bother to actual game.  Your goal is to explore, solve puzzle's and find note's left by the former crew.  Nothing in this game was a surprise seeing as it's a 2D horror game.\n\nThis game has very standard features, like how it is broken up into chapters, but there are some things in those chapters that work well with the gameplay.

The story you get from it actually might keep your attention for  the whole thing, although that may not be to hard seeing as the game is very short, about 15-25 minutes a chapter.  The controls are simple which is good seeing as there's nothing that you need to do that you wouldn't expect.  Along with moving you can interact with certain objects using E or RIGHT SHIFT, and you use SPACE to toggle your light.  The only problem that I have with the controls is that UP ARROW or W are jump, but it isn't any bother to actual game.  Your goal is to explore, solve puzzle's and find note's left by the former crew.  Nothing in this game was a surprise seeing as it's a 2D horror game.\n\nThis game has very standard features, like how it is broken up into chapters, but there are some things in those chapters that work well with the gameplay.  At many points in the game you will be in a room that will look empty, but if there is a burnt out ship light on the wall, you can turn your light off to make the room become like it's original form.

It was short, but I prefer to compare length in dollars per hour so I easily got my money's worth. To start, this had an excellent atmosphere, with a combination of sounds, level design, and lighting to really make it solid. I don't play horror games, and I would consider this to be like a thriller, in that it's dark and gets some great "HOLY F*CK" moments. The puzzle elements fit well with the idea of the game, and the helmet light mechanic is welcome and refreshing. However, I have a few gripes that aren't necessarily an issue but are a tad annoying. Basically, you can sometimes jump in the air and ladders are wonky. I am a little disappointed in the ending, mostly cause I don't know what the heck happened, but I like the game anyways and it's fun to play in little stints during lunch or something.\n\nOh also my playtime (89 minutes or so) does not accurately reflect how long I have played. I completed the first two chapters when macs were unable to run the game and had to be launched from Terminal. This has been fixed, though i have to admit that it was a little fun to enter in some external commands instead of steam so I didn't mind it.","January 2","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story you get from it actually might keep your attention for  the whole thing, although that may not be to hard seeing as the game is very short, about 15-25 minutes a chapter.  The controls are simple which is good seeing as there's nothing that you need to do that you wouldn't expect.  Along with moving you can interact with certain objects using E or RIGHT SHIFT, and you use SPACE to toggle your light.  The only problem that I have with the controls is that UP ARROW or W are jump, but it isn't any bother to actual game.  Your goal is to explore, solve puzzle's and find note's left by the former crew.  Nothing in this game was a surprise seeing as it's a 2D horror game.\n\nThis game has very standard features, like how it is broken up into chapters, but there are some things in those chapters that work well with the gameplay.  At many points in the game you will be in a room that will look empty, but if there is a burnt out ship light on the wall, you can turn your light off to make the room become like it's original form.  There were also a few sections where you would turn your light off to make a certain form of crate float until you turned your light back on.  I find the use of the light as a focal point works well, it's simple.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!!!\nThe story revolves around the events that took place on the ship after the crew found some mysterious artifacts on a unknown Island.  The story of what exactly happened slowly unfold through each chapter, along with your purpose in the events.  The basic lay out of the game is... CHAPTER 1, scary part, because you don't know what is happening and why your here.  CHAPTER 2, first incounter, because you will not only incounter your first monster, but many.  CHAPTER 3, your fate, as you find what you nust do to survive.\n\nThis game mayy be short, but it will deliver a good story even though it may be a bit cliche, and the function of the light is a good gameplay focus, so with all said, this game is a solid 7/10","December 20, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't normally leave reviews but felt it would be irresponsible not to when I enjoyed it so much.\n\nOne major commendation I have to make is for the sound design.  I'm studying audio engineering at the moment and am extremely impressed by the quality of the sounds.  That coupled with a few things in game really had me momentarily petrified!\n\nThe graphics work in it is absolutely beautiful, and added to the immersion really well.\n\nAtmospheric, simple with no frills, bare bones control system and immersive...took me right back to earlier gaming days where you stopped to think about what you needed to do to progress.  These guys have done a spectacular job with a wee short game.\n\n\nPros\n- Simple\n- Curiousity-inducing background story\n- Amazing sound design\n- Makes you genuinely feel like an explorer in a messed up place with eerie graphics and noises that raise the hairs on the back of your neck\n- Great wee headlamp on/off animation with accompanying sound effect\n- Clever multiple existence idea\n- Doesn't introduce you to the game using kid gloves\n\nCons (let's face it, every game has it's downsides!)\n- Save feature mid chapter would be beneficial\n- Possibly some atmospheric background music would be good\n- Navigating ladders can be finicky, if you're holding down W/S/up or down when you jump towards a ladder, you occasionally move in the opposite direction...but it's not enough to detract totally from my overall view of the game\n\n\nI love how I as a gamer wasn't patronised in the introduction to the game.  You're dumped into it and have to figure things out for yourself, something a lot of games fail on for me these days...they over-tutorialise.\n\nAnyways, to finish up, if you like the odd jump scare without it being OTT, buy this game.\nIf you appreciate having to think for yourself, buy this game.\nIf you enjoy simple, well thought out games, buy this game.\n\nBig thumbs up to the devs and keep up the good work!  Well worth the small price tag to support their work.\n\n\n10/10 Would happily require underwear change again","January 4","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a simple concept of being under water in an old ship and turning your light on and off can make changes to the environment.\n\nThe moody graphics are suited well with the eerie underwater sound effects and the story seems a little peculiar, drawing you into it the more you progress.\n\nMy only gripes are some of the ladders are a little hard to negotiate and the "flicking" of the light animation every time you turn your lamp on/off are a little offputting but it's still worth the while and doesn't hinder gameplay too much.\n\nNo untimely deaths, no repeating the same levels and already one jumpscare that had me nearly reaching for a new pair of undergarments!

It was short, but I prefer to compare length in dollars per hour so I easily got my money's worth. To start, this had an excellent atmosphere, with a combination of sounds, level design, and lighting to really make it solid. I don't play horror games, and I would consider this to be like a thriller, in that it's dark and gets some great "HOLY F*CK" moments. The puzzle elements fit well with the idea of the game, and the helmet light mechanic is welcome and refreshing. However, I have a few gripes that aren't necessarily an issue but are a tad annoying. Basically, you can sometimes jump in the air and ladders are wonky. I am a little disappointed in the ending, mostly cause I don't know what the heck happened, but I like the game anyways and it's fun to play in little stints during lunch or something.\n\nOh also my playtime (89 minutes or so) does not accurately reflect how long I have played. I completed the first two chapters when macs were unable to run the game and had to be launched from Terminal. This has been fixed, though i have to admit that it was a little fun to enter in some external commands instead of steam so I didn't mind it.","January 2","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of my biggest and best gaming surprises ever. I bought it without expecting much of it, and boy is it good. Basically it's like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but better. Who new a bunch of pixels could be so spooky?\n\nThis game has got an incredible atmosphere, a good part of it comes from the excellent sound effects... fantastically immersive (pun intended).\n\nAfter that, it's pretty much Amnesia:\n- Spooky adventure in a derelict and confined place\n- Mysterious artifact retrieved from third world country ruined everything\n- Your best only friend is a torch\n- You've got no weapons to defend yourself so when something attacks you, you better run\n- Story comes from parchment papers scattered here and there\n- Only 2 or 3 jumpscares in the whole game but they are the worst ever\nYup the similarities just keep piling up. But like I said Reveal The Deep is better in my opinion. So that's okay.\n\nSo...\n\nPros:\n- Awesome sound\n- Minimalist albeit cool graphics\n- Nice game system (turning your light off can reveal secrets, a lot like entering the Dark World in A Link To The Past)\n- Super spooky\n- Very Atmospheric\n- So cheap!\n\nCons:\n- Short\n- Visuals are very dark so when you find a piece of paper and want to read it your eyes are gonna have a bad time\n- Controls not as responsive as they should be\n- Ending quite a bit disappointing\n\nStory is neither good not bad, pretty generic, doesn't matter in my opinion.\n\nI'd like at this point to reiterate that I absolutely loved this game.

The music, random noises, not knowin what's going on all adds up to a thrilling experience. It's terrifying walking around not knowing if a monster will pop up at any second. When I first started I formed a habit of looking back and right, eventually I learned that nothing pops up at you. But the random noises and voices nearly made my genitals explode.\n\nThe scariest part was when I walked towards the monster in the wall and it swiftly launched me backward. That nearly made me lose my ♥♥♥♥♥... Even after doing it over and over it was so scary. The sound...the everything...it's like you were going to die.\n\nThe long experience (if you have no clue what you're doing) really wears you down. Since you can't mute anything you have to listen to all the scary sounds and creepy noises. After a hour you feel like you want to kill yourself just to stop playing...but you keep playing...\n\nThe game basically programs your mind to be in fear of everything. Even the little shrimp/crab thing scared me a little. It could'e killed me or something :steamhappy:\n\nThe creatures that try to sneak up on you kinda ruin the terrifying experience. All you have to do is flash your light on them and they run away. For once in a while you have control over your situation and the ability to defend yourself. I think it's better when you have no power over your fate other than the ability to evade and escape.\n\nThe giant monster (jake or jacob? forgot) was kinda creepy. But not so much. I thought he would crush me but he just let me walk past and...kill him with the box.\n\nOne of the scariest things in the game is the paintings and the letters...they intensify the creep factor beyond belief.\n\nAt the end you stack the blocks to make a totem pole and it's pretty interesting.

The music, random noises, not knowin what's going on all adds up to a thrilling experience. It's terrifying walking around not knowing if a monster will pop up at any second. When I first started I formed a habit of looking back and right, eventually I learned that nothing pops up at you. But the random noises and voices nearly made my genitals explode.\n\nThe scariest part was when I walked towards the monster in the wall and it swiftly launched me backward. That nearly made me lose my ♥♥♥♥♥... Even after doing it over and over it was so scary. The sound...the everything...it's like you were going to die.\n\nThe long experience (if you have no clue what you're doing) really wears you down. Since you can't mute anything you have to listen to all the scary sounds and creepy noises. After a hour you feel like you want to kill yourself just to stop playing...but you keep playing...\n\nThe game basically programs your mind to be in fear of everything. Even the little shrimp/crab thing scared me a little. It could'e killed me or something :steamhappy:\n\nThe creatures that try to sneak up on you kinda ruin the terrifying experience. All you have to do is flash your light on them and they run away. For once in a while you have control over your situation and the ability to defend yourself. I think it's better when you have no power over your fate other than the ability to evade and escape.\n\nThe giant monster (jake or jacob? forgot) was kinda creepy. But not so much. I thought he would crush me but he just let me walk past and...kill him with the box.\n\nOne of the scariest things in the game is the paintings and the letters...they intensify the creep factor beyond belief.\n\nAt the end you stack the blocks to make a totem pole and it's pretty interesting. It could've been more scary but I was expecting a boss battle. I have no idea why the character becomes the gatekeeper.\n\nI also found it creepy how their are other diver suits.\n\n\nWhen it comes to horror/scaryness I rate this game 8/10 but that's because I played it in day time.\n\nI would never play it at night...that would make me suicide lol.\n\nGREAT GAME WORTH THE MONEY. 5/5","May 22","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game will probably only take 2 hours from start to finish (3 at most). However, its still a great interactive story & adventure set at the bottom of the sea!

The sound design was fantastic, as the creakings of wood, doors closing, and bubbling sounds truely put me in the dark underwater caverns. The level design and puzzles were nothing too fancy, but they were something to get your mind thinking. The story is basically placed in logs and letters written by past passengers in 1901, and the progression of the horrors that the ship contain show in the letters they write, clearly showing fear of the unknown.\n\nThis game isn't exactly "scary", in my terms. Granted, there are a few times when enemies are present, and in turn can give one a jump. However, they don't pose so much as a threat, and more of a way to stress the player (watch their back), or to find a way to solve a puzzle to continue the adventure. It's mostly just the sound design that is meant to place you in a real sunken ship, and it does a very good job.\n\nMinor things such as controls, art design, and playability are all totally fine. In general, Reveal the Deep is an interesting 30 minute to possibly an hour game that has great potential, and shows it very well. It's simple, but brings interest well enough to keep the player emursed, and it's just a handful of fun, and for a good price.","May 31","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a fantastic exploration horror game that executes the basic concepts of tension beautifully. It only took me about 90 minutes to beat the game, which may be a turn off for some people, but for less than a dollar, I feel I easily got my money worth. I wouldn’t only recommend this game to people tight on time or money, but also to any aspiring environment or sound designer as it shows how vital simple and small effects can elevate a generic exploration game to something pretty special and standout.\n\nPros:\n•	Creepy atmosphere\n•	Fantastic execution of horror elements\n•	Sound design makes you feel alone, especially if using headphones.\n•	Fun thematic puzzle mechanics\n\nCons:\n•	Multiple input bugs\n•	Ending that seemingly comes out of nowhere with little explanation\n\nCheck out the full review at: tmblr.co/Z1PuXi1-mAJZS\n","January 12","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I said " Hell, for 0.49$ it looks pretty good " so I bought it, I'd say this from now this is a really good game because it captivates you in the story. The sounds and visuals are awesome! The only problem that I have with this game is the menu... They really have to work that out!\n\nNow... About the game. You're a little guy in a special suit and you explore a sinked ship. You'll understand why I say 'special' suit when you play the game, at first it is not quite obvious, but after you're playing it for a while you'll get it. While you explore the ship you'll solve puzzles, discover letters (which tell you the story) and get scared a bit (I got scared in Chapter 1 :) ). The fact that you can't actually close the game because you'll lose all progress of the current chapter you're playing is a bit annoying, but I'll call it a 'feature' because it actually makes you pay attention to the story and it captivates you more in it. This game is short so it doesn't need a 'save' feature. You're stuck at 'Chapter 2' and you have to go? Big deal! When you come back, you'll restart Chapter 2 and relive the experience, you'll pay more attention and live the story at its fullest.\n\nSo... I'd recommend you to buy this game!","February 7","true","6.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After all, the atmosphere and sounds are spot on. There were several times I thought I was about to get jump scared because the atmosphere was so good. However, everything else was lacking. In fact, it was so lacking in story and writing it sort of ruined it for me. Right after I read the first note, I had a pretty good idea what was going on. I kept begging that it would change, but no. It seriously was just a shameless plagiarism of Dead Space expect on a sunken ship instead of a broken space station. And I put that as a spoiler because if you know that, you know the plot of the game. There might have been some sort of unfolding of the plot during the end that added a little to it, but it was a very poorly done reveal if it was what I think it was. The feeling of anxiety wore off after the first encounter with the monsters because, after them, there really is nothing to be afraid of since you've seen it all. They are just another one of the numerous shadow type creatures (technically, dark mud, but for all visual purposes: shadow creatures). This alone really ruined the feeling of depth. In my opinion, the best feeling was looking off into the darkness of the sea through the cracks of the ship or hear the scratching and shaking like there was something big moving around the ship in the darkness, when, instead, there's just a bunch of bozos running around that pose only a tiny threat and are scared away just by looking at them. And as for the writing, all the letters in the game sounded like they were written by emotionless psychopaths. To be fair, I think I missed a few because they were so dull I didn't bother hunting for them too hard. It felt like terrible things were going on all around them and they just stared off with glassy eyes while half-heartedly scribbling a letter down. "Well, my friend got torn apart in front of my eyes by this terrifying creature and now I'm spitting up my liver and lungs in a flood of blood, but now I remember I never did eat that sandwich..." It's not quite that bad, but still... It seems pretty important for a game like this. Not to mention that the characters in the story all sounded like the same person. I could read entire letters and be confused until I realized by the font that it was someone else writing it. In other words, there was no real reason to pity any of the people.\nSo as a final thought, I think this game could have really done something special. That's why it may sound like I'm really negative towards it is because it fell a lot shorter than it could have been. Without changing any mechanics to the game, I feel like they could have added a lot of emotion and depth just by adding more to the characters before jumping into the "something's not right". It's saying a lot when I say that the letters were really bad because that's the sort of thing that draws me in and what I crave in games is to find little letters by people. And I think this could have really done that very well. If done so, I felt like the ending of the game could have been one of those "oh my gosh moments" after finishing a good book feel instead of a denial "uh... I guess it's over if my eyes do not deceive me and those are, indeed, the credits."\nSo I really don't mean to say this game is horrible. I just felt like this game could have been a lot more than what it is. Obviously, that's not a fair review for something that's not even there. The asking price is very low and if the atmosphere attracts you, go for it. That alone makes it worth it. It would just sound strange if I recommended it and then put all the bad things down.","February 29","false","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The second chapter introduces enemies and spikes, meaning you can now die. I enjoyed walking around and exploring at my own pace in the first chapter; having to worry about my own survival ruined the second chapter for me. I don't think it's something the game needed. All the challenges of the first chapter were puzzle-solving. It was all about thinking it out. The second chapter's challenges are more about reflexes and luck (sometimes enemy placement can screw you over with no way for you to do anything about it). I didn't pay much for this game and really enjoyed the first chapter, so even though I couldn't be bothered to finish the game, I don't feel cheated out of my money or anything.

Sure. Is it worth the time? I think not.\n\nMost reviews of Reveal the Deep make it out to be a haunting yet endearing little exploration-based pixel-puzzler that effortlessly cultivates an atmosphere of tension and horror that'll make you wish you had put newspapers down before playing. They're not wrong, but it's only really true in the broadest sense possible or if you have an IQ below room temperature.\n\nThe puzzles are comprised of pulling levers and pushing blocks slower than Steven Hawking going uphill, most of which pivots around the core mechanic of turning your light on and off which sees little to no variation throughout the game.\nThe exploration goes as far as taking a left turn as opposed to a right and ending up in a dead-end room containing one, possibly 2, inspectable items.\n\nMaybe I'm just bitter because the ending was confusing, inconclusive and just outright unsatisfactory. Maybe I'm just bitter because my father left when I was a child. Whatever the reason, despite all my cynicism, unless the local 2 dollar hookers are having a half-price special then you're 99 cents honestly couldn't be better spent. All in all, it's not actually a bad game. It's not a great one either and the few hours I invested were anything but time well spent but as far as Steam's collection of one-dollar-dirt goes, it's a diamond in the rough.\n\nDad, if you're reading this, please come home. I miss you.","April 5","false","6.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But the second, in which jumping or crouching instantly killed me, was unresolvable. Given that the game has no save feature and starts you at the beginning of the chapter if you reset, I can't really justify playing anymore, or recommend it just yet.\n\nIf these bugs are resolved in the future, then absolutely I recommend it. I'd love to see more games like it, in fact: small, focused stories with a low price point. I think there's a real future for that, at least with people like me.

Just 51.42% of its owners have ever launched it.\n\nThe average total playtime is 44 minutes, with the median coming in at a paltry 19 minutes played.\n\nTake Steam reviews with a grain of salt. If Reveal the Deep were truly a great game, 88.65% of its players wouldn't forget about it within fourteen days. This isn't one of those games that one must "make time for." It isn't so "deep" that it "takes time to get into." It's simply not good.\n\nI stand by my initial review.\n\nReveal the Deep is the first game that I ever felt the need to get a refund for. The game cost me just $0.99, and I still want my money back.\n\nFirst of all, the game fails to provide the player with any contextual information in regard to who they are and what they're doing. Logos, ethos, and pathos are completely ignored; meaning, I am not drawn into Reveal the Deep either logically, ethically, or emotionally. In my 22 minutes with the game, I was given neither concrete nor intuitive information as to what (or why) I'm doing.\n\nMany games are like that. So what?\n\nTo say Reveal the Deep moves at a snail's pace is an understatement. There is zero action to make up for the player's waning interest level. It takes your submariner longer to do things in-game than it takes a real deep-sea explorer to do the same thing in actual water. Switching "views" in your helmet takes at least an entire second; unfortunately, the amount of times one must switch said "view" is too great for the one-second wait to go unnoticed.\n\nHow Reveal the Deep has accumulated a positive rating of 92% is beyond me. If darkness and a handful of underwater sound effects constitute "atmosphere," I suppose a game needs more than atmosphere to be worth owning. Reveal the Deep, in my opinion, isn't worth owning for even the price of a vending-machine snack.","December 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","0"

That's what I mean by linear. I didn't feel like I had to solve the puzzle. I felt like I just had to walk and wait to get to the next area.

From the incredibly dark corridors of a shipwreck, you explore the notes and story of a group of various travelers while on an expedition and discover what occurred.\n\nI was impressed by the shadows in the ship as you moved about, the delay for turning the helmet light on and off always had me holding my breath as the light dims to almost pure blackness, while also waiting for the light to return and expose what, if anything, was lurking in the dark as it was off. Small details like pulling the camera in very closely while exploring small spaces to really exacerbate the claustrophobic feeling really impacted my experience in the entire game.\n\nThe sound was on point, delivering creaks of the ship, whispers and general unnatural noises  that made every step forward a test of courage. Having consistent screen tremors as you explored gave the sense that you were not on safe ground, as if the ship was being swallowed by a creature unseeable by uncorrupt minds.\n\nThe experience is fairly linear with branching paths and shortcuts out becoming available, but there's generally a good indication of where you're supposed to go throughout without the use of a map, which was pretty impressive to me, given that it certainly feels like a game akin to the "Metroidvania" design with its presentation and the entirety of the paths you explore certainly feel long and winding.\n\nA few simple puzzles are in place during the chapters but they weren't difficult to solve as they mostly consisted of pushing blocks into positions, using various means. This is not a bad thing, as the story was the main focus for me and that was very well done, in my opinion.\n\nA few control issues such as getting off ladders sometimes causing simple transitions onto a platform to fail, but this never once caused any kind of progression blocks. While not a real issue considering the length, the lack of saving was noticable in one or two sections of the third chapter, so if you have to stop in the middle of one, just be aware you'll start at the begining of that chapter.\n\nOver all, Reveal the Deep is a short but very sweet gem that, with a price of $0.99, is worth every cent.","March 12","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both work well together to conjure up a mysterious but relaxing atmosphere. Encountered a jump scare in the first 20 minutes. Don't know why but I walked back into it and it happened again. Spooky. Great value for 49 cents (purchased during a sale).\nThe headlight toggle element is very clever and easy to learn. Visuals are very nice to look at.\nI recommend this if you like atmospheric exploration games.\n\nSome suggestions to the developer:I found getting off of the top of some ladders to be very clumsy. Climbing upwards when hitting the top of the ladder should allow me enough height to jump off onto the ground on the other side. On some ladders, reaching the top made me jump a little bit but not enough to get over the ladder, so I found myself having to try repeatedly (playing with keyboard).\nPlease add some sort of snapshot save feature. My first impression of the game is great but it might not be worth starting from the beginning if I didn't end up finishing a chapter.\nIf practical, a game speed slider would be nice as my little diver walks quite slowly.

It offers soft lighting and deep shadows as you slowly wade through a soundtrack of thick underwater burbles. In some places, you can turn off the light on your diving suit to see things on the ship as they once were, leaving you to wonder what eerie connection your character has between the present and the past.\n\nThe story is adequate if not spectacular, helped along by evocative hand-drawn illustrations.\n\nNOTE: There are a couple of puzzles where you have to push a block that's taller than you are into a gap to proceed. However, it's possible for the block to build up so much momentum that it overshoots the gap, leaving the puzzle unsolvable with no choice but to restart the chapter.

It offers soft lighting and deep shadows as you slowly wade through a soundtrack of thick underwater burbles. In some places, you can turn off the light on your diving suit to see things on the ship as they once were, leaving you to wonder what eerie connection your character has between the present and the past.\n\nThe story is adequate if not spectacular, helped along by evocative hand-drawn illustrations.\n\nNOTE: There are a couple of puzzles where you have to push a block that's taller than you are into a gap to proceed. However, it's possible for the block to build up so much momentum that it overshoots the gap, leaving the puzzle unsolvable with no choice but to restart the chapter. So be careful with those.","March 9","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Desgin flaws: Needs a save option and ability to change screen resolution.\n\n\n\nOld complaints, now fixed as of 2015.12.17:\n\nFirst, there are no instructions (unless I am missing something). I initially found only five controls: the four directional arrows, and the spacebar. The spacebar causes your helmet lamp to come on and off, and at times turning it off revealed other sources of illumination. Had I not read the other reviews, I'd have just said "screw this!" and played something else. However, I eventually found that P and the shift-key also cause things to happen.\n\nSecond, evidently there is no ability to remap the keys (I am a WASD man, dammit!).\n\nThird, there is no way to alter the screen size. As I result, I can't actually turn off the game from inside the game, but instead have to CTRL-ALT-TAB out. Nor can I read all the letter I just found to "Dear Alice" dated 1901.\n\nStill, the price wasn't bad. Hopefully the developer reads this and provides a means for selecting the screen resolution.

When I purchased it, it intrigued me a lot about why it cost so little but looked so good? Well, I guess some things in life can be too good to be true, as soon as I started playing it, it was really fun as I was observing the missions and how very featuristic it was. My only minor criticism was that I had to download an additional software to play it as it requires you to do that on a Mac, not too sure about other platforms. Overall 8/10.

When I purchased it, it intrigued me a lot about why it cost so little but looked so good? Well, I guess some things in life can be too good to be true, as soon as I started playing it, it was really fun as I was observing the missions and how very featuristic it was. My only minor criticism was that I had to download an additional software to play it as it requires you to do that on a Mac, not too sure about other platforms. Overall 8/10.

And the sound effects are good:  I love the creaking the hulk makes when you jump up and down. But there are some shortcomings.\n\nAnd the developer seems to have responded to my comments, or the software magically repaired itself. While I currently still get stuck in the bowels of the ship, I will return! Fun little puzzler.\n\n\n2016.05.05: Design Improvements: now has 3 Chapters, which allow you to select where to start in the story. Desgin flaws: Needs a save option and ability to change screen resolution.\n\n\n\nOld complaints, now fixed as of 2015.12.17:\n\nFirst, there are no instructions (unless I am missing something). I initially found only five controls: the four directional arrows, and the spacebar. The spacebar causes your helmet lamp to come on and off, and at times turning it off revealed other sources of illumination. Had I not read the other reviews, I'd have just said "screw this!" and played something else. However, I eventually found that P and the shift-key also cause things to happen.\n\nSecond, evidently there is no ability to remap the keys (I am a WASD man, dammit!).\n\nThird, there is no way to alter the screen size. As I result, I can't actually turn off the game from inside the game, but instead have to CTRL-ALT-TAB out. Nor can I read all the letter I just found to "Dear Alice" dated 1901.\n\nStill, the price wasn't bad. Hopefully the developer reads this and provides a means for selecting the screen resolution. Then I can play more and alter my recommendation.","December 8, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

It manages to capture the idea of  Lovecraftian  horror when other games don't understand the source material. This game did cause me to look over my shoulder in game and in real life when there was an unusual noise or passing by an open door. This horror game utilizes other horror motiffs to achieve their atmosphere instead of jumpscares. There are some genuine startling moments in each chapter.\n\nThere were times the paranoia depleted when I became lost in the maze-like ship. The pacing can suffer if the player becomes lost. My advice to any new player is this:  Keep moving forward. Avoid backtracking as much as possible.\n\nIf this game sounds interesting, then you may enjoy it.

For 99 cents at full price you can't pass it up and if a discount comes along then this is a no-brainer purchase for those that enjoy old school gaming drenched in darker themes.  You play as a nameless diver in the 1900s exploring an old sunken ship.  There's not much in the way of prelude and the game drops you right into the action.\n\nWhile lacking an ending or development for the main character, what story there is unfolds over notes, semi-flashbacks and dialogues that appears when searching your environment.  Right from the getgo it's obvious something bad happened to the ship and soon you'll find that you are not alone.  The atmosphere in this game is fantastic with the sound deserving special mention.  It's not a jumpscare fest but it managed to jolt me a few times quite unexpectedly.  You'll hear the creaks n' booms of the bulkheads with appropriate underwater FX, eerie echoing ambience and the leaden footsteps of your character.  You are truly alone in terms of allies.  Reveal the Deep pulls this aspect off nicely, creating tension within the black spaces.\n\nThis new age of sideview horror adventures has created several graphically unique masterpieces and while Reveal the Deep isn't quite among the best looking, the visuals are well-done.  The sparse, pixelated setting has enough detail in the backgrounds, floors and brooding lower sections of the ship to make it hard to look away even when your pulse is picking up the pace.  Though the main character isn't especially detailed, he's got a certain charm in his minimalism that keeps you concerned for his safety.  You will encounter a few creatures along the way and they too are rather creepy in a less is more fashion that suits them well to the environments and situations.\n\nThe gameplay isn't ground breaking but it's effective with a few neat flourishes sprinkled throughout.  As you explore you'll need to solve puzzles to progress, search thoroughly for bits of backstory and keep your wits about you.  Nothing is too difficult to accomplish yet there's just enough challenge and segments to engage your wits which gives advancement a satisfying feel.  You can crouch, jump, push objects and tap your helmet to turn your lights on and off.  The helmet mechanic was particularly cool because whether your headlamp is on or off changes the way that you view your surroundings and warps the ship from past to present where notes will suddenly appear, the ghosts of the crew and passengers will call out to you and previously inaccessible areas will become accessible.  There are also switches to pull, obstructions that need to be removed by finding glowing orbs and a small smattering of doors that can only be opened with a key.  Also certain platforms will only operate when switching betwixt past/present time tense.  This mixture of exploration, puzzles, platforming and story keeps the game engaging for its short run-time.  A couple of the puzzle situations are slightly obtuse but careful attention to detail should ensure that most players won't need a walkthrough to beat the game.\n\nFinally, you'll have to figure out how to deal with a few of the ship's current denizens who are less than happy with your presence, in addition to dodging some deadly traps.  It probably won't happen often, but you CAN die in Reveal the Deep.  Death doesn't punish your progress too much, though you'll be setback to a predetermined checkpoint.  The game only saves permanently after completing a chapter.  None of them are too lengthy, requiring perhaps a half hour a piece to complete give or take.  I spent 4 hours with the game because I searched every single nook and cranny to uncover the backstory and paused for roughly an hour to take care of some stuff for work.  For the price, the length is just right and I really had alot of fun playing this little game.\n\nThe experience is not without some flaws and some weakpoints in the hull.  While the story is well-revealed throughout, the ending feels like quite a copout and was certainly a letdown.  I didn't expect much for 99 cents but it's surely a head-scratcher in need of some Head and Shoulders.  It's a minor gripe for certain.  The bigger gripe is that the controls can be fluttery and sent me spiraling into a few accidental deaths and oopses.  Jumping works well most of the time, and other times you can't seem to get your character to jump anywhere but straight up as if he's tied to a nice bushel of balloons.  You'll probably have a difficult time wrangling ladders as well and jumping off of them can be an even bigger migraine that the basic platforming.  Still, nothing is purely broken...it can be annoying but shouldn't induce too much foul language.  I've heard of some glitches reported which thankfully I really didn't encounter.  This is a sweet little gem all around...\n\nPros:\n\n-Fun gameplay with a nice mixture of platforming, adventure and puzzling.\n-Great setting, atmosphere and ambience.\n-Superb sound FX.\n-Well-done graphics that suit the game nicely.\n-Story build-up is a nice touch.\n-Horror touches are subtley creepy and implemented with care (a slow burner instead of a jumpscare fest).\n-Diving headlamp and past/present time switches are a unique feature.\n-Great price!\n\nCons:\n\n-Mostly solid controls but certainly on the flighty side (jumping and ladder climbing are a pain).\n-Short.  The game is fun enough that an extra level or two would have been nice.\n-A one and doner.\n-Weak ending.\n-A few slight frame slowdowns experienced in inhabited areas.\n\nOverall:  7.6/10\n\nDespite my criticisms I am very glad that I picked up Reveal the Deep, horror fans that enjoy the side-scrolling revival should absolutely pick this up.  At 99 cents it was more than worth my money and if you can get it on discount then the value is ridiculous.  I'm a sucker for horror games and old school games (being a gamer born in '82); Reveal the Deep combines the best of both worlds.  With a great setting, an entertaining gameplay mix, haunting sound, intriguing sci-fi/horror short story type of atmosphere and just the right length, Reveal the Deep should most certainly please the audience it's aimed at.  I had a lot of fun with this game and it left me wanting more, which is never a bad thing.  In the odd chance that a sequel pops up, I will not hesitate to play it!\n\n\n","April 21","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played 3 hour until now and just got to the chatpter 3 now. I feel dumb...\n\nIt's a OK game, by the way... The exploration is a important thing here, but I don't feel rewarding with what I found or the progression. Next to the end of the game (chapter 3), the story turns more interesting. The control is a little 'heavy' (it's frustrating sometimes), but I think it's because of the suit of the character. Overral, the game reminds me of the good game 'Lone Survivor" (reason that I bought this game). The price is fair by what the game offers.\n\nNOTE (04/09/2016): At the end of the game, it let me pass to an area that doesn't have a way back. This is ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating. The leves are way too big and dark, so you easily get lost and stay hours searching where do you have to go... I don't finish the game because of this and uninstall the game.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nEM PORTUGUÊS PROS AMIGO BRASILEIRO:\n\nTodo mundo termina o jogo com apenas 1~2 horas de gameplay. Estou com 3 horas de jogo já e ainda vou começar o capítulo 3. Me sinto muito burro...\n\nAliás, o jogo é OK... A exploração é algo importante aqui, mas eu não me sinto recompensado com a progressão ou com o que encontro. Perto do final (lá pelo capítulo 3), a história começa a ficar mais interessante. O controle é um pouco 'pesado' (o que é frustrante, as vezes), mas acredito que seja por causa da pesada roupa do personagem. Em geral, o jogo me lembra o bom e velho "Lone Survivor" (motivo pelo qual o comprei). O preço é justo pelo que ele oferece.\n\nNOTA (09/04/2016): No final do jogo, o jogo permitiu que eu progredisse para uma área que não tinha como voltar. Isso é muito frustrante, pois os cenáriso são muito grandes e por serem escuros, são confusos e acontece de as vezes você ficar horas procurando onde tem que ir. Não consegui terminar o jogo por causa disso e desinstalei.","March 28","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took a few minutes to get into the mood but once I did I found it really enjoyable. It's simple "time shift" light mechanic opened up some really interesting gameplay mechanics. At first I didn't get it as there are very few instructions on how to play in the first level (left, right, jump, light on or off and that's about it) but once I did the setting and story drew me in much more. Also, a little side note, I have found that playing this game at night with all the lights off and headphones on to be the best setting. The sound effects and low lighting design makes it ideal for playing late at night. Overall a really fun game, and a really unique one in terms of setting and gameplay. If you can catch it on sale don't hesitate (I think I got it for .50 cents). It’s always great to see small developers pushing the boundaries of what makes a good game. Having said that, this game is not for everyone. It’s not a fast pace ninja game. It is more deliberate at trying to set a mood for the player. Even if it is not typically your cup of tea, give it a shot, you never know, you might love it. :) Enjoy!\n","June 2","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
