Guided by an angel, it's up to you to save Sacra Terra from damnation.\n\nThe plot is really interesting: you're in a dark ambiance, yet, the presence of Angel is the light of the game. The fact that you have to find a way to free the souls that were taken by the Sins is a nice challenge.\n\nIt is also a nice challenge to find your way around, because the map can't be used for fast travel - which can be annoying at the end of the game. The HO scenes are easy as are the puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, when you see the demons's appearance, they're very detailed - you're even kinda attached to them (at least for the firsts you're encountering). The soundtrack is also good.\n\nThe game is neat, the only bug I encountered is in the bonus chapter, well, it wasn't breaking the game as the reset button was working but I skipped the game as I got stuck twice.\n\nWhile there is no achievement, there are trading cards. Achievements would have been nice, as you have to find beyond objects that will unlock all the videos of the game in the main menu.\n\nSacra Terra is a good game, that many of casual gamers will enjoy. Go for it, for the price, you're not robbed at all.","November 24, 2015","true","4.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Not recommended for those who are prone to get bored when nothing is happening in their games.\n\nLong version:Sacra Terra: Angelic Night doesn’t seem bad at first– it’s a quite large hidden object game with over 40 screens (and another 12 in the bonus chapter) of good-looking and detailed art. The hidden object scenes are sometimes a little cheap with item placement, but they also provide a level of difficulty and enjoyment that is rare in today’s HOGs.\n\nEven the story starts great and gets you interested: the unnamed male(!) protagonist wakes up on a hospital bed to find the entire town deserted, only to run into an angel shortly afterwards to learn that he needs to confront the demons of the seven sins.\nSadly, in practise, this means a lot of running back and forth (there is no map) between the starting area and all other places with little to no plot to carry the monotonous tasks. The puzzles make sure we never fall asleep, but this is pretty much as far as the entertainment value goes.","November 15, 2015","true","6.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","6"

The Hidden Objects parts are also good and i didn`t have any problems with them.

If not, thats not for you. :)\n\nBut now i have one ccriticism point, dear developer. I´m missing achievements like in Artifex Mundi games.

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\nThere are two different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual and Expert.\n\nThe notebook has two sections: Map and Journal.\n\nThe journal keep tracks of all story events and clues in the game.\n\nThere are interactive items in the game, they're marked with a symbol, but sometimes these interactive items do require extra items before they can be interact with.\n\nThere's a map in the game but it can be only accessed through the notebook. There's no fast travel in this game at all. But it does shows the individual's current position and tasks that can be done at certain location.\n\nMost of the hidden object scenes consists of traditional word list and shadow items. Some of them do require little or no interaction.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are rather easy to solve without much difficulty. For most of these puzzles there's a reset button. However, there's definitely a skip button, for all of the puzzles. These two features are only present in "Casual" game difficulty mode.\n\nThere are collectibles, they are called beyond objects, but otherwise known as morphing objects. There are forty-two beyond objects scattered throughout the game.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there's a bonus chapter, but it can be unlocked only after the main story of the game's completed. The bonus chapter is the pre-sequel to the main story.\n\nMiscellaneous\nIn the extra section there's some bonus contents: thirteen concept art, a built-in walkthrough, and wallpapers.\n\nThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam’s Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it’s Booster Pack Creator. Badge can be crafted and upgraded with these trading cards. This feature is only available for Steam’s version of this game.\n\nFinal thoughts, I definitely enjoying playing this game all the way through to the end. However, there's one thing that would make traveling less tedious is having an map that fast travel ability. As for the replay value I would say it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.","November 12, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The best element of the game is the story/atmosphere which is significantly better than the norm for the genre.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the point and click part of the game is relatively decent and mostly logical, with a map with hints of everywhere you can do anything, and an active hint system beyond that if you need more help - the puzzle minigames are all easy - I skipped one, where you need to know the order of astrological systems as I couldn't be bothered to look it up, but the puzzle is just swapping the symbols over, there is no complexity or thought needed, as with most of the other puzzles.\n\nSo overall this is a fairly easy one to recommend, just don't expect a challenge, just an easy ride through a somewhat decent mildly scary story.","October 31, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And the story is just bland and boring.\nThere are so many hidden-object games better than this.","March 19","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a fan of creepy sanitariums and asylums, so this is right up my alley. Like all HOGs, the length of time that it takes to play only adds up to around 4-5 hours, but the storyline is very gripping. This last time I played, thanks to Steam, I went straight through the main game without stopping, realizing that I was getting close to bedtime :P\nI don't tend to listen to the music so much, there's too much background noise going on in the house to worry about it. And there's no voice acting to worry about, which sometimes can be a bad thing if you're looking for more realism. However, the graphics are terrific. Also, the map shows you where to go to do things, but it doesn't have an auto feature to take you where you need to go next.","February 9","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very cathartic to play even if some of the 'treasure hunt' scenes can leave you a bit frustrated for a moment or two. Also, this game really ages you; if you don't use the hint button you might not know what some of those old objects are. That said, I found the puzzles were very creative and intuitive. It made me feel like a genius.\n\nThe ending leaves something to be desired, the build up was great but the ending fell flat like a runner getting a shoe hooked in a tree root.\nI will end on a positive note however, I did find the bonus chapter to be charming and quite enjoyed that story tie-in!","March 25","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A doctor messes around with demonic forces and causes the downfall of a hospital, and thus it becomes your duty to vanquish the demons as you are the only one capable of it.\n\nPros:\n-Interesting Storyline\n-Artwork is fairly decent\n-Easy to complete and does not require much effort, thus perfect for the casual gamer\n-Cheap considering the content\n\nCons:\n-Becomes repetitive too quickly\n-Does not draw you in as the player\n\nOverall, this is one of few point-and-click games that I enjoyed, worth picking up on a sale.\n\n7/10","April 15","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the atmosphere is produced by crying children and desperatly screaming and yelling people... It works on a subliminal level.\n\nPlayability: ++ The accessibility of the game and the areas is good, the riddles (minigames) and the Scenes are well done and there wasn't much need of using the hint system during the game.\n\nGenre Type Values:\n\nStory: ++ The story is plain and direct, you are in a strange dilapidated hospital, you are freed by a strange entity going by the name "Angel" and being one too, so far so good, but then you have to solve riddles to destroy each one of the seven sins, by using their own indulgence. I won't tell too much, it's just spoiling you the fun. It sounds harder than it is, and you actually will find the answers spread through the game. Especially nice is the descriptions in the journal, and the cut-scenes of the game.\n\nTechnical Realisation: ++ The whole game is a smooth experience, even when you quit the game and play later, you are easy in and out the game. The story was nicely realized, the graphics are atmospheric and fitting, the sound lends to the sinister and dreadful atmosphere. Not one bug sprang up during gameplay, and there were no lags, no crashes encountered. It worked like a charm, even the cutscenes were fluently executed.\n\nExtras: ++ The game has a bonus chapter, wallpapers, a walkthrough (not needed, but nice to have) and art prototypes of the game. In all alone the bonus chapter is a nicely done upgrade to the story (plays before the events of the main game), the wallpapers might not be up to modern standarts but they are just what one might look for.\n\nOverall: 10 + The game is a good example how a game is well executed and can, though it's quite short be entertaining and satisfying. Given it's a HOG, but this Hog really is one of the good ones.\n\nValue for Money: Very Good. 2,99 Bucks At this price you can't do anything wrong. It's a good Hidden Object Game, and it's entertaining for some hours. It offers some suspense and satisfaction, although the replayabilityt is next to zero.\n\nRecommended\nIf you are looking for some fast and relaxing fun in a game, or if you are looking for a good example to try out Hidden Object games, this one might be the right one for you. It's inexpensive, it's actually having a story that doesn't come all too cheesy, and it's working perfectly like a charm. The length of the game might dissappoint you and like in any other HOG there are no multiple endings to try out. But you can't be too choosy with a small budget, and for the given price it's really good... even better on sale or with a voucher, bundle...","April 21","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
