My personal policy is that if a game has been around forever, and thusly no one or their dog is going to read my review anyway, I may as well wait until I've fully completed and/or officially given up on the game before posting my review.  But when the game is brand-spanking-new, well...look how many reviews there are for this game already, and it hasn't even been on sale for twenty-four hours yet.\n\nHopefully a few of you out there will be able to at least acknowledge that my review is liable to be one of the more, er, let us be kind and say "mature" ones that is liable to crop up.  Hell, I think I've ALREADY beaten the average word count for a review on Steam, haven't I?  And hopefully spelled all words correctly, in something at least resembling English.  So with no further ado, let's attempt a review on the basis of what little I've played thus far.\n\nFirstly, for all of you "casual" horror gamers, who are looking for the next Five Nights at Freddy's and/or a horror game without too much story, but with at least a hint of "mythology" just waiting to be uncovered, THIS IS HEARTILY RECOMMENDED TO YOU.  It's "spoopy" (whatever that means), atmospheric, and has it's fair share of jump scares.  Y'know, the whole "creepypasta" thing (again, whatever that is).  It's also a time-based game in which you have to "survive until 6am", during each hour of which your basic aim is to keep heading towards wherever you think an unlit candle may be waiting, so that you can transfer the flame from your current candle before the wax melts down and all hell breaks loose.  So it's essentially a keep-moving-or-else, race-against-time suspense game, and a very well-done one at that.\n\nSecondly, and oh boy oh boy, is it UNFORGIVING.  I mean HARD.  I mean, STUPIDLY ♥♥♥♥ING HARD.  As in, with the thirty-five-odd minutes I already have up my sleeve, I'm yet to even get to 1am.  But that's alright...I know all you Freddy fanatics will be fine with this, as that seems to be one of the criteria you people are looking for.  Me, I'm one of those older-school people who can take or leave the whole "hardcore" gaming thing, and am quite happy for a game to merely be a CHALLENGE.  Put it this way: I've played "Outlast" on the second-hardest difficulty, but I really don't feel compelled to ever conquer the "insane" mode; nor did I bother seeing the "Justine" mini-game in Amnesia all the way through; nor am I ever liable to escape from the boat in Monstrum one single, solitary ♥♥♥♥ing time!  BUT...if you're the kind of person who likes that kind of uber-challenge, and doesn't mind playing for ten or twenty minutes straight just to be insta-killed and go all the way back to the beginning of a game, or at least substantially-sized level therein...then, yes, HEARTILY RECOMMENDED.\n\nIt's certainly good, and definitely seems to achieve what it set out to achieve.  Me, I'm kinda doubting that I'll be seeing it through to its conclusion, but for many of you this may well be your "game of the year" or something.  It's certainly better than the recently-released Emily Wants to Play, and probably on a par with the also-recent Boogeyman (and let's not even mention crap like 1 2 3 Slaughter Me Street).  Despite the meagre time I've put into this thus far, I'm kind of suspecting I've already seen most of the tricks it's liable to have up its sleeve - as is the case with ALL such games, in my experience - but chances are you've worked out already whether this is the game for you or not.  If you're prepared to die, over and over and over again, and redo the same, basically very similar levels over and over and over again, you'll be fine.  It doesn't even pull punches for the first level or two like the Freddy's games do...it's just hard from the get-go, and you'll probably get your first achievement (for dying) in no time!  But it IS highly competent, of its type, and is bound to be a hit with the audience it's clearly intended for.\n\nNow bring on the barrage of reviews which consist of one sentence, barely one word in coherent English, and an 87% "helpful" rating.  But hey, that's okay...I live in a nice, multi-storey flat with lots of very solid brick walls, so I'll still have something to do once my own review's approval rating drops below 50% for having, y'know, WORDS 'n' stuff in it.\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.","December 17, 2015","true","3.3"," 135 of 174 people (78%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","78","135","174","43","23"

The story is Mind numbing and keeps you wanting more. Collecting papers with nothing but a candle brings a slender esc vibe and gives you chills with the eery darkness and the terrifying sounds of the night. The “stay alive to 6 am” factor is also a bit five nights at freddy’s like but it’s still an interesting factor for the game as it brings new information for the story each hour you survive. And you can continue after each hour.\n\nPros & Cons ++  Pros\n-The fear factor\n-Always Eager to keep playing\n-Controller support\n-Good graphics\n-Great Concept\n-Original Story\n-Collectables\n\n-- Cons\n-Single player only\n-Repetitive mechanics\n-Cost (12.99 USD)\n-Short Game\n-Sometimes it’s hard to see\n\nSummary This game is a all around good horror game. The idea of the children in the forest and the story that you’re friends tell you about it before they drop you off in the forest is quite interesting. The more you play the game the more you learn about the story and the origin of the children. The masks are nightmare inducing and perfect at the same time. There are multiple strategies much like any other game in order to survive the night. I personally love this game and love the story behind it. It’s very unique and ominous.\n\nFinal recommendation:\nI would give this game an overall of 7.5/10\n\n\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here!\nThank you Expired Goat","February 23","true","3.8"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","41","44","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/squaredsumo/recommended/418300/","squaredsumo","SquaredSumo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/squaredsumo/","600 products in account","(THIS IS A REVIEW IN PROGRESS) - Updated 12/21/2015\n\nWIck is yet another first person horror game that drops some doomed individual out in the middle of nowhere and expects them to survive the night while collecting various objects. In Wick's case, you play some poor fool as your "friends" leave you in the middle of the woods to survive until 6:00AM while uncovering various clues to the story behind the children haunting the woods with nothing but the flickering light of a candle to guide and protect you.\n\nPersonally, I am not a fan of what I have played so far. There are way too many jumpscares for starters. Every other step seems to lead into a child flashing on the screen for a second or two and gets old fast, as do all the monsters in the game. Never found myself scared because of how frequently they deliver everything. There is no moment to just take everything in and get sucked into the atmosphere. Instead, I just find myself getting annoyed by the frequency of the monster attacks.\n\nGameplay is also very basic for Wick. You find clues to uncover more of the story, try to stay alive by finding candles to light with your limited matches, and avoid the various monsters lurking in the shadows. Each night adds new monsters with various ways to murder your face. To protect yourself you need to constantly move and find new candles to light. You can transfer light from candle to candle to save your matches and you can find candles themselves by looking for their shine in the distance. Nothing really to write home about with the gameplay. They could make the shine from the candles happen more frequently and for longer. Find it way too easy to lose track of them with all the children spawning in every direction. Gets especially hard on later hours.\n\nIt's also very easy to die by either getting sucked into an animation from 40 yards away or by getting teleported directly into an instadeath when you are trying to find a candle. I'll just assume I'm just being terrible at the game, but I thought it worth mentioning all the same. Still, it really does feel like the difficulty spikes to an insane degree very fast. I've managed to get to 4AM at the time of writing and it just keeps at it with the odd difficulty spikes. You'll probably get the hang of it eventually. However, it doesn't make it anymore fun.\n\nThis is a game that tries to be a hybrid of FNAF and Slender and I don't know how well it does that. Overall, I can't honestly say anyone should buy it. You might find some cheap terror if you spend brief moments playing, but nothing worth writing home about. By the time you get a good grasp of the gameplay, everything becomes tedious and loses any and all traces of it being scary. Not currently my cup of tea.\n\n[UPDATE 12/21/2015]\n\nI have currently spent around 8 hours with the game in total at this point and wanted to post an update for those curious. The game's difficulty is still very unrelenting. Some people might enjoy it. I have no idea. Personally, I find it ramps up way too much and way too quick. Whatever horror elements or atmpshere you could take from the game are ruined by having to mechanically learn the patterns of each individual child in order to avoid dying. Hear something snoring? Better either run or drop your candle. See the kids spawn at your feet? Better look at the ground and not move. Screen get a red blur? Better make sure the little girl in the bunny suit doesn't kill you. I found myself more worried about patterns than learning about the story and letting the atmosphere sink in. I have yet to either bother trying to find collectibles for 4AM onward, because the game is just so chaotic. Perhaps the game isn't for me. I'm a big horror fan, but this game just doesn't set right with me.\n\nCurrent Rating\n\n6/10\nAverage.\n\nSome gameplay if you care\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwysbmQ-_p4\n\n\n[UPDATE]\nAlso found a hilariously frequent glitch that happens on the bus. If the child spawns on the outside and you view it from the door, it can't kill you and the game's clock won't progess the night. Fun.\n\n\nPro\n- Music is decently done.\n- Visually appealing\n- Might Be scary to some players.\n\n\nCon\n\n- Not very fun\n- Way too easy to get insta-killed\n- Way too easy to get turned around\n- Children/Monsters are not scary, nor do they look scary\n- Way too many jump scares\n- Cheap enemies: Spwaning at feet while walking and instantly dying or teleporting you mid    candle pick-up","December 17, 2015","false","7.9"," 133 of 196 people (68%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","68","133","196","10","9"

I saw quite a few YouTubers playing it, and finished a whole gameplay in one day. I was estatic, especially at the end. I was legit freaking out, and excited. I wanted to know more, and I defintely wanted the game for myself.\n\nPROS-\n\n-Amazing story. It's still confusing, with not all the pieces put together, but it's unique. I love games that leave you with so many questions at the end. I'm excited to contribute my theories and ideas to this community, and I hope this community thrives.\n\n-Graphics! My my, one of my favorite things about this game. I studied how the trees moved, the fog moved, the hand motions the player made. They're all amazing! The fog can be a bit buggy, and the trees can look funny, but there is NOTHING that makes it unenjoyable. Everything looks real, and clean, and fantastic. There are a few things out there, such as vines that aren't 3D, but they still have shadow to them, which makes it almost unnoticable. My favorite part, however, is how your hand moves in front of the candle to shield it from wind, how the candle flame flickers and moves, and how smooth the animations are. Everything is fantastic, like I said before. Good job. I hope you people keep making games!\n\n-Game in general! Now, I love a good scare. This game really did deliver; I knew the popups were coming but they got me every time! Talk about embarrassing. Wandering around in the forest at night has always been a fear of mine, and the fog topped it off. The forest idea wasn't very original, there are lots of horror games taking place in the forest. But that's no big deal, I personally love forest-based games. The candle idea was very interesting, too. I love how you move around and pick up candles, and they run out as time goes on. I know some people think of Wick as a Slender and FNAF mix, with the pages, and the "survive each hour/night" mechanic. But really, this game is so unique and beautiful that I don't mind at all. It's not exactly like any other game, and that's perfect.\nReally, though... The scare factor isn't everything. To me, what makes a good game is story, especially a horror game. This game has a great story, hard to piece together, but still fun nonetheless. So really, GREAT job!\n\nCONS\n\n-Do I dare put something as silly as this here? THE FENCE. What are you talking about, what fence? The one you are dropped off at in the beginning. Looking at it, you could climb over it if you were desperate enough. But look! Barbed wire, and there's also the possiblity of electrical, shocking wire. I know a lot of people are picky with their games, and something like a short fence would really set someone off. Not me! That fence barely bothers me, and I put this in the CONS just to alert anyone about such a factor. But something as simple as a climbable fence will NOT take away the thrill of the game.\n\n-Few bugs. I've encountered several, from Tim doing some funky little dance-run in front of me, to Lillian teleporting me on the wrong hours. I'm not sure if the teleportation thing is a glitch, or if it's meant to happen, going back on the first hour, but it doesn't bother me. What happened was only me getting up to the 3rd hour, and then going back to find Tim's blade in the first. I was teleported and heard Lillian's giggles, but it wasn't that much of a problem. And actually, Tim doing that little dance was just plain funny! I'd pay to see that again.\n\nAlright, I could waste your time and think of more PROS and CONS to put, but I won't. You can decide if this game is for you. It was for me; I watched an entire gameplay and still bought it to play it for myself! Definetly recommended, although this game may not be for some.\n\nGraphics are great, story is great, models are great, and little kids are freaky!\n\nI hope my review was helpful, though it may not be perfect.\n\n9.1/10","January 18","true","18.1"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","21","21","3","1"

On top of being a scary game, it was hard too!\n\nThe core strategy is to learn the way the kids behave. I know that sounds obvious, but this game is much more than just a simple jump-scare walk em up. Despite the fact the gameplay mechanics are simple, they are simple in the good way. You have limited mechanics, but you need to master those mechanics to survive the children's increasingly complex attacks.\n\nTips [WARNING! :  SPOILERISH]\n\n1. The kid you can't look at (Tom, I think) can be avoided by looking at the sky or the ground. That's what I did the first time, because I knew I wasn't supposed to look at him. It worked! This technique works for the crazy attack when he clones and surrounds you too. This works great...except when you are being tag teamed by one of the other kids, and you need to keep moving. If that's the case, you need to be brave! and just keep moving that mouse to look away from him until he decides to check on his time share and stops spooking you.\n\n2. I think keeping a candle lit makes the night go by faster. I'm not sure. I was using a timer (it helped me keep sane when I was waiting for the night to just end!) and I found that the night seemed to go faster if I was regularly keeping a candle lit. I'm not sure though, so don't worry on that tip too much.\n\n3. Pay attention to those sound cues. They let you know the approximate direction where a kid is coming from and what kind of attack you can expect.\n\n4. When you get the map (you find it in the evidence you get from the...2nd night I believe), take a picture of it with your cell camera. You then have a map of the forest you can refer to. Really helpful when you're trying to find all the artifacts. That's how I found them all!\n\n5. Artifacts are found at landmarks. That's much appreciated. If they were just scattered around the map, that would have been trying. But, just check out the major landmarks (or around them) and you will find all the artifacts.\n\n6. The ending I'm talking about below is...well...just use tip #5.\n\nTo the Developers :\n\nThe hint system is helpful. I would just add some more hints along the lines of what I included in my tips above. This is a good game, but, imo, the kind of short game that you want to push through in 2 or 3 days, while the scares are still fresh, and you're still invested in the story. Especially when a player keeps dying on the same night. It's good to be challenged, but challenge can turn to frustration and then just moving on unsatisfied. I would give a really juicy hint to a player if they have died around 5...maybe 7 times on the same night.\n\nConclusion :\n\nI won't spoil the ending, but let's just say that I really like the way the game ended. I think the ending is in keeping with the trend that is occurring in the best examples of our entertainment media. For certain we encounter many things during this life that are horrible and terrifying, but there is always a deeper truth to uncover if we just look hard enough, and that truth always reveals there is more to the terrible parts of life than just the terror. There is the truth of being a person.\n\nThis was a surprising little game! Genuinely scary, but not grotesque or repellent in the type of scares it elicits. The game seems simple, but there is a deceptive amount of depth to it. The game had only 1 tiny bug that I found (a candle fell through the bus so I couldn't get to it). The frame rate held solid the whole game despite the fact I only have a 512 mb graphics card. The graphics are good, especially the lighting. The sound work is very good, essential to a scary game, and I became as alert as a squirrel listening for an owl.  And, most important to me personally, the story is eerie and interesting. I still am not totally sure what happened, but I think I'll put the final pieces together in my head over the next little while.\n\nIf you think you'll like a spooky, well-made little game with a good story, grab a match and light Wick!\n\n====\n\nOriginal Review\n\nThis is a fun, creepy game. I voted for the game on Steam Greenlight, and am not disappointed! First, you should be aware that the game is not easy. I thought it was going to be a lot like Slender, but it has deeper gameplay than that. You need to learn the behavioral patterns of the children to be able to successfully avoid them (tip : pay attention to the clues nailed to trees with the eerie drawings on them). I thought the game would be boring with only one environment to explore, but the game makes good use of the small amount of real estate by throwing in regular surprises (new children to avoid, plenty of spooky easter eggs, new sound cues to be aware of, etc.) I think the game is priced well for the content. As I said, in my original comment on the Steam Greenlight, I am happy that there is a story to unlock. It helps to keep me invested in the game and will help push me forward to the end. I'll update when I finish the game. [And : I think the actor for Lee Everett from Walking Dead did one of the voiceovers for the pieces of evidence. At least, it sounds a lot like him!]","December 26, 2015","true","5.2"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","26","31","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markofthedead/recommended/418300/","markofthedead","Markness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markofthedead/","135 products in account","Wick is a survival-horror game based off of ghost stories that revolve around what seems like a small town. You are placed in a forest with ghost stories in mind and are told that you need to survive the night (from midnight to 6AM to be precise).\n\nFirstly..\n\nControls: The controls on the game are pretty standard, you move around with WASD, and you use your mouse to look around. The control bindings are very standard and no one should be having an issue with this, pretty easy to get a good score for this. Everything moves around pretty smoothly, however, I believe that those with a computer that is not current gen will be experiencing some issues... And on to the next point.\n\nGraphics/Smoothness: Graphics are pretty good for a 10 dollar game. However, I was experiencing a little bit of graphical lag after recording, none actually experienced in game though. So this goes to give you a slight warning, those of you without a good computer may be slogging when you play this game unless you really tone down the game.\n\nGameplay/Bugs: The game itself so far is fun. Similar premise to other games that the developer has been inspired by (FNAF, Slender, Amnesia,etc.), but the game itself is original. It plays quite well and is fun. I have yet to encounter any bugs or have read about any, so it seems good for that so far. Keep in mind though.. this game is really difficult and not for someone who cannot handle playing between 5-10 minutes and then failing. The rounds become progressively longer and more enemies are added. You need to understand the mechanics behind the fights to really understand this game well. Even then, you may get insta-gibbed by bad spawns (I'm looking at you tree-guy/guy who charges you.. the tree-guy requires you to look away, and basically not move, whereas the charger wants you to keep moving.. therefore resulting in an insta-gib if they spawn on each other).\n\nThe question now is whether or not it is worth 10 bucks which brings us on to the next point..\n\nValue: The game is currently 10 bucks on steam. Do you think it is worth it? For 10 bucks you could go and see a movie I suppose, or make a trip to McDonalds. If you keep that in mind, then the game itself is worth it. But with my 1$/HR calculations this would mean I would have to get 10 hours of gameplay out of the game. I think I will be able to get my 10 hours worth of gameplay out of it since I am an achievement hunter. Therefore I am bumping up the score. It really is getting value in for me, for those of you who don't care about completing it and just want to push through ONLY, then it may only take you 4-5 hours MAX. For someone like me who likes to go back and try to find things/do achievments then it is well worth it!\n\nSo here is my score:\n\n8.5/10 ( 2.5 out of 2.5 controls, 1.5 out of 2.5 graphics/smoothness, 2.0 out of 2.5 gameplay/bugs, 2.5 out of 2.5 for value)\n\nMarkness recommends the game for horror fans. And definitely recommends it if it is on sale (like now). Those of you who are on the fence may want to wait it out though, because I can imagine the price going down around.. Christmas or any of the other seasonal holidays. Also, it takes a lot of patience it seems (I am on 4AM to 5AM which I think is the last night.. ? And things are quite difficult). This means that the game is considerably harder than the other sorts of games that you need to survive. It is not for the faint of heart.. for people similar to me though, who enjoy pulling out their hair trying to beat it, you will definitely enjoy this game!\n\nNote to developer: Work on the spawns. There are combinations that you cannot beat. For example the guy who comes in from underground who you are supposed to run away from, and then you get the guy who spawns by trees who you cannot run away from. What the hell are you supposed to do when that combination is near you? Also, getting insta-gibbed by spawns when there is no way you can see them. For example, lighting up a candle in the bus and walking out and dying. Or the fat guy on the other side of a rock that you cannot see (just kind of hear), and before you know it, it is too late. The game is tough, but some things need to be improved so that you don't feel like you have been cheated. It is not fair to understand the mechanics/do everything perfectly and then you die to something that is not intended to take you out. This needs to be fixed. Other than that, the game is solid.\n\n\nAlso, if you want to see how the first 15 minutes of the game go then take a look:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c12shrmn6k","December 20, 2015","true","10.0"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","4"

The idea being to survive the night alone!!\n\nCryptic drawings and relics from the past (3 for each hour of the night, midnight through 5:00 AM) vaguely hint at the strange goings-on of what really happened to the missing children and of the semblance of the ghosts that you'll encounter in your quest for survival.\n\nGreat, mist-enshrouded graphics with exceptional use of lighting and sound make Wick a truly unique and harrowing experience.

It does share a few similarities, mainly trying to find items in the dark while being taunted by creatures), but what Wick does is done well. You’re limited in your resources, the enemies are terrifying, the story is good, and it is quite an intense game. It’s also similar in style to Five Nights at Freddy’s, where you’re tasked with surviving, but instead of surviving several hours each night, each “chapter” is one hour long, and you must survive from midnight until six in the morning.\n\nYour only resource are matches and candles. Your matches won’t last long at all, requiring you to find candles for light. Candles will eventually burn down, and you’ll be on the hunt for other candles. With only six matches available, you’ll need to make strategic use of your time and finding candles, as the enemies are far more difficult in the dark.\n\nLastly, yes, there are jumpscares, and yes, there are a few of them, but they serve a genuine purpose instead of being PewDiePie bait.\n\nProsGood story with an interesting premise, and I’m upset I never thought about the game you play in this game when I was a kid\nThe children, who are after you, are quite scary and have fun methods of sneaking up on you and also how to be avoided\nGraphics are good for what’s there; the entirety of the game takes place in a forest with only a few structures, so there isn’t really much to it, but the fog and draw distance really render you on the edge\nSound and music are both excellent; you’ll hear footsteps to your right, only to glance but see nobody, and the music crescendos and diminuendo at just the right times\nInteresting backstory as told through the items you collect and the evidence that’s unlocked as you survive each hour\nEach hour gets subsequently harder; instead of dealing with one, fairly easy enemy at midnight, you’ll eventually wind up contending with all of the children at onceConsOverly short; unless you miss some collectibles, there’s no reason to play through the chapters again\nThe forest is static, so while your spawn changes, the environment doesn’t, and it’ll eventually become easy figure out where you are in relation to the few structures\nDifficulty seems hit and miss, and the game can occasionally be unfair, when it chooses to spawn three or at once, having you run from one enemy into the waiting arms of another, because they’ve surrounded you seemingly out of nowhereSummaryWick is definitely a worthwhile game. If you’re easily taken aback by jumpscares, you’ll be jumping a lot. Aside from that, it’s a genuinely fun horror game with an interesting element that makes it even harder. You can’t go wrong, whether at full price or a discount.","January 13","true","3.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

It was better then most horror games out there and it needs more attention. Wick had me on my toes figuring out and trying to avoid the enemies. Let me explain more here!\n\nStory: The game had a good background story once you attempt to dig deep enough. The story at the moment is you play as a young teenager (Sam) who is taken to the woods by his friends and left there until he has survived the game Wick. You must avoid the enemies as much as possible and not get caught. The "ending" to the game will shock you to the core! It has an amazing background story and the evidence you find in the game really helps you figure out a lot of details. The events are also helpful to figure out the game. And the new DLC got us way deeper into figuring it all out.\n\nGameplay: In this game it is styled to be a normal first person horror survival. You must walk around the entire map in order to avoid the enemies and collect items. Once the enemy has found you, you have no choice but to run away. Every enemy has its own special abilities that you must firgure out how to avoid. The game is smooth and nice and I thought the gameplay wasn't original but it was made much better then any other horror game.\n\nArt: The art is really good (except for me I had to lower the graphics). The enviroment was creepy and dull and that was one of the reasons why I really loved the game. The enemies are really well designed and they don't look bad at all. However if you brighten up the gamma the game doesn't look good. Keep the gamma low for the best gameplay!\n\nMusic and sounds: OMG the atmosphere has to be one of the best things in the game. The sudden footsteps behind you. The noises of the background and the sudden tense music that can really give you goosebumps. Every noise you heard was unsettling and unwelcome. The music for the game was great. The Chase themes are well made and it suited the enemy. The music itself was nicely made but there is only one theme... Hope they release the free soundtrack.\n\nPros and cons\nPros\n- Enemies were fair and balanced\n- Ambience and music\n- Artstyle\n- Player death animations (YES)\n- The hour are not to long compared to FnaF\n- Unsettling game events\n- Wonderful lore\n- Free DLC\nCons\n- Game is to short\n- OMG WHERE THE HELL ARE THE CANDLES!\n- Cheap jumpscares when exploring (Troll)\n\nEither way the game was worth the money so if you are a huge horror fan then play this now! You won't regret it!","May 23","true","15.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","1"

An intersting game with collectibles all while avoiding an urban legend/creepypasta. The story and background lore is fantastic, and the characters are pretty diverse and well made. Each one looks crazy as hell and has it's own unique way to avoid it. The game helps you find other candles and continue the night all while not being too obtrusive and clunky on the screen.\n\nAs it's own solo urban legend it actually sounds like a really intersting attraction that could be pulled off as well. I will admit there are a few times that had me kind of raging cuz of some cheap deaths, but some of them were also my fault. The game is very fair and you can generally get around the enemies easily if you know what you're doing. That doesn't mean you're safe though.\n\nIf you're looking for a fantastic horror game to play with good lore, and fun mechanics I highly recommend Wick. The easter eggs, and jokes in the DLC alone make it worth it. If you decide to play I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.","May 21","true","18.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Well become a victum of the game wick and you will soon realize what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are.\n\nWhat is wick? Aparrently the game is an old camp game where friends would take a kid blindfolded into the forrest and leave them there at midnight where they have to find multiple candles to give them some light and comfort in the dark and scary forrest. Legend has it that there are the spirits of dead kids roaming about the forrest at midnight, so stay in the light and don't let the little buggars getcha.\n\nQ: IS THIS GAME SCARY?\nA: This game is scary and at the same time it isn't (let me explain)\n\nPros:\n-there are 6 hours total that you have to survive, midnight -6am.\n-There are multiple demonic little kids roaming about in the dark waiting to grab you\n- Atmosphere is just great, the graphics quality is really good and the setting is just chilling.\n- There are plenty of candles, you can see them with a little flicker off in the distance, just remember that and follow it.\n- There are jump scares and they are good, but they are common like most games\nFor Example: they will show the 1st kid run in front of your face (it isn't really scary), then they will show him drop out of a tree in front of you (that is when the chasing begins and it isn't scary at all) But either almost always at the beginning or mid-end of the hour they will flash infront of you causing no harm (But HOLY ♥♥♥♥ is it SCARY! but very common in almost every game)\n- If your candle runs out you have a match but that match gives off less light, if you are mainly in the dark with no light your true fear begins to take hold of you. You camera will start to halucinate and you will hear a lot of noises from the evil spirits. I am not sure if after some due time the spirits get you or if you just have to keep running and can't see very well but i can tell you that you need to find a candle fast (don't use all your matches, you only have so many)\n\nCons:\n-It is almost garranteed that you will die within the first hour when you first play\n-The finishing moves that the kids do on you seem rather lame\n- Don't go into a building or a bus you will die almost all the time\n-The game can be rather short at times and rather long at others\n-The map is always the same, small forest area, and it is kind of a pain, you would expect at least another map/ area\n- this game may seem a bit hard and a bit frustrating and lacking at times, and you may want to get a refund (trust me i thought about it) but than i thought hey keep playing try to beat it and see what else it has to offer. This game is fun and it is worth the time.\n\nNow would i say this game is worth $ 10, no i would not say it's more like a $5 game. it is a fun game but it is just the same stuff over and over nothing really new. but it is expected of a horror game that is somwhat similar to slenderman.\nIf it is on sale definately get it.\n\nMy version of a 1 - 10 Scale\n10 - "Worth every penny, I ♥♥♥♥ myself multiple time and will gladly ♥♥♥♥ myself again playing this game"\n9 - "Worth the money, excellent game and good scares (nightmare may come)"\n8 - "Still worth the money, decent scares"\n7 - "Great game just lacking a little but still worth the money hoping that there will be more to come"\n6 - "Not bad"\n5 - "Meh"\n4 - "Come on this is not scary"\n3 - "The most common jumpscare pasted into the game"\n2 - "Don't even bother"\n1 - "I would like to exchange this game for any other peice of ♥♥♥♥ better than this"\n\nI WOULD RATE THIS GAME A "7"\nA+ for the effort and graphics but I am hoping that the team behind this game will take the time and develope this game even further to have a long lasting effect on the players.\nStill haven't beaten the game, just need to reach 2 am :/ i know i talked a lot for just the beginning but i am glad i purchased this Game.\n\nI might update this review in the future but please do take a look at this game.","March 31","true","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You play as a girl who's been left in the woods by her friends to play a game called "Wick" in which you have to survive the woods until 6am. Along with the eerie environment, what I really like are the clues that you pick up. Yes, you're thinking "this is exactly like Slenderman!" but it's not. There's a story to this game that relies heavily on police reports that you can view in the main menu and all the clues that you can pick up in each level. Sure you can play each level by just staying alive and nothing more, but the real fun is finding out what happened in these woods and why these kids are here. The gameplay is easy to pick up, basic movements from the "wasd" controls and "E" and "F" as interactions and the creep factor is pretty good, such as the jumpscares aren't too excesive or too little.

The design of the monsters is slightly disappointing. On certain levels the enemies appear TOO much so it can stressful. Even some of the early levels are long, one felt like it was 20 MINUTES!

The craze of indie micro-budget chasing simulators has grown stale, the market too saturated for even quality titles to stand out. Despite my distaste for Slender‘s lack of gameplay and YouTube-bait scares, I can appreciate it for being a fun little title made by fans with more enthusiasm than game design experience.\n\nIt spawned a genre, but Slender‘s style lacks legs. You can debate about the respective spookiness of whichever specter or boogyman is chasing you through this week’s forest/abandoned park/haunted house. As far as gameplay goes, it’s not terribly hard to replicate “walk around and hunt for items while being spooked.” Improving on this formula is simple, as any interaction and/or variety is new.\n\nWick is Hellbent game’s most recent attempt to evolve the genre. Normally, I wouldn’t have interest in such a title. There are countless new Slender permutation every year, and I can’t go through them all for sake of my time and sanity. They tend to be games I play when I have absolutely nothing else to do, and fall to the farthest back burner on my to-do list.\n\nStill, I’m nothing if not a hopeful, cheery gamer, and every once in awhile one of these titles catches my eye. For reason’s I can’t quite pinpoint, the Steam page for Wick proved such an occasion. Maybe it was the slightly more cartoonish art style? Hell, it’s likely that I was just overcome with holiday cheer/dead time boredom. Whatever the reasons may be, I decided to go into Wick without the usual cynicism I have for Slender-likes. Yes, the Slender clone is a tired genre, but I can’t exactly hold that over every similar title’s head forever, can I? At some point, shooters had to stop being considered all Doom clones.\n\nWick goes for a minimalist approach to direction. Dropping into the game, you play a nameless blindfolded teen being led to the area where you will play a game called “Wick”. It’s a permutation of the teenage game where friends go into the woods, leave a friend behind with only a single light source, and retrieve them in the morning. Presumably, spooks of some kind or another occur in the interim. I refer to this as a “plot device” game, since no person I know has ever felt the need to willingly get lost in the woods and ♥♥♥♥ with ghosts. Maybe people were more desperate for entertainment before the invention of the computer.\n\nOf course, just standing there and waiting for the morning would make for a boring game. Your only light source at the start is a set of matches, but candles spread throughout the forest serve as more lasting illumination. Light can be transferred from candle to candle, and distant candles can be seen as sparkling dots on the horizon. It isn’t terribly hard to keep yourself perpetually lit, so it serves more as a trail to keep you on track to interesting landmarks than a real restriction. Personally, I kind of like this. Resource management definitely has a place in horror, but the more narrative style of Wick lends itself well to this less stressful approach.\n\nRunning out of light is suitably dangerous and spooky, spawning all sorts of terrible noises and making you a target for the various fiends. That’s not to say that you are perfectly safe in the light. Certain triggers will cause more persistent enemies to spawn, which must be fled from to survive. As the night goes on, different enemies will pursue you, each with their visual style and method of assault. The variety it offers is refreshing, and while we don’t see anything truly revolutionary, it’s enough to require you to mix up your play style and learn through trial and error.\n\nThe meat of the game comes from discovering a large assortment of collectibles. Notes, documents, and items all serve to flesh out the game world through little snippets of story. The notes are generally drawings, and serve as hints/instructions while also building some spooky tension. Items are all suitably unsettling, and come with a little snippet of audio narration to further up the creepiness factor. The documents stand out as the most unique part of the package, and add a dual layer to the narrative. A series of police interviews with the group of friends that left you in the woods allude to the fact that something went wrong during tonight’s game of Wick. It reveals that there’s something special about your experience, and this isn’t just something that all the other kids have done and inexplicably got through just fine. It colors the events of the game in a more questionable light, and what you see might not be what actually is happening.\n\nAlas, that’s all there is to talk about with Wick. It’s a scavenger hunt Slender clone with more variety and legs. Sure, it innovates, but all that can be said about the title is still doable in just a couple paragraphs. It’s an inherent weakness to the genre, and one that prevents me from really getting fully into it. Some visual bugs and awkward spawns will take you out of the experience. The jump scares are also a bit too frequent, with almost every turn or new location prompting some kind of screaming child or demonic arm to dart out. It’s too rapid-fire, which makes the roughness of the seams more glaring.\n\nStill, none of the bugs ruined the experience for me. What is there is good, delivering scares in a unique environment. I had fun figuring out how to survive, and really enjoyed piecing the story together.\n\nIt’s the perfect example of an average game that I find enjoyable. This isn’t a big budget title pulled down into mediocrity by a clipped production cycle or inexplicable design choices. This is a small game that does a single thing pretty well. People that like this kind of thing will like Wick. If you absolutely adore Slender, you’ll find Wick to be a familiar experience with some innovations. It’s an indie game total worth checking out, I do recommend.","June 2","true","41.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will get a lot more enjoyment out of this if you consider it a "creepy interactive experience".\n\nAs a game it fails.  The only thing you do is walk around a forest avoiding random "enemies" you can't fight while trying to keep candles lit which isn't even necessary for survival.  That's it.  Yeah, you can find certain objects in each hour you're in (there are six), but I never felt particularly compelled to go looking for them. I just ran across them.\n\nAs a "creepy interactive experience" this is very well done.  The atmosphere does a wonderful job making your skin crawl.  It's always dark except for the candle in your hand.  The trees sway in the wind.  Fog is always rolling about making it hard to see in the distance.  Weird things can happen to you randomly, like your candle gets suddenly blown out, creepy disembodied kid voices talk into your ear.  The music adds a lot to the tension of walking around waiting for something to pop out, which something will multiple times.  If you like jump scares, this experience will satisfy you immensely.\n\nI do not consider this a game.  If I did, I would hate it.  But as an creepy interactive experience, I really enjoy it.  I enjoy how tense I feel when walking around a dark, creepy woods waiting to avoid whatever is out there.  I enjoy the sound of the wind blowing through the forest.  I enjoy all the weird things that happen to me.  I especially enjoy the tension-adding music.  If you can buy this on sale, it's worth it.  If you're into creepy atmosphere and jump scares, you might just enjoy yourself with this.","February 15","true","6.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It has a dash of Slender but with more than one threat that will change how you play each "hour" of the game. Visually things are good. The Game pulls a great pallet of blues to portray a full moon through fog. Sound is good as well and a good set of headphones is recommended for Wick. The only issues i'm having is with the timing in the game. For example: i found all three objects at 3:00am and died just before the clock struck 4am. This pushed me back to just running around at 3:00am till the time changes. Other than that it'sa good bite-sized horror game that will give you a good bump!","May 17","true","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is Mind numbing and keeps you wanting more. Collecting papers with nothing but a candle brings a slender esc vibe and gives you chills with the very darkness and the terrifying sounds of the night. The “stay alive to 6 am” factor is also a bit five nights at freddy’s like but it’s still an interesting factor for the game as it brings new information for the story each hour you survive.

It has some very great atmosphere, music, sound design, graphics, and a pretty cool candle mechanic. Unfortunately, we've played this game many times before. You walk around a dark forest while enemies randomly pop out of you in a rather hilarious way, you survive the night, onto the next night, and so forth. Imagine combining Slender: The Eight Pages and Five Nights at Freddy's into a game. Wick is literally that. Walk-through-a-forest-and-always-look-away simulator with some pretty cheap jumpscares that are only scary the first three times. I'm a MASSIVE horror junkie and I've played just about every horror game out there, so I can tell what's a quality horror game from one that's not. Wick gets boring rather fast without improving much to any of the gameplay. It does add a new enemy type to each night you survive, however, I rarely enccountered these enemies. The only characters to really pose a threat are the main enemy type; the ghost children. With bad design and dumb jumpscares, they lose their sense of being a scary threat too. The candle mechanic was done very well. You have a limited number of matches, which you use to light candles to keep the ghosts away while providing a light source. The candle starts to melt, so you have to be very careful with how you use your matches. If the enemy types were more scary and agressive, this would've made for a great game. If you enjoyed Slender and FNAF and are looking for games like them, Wick is worth the $10. However, if you're looking for a horror game that's different and doesn't misuse jumpscares, look further. A good horror game with great atmosphere and scares and around the same price range as Wick, try The Cursed Forest. I'm going to give Wick a 5/10.","May 15","false","0.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"
