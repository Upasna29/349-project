"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feistykobold/recommended/334270/","feistykobold","pango","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feistykobold/","4189 products in account","UPDATE 20 JULY 2015: Another game update. Still no tooltips on tech tree, no mouse on screen edge scrolling. I don't think they care about making the interface more PC-like at all. Either that or they are using some crossplatform framework which doesn't allow PC features so they -can't- make it palatable to pc users.\n\n\nUPDATE 19 JUNE 2015: I checked the game again to update my review. Nothing has changed except there is now a full screen option.\n\nThere may be a good game inside here somewhere but I'm having trouble persevering with it due to the atrocious interface, which is exactly the same as the mobile one and makes no effort to take advantage of the PC.\n\nThe game runs in a window at a set size and you can't change it. (update there is now a fullscreen option) There are no tooltips, so you have to press buttons to find out what they do then click back. This is especially annoying in the technology tree where you have to click on everything one by one to find out what it is. It's seriously tedious. There is no mouse on edge of screen scrolling. No use is made of right click.\n\nJust like a mobile game it has a "please review the game" button and another button to "more games".\n\nThere's quite a long time between turns after you press next turn. Some kind of progress indicator would be reassuring.\n\nI mentioned when the game first came to PC  in early/mid September 2014 that they needed as a matter of urgency to move away from the mobile interface and make a new interface for PC and I seem to remember a dev saying they would be doing just that.\n\nIt's been nearly 6 months. It's clear they aren't going to do anything. The game has been written to make money on mobile and then as an afterthought they have dumped it on the pc to make some more money, but they aren't willing to actually put any work in beyond making it actually run on the pc.\n\nThe worst effect from the mobile interface is the tech tree, which I mentioned earlier. There are a ton of technologies on the screen and you have to click each one to find out what it is, (like Warp Drive 1 or Spanner Throwing 3 or whatever). There's no way to know just from the icon what the tech is and clicking it takes you to a whole new screen which pretty much just says the name of the tech, then you need to click back to go back.\n\nIt would be so, so easy for them to add tooltips to the tech tree and it would be remove a massive frustration from the game. They've had 6 months to do it and they haven't done it.\n\nI have no respect for the devs at all.\n\nI seriously suggest not buying this game.","January 31, 2015","false","0.9"," 128 of 173 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","128","173","3","24"

Hopefully I can answer this question.\n\nA blend of complex strategic development of technology, star system colonization, war and politics. The remnants of the human race must survive and hopefully flourish in the face of enemies within your society and aliens bent on total final destruction.  This is not a casual game. Where Masters of Orion and Civilization cross paths you will find Star Traders 4X Empires.\n\nTo get a small demonstration of real time game play take a look at these two YouTube videos the Developers have published.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNjjENqwt1E\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Uxg1iZXRY\n\nPros\n1.  Documentation Score 5 out of 5.\nAll the rules are contained inside the game by clicking on the Advisor Library.  I wish more games would do this!  During this Steam holiday sale I’ve picked up inexpensive games then thrown in the deep end, especially the “oldies but goodies”.  In addition you can find the ST 4X rule book online at https://www.tresebrothers.com/star-traders-4x-empires/game-manual\nThe in-game rules get updated as new content is added\n\n2.  Technology Tree 5 out of 5.\nClose to 100 separate categories each one providing multiple benefits.  One box might give you access to 4 different weapons and a new ship class.  Another might give you a Spice den to increase morale while unlocking a big money making trade option.\n\n3.  No IAP 5 out of 5\nThe Elite version contains all 8 of the factions and syndicates, and you don’t ever pay for new releases as the game expands.\n\n4.  Ships 5 out of 5\nYou can design your own ships, name them and train captains as specialists in planetary invasion, gunnery, or repair to name a few.  The tactical battles involve whole fleets where every ship is controlled individually.  Being turn based you get a chance to really think about what will happen on the next move.\n\n5.  Hot Keys 4 out of 5\nHaving them and the mouse wheel zoom functions really speeds up game play, touch screens always seem to slow me down.  More keys need to be  added so that’s why I gave it a 4.\n\n6.  Artwork and Atmosphere 5 out of 5\nIt is important to compare this with games of similar type not Skyrim!  The ships are very detailed when you zoom in.  The sound effects are great.  There is an Ethereal soundtrack that currently has a bug but will be fixed soon.\n\n7.  Game design and play 5 out of 5\nYou cannot play as a Tyrant warlord.  Refugees are landing all the time. The morale and political development tree are just as important as designing and launching warships.  If you can’t manage the human side the economy will crash, people will riot, syndicate rivalries can result in war, and your research will stagnate making you easy pickings for the enemy.\n\nCons\n1. Difficulty 4 out of 5\nThere are multiple difficulty levels.  All Trese Brothers games set on Normal are meant to be challenging.  The game does not cheat it just opens a can of whoop-♥♥♥ on me every time I play.  I’m not the most skilled player in the world so it will take several months to get the hang of it.  You aren’t going to see comments like “I beat it in 4 hours at Impossible level”.  If you are looking for a solid challenge you just found it.\n\nComments\nThe Trese Brothers have looked forward to building this game for years and the dedication shows.  After purchasing if you don’t like it come back and play 30 to 60 days later new releases are coming out like clockwork and you may find your opinion obsolete.  I participated in the Alpha, this game just keeps getting better all the time.  The $9.99 is a small price to pay for so many weeks of play and I would buy it again.","December 29, 2014","true","3.7"," 89 of 115 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","89","115","3","0"

(Hint: A POWERSHIP doesn't win wars; Armadas win wars. ;) )\n-Interesting mechanic with guiding 3 individual factions makes diplomacy less of a way to 'game the system' and more of a 'system of the game'\n- Developers have an exemplary record of listening to their players, updating their games, and making good on any and all short-comings of the game when it's first release. If there's an aspect of the game that 'breaks' it for you, tell them, and there's a good chance they'll find a way to make it work as soon as humanly possilbe for a (mostly) 2 man dev team. ^_^\n\nCons:\n- Needs some better explanations/tutorials. This is probably not a good 'first 4x' game at present.\n- Some pacing issues should be addressed, but it's not really anything that I as a 4x fan havn't dealt with in any other 4x game, up until the 'final' version. So it's a con that's only a con because the game is still evolving, in my judgement.\n- Full screen is only enabled if you launch from the steam browser. Needs to be an in-game option.\n- Steep learning curve: I ended up restarting my first few games several times when I realized how drastic the early game mistakes I made were effecting my effectivity. But figuring things out was also rewarding. I can see how some would not appreciate this (but this is a function of needing more tutorial/explanation of systems)","January 20, 2015","true","5.7"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","43","50","0","2"

It seemed rather simplistic when I first started playing, like a typical ipad-game, and I didn't like it. However, it turned out to be rather deep once I got under its skin and it's got some entirely unique qualities that make this an excellent 4x.\n\nUnique 1: Your viewpoint is from that of a military umbrella-government that rule 3 human empires under martial law. This because you're fleeing home due an alien invasion. The challenge in this game then comes as much from internal strife between the 3 empires under your control and their wish to end your martial rule sooner than later, or even dominate all humans in your sector, as from deadly xenos. If you don't succeed in keeping the power of the 3 in balance you'll see a slew of detrimental effects on the planets affected by their politics, which in turn can cripple your ability to fight off external enemies. Very appealing game mechanics.\n\nUnique 2: You're calling the rest of the exodus fleet, letting them know you've settled. Your population growth doesen't come from new births but from immigration. As a result population growth is out of your control as long as you have a place to settle the newcomers. This result in a very different early game from other 4x games, where there is no value in expanding to new uninhabited worlds just to have more places to grow population. You total population growth is the same with one world per faction as with 10 worlds, as long as there is room to settle the newcomers. This make the early gameplay and expansion in general far more interesting than in other 4x.\n\nAnother interesting facet of this game stem from the abilities the 3 factions afford your united realm. You get a choise of different factions to pick your 3, and they can have abilities like skilled pilots from superior millitary traditions. But if you choose to base all your united millitary from out of that faction during the game (to get the strongest millitary possible) that would lead to the millitary faction declearing war on the other defenceless ones. This means you cannot simplify your choise of factions into "roles" based on their specialty, but must maintain a more complex view of the composition.\n\nThere are other less appealing game-mechanics that prevent this game from truly shining. There are some rather easy-to-find strategies that the AI simply can't handle. Some of the graphics is unappealing, not just low quality (I don't like the ship models). The fuel and logistic mechanics could be more inspired. But despite all this, Star Traders 4x remain a solid 8/10.","December 21, 2015","true","56.0"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","29","29","0","0"

First off, yes, it is a mobile port, so it does have some of the trappings of that (lack of tooltips, overly "clicky" interface, etc).  There is mousewheel support, which is nice, and they have promised to add tooltips, which would make things a lot easier to navigate.\n\nOn the plus side, the game has a nice big tech tree, which feeds into a large number of ship and colony upgrades.  The diplomacy is kind of unique in that you are managing relationships between factions within your empire, rather than other factions.  As far as I can tell, this is the only space based turn-based 4x game that has on map tactical combat, which is good or bad depending on whether you like that (personally I prefer this).   The ship designer is pretty fun to use, although it could have been consolidated into fewer screens.  I didn't really have any trouble picking up the game, although some things could have been explained better.  Even though some things could have been better, overall, I enjoyed this game a lot.","January 12, 2015","true","62.1"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","35","41","0","3"

Unlike most 4X type games, you aren't controlling a single empire, but rather three disparate factions.  They each bring strengths to the table to help you succeed, but they often don't see the big picture, and bicker like children, hindering your chances.\n\nI like the turn-based approach, allowing you to really think out your strategy, and the fact that the research paths are so diverse.  There isn't a "one path to success" approach in this game - trying different things nets different results, with some being equally as successful as others.\n\nI would recommend this game to those who enjoy turnbased 4X games, and who love to challenge themselves with a brilliantly thoughtout game design.  It's hard to believe it's made by really only two brothers, who also develop multiple other games of equal quality.\n\nIf you do try the game and find some aspect not to your liking, good news, the developers  actually listen, and work tirelessly to improve the games they develop.  The community forum that they run is also fantastic because no question bad or trivial.

It has a vast tree of technology that progresses pretty intuitively, but the controls and gameplay itself is rather hard to master.\n\nOnce you figure out the basics and get an understanding of how the game progresses and works, It becomes easier to work through the game.\n\nIt essentially centers around colonizing planets that then become their own centers of production. Each planet has a "quality rating" that determines its potential for use. Lower quality planets will end up being burdens on your empire, while high quality planets will be the center for constructing your fleets and providing income.\n\nPlanets have a "resource" called population that is not so much usable, but must be managed to keep the empire from falling apart. Higher populations require more management to keep happy, but come in handy to protect planets from capture.\n\nOne you figure out that you can research higher levels of buildings for your colonies, the game becomes significantly easier to manage the lower quality planets, and to capitalize off of the higher quality planets.\n\nThe game generally culminates in a match to invade and bombard each others planets, with the option to completely destroy the planet (by reducing it's Quality rating), or by reducing the planet's population to zero. You have three invasion options: Bombard (which has a high chance of lowering quality), Invade {which has a low chance of lowering quality), and Scout {Which may not always lower population, but never reduces quality!). Systems recover 1 population per turn, so to actually capture a system, you have to really have a big fleet.\n\nThe game is clever and addictive, and overall I suggest it to any fans of the old Sid Meyer's stuff.","February 22, 2015","true","52.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

When I saw that they ported it over to PC, I could not stop smiling. It's just got that spirit to it, you know, that a developer who loves what he does gives to his game. Now, that is not to say that it doesn't have its flaws, the mobile UI comes to mind, but, still, an excellent game.\n\nGameplay: The game starts slow, and there can be turns where you literally have nothing to do but hit "end turn", but the gameplay is generally fairly balanced and fun. The combat seems as if it uses a random number generator to determine whether or not you hit with any of your attacks, however, it still feels intuitive, and the satisfaction that devastating an entire Xenos fleet with four fighters through hit-and-run tactics is just amazing. The world management is quite fun, if you manage to learn how to do it properly, is very well done, if a touch shallow. Overall, the gameplay is quite good, though it's not the best.\n\nUI: The mobile UI seems to have carried over, which is rather disapointing. Now, that being said, they do seem to be slowly improving it and adapting it to PC, however, it is taking time. The UI could be much worse than it currently is, but I'm looking forward to its continued improvement.\n\nGraphics: Not too shabby, not too good. It isn't great, but it could definitely be significantly worse than it is.\n\nOverall: This game is an excellent addition to the Star Traders sequel, and it's only getting better, as it is being constantly updated. However, it was poorly ported over to the PC, and everything "mobile" about it is obvious, and annoying. At its current stage in development, I'd give it a 6/10, simply due to the shoddy interface and obvious port over from mobile. Given continued updates, I could easily see this skyrocket up to a 9.","August 6, 2015","true","15.5"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

Following the success from their previous titles Star Traders and Templar Assault, 4X Empires builds upon the lore of the Star Traders Universe by giving the player a completely new perspective on the deeply enriched story previously told.\n\nThis game is played in the perspective of the venerable Templars, protectorate of the bickering factions and guardians of the quadrant. As such, you are unable to directly control the factions and their politics, only what they build, what they research, and when. The politics system is a formidible beast, and truly gives the player the feeling that the Templars are not completely in control. It is this politics system that makes the game unique, and at times, infuriating. I have lost several games solely because the warring factions would rather fight amongst themselves than band together to fight the Xeno scourge.\n\nGameplay can be slow at times, but it is only because empire building takes time. Time that the player does not always have. The Xeno are always waiting just outside the field of vision, building their own empires to combat your own. The different types of Xeno make each of them unique in their own right. Some are slow to build up, but release extremely powerful ships into the quadrant, others expand at reckless paces, their factories spewing out hoardes of assault craft. Still others deal tremendous amounts of damage through radiation technology, which bypasses conventional armors to wreak havoc on your forces and systems. Still more exist in the quadrant, and each of them difficult in their own rights.\n\nFortunately for the player, a rich, complex, and infinitely customizable ship builder has been implemented, and hundreds if not thousads of ship configurations are possible, some more effective than others. System upgrades can provide valuable defensive structures that help a beseiged system hold their own until help arrives. The ship builder is honestly the crown jewel of this  game, as the designs made, the amount of ships created, and how you deploy them in the quadrant will MAKE or BREAK your game. But one can never lust for too much power, as the upkeep cost of the ships and every other system upgrade must be kept in balance with the amount of income your factions can create.\n\nIf you enjoy 4X games, dont mind a slower pace, but truly want a deeply satisfying gameplay that fully delivers on its promises, look no further than Star Traders: 4X Empires. Not only does the new and improved tutorial give you the basics of the game, the Trese Brothers have an amazing forum set up, and are 100% involved, answering any question you may have, here at http://startradersrpg.proboards.com/\n\nIf anyone deserves your time and patronage, it is Trese Brothers Games, happy hunting!!","April 5, 2015","true","57.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The gameplay is still solid. I love the unique political system. The developers do have some more work to do on making the UI better for PC users, but I have faith in th Trese Brothers. I have been playing their games for years on android and they update regularly and strive to improve. In fact they just did a complete overhaul of the main scrren UI of this game for all platforms and have pushed out two skin packs for ships. Right now I would give it a 7/10 Solid Gameplay. Good retro style artwork, but a ways to go on making the UI and controls better and more intuitive for PC players. It's a rough diamond at the moment there is a great game in there.","December 23, 2014","true","139.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I've played it before on other platforms, but I think I'm going to play on my Mac now. I appreciate the support for both mousewheel and two finger swiping. At first I was a bit confused, but the help file was very ... well, helpful.\n\nIt has some rough edges, however, juding by their other title players can expect lots of updates. I would like to see more special attack options for the ship designer and the ability to build planetary weapons to repel invasion ships by damaging them.\n\nMy  tip for anyone playing is make sure you build Cruisers/Carriers and get them as much XP as possible. Fighters are great for soaking up damage but they don't get the attack bonuses from XP like the bigger ships do.","December 17, 2014","true","94.7"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

It's a fascinating study in how to take a simpel premise and just make it fail.\n\nS4 games are my cup of tea. Have been since forever. They flow, they're fun, and they have variety through trying different approaches and maps.\n\nThis game has an interface that is slow, clunky, and where every command is easy to misplace, even after several hours of playing. The tech tree, as others have said is both too large and too simple. Combinations should be as important as individual choices. Likewise the civilisation mixes are individually diverse, but have poor combinatory impact.\n\nAt three quid this worth playing with just for the education.

Let me try again.\nFirst off, the game is very light, which is cool. The UI scales to a big screen well. The tech tree is ginormous. The gameplay is very promising.\nBut it does not feel right playing on PC.\nThe main concern that I have is the interface. It feels a lot like a lazy port from a smartphone game. There is no option button if you want to adjust screen size, volume, hotkeys or whatever. Everything is a click. Right click has no function at all. No mousehover, no tooltips. The tech tree is huge huge huge, and to know what each one is about, you have to click on it, which brings you to a different window and you have to press Esc to return instead of being able to simply and quickly view mouseover tooltips like other PC games. The same goes with planets, ships and buildings. The Help button from the main menu took me to a website that doesn't work, for me at least. Information on mechanics are hard to find in-game. The tutorial offers almost no information. To top it off, trying to open up the library from the Esc menu consistently results in a crash.\nIt unnecessarily takes a lot of time to learn about the game.\nThe game is costly in terms of time and money. Games like this would cost around 3-4 dollars on a smartphone.\ntl;dr: too pricey","December 17, 2014","false","2.3"," 91 of 218 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","91","218","0","10"
