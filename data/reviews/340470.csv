The first 10-15 minutes of the game were spectacular, then the milk scene happened and I had to quit as I thought there was a game breaking bug.  It turned out that I needed to fetch the milk from the shelf and continue my game.  I was so excited to play again after being so sure it was broken.\n\nThat's where my frustration began to incline.  Now, here's my thought process:\n\nYou start off the game in your house, hearing music playing, and as you walk around there are little hint bubbles above your head.  I would even say that 75% of the floor area is covered in triggers that make hint bubbles appear above your head.  They are extremely clear.  You will soon figure out how to stumble your way out of that first scene, I really enjoyed it.  Bravo.  Then the bike level, pretty tame, but I also enjoyed the challenge of how difficult it was to complete without error.  Bike level 2, even harder, same thing, I get it, it's challenging, I win, go me.  It's very clear what you need to do.\n\nThen this graveyard level.  I gotta say, no one should ever experience that.  My cat was even starting to worry about me after playing that level for an hour straight.  So luckily I saw a thread in the discussion area that you need to be aware of your heart beat in order to navigate the graveyard.  Cool!  So I do just that, go out there with that in mind, trying to feel my way around listening very carefully.  Walk a few blocks in one direction, few in another, always going back in alternate directions to make sure that I didn't potentially walk past any point where I was supposed to turn.  The tone never changed for me.  You can walk for 10 minutes in one direction, 10 minutes in another, zig zag around, doesn't matter.  The whole area is infinite, there is no way to reach any corner of the level, it's a giant loop.  I literally walked around trying different directions for an hour straight, not even the slightest change in the tone.  I don't get it?  It's the most maddening experience.  I don't wish it upon anyone.  So let me just GUESS at random numbers here:  let's say you walked 100 graveyard blocks to the right, and then went 20 blocks up, did you miss it right at the beginning?  Then from this point is the only way to go back to where you came to retrace those steps?  I can't tell if the tone changes if you are within 5 blocks or 1 block or what.  It's just dumb.  You can spend your whole life in there bumping around.\n\nHow would you ever start from the beginning again?  You can't.  The only way is to press the escape key.  What happens if you press 'escape'?  The game terminates immediately, without warning, no dialogs, settings, anything like that.  The game instantly shuts down.  You can't resume where you left off.  You have to start the game back up and play through ALL of the previous levels each time you play.  So if you were frustrated at a few of the previous levels, well surprise surprise, you need to go back and beat them all over again just to have another chance at perhaps walking in the right direction on the graveyard level.  It really wouldn't be so bad if you could resume at the last checkpoint, similar to how when you die in other levels it just restarts from a checkpoint.  There is no way to restart the graveyard.  You get lost, well, game over.  Start the entire game from scratch again.\n\nCan I remind the reader once again that the first stage has popup hints almost 75% of the time while you walk around, very clearly telling you EXACTLY what to do.  Then when you are shopping at the store level, it's up to you to figure out that there are 1000 things in the store and you have to know which button to press at which wall.  The only way to do it is to know in advance where to go or to button mash every key and walk to every single corner and eventually you will find it.  Not really a puzzle!  Just seems like lazy game design.  Put all of the effort in the beginning and then send the player out to button mash.","February 19, 2015","false","3.8"," 82 of 105 people (78%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","78","82","105","8","6"

The game excels at being a weird, WTF prompting, mind bending adventure.  The game sucks at being a fun to play game though which is why I can't actually reccomend it.\n\nAs far as the story goes, the game is absurd, hilarious, and will have you questioning what is going on the entire time (mostly in a good way!)  If you enjoy  game that just wants to mess with you maybe you should check it out.\n\nHowever the actual gameplay is clunky, confusing, and can be breaken down to a series of unrelated mini games.  The game progresses through mechanics seemingly at random.  At first it's a game about exploration, then it's a dodging mini game, bike racer, then puzzle solver.  None of these are done well, and you're fighting the mechanics every step of the way.\n\nBasically I could only reccomend this game if you're into the YouTube scene.  It makes a great wierd game to play for your fans, and that's about it's only strong quality.","July 25, 2015","false","0.5"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","28","32","3","3"

You'll beat this game in under 30 minutes on average.  As far as gameplay goes it's extremely lackluster, you can go to Armor Games or Newgrounds and find a flash game that'll hold your attention much longer than this.  It's a game when I saw the screenshots I really wanted to like, but there is no meat on these bones at all.  I mean $2 isn't exactly highway robbery but I'm sure it'd be better used going towards something with a little more depth.  If you got this in a game bundle, it's a 30 minute distraction.  If you're looking to outright purchase this game hoping for something that'll occupy your time longer, I'd say avoid it unless if you think $2 is worth the soundtrack, which I have no complaints about the soundtrack one bit.","February 24, 2015","false","2.5"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

The dialogue is nothing impressive but it has just enough humor to entertain, but its not witty by any measure of the imagination. The game twists in a surreal manner fairly often raising the entertainment value further. The main menu contains a joke so if the game is really WAY too short, its because you havent figured out the joke yet. There is about 20 minutes of gamepay here. Overall I would say its worth a buck because the game is.... nearly directed, like a movie would, with an interesting use of change of camera panes, and nice integration of sound effects as an additional mechanic layer and really adds texture to the game at times. The music when its present is a suprisingly symphonic retro 8 bit treat, you do get an occasional use of stock music from uncopyrighted sources but they are not part of the main musical score and are mostly used as accessory for a few npcs.\nWorth a quid in my book but if you are not a fan of adventure games to begin with you might want to skip this.\n","October 10, 2015","true","4.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

The big reason I liked this game is because of the humor and the really cool soundtrack. The basis of You Are Not A Banana is you follow a man as he goes through a day. Weird and odd things happen, and plenty of little puzzles are present throughout the game. You Are Not A Banana is very short, but the price tag of $2 is reasonable for the time. There is controller support, but the game doesn’t have different icons for the buttons in game. This game is very quirky and is not for everyone, but it is definitely worth a look at.\n\nPros\nFunny and comedic aspects\nRelated to real life (everyone can relate)\nAwesome soundtrack\nWeird in a good way\nNostalgic/pixely graphics\nCons\nA few sections are frustrating\nVery short (it is $2 though)\nThe controls feel unresponsive at times\nNo in game icons for controllers\nConclusion\nYou Are Not A Banana is a pixely adventure game with a really awesome soundtrack and it also has some very funny moments. You Are Not A Banana is not for everyone, but for the price of $2, there is no reason you should check this out.\n\n-HiPFiRED\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

If you’re feeling like a VERY short, random, odd little indie romp I would somewhat hesitantly recommend this, but for most people I can’t say I would. I don’t regret buying this if it helps the creator make more games, however I can’t say I’d recommend my friends try it.\n\nIt’s biggest problem is the title and the first few minutes of this game were so good that I was pretty disappointed when the rest of the game didn't measure up. Bits of it were fun (dream time, museum, bumping into stuff), but I spent most of the game in the bike minigame that really didn’t feel necessary. The music was great, I like the concept, but it was also so painfully short. Again, with the fun opening, I just kept waiting for something equally cool to happen but it never really did. Neither the humor nor the ingenuity measured up for me to the bar it set in the beginning, so once it was over I was left feeling dismayed.\n\nFor a lot of the game I also felt like I was playing a side quest of Always Sometimes Monsters. However, where that game makes its message pretty darn blatant, if this game had one a message it went right over my head. I didn’t see a point to what I was doing, which, given the surreal elements would have been fine, except so much was grounded in the mundane (both in terms of the character’s life and the bike minigame) that the surreal elements just seemed out of place and random instead of meaningful. It felt like it was pulling its punches. I wanted more surrealism, more confusion and bewilderment. More of... something. Ultimately what I love about random artsy-ish indie games is that I at least feel something, but I didn’t feel a whole lot during this and as a result it is still the first opening that leaves the greatest impression on me.\n\n:( I feel like if it was pushed a little farther there is something really cool here, and I’ll probably try out the sequel, but … maybe during a steam sale next time.","February 19, 2015","false","1.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

I enjoyed its abstract, almost otherworldly feel the game had. I know this ganme isn't for everyone, but it for sure was for me. To add, its art style and chiptune soundtrack was quite satisfying, coming from a retro game fanatic. To conclude, You Are Not A Banana was a great and awesome game, and I would reccomend it to anyone who likes retro, puzzle type adventure games. But this game also has its downfalls. One being its length. I beat it in 30 minutes. It had me wishing there was mnore, because I genuinely enjoyed this game. I really wish a sequel is one the way and that it expands on the already...interesting storyline. Also, the graveyard portion of the game had be stuck because, at first, I had no Idea what to do unless I watched a video (I'm not gonna help you, this isn't GameFAQS ;) )  All in all, this game was a great experience and had so much potential, but just fell short in a few departments, which is my I rate this game 8/8.","September 14, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The first play through took me about 45 minutes.  Included in that was me being lost in the graveyard for about 15 minutes.  The second play through took me about 15 minutes.  I did everything the same.  I tried going through every door and staircase but nothing changed so there is little to no replay value.\nI wanted to like this game.  I enjoyed the music, the art, even getting lost because that means I just have to explore a bit more!  But, in my opinion, it isn't really worth 2 dollars.  The bike game gets old after the first minigame and there are doors and other areas to the game that you want to explore, but the game just won't let you.  Although, those areas would have probably added an extra 5 minutes to the playthrough at the most, it might have made me chose to recommend it as it would have added more exploration which the game needed.\nAlso, there is no point to being a banana.  It lasts 20 seconds and that is it.  You can't do anything.  It might have children saying, "HAHA!  So random!

The game has a good balance of difficulty; dialouge helps tell you where and what to do next while still giving the player a fair amount of thinking and puzzle solving to do on your own. The blind puzzles where you have to bump into obejcts were pretty neat and intuative, though having a clear to understand "You're Hot/You're Cold" radar would have made the game less "Bump Into Everything And Hope You're Right". I wish there was a bit more to the game as it only took me 25 minutes to get to the credits, but for a $1.99 price tag, I can't complain too much. The game has its flaws and may not be for everyone, but I personally found it to be a nice experience for what it's worth.\n\nI personally didn't encounter much of problem while playing this game, though some people seem to have difficulty with the graveyard scene, which is understanadable since it appears to go on forever and makes it easy to get lost in (perhaps the developer could tweak that).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/recommended/340470/","celtic7guardian","Celtic7Guardian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/","1153 products in account","I traded a game I would never play to get this one. I felt the name alone would make it good blindstream bait. As such, I booted it up yesterday to show my friends. I went in with neutral expectations, keeping an open mind.\n\n1.4 hours later, which is how long it took to finish You Are Not A Banana, I had three words to say about it: "Screw this game."\n\nFirst, let's give credit where it is due. There are a few legitimately amusing moments in You Are Not A Banana. Some of the humor in it does work. It's not a logical game in any sense, but frankly, if you went into a game called You Are Not A Banana with hopes of logic being present, you need to check your expectations. So it did make me laugh a few times, and that is more than I can say about some games.\n\nWith that out of the way, it's time for all the things I can use to discredit it. The game's title is a bloody lie, and it took me a few tries to even figure out what I was supposed to do. After that lie is unveiled, there is no mention from any characters about bananas. This is extremely depressing.\n\nOkay, let's be serious for a moment. The gameplay is awful. I don't mean the parts where you walk around as the main character from room to room, because that's your basic movement scheme. What I'm talking about is the "gimmicks" present. For example, you have two race sequences on a bicycle. Controlling that stupid bike, and moving it quickly enough to pick up the wrenches you need, all without crashing into random nonsense, is absurdly annoying. There are a few times where you need items, and those items are unintuitive in how they are gotten. On top of that, there isn't really anything to examine. Your character will comment on certain things when he is close to them, but there is no way to specifically trigger those comments beyond hoping you are in the right area, and you can't make the stupid speech bubble go away if it does pop up unless you get away from said location.\n\nThe protagonist, by the way, is an utter loser who I gladly ran into several cars. This unlikeable waste of data space gives no incentive to help him get what he wants. Every time a character made his life more difficult, I was quite happy, because he deserved it. None of those characters have names, for the record, or if they do, I sure as heck didn't see them.\n\nOh, and speaking of running into cars, here is one of the few things I can say this game did right. If you die, you spawn nearby. No progress is lost, unless you're in the race, in which case you restart the race (which honestly is not a huge deal, even if it is annoying). And thank everything it does, because this flipping game does not have a save system. It's a short game, yes, but come on now. After how awful some of these segments were, I really wanted to save, quit, and come back to it later. But no, I had to do it in a single sitting, and that was just bad.\n\nThe music is mostly meh. I didn't particularly like any of it. The graphics? Also meh. I mean, some of the items look like what they should. Others... I thought I had gotten soda instead of milk, let's just put it that way. The protagonist also looks obnoxious, which is fitting, given that he is, but still makes him blah to continuously look at.\n\nBut all of this pales in comparison to one flaw I have not yet mentioned. I probably would not have recommended the game even without this flaw, yet I could have at least said, "If you can get it for free or something, sure, give it a go for a few quick laughs." With this? I don't recommend it even for free. And what is it?\n\nThe graveyard puzzle.\n\nThe graveyard puzzle is one of the worst experiences I have ever had with video games, and that is saying a lot. It is an infinite cemetery that has you constantly at crossroads with four paths. You have a heartbeat/music to follow, with one randomized path having a slight variation. You take that path, and then do it again, and again, and again, constantly wondering if you are getting anywhere, until you finally find something different.\n\nThis bloody puzzle took me somewhere from half an hour to forty-five minutes to complete, and not because it was particularly mind-challenging. No, it was because the sound differences are so subtle that it is nearly impossible to figure out where to go. I couldn't hear any difference 90% of the time, and the people viewing my stream couldn't tell, either. You know what's not fun? Randomly picking paths and praying they work, and then banging your head against a wall when you find out you've actually made things worse. To add icing on the cake, your character's footsteps are so stupidly loud that it's ridiculously annoying to try and hear the heartbeat over them. I honestly had no idea if I could ever get through this segment, and when I did, I could not wait to finish the game just so I could rant about how horrible it is and delete it off my computer forever.\n\nFun fact: the developer has evidently said this is an "experimental puzzle." I've got news: that experiment failed. NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.\n\nAfter that puzzle, I finished the game in about five minutes, give or take. So yes, a total of 1.4 hours, with most likely over half of that being the awful graveyard part. I have 3.6 hours because I left the game running when I was done to collect the trading cards. But not for a badge, because I don't want that shameful thing in my profile. I'm trading/selling/doing SOMETHING with the cards to get them out of my life, and only got them so I would never have any reason to download this game again (barring something highly unexpected coming up, such as having a gun pointed at my head and being threatened to be shot unless I play it again).\n\nIs this the worst game ever? No, but it sure as heck isn't a good one. That you have to pay anything for it is a crime. Even if it was a free game, I wouldn't recommend it, but at least it would only be ripping off your time and not your wallet. Thank goodness I got this for basically nothing. It did at least make for an amusing blindstream at parts, but I will never let that graveyard segment go, and I will be referring to it from now on as a fantastic example of what NOT to do in a game.","January 31","false","3.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

The game makes you restart since apparently you have to select the human character instead of a banana. You have to close your eyes and bump into stuff to find "things", and there are 2 short bike races where you pick up wrenches to make your bike faster. Once you reach the art gallery you are informed that you need an art pass. The game is very vague on what to do once you reach the graveyard. After a bit of wandering and listening you find an art pass, exit the graveyard and give the conveniently found pass to the guy at the entrance. Enter the art gallery, look at the "art", try to leave, follow janitor,and get your meh ending of this lame, pointless game.  There is not enough content in this "game" for it to be classified as a game imho. I do not recommend this and  as the protagonist said, "That was kind of meh."

Definitely a nostalgic nod at a "bygone" era that made me all warm and fuzzy. The gameplay is smooth and easy to understand...at first. I got about 20 minutes to a half hour into the game before I arrived at the graveyard that you can read ALL about in the other comments. I've seen that people have, in fact, made it past this part. I myself have not, and I really wish that the puzzle of sorts were easier to understand. I'll try it again sometime, but I wasn't too happy with that, especially when the game had been so fun up until that point.\n\nHere's my Let's Play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6S5sq8bK2k","February 21, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
