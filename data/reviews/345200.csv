"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehbrowniemixx/recommended/345200/","tehbrowniemixx","Browniemixx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehbrowniemixx/","133 products in account",""There's always a bigger fish" sums up the whole game for those who don't want to read, now on to the review for those looking for a more in depth look.\n\nOkay, so, Tasty Blue sound familiar? Well if you ever heard of tasty planet way long ago then you'd know this is that game.\n\nThe first part I'll talk about is what is it? Well it's what it looks like a game where you eat things that you can until you grow enough so that you can eat bigger objects and then when you eat enough of those you can eat the evven bigger objects and so on. Your character will occasionally make these accented sounds like "yummy" "yum-yum" and everytime you finish a level he goes "oompa!" that's just the first character though but I'll get to that later. As far as the two predecessing games go, the sound assets are the same throughout with screaming people and animals and crunch noises when eating, as far as I know they haven't made any different sound clips. There is a local co-op that allows you to use the other controls. The controls are simple, you either move with the mouse, the WSAD keys or arrow keys(the game won't mention the wsad keys but they works just fine)\n\nNow I think I've talked about the original titles enough now I shall discuss what makes this differ from the other games. For starters, it's based in the ocean so there's water physics and the ability to launch yourself out of the ocean. instead of it being 2D top down it's a sidescroller so it may look a bit off in some places. The story as far as I know is about as descriptive as any of the others and uneccesary at most. now the strange thing about this game is that there's no clear chapters anywhere, you know there's 3 different fish types but there's no clear definition where one starts or ends. Now how the fish work, beign that you control a fish and not a grey blob, you can generally move forward with better ease with a challenge for doing a 180 some people might not like this but the only real issue I found was when I tried to eat an object and I ended up looping around it for a bit before I had to turn off. The game seems to have a star scoring system involved, there's a timer on the top right so if there's any obsessionalists who strife for completion the game has that. There's at least 5 difficulty setting that change the damage ratio on enemies.\nThe setting are simple but more than what the other two games had, you got graphics with aspect ratio but everything else is just a checkbox. Something different they decided to do is include a "carnage" system where you use a slider to change how much "blood" shows when you eat something that's alive. Control options are bare minimum with only mouse sensitivity options, with no rebindable keys.... could be an issue\n\nThat's about all I can think of for information, I guess if you either played the original tasty planet games 10 years ago or are curious to play a katamari esqu title then this is your game, it's not for everyone though clearly with visual quality not high in depth. At it's current price and estimated play time of about an hour or two it's definitely a fair price range. And even then if your not satisfied I'm certain this game will be on sale either with the weekly or seasonally.\n\nI really do reccomend this though, I'm having fun with it","February 10, 2015","true","7.6"," 62 of 82 people (76%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","76","62","82","16","3"

Found it best to play in small amounts which I am pretty sure it was designed for anyway. Would definitely play a sequel as this one was very addictive.

It operates on a star system,\nwhich encourages replayability, but I feel the game would have benefitted\nfrom having a leaderboard.\n\nYour objective is to eat smaller items or fish, and the more you eat,\nthe larger you grow.  The comedic aspects comes when you may find yourself\nlarge enough to eat small boats or buildings within the missions.  The\nmechanic is simple, but is solidly supported by the music, which helps\nkeep the atmosphere, and the level design, which mixes up the levels so\nyou don't feel like you are replaying the same mission with small variations.\n\nThis is a small, simple, game with solid mechanics and an entertaining\narcade feel.

It is fast, goofy, has often-questionable hit meshes, even-more-so questionable animal-to-world scales, and it's a lot of fun while it lasts. It is certainly no Katamari, nor shares the polish and budget of a Popcap title, but if you like a game that doesn't take itself seriously, you'll probably like this game.\n\nThe game is short - I finished in just over 2 hours. It is split into levels which chronicle the lives of three different aquatic animals as they grow to monster sizes. The game really shines when it drops you into a large body of water with a large variety and population of things to eat. This becomes very apparent as soon as you encounter the boring and frustrating oyster levels which there are two of. You'll know what I mean when you get there. There are also bonus levels at the end which offer some more fun after the campaign.\n\nIf you let yourself just steep in the ridiculousness of this title, you'll surely enjoy it while it lasts. Minor things like keyboard controls, repetitive (but often totally bangin') music, and those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ oyster levels might make you want to kill yourself briefly, but that's just a sign you've been playing this game for too long at a time. I finished my 2-hour playthrough in three sittings.\n\nIf you still want the game at this point, I wholeheartedly recommend it because it's downright fun for the price.","February 22, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

There have been many similar games to use this concept, dating at least as far back as the early 2000s with browser games on sites like Newgrounds, but Tasty Blue looks like the kind of game that would expand on it.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nYes, there are a ton of levels, but there is very little variation among them.

In Tasty Blue you only get set back a small amount of size when hit. You can't die which means there is no challenge.\n\nOther than that, it has a nice art style with vibrant colours and a childish cartoonish style. The physics are also pretty cool I guess, and sometimes it feels quite satisfying to eat up a whole city as a goldfish.

Three scenarios are lined up for you to experience; the goldfish that gets overfed and escapes their prison of a bowl, the opressed dolphin that makes their escape from the mediocrity of jumping through hoops for its human overlords entertainment and the genetically engineered shark that was created to defeat the other two monster characters, but decided it was still hungry afterwards. HOWEVER, I personally felt like there could have been a slightly more in depth story, which may have broken up the repetitiveness of each characters plights. However these story introductions leave me wanting to know about more of a follow up to the characters.\n-Continuity issues: One level I've grown to the size of a house, and am EATING houses, the next, I'm back to the size of a tuna fish... why? I thought there was a linear story happening here...? Also, orcas that are half the size of helicopters.\n-Same old ability: space to boost, space to boost, space to boost..... Shouldn't different creatures ahve different perks?\n\nIn conclusion; 'Feeding Frenzy' did it better. Seriously, if you're considering buying this game for your kids, sure, go for it, but if you like the mechanic of playing as a creature that must eat or be eaten, and consequently grow and eat bigger things, look up Feeding Frenzy. It's fantastic, and has a great story with a touch of mystery beautiful artwork, and each character has specific attributes and abilities.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\n\nFor kids, sure, but go google Feeding Frenzy anyway.","March 20, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fortunately, it lacks both the stress-inducing time-limits of the former, and the obnoxious difficulty of the later. You're graded according to how quickly you get through the stages, so if you wanna three-star every level, you're gonna have to move your tail - but if you just wanna take it easy, enjoy the sights, and stop to eat the flowers, nothing's stopping you.\n\nOf course, unless you DO want to do exactly that, it's going to be a fairly short game. Don't expact days of entertainment here - you can blast through the whole thing in an evening if you're so inclined. Still, it's a fair ammount of fun for the price, and worth owning just for the experience of going straight from chomping on zytoplankton to eating the moon within the space of a single game.\n\nThe only real critique I can level at it is that some of the levels have you hang around the same area, eating the same endlessly-respawning objects for way too long time - but that's ultimately a minor quibble. The controls are tight and responsive, particularly if you're using a controller, the physics are tuned more towards 'fun' than 'realism' (which is how it SHOULD be), and there's a huge variety of things to eat - from bottlecaps to aircraft-carriers. So if you're looking for an afternoon of anarchic, all-devouring fun, look no further than this clever little game!","February 19, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not much in the way of challenge other than trying to clear a level as fast as possible. It is a fun distraction, but probably nothing that will keep you playing for long periods of time.\n\nWhat this game lacks is visual appeal. The art style is cute and quirky, but the environments are rather bland and repetitive. The same can be said about the music. What is there is fitting and somewhat catchy, but it lacks variety and you'll get tired of hearing the menu/map music if you play it for too long.\n\nOverall it is a decent game and worth playing if you catch it at a discounted price. Just don't expect a lot of depth even though you'll be diving deep to eat more and more.","February 20, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Three scenarios are lined up for you to experience; the goldfish that gets overfed and escapes their prison of a bowl, the opressed dolphin that makes their escape from the mediocrity of jumping through hoops for its human overlords entertainment and the genetically engineered shark that was created to defeat the other two monster characters, but decided it was still hungry afterwards. HOWEVER, I personally felt like there could have been a slightly more in depth story, which may have broken up the repetitiveness of each characters plights. However these story introductions leave me wanting to know about more of a follow up to the characters.\n-Continuity issues: One level I've grown to the size of a house, and am EATING houses, the next, I'm back to the size of a tuna fish... why? I thought there was a linear story happening here...? Also, orcas that are half the size of helicopters.\n-Same old ability: space to boost, space to boost, space to boost..... Shouldn't different creatures ahve different perks?\n\nIn conclusion; 'Feeding Frenzy' did it better. Seriously, if you're considering buying this game for your kids, sure, go for it, but if you like the mechanic of playing as a creature that must eat or be eaten, and consequently grow and eat bigger things, look up Feeding Frenzy. It's fantastic, and has a great story with a touch of mystery beautiful artwork, and each character has specific attributes and abilities.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\n\nFor kids, sure, but go google Feeding Frenzy anyway.","March 20, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No, not by any stretch of the imagination. But what it lacks in design and control, it more than makes up for with pure unbridled fun. A sequel-ish to Tasty Planet, Tasty Blue shares much of its mechanics with its predecessor, but while Tasty Planet took place on a flat plane from a birds-eye view, Tasty Blue instead is treated like a diorama of sorts, meaning gravity has an effect on the game's physics. Tasty Blue certainly does not have the same charm as Tasty Planet did, given the fact that you're eating mostly fish and people, but the gameplay remains enjoyable enough to keep playing it. There are some issues I have with the game, such as its seemingly poor optimisation on my computer and tough to use controls, but those problems are washed away by the fact that I simply enjoy the game. Getting 3 stars on a level is often very hard, and sometimes RNG based, but trying to get as many stars as you can keeps me entertained enough to keep playing the same levels over and over.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Tasty Planet, or Feeding Frenzy from way back in the day. While the game looks (and is) simple, that doesn't make it any less fun, and there is a certain childish whimsy to hearing that the sounds of eating accompanied by silly looking blood. If anything, this game brings me back to a simpler time when I first found sites like Big Fish Games and PopCap, and the ability to relive that odd nostalgia makes the purchase more than worth it.","May 22, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
