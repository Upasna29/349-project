Need for Speed Shift is all about racing on a racetrack, and fighting through the pack to place in the Top 3. There is also drift mode, where you score the most combined points in three rounds to win. The driving physics are decent, not too bad, but not great either. There are a good selection of cars that you can own (although it sucks that you can only buy 1 unit of each car) and a range of real world tracks (Nurburgring, Spa, Silverstone, etc.). Those make a pretty good legal racing game.\n\nThe annoying thing is cheap AI in car battle mode, especially in Autopolis GP. They can just tackle a tight hairpin (turn 4) at 100+ km/h without understeering... Also, there are some unfair car battle matchups, when 1 car is a lot faster than the other (Audi R8 vs Aston Martin V8 Vantage for example) and no matter how good your driving is, you'll still lose in the slower car (unless you play dirty).\n\nOverall, it is still a good racing game to play if you are looking for a mixture of simulation and arcadey style of racing.","May 9, 2015","true","26.5"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","28","33","0","0"

This game is a mixture of a racing arcade/simulator. Shift 2's racing and flow was just not up to par with this. The racing in this game it actually FEELS really good. The cars look beautiful. The cockpit even more beautiful. If you're not satisfied with a car or part you've just bought you can just SELL it and get every single cent you've put in that car. UNLIKE Shift 2. Oh yeah, that reminds me too, money in this game isn't hard to get. You can get a nice amount each race if you know what you're doing. They even give you cash for custom/free races that you setup yourself. And the fact that you can get a 100% refund for your fully customized car feels good. I don't have to worry about wasting my time putting blood and sweat into a car that I probably can't use 60% of the time due to tiers and specialized events. The engines, transmission, skidding etc all sound amazing in this game.\n\nThe customization is pretty in-depth giving you the option to go up a tier if you have all of your tiers vehicle enhancements. Which is AMAZING because you get to bring your favorite vehicle to more races. What saddens me is that the game doesn't have any night races or courses. Well, at least from what I've seen. This game also encourages ramming and playing clean. You get points which gives you bonus money and experience for playing either aggressive or clean. Yeah, pretty ♥♥♥♥ing ironic mainly because in Shift 2 they try to act like the game also encourages ramming with their spectacular Shift 2 announcement trailer. (No really. I really loved Shift 2's trailer. It was amazing.) But really you couldn't do none of that ramming ♥♥♥♥ in Shift 2 without crashing your ♥♥♥ into a guard rail. I'm not a Shift 2 hater at all. I actually do like it and think Slightly Mad Studios did a good job with it. Especially with the head-cam which I wish this game had, but it's just that this game is better in many other aspects and ways than Shift 2. I also like the in-game trailers showing off each type of race event in this game. The music in this game is good ♥♥♥♥ too.\n\nThe AI in this game aren't really that hard to handle. I haven't really tried max difficulty to know though. Also the replay camera in this game is INCREDIBLE. It really gets you into the spot when you see yourself in a TV like position racing across the screen. I think this game has the best replay camera for any racing game I've seen.....Well, maybe not better than Assetto Corsa's replay camera. I think it's because the sense of speed on camera is set perfectly to make you feel like you're actually watching someone race. But yeah, overall. The game is totally worth it. You won't regret it. Also, don't think I was talking down Shift 2. I just think this game is just superior to its sequel in many ways.","October 17, 2014","true","10.7"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","32","47","2","4"

The cars bounce like low riders for no particular reason.  The steering is also very twitchy.  I have gone through all the adjustments to try and fix this but it just can't be dialed in quite as good as Codemaster games.\n\nYou can say that the AI cheats.  Cheating is when you don't play by the rules for the purpose of winning.  That is what I noticed.  You have to follow a very specific driving line in order for you to make it through a corner.  The tighter and faster you go, obviously you would understeer and slam into the wall.  Well the AI does not do that.  The AI will also swerve left and right while making a tight turn to block you from passing.  Then there is the collision system.  The AI can slam into you and you are then taken off the road and it would take you quite a while to get back on the road.  You would have lost several seconds and would probably cost you the race.  Now if you decide to pit the AI cars, it won't have any effect on them.  They will not slow down.  In fact they would retain the same speed and jump back on track half a second later.  It is such bull crap.\n\nI'm not really that bitter since the game only cost me what a nice sandwich would.\n\nIf you want realism, stick with Codemaster racing games.  This is a minimally decent attempt at simulation.  But the Need For Speed series should just stick to arcade style racing.","November 27, 2013","true","9.0"," 31 of 50 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","31","50","0","6"

I can imagine it does a pretty good job at that.\n\nBut if you jump into it expecting something more, you're in for a big disappointment. I wouldn't even go as far as calling it a mix of an arcade and a simulator because it's a pure arcade which stays true to the Need for Speed name. The game revolves around ramming into each other, the AI is bad and so are the physics, the controls are poor all the way from the menu to the game itself and the unnecessary blurry speed effects and the deep voice-over about how you're a totally cool driver now don't really save this title - only make it more cringeworthy.\n\nNow I'm not trying to make it look as bad as possible. The game is all good as an arcade, is pretty nice to look at, there's a lot of cars to pick from and you can customise them to a certain degree. And obviously I would be stupid to expect realism from a Need for Speed title. I just don't think it deserves to be promoted as a simulation experience.","September 27, 2015","true","16.7"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","22","35","5","2"

I Chose this one for a number of reasons. First of all, i used to play some sort of Need For Speed on PlayStation 2 and it was my favorite game. I also bought it for the system requirements. It runs flawlessly on my laptop (A10, 8GB) and im yet to test it on my media PC (A4, 4GB).\n\nThe game is fun; it makes you want to keep on playing. It's just one of them games you could play for hours. The graphics are great especially for a game this age. Of corse it's not the most recent Forsa but in my oppinion the graphics are perfectly fine. There is plenty to do in the story mode, i have yet to try multi-player.\n\nOne minor complaint: the controles on keyboard and mouse are just not that good. This is the case for ALL racing games, not just this one.

It both runs and looks fantastic on Windows 10. It offers up quite a lot of gameplay for the price, with a nice array of cars and tracks, all constructed to the highest level of detail possible at the time. Gameplay is fun and fast-paced, but don't believe the marketing. It is an arcade racer through and through, not a sim. Career mode progression also relies on an inferior and clunky arcade style unlock system, where you are forced to earn stars to unlock future events with some fairly ridiculous side objectives (spin-out 4 opponents) forced upon the player. Overall Shift is a really solid arcade racer, if you accept it as such, you'll have a good time, but if you expect this to be a sim, you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere is my full in-depth review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnR7ftTzHuU","February 13","true","20.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It thinks you want to navigate the menus with your keyboard and mouse, instead of the obviously hooked up XB1 controller, because I'm driving with that.\n\nControls are just ♥♥♥♥.\nUnlike most other 'realistic' racing games, SHIFT thinks that you want to go into full lock when you're at top speed, instead of progressively lowering sensitivity the faster your speed is. No, what this game does, is force you into a dumb as ♥♥♥♥ slide, as your TCS activates, because apparently it thinks you want to... you know what, I don't even know what the game thinks you're attempting to do, because that ♥♥♥♥ing TCS goes on constantly, because your car is constantly out of control at the slightest steering input. It's probably easier if you have a steering wheel, but there's no reason for the controls to be this bad on what a majority of users would be using, which is a XB or PS controller.\n\nPhysics are questionable.\nRear ending cars with another car, in real life, doesn't cause them to get shot 20ft into the air. Flipping, sure, but even that isn't simulated right in this game. Cars flip, because some part of it digs into dirt/grass, or they are really sideways when their tire suddenly gains a ♥♥♥♥ ton of grip. In this game, it's like the cars become cardboard boxes once none of their tires are touching the ground, as in they have no mass, so they just get launched 20 ♥♥♥♥ing ft into the air when you bump them right and it's ♥♥♥♥ing dumb.\n\nAnd then there's the handling between these ♥♥♥♥ controls and questionable physics. Apparently, when you go into a banked corner at 'just the right speed' your car bottoms out, as evidenced by the long trail of sparks underneath the car, which causes your car to go out of control and not accept any sort of steering input. I don't know what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ suspension these cars use, but you can't adjust that at all in the game. I have never seen any racing cars just absolutely bottom out through the entire corner, unless it had no wheels. In fact, this is the first game I have ever played that does this. It's not like the cars doing this are F1 or other low ride height cars either, they're just tuned tier 1/2/3 cars, which should never have this problem, ever.\n\nGame Modes\n♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥ing DRIFTOOOOOOOO ♥♥♥♥, it's so ♥♥♥♥ing dumb, because the controls and CAMERA switch, randomly, between 'oh, you want to corner' and 'DRIFTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO'. As if the car wasn't hard enough to control already, there's a whole new dimension added with drifting events. Instead of a linear transition, or you know, a complete physics/control system, this game has a very strange camera and control transition between the start of your drift and what it considers a 'drift', which makes it unnecissarily difficult to do these events. In fact, it felt so clunky and stupid, that I totally lost interest doing any of them.\n\nCamera\nOH MY GOD, I can't complain enough about this. Okay, I get that crashing hard will disorientate you, I've had that happen in real life, but this game goes overboard with it. Tapping another car or kissing the wall does not do that in real life, yet this game does. It was fine at first, but gets extremely annoying after the 10th race with ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI drivers that decided to randomly ram you or brake check you. and like ♥♥♥♥ I am going to hit the brakes for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI getting in my way.\nOh, hey, do you like simulated frame drops? This game does that when you hit things. At first, I thought it was my PC, but turns out, that's a feature effect this game has.\nAnd if you want to point out that I can just drive smoothly, I do when I can, but the ♥♥♥♥ing controls and handling become ♥♥♥♥ on some courses, that I can't be bothered to drive smoothly around the AI.\n\nMap\nLOL. A map that tells you if you've 'mastered' a corner or not, it's nothing more than a distraction. Mastering a corner doesn't mean ♥♥♥♥, you just have to finish in first place, because there is no smooth cornering in this game, just the disappointing sight of smoke coming from all 4 tires, because the game thinks you want full lock instead of minor inputs.\n\nProgressing through the game\nDon't like to do some events you don't consider to be fun? well, too bad. Unless you do those, you're not going to be able to progress through the game. And that's where I said '♥♥♥♥ this game' and went ahead and uninstalled it.\nI don't care about drifting events in this game, it's done terribly and I want no part of it.\nRacing is fun, until you get the go-kart map with nearly zero opportunity to overtake.\nTime trials, didn't even bother with those, I want to race against other cars, not the clock, especially when the controls and handling are so clunky.\nEndurance. LOL, a ♥♥♥♥ing '8' shaped course for endurance? that was the most hilarious ♥♥♥♥ I've seen.\nBattles. Just choose the OP car, there's no point in using the ♥♥♥♥ one, because it's going to lose 100% of the time.\n\nConcluding remarks\nNFS: ♥♥♥♥","May 16, 2015","false","5.9"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","27","48","10","2"

The works upgrades make your favorite Tier 1 & 2 cars into powerhouses which lets you compete even an RX-8 well into the game - it's a well-balanced idea. Drift mode initially struck me as virtually impossible, but returning to the game a second time, it's actually quite a lot of fun (I recommend a Works'd RX-7 or, of course, the AE86). The game, in my opinion, has a greater depth than Forza, for example, and I'd even recommend Shift highly to someone with a 360/PS3.","June 13, 2013","true","28.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The car handling, the visuals, the difficulty are spectacular. The opponents are not nearly as retаrded as they tend to be in most racing games and actually provide a challenge. However, it has one major flaw. The NFS World tour (final tour) is unlocked midway through the game. With only 8 hours on the game I beat the tour, with half the events were still not done. But after the final tour is beat the temptation to grind the rest of the races is just not there. So I only got 9 hours out of this game. Still, it was very enjoyable. The unlocking system is flaud, but only a minor issue. If you're gonna get it - play all events first :)","January 31, 2014","true","10.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is a motor racing game as it should be! At least the Need For Speed franchise stopped trying to lumber a driving game with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t storyline and got on with the core ingredients of a driving game... the driving!!\n\nGraphically this title is still fantastic despite it's age, the controls are responsive but also feel realistically weighty... whereas so many driving games seem to make the car behave more like a speed skater, this game is much more realistic and responds as a car should, no matter how much weight reduction you put it through. But the real attention to detail comes in the audio department. The engine roar of your car really portrays the raw grunt and power of the machine you're in, and has unquestionably the best engine sound of any driving/motor racing game ever released! There is also a huge number of cars to choose from as you start from the relatively lowly tier 1 cars such as the VW Golf, Honda S2000 or Ford Focus GT and work your way up to the monstrous tier 4 hypercars including the Koenigsegg CCX, Pagani Zonda R and the mighty Bugatti Veyron.\n\nSome of the old favourite NFS features are still here... There are performance upgrades a-plenty here for you, along with the chance to really personalise your car with any number of paint schemes, liveries, body kits and wheel rims.\n\nThe Need For Speed franchise seems to have really lost it's way over the past few years, but NFS: Shift showed us that occasionally they really could get it right sometimes. If you enjoy racing games but have always stayed away from the boy-racer theme of so many other NFS titles, you really want to make this the exception.

First one was Porsche 2000, and the second is this game. The thing is… I honestly don't know how to explain why. Maybe the best way would be to do it by listing some contradictions to other? Both titles *are not* cartoonish. Both give you a sense of being a real owner of the cars you drive — there is no stupid scripted story throughout the game (let's leave that to other genres, shall we…). Both have cars that are pure pleasure to drive, even with a keyboard which I always do exclusively (sorry). I won't recommend you coming back to Porsche 2000. Sixteen years and counting, let's leave it as a legend and let it rest.

Only then, you'll find out how rewarding racing a car can be. Especially since it is really difficult to keep it stable at high speeds and in tight turns.\n\nThe graphics in this game are clean and sharp. Textures could be better, though car detail is ample and greatly refined. Interior cockpit view is also done admirably. The sound feels too fake at times. Especially when you have games like DiRT 2 and 3, that use a sound system that is near indistinguishable from the real thing.\n\nA good game, excellent for drinking games and arcade race players.

There are a few red flags you need to be aware of. First and foremost being that in a good number of cases, you will not be able to run the game straight from the download/Install. Other times, your hardware will straight be incompatible with it, so do yourself a favor and research if it will work with you stuff, because a recent upgrade in hardware took my ability to play this game away.\nSecondly, you will never drive an actual, to Specification Track Car… Taking the time to tune it will help, but  the 'end game' cars bounce around and fly on the track is because they are still setup as a road car. Their spring rates, dampening force, and so on is far from what you would want on a track.\n\nThirdly, the true 'End' of the game essentially becomes Trackmania… Driver against Driver with a minimalistic gap between the cars you are driving.\n\nOverall, a good game, just do your research before buying it, and expect some headaches along with it.\nHonestly, my favorite 'sim-cade' racing game there is, with Pro-Street running a very close second. Speaking of which, if you like NFS Pro-Street, you'll like this, IF you can get it to work.\n","January 30","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a standard layout, with a D-Pad and 4 buttons, much like Playstation and Xbox Controllers. Even though it's not officially supported, it's a complete joke that those won't work in the menu, especially if they work with any normal key bind you can set in the menu.\n\n2: The optimization is downright awful. i7-4770, GTX 760, 8GB RAM merely get you a 60 FPS on 1080p on MEDIUM settings, that is WITHOUT motion blur and texture filtering at MINIMUM.\n\n3: The option menu, specifically graphic settings are another huge ♥♥♥♥ up. This is one of the games where you have to restart the whole game whenever you change most of the settings. That's pretty bad already, but it gets even worse if you are testing different settings to reach decent quality/framerate ratio.\n\nIt even offers me 144 hertz mode, even though the game doesn't even support it. It'll just go back to 60 hertz upon restarting.\n\n4. Some of the cars have 7 gears, just like my TH8A shifter, but you can even shift into the 7th gear on cars that don't even have 7 gears. It will display that you're in 7th gear, but it won't accelerate any further. That's just ridiculous and shows how much the programmers thought about what they're doing.\n\nIf you have one of the wheels that are supported or use a controller, this might be a good game for you, though it's quite hard to play with a controller if you don't use assists at later stages in the game.","March 25, 2015","false","9.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

I had played this game on PS3 when it came out and I remember it as a fun experience. When I booted it up on PC, however, I could tell that functionality for this PC port was not one of the Developers' priorities. I struggled through the settings menu to fix the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ default graphics and to set up my G27. After about 20 minutes of closing and rebooting the game for the settings to be applied, I finally got in game to the prologue, I guess it could be called, or the tutorial. The forced practice lap after a forced two minute long cutscene. It was almost imposible to control the car! Even without other AI vehicles on the track! Once I finished the lap, it gave me the settings I wanted to adjust, by the way there isn't a settings option when in-game, the assists. I turned them all off. I finally get into the actual first race and the ♥♥♥♥ing behavior of the AI was god damn horrendous. The car didn't respond to my inputs. For those reading and preparing a lecture on how cars actually work in real races and how I know nothing of the real world phyisics, please spare me. The mother mcfreaking car would. not. turn. Then when it would, it would over steer. It was like there was still another sneaky mother ♥♥♥♥ing drive assist that I couldn't turn off.\nNot to mention the freezes, crashes, and glitches that occure damn near constantly.\nI really wanted to like this game because of the nestalgia but it didn't live up to any expectations.\n\nThis was almost the worst $4.39 I've ever spent.

After 29 hours, I finished the game. Granted - I'm missing about 10 stars out of 1125 or something, but the requirements for those stars are so arbitrary, I'm not even going to bother.\n\nGraphics: 4/5\nSound: 5/5\nAI: 2/5\nReplayability: 2/5\nOnline: 0/5\nSoundtrack: -20/5\n\nThis game has its highs and lows. I will say that the interior views for the cars are amazing - NFS: Shift is the only game I've played that featured a cockpit view of the AE86, which not even Polyphony Digital (makers of Gran Turismo) could not do. Aside from the cool interiors, decent HUD effects, and sound, the game is not really all that great.\n\nThe AI is absolute trash, and WILL ram you on turn one of any track. The thing that disgusted me the most was the gratuitous use of rubberbanding, which only activated once the AI realizes you have a good chance of passing them.\n\nThe in-race missions are okay, except for the ones that require you to spin out/tap out an opponent. As a racing game veteran, there is nothing that I hate more than dirty racing, and this game requires you to smash opponents for stars in certain races. To add insult to injury, when you DO attempt to smash the enemies, you might as well be crashing your car into a wall, because pit maneuvers and other various tactics do not work, and instead will spin you out.\n\nSometimes, races require you to perform clean laps as a mission. This is extremely do-able on tracks with more than one lap. This is NOT do-able on Nurburgring. Because of Nurb's narrow track, and the AI's awful racing line, you will either be hit, or you will hit someone. If you try to race clean, you will never make it into first. That was another mission I did not bother doing.\n\nOnline was non-existent. I selected quick match at peak online gaming hours (10pm EST - 2am EST) and did not find a single match. The game still gave me the option to create a match, and I could post my leaderboard stats online, so I arrived at the conclusion that the servers are up, but nobody plays this online.\n\nI completed this game because I enjoyed NFS as a kid. If I had to rank it out of games that I've played out of the franchise, I'd rank it NFSU2 > Pro Street > Shift > NFSU1.\n\nI picked this game up for $5 because it was on sale, and I think that is the only circumstance that you as the reader should pick this up. This game is NOT worth $20.\n\nThe soundtrack is ridiculously ♥♥♥♥ too. I just played the game with my Eurobeat collection running in the background.","May 10, 2014","true","29.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Very easy to get this set up to your liking.\n\nI also love the full customization when it comes to controller assignments.  You'd think that would be standard, but shockingly, there are a few high profile games out there that still don't allow it.\n\nGame looks and plays great, carreer mode is reasonably fun, and challenge levels and driver assists are very wide ranged.

Sure, it's an ok game, but the NFS standard has been raised so high for it to be dropped on its head like this.\n\nMaybe it was better back in the day, but it pales in comparison with other NFS titles, mainly NFS: Hot Pursuit (whether you're talking about the new one from 2010, or the older one, NFS3:HP from 1998). The handling of the cars is atrocious, and other reviewers have done a far better job of explaining its shortcomings than I ever could, but steering sucks, acceleration sucks (AI can always accelerate faster than you even when you're in the same cars, and they can always corner better than you can by supplanting the physics of the game and taking curves without sliding; you aren't allowed to do that though!). Touch the steering wheel at the wrong time and you spin out. Run off the track for more than a second, and you get a warning and your time doesn't count. Run off the track too many times, and it's race over for you! Come to a complete stop and then wait about 5 seconds for the game to register that you can drive again. Hate a particular trial? Too bad, you have to master it to continue. Forget overtaking your opponent on most of the time trials...unless you get in front of him somehow in the first turn, he's gone and you can never catch up; you have to get right in front of him and stay there, blocking him from passing the whole time. Not fun!!\n\nThe unacceptable cons of this game make it unenjoyable to me. Pair that with racetrack only driving and it's not enough to keep me interested.\n\nSorry to say this is my least favorite NFS game I've ever played, and I have played most of them with the exception of maybe Undercover, Rivals, World, and The Run. It never offers anything fun and exciting, just frustration and more frustration.","October 9, 2015","false","2.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The controls are bad, the physics engine is a joke. Frankly, I was quite dissapointed - I was hoping for an arcade racer with NFS style controls and gameplay that would just let me race around tracks and circuts with no crazy storylines or weird gameplay modes. I had high hopes for this game, and I really wanted to give it a chance but after just over an hour of play and a good thirty races under my belt I just wasn't having any fun.

But even with, the game is insanely hard to control.\n\nThis game is completely unplayable. On a totally reasonable machine the frame rate is awful. The steering takes forever to respond so you fishtail off the track constantly. And the worst part is, you can't skip any cut scenes and you cant modify graphic settings or control settings in game, and there's only career mode when you start. so you have to watch all the cutscenes (which bug out and play 2 to 3 times in a row) at the begining of the career, find out the controls are still impossible, and then you can't even quit back to the menu, so you have to force quit and restart to change your settings. and being an EA game they make you watch their stupid logo every single time you turn the game on and warnings about driving.  I've done the first and second race a bunch of times now and i can't find a way to even control the game.\n\nI've owned hundreds of games in my life, dozens of racers, and Ive never been more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that a company has the audacity to sell this.","January 1, 2014","false","3.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

But its a Racetrack racer similar to Pro Street. But I preferred this game to NFS prostreet.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean i'd recommend it to anyone other than a Die-Hard racer. Any Gran Turismo/Forza will do better if you want a Race track racer, and If you want customisation. Both GT and Forza have Customisation elements, but not like NFS. And there is a Xp "grind" that gives the RPG like rewards and challenges, which I honestly did not enjoy.\n\nOverall. Better than Shift 2 that I played on PS3, but still not like the Innovation that NFSU brought. Only get if you're a Die-Hard racer type, or a Fan of grindy-Racing games (Just get Forza 5).

Going flat out, it will give the Bugatti Veryron SS a run for its money. However, this game is old, and despite the presence of the Veyron in the game, the fastest car is the Pagani Zonda R.\n\nHow could this happen you ask? Well, NFS Shift is a racing simulator, so its main focus is on stuff like horsepowers, downforce, grip, and coachwork damage. When you add up all those numbers, the only outcome can be that the track-optimised Zonda R is the best. It is light, has a stupidly big wing on the back. Points and fins sticking out to maintain that perfect racingline. The Veyron is too fat, the GTR too weak, the Reventon is too silly and the Vette is too uncontrollable. And the game knows this. No matter what race you drive in higher tiers, the one in first place will be a Zonda R, or you...in a Zonda R.\n\nThe game is a Zonda R sim then. It tries to emulate the laws of physics on the track, so it is imperative you understand the properties of traction. You can't floor it and shoot off. You'll spin in place. So you need to gently feather it. That is, if you turn all the assists off. The game offers you assistance with everything; braking, accelerating, turning, the works. However, the point is that it controls like a shed on an ice rink. Turn right = either going right too fast and spin, or go right slowly and go off.\n\nYou can like this kind of realistic driving, but I favour a more arcade approach. I like exotic supercars and doing 200mp/h on the straight, but this game, just is too narrow, too scarce. It is brutally overshadowed by newer, more inclusive racing games. On top of that, the game's soundtrack is a collection of nails on chalkboard. Luckily you don't have to hear it because the engine noise is overly loud. The coolest part though is your ability to paint your car in some funny ways. Unfortunately, if that is the staying point of your game, then you need to reevaluate your priorities.\n","March 10, 2014","false","12.2"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","2","13","0","0"

Need for Speed SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars.\n\nPlayers are thrust into the loud, visceral, intense, athletic experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driver’s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge.\n\n- True Driver's Experience - A variety of visual cues delivers the true driver’s experience including a three-dimensional HUD that mimics driver head movement, inertia and G-forces. The depth of field also adjusts based on the speed of the car; so when the car is traveling at high speeds the perspective will shift to the distance putting the car/cockpit out of focus.\n\n- Driver Profile - What kind of driver are you? Driver profile tracks the player’s evolution as a race driver from event to event. This system is made up of a driver’s personality on the track, their success rate and any profile points and badges accrued all of which work together to create a tailor-made career and game play experience. Driver profile is pervasive throughout all modes: career and online.\n\n- Dynamic Crash Effect - When the player hits a static object or opponent car, the player will feel like they are 'taking damage'. A combination of visual and audio effects will leave the player disoriented and briefly disrupt the race.\n\n- Total Customization - Need for Speed SHIFT features a comprehensive customization option that lets the player tailor every aspect of the cars performance and styling. Go under the hood to upgrade and tune your vehicle to increase its performance.

I haven't played many racing games so I can't tell if it's one of the best, but it definitely is great.\n\nWhat can you ask from a simulator racing game? Maybe real cars, real tracks, real engine roars and such, sure, Shift has got all of them. Even more, it has an astonishingly realistic first-person camera, which is my favorite part. In this camera view you are the actual driver, seeing everything from behind the steering wheel. You can see the driver's hands turn the wheel as you steer, and reach down for shifting when you shift. You can see the driver's vision blur and hear gasps when you crash, and afterwards you see a clear crack on the wind shield. Even the dashboard is realistic, all the hands actually work, and the layout is different on every car. I've even driven a car whose driver seat is on the right.\n\nAside from the super realistic camera view, another highlight I've noticed is the variety of choices. For one, Shift is one of the few in the series with a difficulty setting. And of course there are always different levels of driving assistances you can choose from. To help you choose, Shift has even included a test run at the beginning, and recommended settings are shown to you after this test lap. It told me to go on "Easy", indicating I'm not the best driver :( Another interesting choice is about the in-game HUD. As before you can completely hide all HUD to feel more realistic, however in Shift you can adjust the amount of HUD with a button. So call it out when you need to check out some data, and hide it again after you're done.\n\nThere are also two driving styles you can choose from: presicion and aggression. You can either choose to be a driver with presicion, staying on the best line and clearing every turn without a single bump, or choose to drive aggressively and ram every car in sight out of the road. After each race you are awarded points for each of the two styles, and you level up with them, unlocking cool stuff.\n\nNow that I'm done with praising, let's move on to complaining. The number one complaint I've got is I CAN'T CONTROL THE MENU WITH MY CONTROLLER. As a result, I have to switch back and forth between keyboard and controller to play Shift. This is frustrating. Another problem is, after a profile is created, I can't rename it or delete it, at least not in-game. When creating a profile, the game asks for the save file's name, so I thought it wouldn't matter and entered a random "Save1". It turns out that my driver uses the same name, so now we've got a driver named "Save1". I feel like I'm deceived.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I use a set of bluetooth headphones. When I play with laptop speakers, occasionally my roommates may come in and complain about the noise, and I'll just turn on the headphones, and normally the sound will automatically switch. However this doesn't work with Shift: it doesn't seem to like my audio driver.\n\nIn conclusion, NFS: Shift is a very good racing simulation game. (Some may say it's actually a mix of arcade and simulation) It was the perfect answer to my need for another such game after ProStreet. I'm not a real-life racer, nor am I a pro racing gamer, so I'm not sure if Shift is realistic enough for the pros, but it sure is for me. It has minor problems, but they don't damage the overall experience too badly. Recommended to any racing gamer.\n\n+ realistic data\n+ realistic first-person view\n+ ability to adjust difficulty\n+ a test run that recommendeds difficulty settings\n+ two driving styles to choose from\n+ no in-game music by default : yes this is good\n+ easy tuning\n+ easy money\n- somehow NFS always hates subtitles\n- inability to control the menu with controller\n- lack of drifting tutorial\n- final event unlocked too early\n- reward cars can't be used in career\n- inability to switch audio device in-game\n- credit roll is on a loop : what were they thinking?\n8 out of 10, excellent.","December 12, 2014","true","31.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you unlock the faster cars, the driving just stops being fun. It's a bit weird, since in most racing games one is most anxious to reach the high-performance tiers, however here it just feels like you are riding the brakes constantly, since most of the courses are very tight.\n\nAlso, there are a bunch of bugs in this game which start to get rather annoying. High-speed collisions can result in a car being "stuck" halfway inside of the pavement. The drift races are not much fun at all and actually rather tedious to complete. It feels like the drifting was added in as a last-minute feature; it should have just been left out of this game entirely.","January 6, 2015","false","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I actually bought it just for that reason so I can race using old cars against newer contemporary cars.

I would recommend this to anyone who either loves cars and racing or enjoys the NFS series.\n\nPositives:Amazing amounts of customizability on cars. Like wheels, everyone likes their own type of wheel.\nRealistic drifting, because drifting is actually a hard thing to do and master, unlike lots of games show.\nChallenging, and if it isn't, make it harder, make the AI harder, turn traction control off if that isn't hard enough, please consider playing this professionally or something because you are that brilliant. or alternately you could make it childishly easy.\nCar tuning, make a car yours by tweaking it perfection.\nCar choices, although you might want to get the DLCs for this, there is a decent range of cars to choose from, and they are created somewhat equal, there is no one car that is going to destroy the competition.\n'Bosses', they aren't all the same OP driver, they actually have different ways of driving which you have to adapt to win.\nLevelling, actually feels rewarding. although it can feel a little slow, there are ways to make it much, much faster.

It takes some practice, but it seems anyone can get a hang of handling their vehicle quite quick. As well I like the control you have over your car visually and as well how it's tuned, unlike NFS Hot Persuit (2010).\n\nHowever there are only two downsides. I've found that there were a few senarios that the menu was forcing me to either continue playing, or else force the game shut. Yet one problem that is game breaking is if the window is no longer in focus, it will crash.\n\nIt's a great game in general and a fun one to play with your friends.","June 19, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls (keyboard) feel clunky. Game is more of  generic driving simulator. Only reason I play this over a specific 2nd gen Euro Trucking Simulator is that it provides more action.

Everyone is talking about a sim-like feel to the cars and driving, personally I think this has nothing to do with reality. It's like trying to steer cookie dough shot out of a cannon at 250kmh, or something. What I'm trying to convey here is I think the steering feel of untouched and tuned cars alike is extremely elastic, and there is little to no feel about steering inputs. Don't know if GRID 2 can be considered anything like a simulation, but there is loads more feel to balancing the cars' steering inputs and acceleration/braking in it. Not much time with the game yet, and frankly I don't think there will be too much more. These thoughts are based on playing with a keyboard. Yes, a keyboard, I've played all my racing games on a keyboard.\n\nEdit after a little more time: definitely cannot recommend the game, the physics of it all have nothing to do with actually driving a car fast or slow. On some cars some weird bumps on the road send you bouncing like a rubber ball? And again the steering and acceleration/braking inputs and feedback are very bad.","June 22, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All those mentioned being good (except Grid 1 I don't care for, too touchy).\n\nFor N4S Shift it is original or different from the others mentioned in that it is not a SIM but not pure arcade either (most racers noted fit into one or the other category), it fits a good balance between pick up quick fun (without needing to get all into it with a steering wheel) with realistic elements like heavy braking and not always going full throttle.  No music, just roaring engines too, a good change up for N4S. TONS of upgrades, tracks and type of race events to mix it up so you can get 25-50+ hours if you wanted.\n\nSHIFT probably is not the best hybrid (some sim some arcade elements) racer on the market (haven't tried The Crew or many others that may fit that profiel) since its a few years old too, but its a good racer for a reasonable price.

All those mentioned being good (except Grid 1 I don't care for, too touchy).\n\nFor N4S Shift it is original or different from the others mentioned in that it is not a SIM but not pure arcade either (most racers noted fit into one or the other category), it fits a good balance between pick up quick fun (without needing to get all into it with a steering wheel) with realistic elements like heavy braking and not always going full throttle.  No music, just roaring engines too, a good change up for N4S. TONS of upgrades, tracks and type of race events to mix it up so you can get 25-50+ hours if you wanted.\n\nSHIFT probably is not the best hybrid (some sim some arcade elements) racer on the market (haven't tried The Crew or many others that may fit that profiel) since its a few years old too, but its a good racer for a reasonable price.  Since i ride motorcycles, hoping for a better biker games in the future, hint EA!","July 19, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rest is pretty good and tough to master. Go into a corner too fast and you're skidding right into the curb.\n\nFor some reason there's a whole bunch of cars in my garage that I can't use. I've no idea why they're there. There's a bit too much unskippable splash and glamor and your race stats (precision/aggressive) flash away too fast for you to read them.\n\nThe driving's good though.\n\n7/10","June 13, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dirt 3 and Grid 2 run at a silky-smooth 144 fps througout, but I was looking for a more sim-like racer, so I gave the Shift games a shot. I figured they should run great, since they were both released over 5 years ago during the last console generation. However, Shift 2 somehow struggled to maintain a mere 50 fps on my 8-Core, 4.2 ghz processor and GTX 970. A 360/PS3 game.\n\nOkay, fine, I figure. Bad optimization. I'll try the first Shift game instead. This game might be great, but I'm not going to play it the way it looks for me. The graphics options can't be changed from the default 60hz, medium-detail, no-AA settings, no matter how many times I save the game or try to edit my config file. You have to restart the game to change graphics settings, and those settings inexplicably reset every time you restart the game. Apparently some other Steam user who had this problem was able to work some kind of witch-doctor scheme to get his graphics settings to keep from resetting every time he launched the game. What he described did not work for me, and my patience is spent.\n\nEA, it is not my job to get your awful 5+ year old console ports working and running like they should on my enthusiast-level gaming computer. Say what you will about Microsoft, at least the Forza Motorsport 6 beta looks and runs great on my PC. So Microsoft gets my money in the future instead of you.","May 22","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a big step up from NFS ProStreet (which was the game that started this NFS racing sim business).\n\nThe driving feels good compared to ProStreet and frankly speaking, all of the other games in the NFS series. It feels fun and kinda realistic which makes it challenging somewhat but it doesn't ruin the experience (if you tweak the settings enough to your liking). It's not on par with games like Forza but I'd say as far as NFS games go, this is by far one of the best ones (keep in mind that I am mostly judging it from a gameplay\driving physics perspective).\n\nWhat I didn't like was that the game kinda got repetitive after a while, especially given that you had access to every car and upgrade very early in the game, and had stupid amounts of money as long as you completed all the races. Still, it's not a very long game so it isn't that annoying.\n\nThe soundtrack was good for the most part. It felt like it had too few songs and it kinda got repetitive after a while. Maybe there just weren't that many songs that I enjoyed.\n\nPerformance wise, this game runs at a solid 60 FPS in 1080p (and probably all the way up to 4K) at max settings on my i5 4460 and GTX 980 Ti rig, on Windows 10. There aren't any game breaking bugs that I am aware of. There are some frame rate issues though. Any sort of crash (even hitting small objects) will result in a couple or more skipped frames and this includes crashes done by the AI, at the far end of the track, potentially miles away from you. This is some sort of glitch I think that can affect gameplay to some extent but most of the time the game delivers the frames on time (unlike other games in the series I could mention *cough all the NFS games from Most Wanted to Undercover).","May 24","true","37.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
