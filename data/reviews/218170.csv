My first level 80 character in any MMO, ever. :)\n\nIn getting from 63 to 80, I continue to feel like it wasn't much of a grind at all, even though in two zones I ran out of solo quests to do and was forced to move on before I felt ready to leave. Levels 75 to 80 were a bit harder. First I went to Keshatta, and died a lot. Then I went to the Tarantia Common District, and died a lot more. Keep in mind that since I don't group very often, and thus basically never go into dungeons, I have played the entire course of the game with nothing more than the usual green and some blue (rare) drops, which is to say, some of what my main was wearing was pretty bad. :) This was never really a problem until I got to these two zones, and the Common District in particular, which has a lot of powerful mobs. It's probably the one zone I have found to be the most frustrating in the entire game to date. Still, I made do, and swapping between these zones, plus doing some repeatable quests here and there, was okay.\n\nBut! There has been something else to keep my attention too.\n\nIn December, Funcom added a new and permanent feature to the game: the Twelve Portents. These are "world bosses", one for each month of the year. One boss appears per month, and only for one week at a time, in a specific location. They are raid-level bosses so a great number of players are required to bring them down...but they don't require actual organized raids to do. These bosses sit out in the open (and are easily avoided if you don't care to partake) and anyone of ANY level can help fight it so long as the character can get into the zone and make it to the spawn point. I've gotten raid-level gear from these bosses, and now that I'm level 80, it means I can use it. Very spiffy stuff!\n\nStill having loads of fun, and looking forward to getting into the endgame content now. :)\n\n----------\nJanuary 8, 2014:\nI have been playing this game on and off for over a year and recently downloaded it through the Steam client to begin tracking the amount of time I actually put into it. :)\n\nI really enjoy this game. I play primarily solo with three characters in various stages of levelling: one at 63 and the other two are in their 20s. I primarily like this game because of how much solo content it has. I don't feel pressured to "have" to raid or team up if I don't want to--which is something I felt other MMOs basically force players into after about level 40 or so.\n\nSome people have commented on the Steam forums that levelling to 80 is "such a grind"--I don't agree. Each of my characters have different roles and I'm levelling them in different areas of the game, and each of them has been a reasonably unique experience. Sure, some of the quest content is a bit static--gathering or harvesting quests, for example. But in every zone I've been in I always run across quests which I find quite interesting story-wise. You can tell where someone has put a lot of thought into the more complex quests. The dedicated solo content for character progression is really neat too. Every time I get to go to a new zone I'm inevitably wowed by how it looks.\n\nIs the game easy for a solo player? No. I die a lot. Does this mean it's stupid hard? Not at all. There's always something else to do or another way to defeat the enemy. The key is getting to know your character class and making the best of how that class works.\n\nOther Steam users have also said the community for this game is supposedly "garbage". I can't really comment on that... Playing solo means I don't have any real exposure to it. But! Quite frequently I have been rescued/buffed/randomly traded better gear from other players who just happened to be running by when I was getting blapped or otherwise minding my own business. At times I've been politely invited to team up with players who are obviously doing the same kinds of quests as me and I've had fun with them. The one time I have asked for help in the general chat I got loads of helpful feedback. So...my experience is positive. Besides, I don't play the game for the community...I play for the game.\n\nThe GM support for this game is amazing. I've had to submit petitions a couple of times because I got stuck or couldn't complete a quest due to a bug. Responses and live support while logged into the game itself came back within four hours and once within 20 minutes. In another MMO I play, you're lucky if you get any kind of reply in a week or two. Tech support outside the game has been really good too. I have a recurring hang issue which the techs have been working with me on for a good month. Even when I was frustrated and a bit short with them they were always friendly and patient.\n\nThe graphics are great. There is a DX9 and a DX10 client so you can use whichever one best matches your hardware. I use the DX9 one and while sometimes I can see obvious texture borders and some jaggies despite playing on high quality settings, it's not a huge deal. The zones still blow me away: god rays, foliage that reacts to my character running through it, etc. The first time I found fish jumping up a waterfall I just stopped and watched for a while.\n\nDepending on the importance or complexity of the quest or character offering the quest, there is voice acting. When I was new to the game I figured the voice acting was something I would only see while I was "new" and it would quickly end. Nope! Characters are still talking to my level 63 character. The quality of some of the voice acting could be better but for the most part it's quite good for a free to play game.\n\nI do have a subscription, so all of the areas of the game are open to me. If I was doing free to play, some dungeons and a certain zone would be closed to me. I don't do dungeons that often so I don't think anyone who only wants to play for free should feel they would be missing out. There is so much other content to do, even for groups. The rewards given for having a subscription can be pretty good. I have two level 80 mounts that I'm looking forward to being able to use, and they were given to me because I have had an active sub. :)\n\nEven though the game is free, Funcom is still actively developing it. Character classes were rebalanced in the last year and further changes are planned for things like the crafting system.\n\nIf I had to pick something I don't like about the game, it would be the crafting system. It is clunky, and if you want to build a guild city it's also quite expensive (in-game funds). My other complaint might be the tutorial system. There are tutorials in the game and they do pop up at certain times, but I think some areas of gameplay aren't covered as well as they could be, and certain things are hard to find information on at all. Getting to know your character class can be a bit of a challenge too--for example, I didn't really know which attributes were the most useful for my main's class until someone pointed out that the character stats window has tooltips for certain text areas that say which classes benefit from those stats. There's nothing about the design of the window that would have led me to believe I should hover my mouse! Having said that, the UI is pretty minimal and non-intrusive, which is definitely nice.\n\nIf you're wanting a fantasy-based MMO that isn't all about the raids, definitely download AoC and give it a try. It's free so the only thing you have to lose is the bandwidth and some hard drive space. I recommend playing until at least level 25 or 30 (which doesn't take that long) before deciding whether to stick with it, so your character can leave the starting area of Tortage, which allows an opportunity to experience the game at large.","January 8, 2014","true","385.7"," 109 of 116 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","109","116","2","1"

I'm not a big fan of mindless gathering and grinding, or pay-to-win PvP.  And sometimes, I just like to be left alone.  But, since I enjoy the Conan mythos, I decided to give AoC a try.  Besides, at free-to-play, the price was right.\n\nAge of Conan isn't revolutionary, but it certainly exceeded my expectations.  I joined the PvE server, and I have the luxury of playing it as a single-player game when I want to, and teaming up when I don't.  Even playing solo, levelling up occurs at a reasonable pace thanks to the hundreds of quests to discover and complete.  The character classes are balanced enough for PvE that you can choose one to suit your play style without having to worry about being too gimpy to advance.  And, what I like best of all, is that there are certain single-player Destiny Quests centering around the plot advancement of your own character.  Just imagine?  An MMO with a little plot.  So, all in all, there's really nothing to lose by taking a chance on the free play.\n\nJust a warning, though - free play can be satisfying, but only up to level 80.  Even though 80 is max level, subscription players will continue to advance through an Alternate Advancement tree - so level 80 isn't really the end of your character's evolution.  But even if you play to 80 and don't choose to buy a subscription, just getting there can be worth the trip.","June 21, 2014","true","236.2"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","60","64","0","0"

The glue that has held AOC together was the players. That glue is losing it's integrity. The PVP code was easy for Hackers to breach and inject their own sub routines in. In fact each PVP mini-game seems to have at least one hacker in it. Funcom allows this. They also allow gold spammers. When issues of exploits are brought up in the Funcom forum's they act like the NAZI Descendents they always wanted to be. They stifle free speech and communication. They have added no new content to the game since RoTG. In short they took all of the Sub money from AOC and used it for TSW. In addition the former CEO the week before TSW launched sold all of his stock when he knew that Funcom was tanking. This triggered a raid at Funcom HQ. They have consistently lied to their subscribers.\n\nThe game has many bug's that are serious enough to hinder game play. Grinds are excessively long and ranking /renown system is broke this limits what dungeons you can enter and raids you can join.\n\nIt is a cash shop money mill your FTP account will have no storage space, you cannot complete the main destiny quest, you will be spammed to "Go PREMIUM" each and every time you log in. You will not have access to most of the content of the game as you have to buy each "Country seperate" and if you cancel your sub you lose access to what you paid for. In short when you see FUncom. Remember what that FU stands for.\n\nThe Game is dying and hopefully FUncom will die as well. I hope the entire funcom staff chokes to death on Legos.","April 15, 2015","false","475.4"," 138 of 189 people (73%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","73","138","189","51","12"

This may be my favorite game of all-time. It is definitely up there on the list of all-time greats. Why do I like this so much? For starters I am a huge Conan fan. The first movie (the only movie) the graphic novels, I own all the original Robert E. Howard stories. So as you can see I'm a big fan. So am I just a fanboy that would thumbs up this game no matter what? Quite the opposite. I would generally be over critical when it comes to a game made of my favorite fantasy world but they nailed it. Better than I could have ever imagined. Here is why I like it so much...\n\n- Best classes in any MMORPG hands down. Goes far beyond human, elf, orc, etc..\n- The music to each zone is like the best hollywood soundtrack for a classic movie. Outstanding.\n- Combat feels fun. Doing combos and executing fatalities has not grown stale after close to 150 hours of gameplay.\n- Graphics and world layout are wonderful. From the swaying of the grass in the grasslands to the snow-tipped mountains of Cimmeria to the deserts of Stygia and everything else. The animals that roam the countryside that prey on each other to the huge capital city. The world is very much alive and fun to traverse.\n- The brutality and mature theme. I wanted a rated R MMORPG. They delivered.\n\nI could go on but you get it. Here is another reason I love this game. I have played every asian kung fu themed game from here to the great wall and none have done it for me until I played the AoC expansion "Rise of the Godslayer" and made it to the far east in Khitai. The area is so well done. The questing is fun. The dungeons are awesome and very challenging. Rather than offering a very family friendly colorful crouching tiger experience, AoC offers a wicked 36 Chambers type experience that I was missing in all other asian games.\n\nIt is not the perfect game by any means. On PvP servers gankers are everywhere. The apprentice system is nice but if not used, when in a group with a higher level character it doesn't encourage team work. It is an older game so the player pop is lower than in some new games so finding dungeon mates can be tough at times. Definitely get with a good guild. It is F2P so players can buy top level gear if they want. If that bugs you.\n\nBut the Pros outweigh the Cons heavily IMO.\n\nIf you are looking for an adult, low-fantasy, brutal, beautiful, vast open world with open world PvP (or not depending on your server) AoC is one of the greatest games ever made in this guy's humble opinion.

Thankfully, new content is coming out after years of stagnation, but it still feels like I'm watching something suffer.\n\nThis game is a pinnacle of potential, in drawing from rich lore, a great visual engine, one of the BEST melee combat systems ever created and an eager fan base, but ultimately has become a textbook study of bad leadership and worse followership. If you can somehow get past all of that, though, you may find the game beautiful and addicting as I have.

The combat is not really action based. The skill is in making sure you wait for pats in each area before running in.\n-Gameplay is sadly vanilla wow like pointless questing designed to keep you in the game as long as possible to earn as much subscription time as possible. It does create memories though like only vanilla wow did..\n\nIf you're bored and looking for something else, this is recommended. Leave it for that moment and it will shine.","November 27, 2014","true","71.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","1"

But if you want to play with friends, you can forget it.  Like many games, this has went with the horribly idiotic 'servers within servers' shard style idea, where there are multiple 'instances' even for the main world.  (Honestly, we've seen MMO's put the ENTIRE world on a single server, why do we have to deal with shards?)\n\nThis is a workable albeit annoying idea in any game that does it, but at least in those other games, you can easily change the instance, in this one.. not so.. you can ONLY change instances at a resurrection point/graveyard.  And you HAVE to change instances every time you enter a new area as a member of a team.  Unlike most games, if you're a member of a team and enter into a new area, you are NOT put into the instance other team members are in. You are put into your own instance of the area and then have to switch... good luck switching when you have a team member enter an area that DOESN'T have a res point.\n\nThen of course, there's the horribly annoying combat (which can luckily be gotten around by being a spellcaster).  Far too many MMO's these days are wanting to go the 'action' route, instead of the more strategically minded 'autoattack plus abilities' route.  If you want to melee in this game, you have a left attack, overhead attack, and right attack that must stay on your keyboard, along with any of your attack 'casts' that you want to use because they have to combo together to be useful.  Nice idea, love the combo thought, but the way it works out with plain attacks is just horrible.\n\nYes, the game is free-to-play, but one of the worst limiting ones I've seen, there's only two tiers (free and subscription) as opposed to the 3 tier most f2p's have. There IS multiple instances that you are not allowed into if you are free, so you most certainly do not have access to full content without subscribing, and a portion of your character advancement even is locked to you if you aren't a paying member.\n\nOn the good side, there is voice acting for npc's and the world so far feels right for the Conan universe.\n\nOverall the game DOES have some interesting ideas, but their implimentation is terrible and I could honestly only recommend this game to someone if I absolutely hated them.","December 21, 2013","false","21.4"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","28","50","0","0"

I played about 20 hours outside of Steam, so Im writing this at around 80 hours of play time and at level 39.\n\nDo not let the starting area fool you!!\nYou'll start out in an area that some people feel to be a bit limiting, but once you finish in that area (it goes quickly... and its a good place to learn how to play) youll be dropped in your racial starting area, though you can go wherever you want at this  point; youre now in the actual open world.\n\nI did a few quests in each area, just to enjoy the varied scenery.\n\nSo far, I havent had to spend a single cent. I did, however spend $10 and got some cosmetic armor for fun (and to give back to the developers), but since it was just cosmetic armor, I can say that I didnt have to spend a cent so far and am really having a lot of fun.\n\nJust give it a try, and if the starter area turns you off, just push through and youll really start to enjoy it once you get to your real starter area... but to be honest, I enjoyed the starter area, so, feh.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to mention... I dont PvP and have no input on the PvP system. For me, PvP always seems to boil down to people whining about anyone beating them being over powered or hacking, or whatever. PvP ends up (IMO) being groups of immature sociopaths who act like spoiled 13 year olds. Sorry if that rubs anyone the wrong way. But thats why I avoid PvP. I cant lose myself in the story and lore of a game when I have to constantly be on guard for someone hiding in the bushes and waiting till a mob wears me down enough for them to jump out and "pwn" me and then call me "n00b."

Its environments are spectacular and hold up graphically better than many other newer games, even after six years.

At end game (level 80) if you don't like raiding or PVP, you will probably grow bored with this game. Unfortunately, Funcom did not put enough continuous RPG elements into the game to make end game repeatably enjoyable.

Dated graphics and interface, as well as combat system. Not a bad game, it has a slight feel of the Conan world, mostly thanks to music and suggestion of adult themes, monsters & magic. Play is kind of reminiscent of Everquest, maybe that's not fair, it's been a while, maybe Everquest II would be fair. I've got every setting maxed and I can't get it to look like the screenshots posted on the store page [i7 4770K with a GTX 770]. It's livable, and I'm certain it gains in depth and fun at later levels. In two hours I made level 5, got some rags to wear, and made it to the first town. I think It's an ok time killer, but better RPG options are out there I think. Cash Shop makes it's presence known at every turn, launch, and exit and in game, if you click a button or look at your inventory. It's not impossible to ignore, it's just you have no doubt what kind of game your in. While it might be fun for a group of adventurers, I would never pay money for the quality of play or content I've seen so far.\n\nFinal thoughts, get your Barbarian fun on, but save your cash shop investments for a more up to date game. 5/10 assuming it gets better later on.","January 30, 2015","false","2.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Glaring bad problem i have seen is Gray people and critters everywhere, i guess you have to look at a direction to download all the skins for what players and npcs in your field of view.  Has voice acting and several choices for your conversations.   You can remove your clothes and look at your naked body.  Storyline is after Conan is king somewhere.  I don't like pvp so started on a pve server.  Has different classes and specializations system.  No customization of your body looks, i think it just random picks your looks while you are creating your avatar.  You have a very small inventory, which i guess to force you buy store points to increase the size. You start with 2 slots for avatars. There are several classes you have to buy with store points.\nGive it a try, it is free.

Amazing atmosphere, great graphics, unique combat system with combos and fatalities and spellweaving for casters, solid world PVP and the endgame PVE wasn't too shabby either.  Problem is the devs put the nail in the coffin some time ago when they let this game crumble.  People learned to exploit sieges and devs thought we would all want to mine rather than pvp in the new PVP zone :/  They ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the PVPers and everyone quit.  I haven't gone far enough in this since it went FTP but I'm sure the player base isn't high enough to find good PVP anywhere or even any PVE.  Since it's free it's worth trying out and if you have some friends you can get through the 6 mans but all of the raids require 24.  Just be sure to read up on server populations so you don't get stuck on a dead one, apparently pve-rp crom is the highest pop but then you can't world pvp :/  HACKFLASH :) :)","May 13, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Although you will run into your average low level gankers and spawn campers in PVP realms, what can you expect... it's PVP >.>, the positive experience and high quality gaming that you are able to experience is amazing. Considering it is a free game, somewhat overwhelming at first. Overall Two thumbs up, amazing game!

all night just to download, and I uninstalled it.\n\nI cannot give a full review of this game, but what I can give is a review of the tutorial mission, and a suggestion to the devs and hopefully other devs who might read this.\n\nThe tutorial, is boring, just flat out boring.\nBasic outline, you start off on the coast of this island after a ship wreck, and fight your way into the first town, there you do day missions (multiplayer) or night mission (single player/the only way to progress).\n\n\nThe night mission I had was very poorly explain to me, it mentioned staying out of the light and using stealth, took me a while to realise there was a hide ability I needed to use the whole time.\nHowever, you need to pump points into this ability to use it effectively, also not explained.\n\nThe Second mission has you climb, which at that point I figured out how to pump in points and put a few in climb.\nI was told to get to the roof and spy on someone.\n\nThe closest X to me (leading me to believe I had to go there) had nothing there.\nI stood around, tried to find where to climb from, and nothing happened.\nI looked online and found out you press U to climb (this is explained in game as well, I just hadn't seen it yet).\nP ressed U everywhere, and nothing worked.\nThen I went to the second X instead, and a prompt came up "you can climb here" I walked around for about 5 minutes pressing U and the game kept saying "not close enough" over and over again, which also annoyingly spammed my chat window.\n\nIt took my forever to notice that there was a ladder right behind one of the guards.\nNow, the npc who gave me these night missions quite clearly told me, DO NOT FIGHT THE GUARDS, DO NOT BE SEEN.\nApparently. that's total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, because after failing to sneak behind him, I killed him and nothing happend.\nIn fact I wouldn't of been able to get around him if I didn't kill him.\nTher ladder by the way was NOT lit up, nor are any other climbable areas (which only certain spots are climbable, but the game doesn't tell you where)\n\nI climbed up, snuck around more guards, and finally found the spot for the mission and heard the dialog.\n\n\nThe next few missions were merely fetch quests, but after that I had one to follow the same man I spied on, and I was supposed to follow him to the location of a scroll.\nI followed him for a few minutes, only to realize him pointing at a door at a specific spot was supposed to tell me that's where I needed to go, because he just keeps patroling forever otherwise.\nHe doesn't say anything to let the player know this is where you go, he just stops infront of the place, fiddles with his hands and leaves to keep patroling.\n\n\nFor all the voice work in this game, the NPCs feel lifeless and robotic in their actions during missions, patroling around like robots, and standing in big lines in obvious areas to keep you out.\nIt all feels like those user made missions in neverwinter.\n\nAnd the daytime mission area has about 20 different quest givers just thrown around the place.\nI just accepted some of the quests close to me, and of course they were all too high of a level for me.\n\n\nI just wish devs would make these little tutorial missions more hands on, and cut out all these side fluff, and if you're going to teach new players how your mechanics work, some ON SCREEN PROMPTS AND HIGHLIGHTED ITEMS, would help a whole bunch.\n\nInstead the tutorial area is like a giant quest hub, but the quests don't chain off of one another, instead you can go around and grab like 20 quests at once, and then your screen is flooded with objective markers.\nBut all of that is pointless for anything other than leveling, as the night mission zone (which can only be played by yourself) is where the story progresses, at it's slow boring pace.\nThe whole city is empty when you do this aside from a few guards who pop up depending on what part you're on, and a few drunken sailors in a certain area.\nIt just feels dead and empty and completely anti climactic.\n\n\n\n\nThe combat thus far is pretty basic as well, I've heard people go on and on about how the combat in this game is some of the best in any mmo, and I gotta say, while you can swing your weapon anytime, it still feels like one of those click and spam keys mmos.\nYou have 3 directional attack keys, left swing right swing and forword swing, some abilities require you to hit a specific directional key after clicking them to make them work.\n\nThe combat is still very much mobs sticking to you like glue, like all other mmos, and you using your skills till something dies.\nThere is nothing different about the feel to this combat than any other mmo.\nFrom what people told me about the game, I was expecting more action based combat, like Tera where the enemies actually have movement patterns, charge you, go behind you, and you can move/dodge and have weight to your attacks.\nIf this game doesn't get good till after the tutorial ,then I'm sorry but I just don't have that much time to waste in what is so far an unfun run of the mill ♥♥♥♥♥♥me, especially when it appears that so much basic content is behind a pay wall.\n\nI try to judge if I want to buy into a title based on how they treat their F2P players, and this one stinks out loud.\nYour inventory is so tiny you can't even carry the items you pick up on your way to the games very first vendor, and according to the site you can't even play more than 2 of the game raids if you're free 2 play.(which I imagine all of the serious raiders probably don't even screw around in those raids anymore)\n\nThis was a horrible waste of 10 hours downloading.","July 4, 2015","false","3.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review

I normally wouldn't bother saying this about an older game but this is touted as having "awesome" graphics and I certainly didn't find them.\n\nThe combat is terrible imo.. it feels very floaty and is poorly animated..\n\nWaste of time if you ask me.\n\nIf you're looking for a break from WoW-style combat I'd recommend trying something like Dragon's Nest, Vindictus, Neverwinter, Continent of the 9th Seal, and Dragon's Prophet. None of them are "perfect" but imo all are better than this and actually offer a more interesting action combat setup. Things like DN, Vindictus, and C9 can get painfully repetitive in their questing but unfortunately that seems to be a trend among many f2p games or MMOs in general.\nAnd no their graphics are not the most amazing thing ever created, but at least they don't claim to be and personally I prefer a unified cartoony style like in Dragon's Nest over low-textured "realism" clashing against a cartoon main character like Age of Conan..\n\nOh and please note the "release date 2013" listed on the store page is bull____. this game was actually released in 2008 and rebranded in 2010 apparently.","March 17, 2014","false","1.5"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

What's supposed to be lush jungle looks like someone ♥♥♥♥ green and put a bunch of plants on top. The character models are the only thing that look half-decent, but the animations are stiff and repetative, and some of the character models don't even look that great.\n\nThe combat seems fresh at first, but sadly the innovative mechanics of attacking where your enemy isn't guarding just become dull and repetative. Your enemies give no indication that they are shifting their defense in a certain direction aside from the large arrows surrounding them when you target them. It's a mechanic that deserves a place in a far better game.\n\nThe rest of combat feels stiff and unpolished, like most of the game. There's many questionable design desicions- for example, when you move while holding a bow, your character holds the bow in one hand and the arrow in the other. This doesn't sound so bad- Until you realize the character holds said arrow like it's a sword in a ham-fisted grip.\n\nThe game does, however, have a large variety of weapons and armor, and most of it's not your usual fantasy WoWclone gear. There is a large selection of stats and styles to choose from.\n\nLet's get this out of way. Yes, as a female character, you can run around topless. If you're a thirteen year old desperate for some poorly-rendered digital boobies, you might consider this a very cool feature. I like to think that the more adult people among us might at best shrug at this. If you really want to see digital ♥♥♥♥ that badly, go play Scarlet Blade. It's at least a finished game.\n\nThe UI is the most clunky and obtrusive UI I've ever seen in a MMO. It's sole function seems to be to break immersion and be difficult to navigate.\n\nThe other unique features in the game, climbing and sneaking, are ham-fisted and poorly implemented. You can only climb in select places that are so obvious they might as well have massive signs strapped to them, and sneaking detection is extremely irregular. I've walked directly in front of hostile guards during the day with them being completely clueless, and yet an enemy with his back turned to you at night is hyperaware and can aggro onto you  from 15 feet away.\n\nWhile everyone is voice-acted, the actual voice-acting is so flat and emotionless it might have been better not to have voice-acted the game at all. It's like the actors were aware of how dull and flat the quests they were being asked to voice were and couldn't be bothered to give a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nConan: Unchained feels like a game in early beta in spite of being out for several years. It's obvious the devs didn't give much of a rat's ♥♥♥ about putting out a polished game and instead just relied on the Conan name to sell it.\n\nTL;DR: Pros: bare ♥♥♥♥, a few interesing but poorly implemented mechanics, good selection of  weapons and armors. Cons: Graphics from the early 2000's, horrible UI, dull and repetative quests, flat and emotionless voice acting, horrible animations, generally unfinished game.\n\nFinal rating: 3 out of 10. A poor game.","September 17, 2015","false","5.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The active combat and atmosphere are superb and the graphics, story, and setting are all great but it suffers from a few flaws, mainly periods of inactivity.  When active this can be an exceptional PvP AND PvE game.  But some of its other flaws are no team balancing for minimatches which 90% of the time lead to one-sided pointless battles;  the open world PvP has NO lvl cap so level 80s can 1-2 hit lvl 20s, and some of the PvE quests are FORCED upon you AND they are solo.  AoC was mishandled in development in certain ways but still has a very high potential to be a grand, highly recommended, gaming experience.  The F2P limits that were at first ridiculously restrictive were laxed a while back, too.

It is an older MMO so it is a bit generic, but if you can look past it, it has a lot to offer for fans of Conan's world. I've read nearly every Conan story, short stories and novels. Robert E. Howard's are the best of course. He created Conan in the early 1930's and published his first Conan story around that same time. Howard is considered the father of the sword and sorcery genre, and I have read all of his original, unedited Conan stories, even his thought to be lost material.\nThis game has dated graphics and a dated but unique combat engine, but it is still satisfying to play with smooth controls, excellent sound and music, and nice effects. The tone of the world is a lot more mature and darker than other cartoon-ruined games, like World of Jack Black Kung Fu Panda Craft. Violence and naked breasts are never a bad thing to put in a game.

Utterly stunning. I hated the charge up attacks and spells. I am a more instant action type MMOer like with EQ2 or WOW. You hit your spell and it goes off or you swing your axe and immediately it hits your enemy. The combos are ok but nothing I would rave about. It is a grindy game. I am not sure what others have done but I usually try to go through all the quests if I see them but the majority were kind of uninspiring to me. Getting to level 20 was good the first time but having to do that every toon. Not something I enjoyed. Again EQ2 or WOW let you start in any of the lower zones you wanted. I know this is not those games but other start areas would have been great. And they have had years to do this now. Overall this MMO does nothing more than the otehrs do for me and maybe does less. If you like the lore that much or I should say the theme of Conan then you probably will like this no matter what I say. But if you want something new and innovative that ANYONE can get into and enjoy then this is probably not for you. I did not play this much on Steam but bought it back in the beginning so I have hundreds of hours into it and still have my toons if I want to log in but I have not for many months now. I do like MMOs but ones that are easy to figure out, simple to play and have moderate challenge but not hard. I do not PVP so I have no opinion on that. I am giving this a thumbs down for my own opinion not saying I will never play it again to kill some time. If you just like MMOs in general try it out for free but if you are looking for something new well a change of scenery is all I can see with this. I thought LOTR would change my opinion of MMOs like this one but I really had the same reaction to it after leveling for a while.

If you like the background, I guess this would be your thing, but dealing with endlessly respawning gorillas during a fetch quest is tedious. The voice acting is tolerable, the visuals are good and the world is pretty big.\n\nIn addition, all the men appear to be Scandanavian body builders and all the women appear to be lithe acrobats/courtesans. Both appear to find clothing undesirable.\n\nThe majority of the game comprises of you running back and forth between quest spawning terminals through at least one load zone. I do like how the game lets you complete a quest in your own "world" without the interference of other players, but other players are one thing that might actually make hide farming mildly interesting.\n\nThe feedback is alright, but I don't actually feel like I am inflicting that much damage on anything, and that all I am actually doing is chipping away at a healthbar. Same with the quests. "Go here, stab that, come back." That guy is bad because he has a red circle around the base of his model. A good number of the powers do not appear to be that useful, and I found myself spamming a small number of spells for great effect. A good number of players just summon three dozen unholy hosts and sit back and let them flay their enemies.\n\nI feel like I am not a necessary component of the game. I wanted to like the game, and I want to think that I just don't like MMOs. However, this game just does not have anything that is all that super interesting.\n\nOne technical aspect I feel I must mention is that this game is HUGE.

I've enjoyed a couple over the years (World of WarCraft, The Old Republic, Guild Wars 2) but I never got too into them and probably never invested more than a month of my time. I tell you this because perhaps Age of Conan does something groundbreaking or exceptionally well - for an MMO - that might just be lost on me.\n\nRegardless, Age of Conan really disappointed me.\n\nWhat initially drove me to try the game was the setting - a setting that I became familiar with through the two films from the 1980s among other things. It was my belief that the fantasy world of Conan was a grim and dark one filled to the brim with blood, gore, boobs, and brutality. Even though the game has earned an M rating though I really didn't see anything that justified it and the game world just didn't really feel like Conan.\n\nAdditionally the visual quality and design is just downright horrid. I know the game came out in 2008 but critics were still praising its "awe-inspiring" graphics as recent as 2011. Character models and NPCs just look plastic and ill-designed (there's something seriously wrong with their eyes) and the environments give off that stale, generic, and uninspired feeling.\n\nCombat is...unusual.\n\nAs opposed to how other MMOs tend to handle it (with hotkey abilities alongside a standard attack), Age of Conan has this really strange way of going about combat that just feels uncomfortable and never gets properly explained.\n\nQuests/missions are just generic MMORPG-types (fetch this, kill that, find and fetch/kill this).\n\nSimply put, even for the low price of "Free to Play" Age of Conan just doesn't feel worth my time and attention.","July 8, 2014","false","5.7"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

The tortage pack thats 9.99 is a scam because the beginning area will often times be pointless and moronicly difficult to justify the package of crap. MMO's are dead just find another game or genre.\n\nEDIT: Well do to popular downvoting from AOC ♥♥♥♥♥♥s I thought I would emphasize on why if you are interested in AOC why you should NOT bother with it. 1. Graphics are sub par and lag even on good rigs and ISP's. 2. The servers are almost completely empty, maybe a few hundred people still play this game. 3. Any players left are usually trolls who will jump around you and be obnoxious because they cant afford a WOW sub where all the REAL trolls are. 4. Tortage also known as nood island is a bland gift basket of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ repetitive quests and dull interactions. I would recommend a good dose of thorazine to find this turd in the rough entertaining. Now while it has some decent points of interest like char cus it quickly loses its appeal in how the game flows. It's like a big floating fart waiting to pounce into your nose and leave a bad taste.

This makes it very difficult to finish quests and unless you can afford to buy items using real money many quests will be impossible for people to achieve anything! You can not get powerful enough items to fight the tough bosses and the number 1 to 10 combat system is not the best, so i am currently level 34 and until i can afford to buy better equipment the game is impossible for me especially without a mount to ride to get around which takes a long time and in the game you cannot get 50 or more gold to buy one!

If you're looking for a quick compare, you'll find it similar to many other notable MMOs that you've played in the past.  Quick actions (left hook, stab, right hook) keep the game's combat interesting.  Combos can be activated by hitting the special attack and the right follow-up attack(s) to execute.  All in all, I'd give it 7/10, but MMOs aren't my main squeeze.","February 21, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Benefit of having characters since before it went F2P, though they're server locked and lost their names, which makes me not want to play anyway!)\n\nUpdate: They recently did a server merge and didn't bother to inform anyone on/after the day it was done (instead informing like a month prior), so I've lost all of my character names, just like SWTOR.

Think about that for a second.  You can actually get equipment that provides a tangible bonus to you beheading enemies.  My favorite in particular is for two-handed weapons.  You impale your foe on the weapon, then body check the handle to shove it the rest of the way through.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ *metal.*\n\nThat said, it's an excellent representation of Howard's stories.  At the very least play through Tortage, the newbie island.  Finishing all of the areas provides a pretty damn good tale and is easily soloable.

The end-game is very open-ended for players with time constraints. For example, most guilds run public raids at all times of the day usually tier 1 to tier 3. The tier 4 raids generally require a more dedicated guild. The dungeons in the game are top-notch. Equipment is important but skill and an optimized build are more important than gear. Age of Conan is by far the best MMO I ever played except for Asheron's Call.\n\nThe only thing I wish they would do is implement a group finder.

I started playing back in 2009 about a year after release and then stopped in 2012.  It was an amazing game, but I moved on to "better" mmos like GW2 and other newer more popular releases.  The short answer, nostalgia brought me back, and has kept me going.  The world is MASSIVE, and truly memorable.  Nothing like killing mobs in Ymirs Pass or leveling in Gateway to Khitai.  The endgame was, and is a little bit of a let down to me, it really is a gear grind, don't mistake that, BUT that being said the gear is really freaking cool.  Leveling is amazing, and i usually don't have more than one or two top levels in an MMO, but i have 9 out of the 12 for Conan, that has to say something.  If you love brutual, real, and memorable open worlds, this is the game! It is truly built to be your playground, if you look at it to be a perfect, feed you everything game, it won't do that, it is what you make of it.  I can not guarentee you will love this game, but regardless it is worth trying.  DO NOT GET DISCOURAGED BY THE OPENING ZONE, it may seem a little linear, and small, but it is not 1/10000000th of the game, keep going.","March 10","true","83.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Conan had some of that yes, but the world that they created around it just popped. As a fan of Robert E Howard I must say: The creators clearly took the time and did their homework. The atmosphere is so thick you can cut it with a knife. This is one of the few MMOs I can think back on and say "Yeah that was pretty cool". Now it's free.

Very creative professions and gameplay.\n\n2.  Intelligent and interesting storyline and quests.  PvE not too hard once you figure it out but NOT a faceroll like so many other games.\n\n3.  Interesting and challenging group instances.\n\n4.  Zones look awesome for 2008 graphics I was very pleasantly suprised considering how claustrophobic TSW zones seemed at times.\n\n5.  Community generally willing to group and help.  Occassional idiots but not toxic like so many other MMOs.\n\nCons:\n\n1.  Some bugs.  Some basic gameplay functions not explaained or explained poorly.  But people will generally help you out.\n\n2.  Graphic glitches in some zones.\n\n3.  Limited support.  Very little new content being produced.\n\n4.  not P2W but you will need buy the expansion pack and a subscription once you reach endgame to get any enjoyable content.\n\nOverall i recommend if you are looking for a solid reasonably priced MMO.","May 6","true","162.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is stable! In 41 hours of playing I have experienced two drops from the server and they were both from my modem/connection cable, not the game. Its also fairly beautiful for a game with 8-year-old graphics. Though on my underpowered onboard Intel HD4000 GPU I still need to turn graphics down when in large cities so I get around mid-20 FraPS. Levelling and skills are okay, I guess - I dont have any experience in other games like this to compare it too. I just dislike the  "class-based" restrictions on armoer and weapons. If I find a friggin' ogre club I can swing that does 30 damage, I would use it...screw my "class"...but nope. I'm not a barbarian. I'm a guardian. A class I chose because I CAN (a million xp down the road) wear plate armor! Yay! But this class renders at least 50% of the weapons you glean from treasure chests and conquered enemies TOTALLY USELESS! I'm level 28 and still carrying a pole-axe I took from Strom's corpse after I killed him at level 20...because there just arent any other weapons that do the damge this axe does. But that aside, the ability to kill enemies with slightly higher level is fairly easy when you can carry-out a series of comboes...which took me about 15 levels of dying a lot to figure out how to pull off correctly. I also have become fairly good at conquering two enemies the same level simultaneously with a string of comboes. Three is pushing it and four is almost a suicidal endevour. Time to run away...nd most of them chase you.\n\nThings I particularly dislike: the combat is...unsatisfactory. For all the hacking and slashing, there should be a limbless or headless cadaver on the ground when I'm done. The enemies really ♥♥♥♥ me off in some areas and calmly pushing number keys in soccession to accomplish comboes really isnt a visceral experience. I'm not sure what to suggest, because I've never played the other RPGs out there, this one at least isnt set up like an actual RPG gaming table with a grid and dice rolls and crap. Its more like Tomb Raider, but with clunkier, less precise combat. I'd prefer a TPS type of combat, where the strike you are initiating is directed by your mouse pointer aiming at a certain area of the enemy's anatomy. I have some other minor gripes, but they may just be my inate unfamiliarity with this genre of game, so I wont bring them up.\n\nThe thing I really like about this game though isnt the game mechanics at all though, its the world - the setting. I was a fan of the Conan comics years ago, and Arnold Schwarzennegger as Conan was THE only portrayal that really works. The Arnold /Conan movies may not have been great movies, but they were good (the first one especially) and that really energized my interest into the Hyborean World. This game, like "Warhammer 40K: Spacemarine" gives me a chance to play in a virtual world so different from our own...its nice to spend some time there and soak in the epic scope of the universe dreamed up by the creators and faithfully brought into a video game by the devs. As I was wandering through the jungles around Tortage it reminded me of a Comic book I have from the 1980s where Conan ventures through mountains and jungles encountering various races of people all to try and reach his dead wife or lover Xenobia. It all turned out to be a Wizard's trick, IIRC, but the art in the comic was beautiful and this game is comparable though not quite as poster-noir.\n\nI wish the enemies didnt respawn 5 minutes after I kill them...it would be nice if they staid dead for a while to give me some time to breath and explore without constant combat every 100 feet of travel.\n\nThe fact that its a free game, makes the negatives out weight the positives. I may never actually reach level 80 or finish the game, but it is a cool place to spend a few idle hours.","May 28","true","48.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The are hidden gems of humor and just things that make you smile or unexpected twists when you do the many many side quests. There is also the question of finding others to play with. you can go the whole 80 levels alone without ever teeming up with anyone just dont expect to be able to do dungeons. Or you can get together parties of 4 and go clear out some dungeons for even more story and places to explore. And although I started as f2p player, now when i am nearing lvl 80 I am considering the subscription option because this game really seems like it would be worthwhile to pay for a subscription.","June 2","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The devs put love into it. This was NOT designed to be a cash cow, and that is why it is so beautiful. They did not try to gear the game towards everyone, but rather towards a specific audience. Good writing has a specific audience, so why shouldn't games?\n\nWords can't really describe this game, so give it a shot. IT'S FREE. And they are re-vamping the F2P system so the X-pack is free. What more can you ask?\n\nDon't be fooled by my hours, I just registered the game with steam.\n\nEDIT** After playing for about a week, i can confirm it is NOT p2w.","May 2","true","28.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
