"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rakknar/recommended/375250/","rakknar","Ragnar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rakknar/","398 products in account","Really enjoyable game, and I love that it allows you to play at your own pace. If you want to sell 10 different complicated but high priced pizzas at the same time, you can - there's nothing stopping you from customizing your pizza whatever way you want to. If you want a relaxing experience or just to tune out for a few minutes and let your brain relax, just serve a few kinds of simple pizzas for a few in-game hours.\n\nIf you want, you can even set how long the in-game workday lasts. If you want an intense challenge, set an 8-hour work day (1 in-game hour is roughly 1 minute, I think) and have 20 pizzas on your menu at the same time, I tell you, you'll need to take a minute to relax after finishing.\n\nBut the management aspect of the game is the best part in my opinion. There are so many customization options and upgrades and the game is balanced so well that progression is logical and based on the player's skill level. With one exception (that I encountered, at least, I know there's multiple storyline paths) in the main storyline where I was forced to play for pure profit for a bit, I never felt like the game was getting too hard or too easy. Or even that it imposed a certain gameplay style on me, like Cook, Serve, Delicious, the closest example I can give, did with the increasing number of "lanes" - in Pizza Express, you can even influence the range of people you'll have to serve in a day.\n\nThe graphics are quite enjoyable, they reminded me of Pizza Tycoon, the old MS-DOS game from back in the day. I'm pretty sure it was intentional, but I didn't mind, the game was easy on the eye in any case.\n\nOverall, I don't regret spending 5 euros on this in the least. It won't keep you occupied for dozens of hours, but for what it offers, that price is a steal. It's fun, challenging and customizable, and a viable alternative for fans of Cook, Serve, Delicious! that want a different take on the indie-casual-sim genre. 9/10","July 1, 2015","true","10.3"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","32","36","0","1"

The details are what make the game so satisfying to play.\n\nYou choose open and close times for the restaurant, cater to vegans and lactose-intolerant customers by creating pizzas with your own chosen ingredients, and purchase different types of advertisements that have different effects. For example,  you can spam people's email inboxes for a cheap price, but it is frowned upon and won't be as effective as a giant billboard by the road.\n\nAlthough going into the game I wasn't expecting to be introduced to characters or story, they're actually very well written, engaging and fun to go along with. You have choices that branch the story's path, which makes the game even more interesting.\n\nGoing back to the level of control the game gives you, bankruptcy is a thing that can happen in this game. If you aren't careful, and buy more ingredients, give out too many free drinks, and make too many mistakes, you CAN run out of money. If you're careful, it won't ever happen, but it's nice to know that your choices matter.\n\nThere's so much to talk about, but I really think if you like the sound of what I've already mentioned, then you should give the game a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogrep/recommended/375250/","ogrep","Vino [Olive Garden]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogrep/","985 products in account","Part clicky-minigame, part management sim. Start up your own pizzeria, unlock ingredients, create new dishes in any combination you want. I advise making a pizza that's just plain dough and a single handful of hotdogs. Call it the "STUPID IDIOT SPECIAL" and watch as your stupid idiot customers gobble them up by the dozens.\n\nPizza Express is a somewhat less polished and more crunchy/low-fi version of Cook! Serve! Delicious!, with less fluid/fun action gameplay, but much deeper and more interesting management. Making the actual pizzas is an exercise in fast and accurate clicking (and memory, of course), which is a lot less precise and satisfying than CSD's responsive controller-based gameplay.\n\nAs I hinted at earlier, the management side of the game is what is truly engrossing. It's paced well, and there are a ton of systems that work together to create a great deal of depth - advertisements, shop upgrades, new ingredients, ingredient upgrades, the incredibly organic and freeform recipe creator...\n\nYou'll eventually juggle up to 30 different recipes that you've put together, each one unique and hopefully a good balance of different flavors - while you can technically create any random mishmash of ingredients you want, you'll only get the best scores with dishes that hit all 5 of the target tastes (sweet/salty/etc). It's surprisingly difficult to come up with a balanced menu, and even more difficult to remember all 30 of those recipes in the heat of the fast-paced kitchen segments.\n\nOver all this is a fun, lighthearted story with generic, but inoffensive characters. I got a few smiles out of it, and didn't really cringe during any of the dialogue, which is all I ask out of games.\n\nIf you're into management simulation, arcadey-clicking, and decent-to-mediocre pixel art, you've got a great option in Pizza Express. I recommend it to any fans of the genre. Newbies will probably want to start with Cook! Serve! Delicious!, which, as stated, is a lot easier to get into and more immediately fun.","January 1","true","9.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/375250/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","I'm 7+ hours into this game and still enjoying it immensely. Its pixely graphics may lead the casual browser to perceive that it is a bit of a cheap game and will perhaps not have much that's satisfying to offer, but don't let the appearance fool you: this is one of the best business simulation games on Steam! I am very surprised at its depth.\n\nThere are essentially two phases: day (open hours) and night (closed hours).\n\nDuring open hours, customers will flood into the store, order pizzas off of your menu, and then wait for you to make them. In this part you'll be playing something akin to "cook, serve, delicious" where you actually have to assemble the pizza from your batch of ingredients and then send it out to the customers. You dont' want to keep the customers waiting too long, so you have to build the pizzas quickly and accurately. One thing that potential players may NOT like about this section is that you can't just assemble the pizzas using hotkeys, like you can do in "cook, serve, delicious". In this game, you must click each ingredient and manually drag it to the pizza, and you have to do it accurately. If you don't drag the item directly over the pizza, it doesn't count. This will be a turn off to some people, but if you are okay with this, you are in for a treat.\n\nThe real surprise with this game is how robust the business sim elements are during closed hours. The longer you play, the more features start to unlock. You get to order your pizza shop's inventory of ingredients from a large catalogue to give your shop a flavor you like (while taking into consideration the needs of different customers, e.g. vegan, carnivores, lactose-intolerant options, etc). There are more ingredients in the catalogue than you can possibly have in your shop, so there is some choice to consider. The game tells you the "stats" for each ingredient as well, as far as how it will alter the flavor of the pizza and/or what kind of customer taste it will please (e.g. sweet, spicy, salty, bitter, sour, etc).\n\nIn addition to stocking your own ingredients, you also have to design, name, and price each specific pizza on your menu. This part actually takes a lot of management, because you actually have to consider the range of options your parlor offers different types of customers while building, and then for pricing you have to add up the total expense of all the pizza's ingredients, then determine how much you want to charge for it. I found that charging about 180% of the pizza's ingredient cost does not make the customers unhappy and still earns you a good profit. For complex pizzas anyway. For simpler pizzas, I may do closer to 160%. You have to perform the math yourself, though, so keep a calculator handy. (For another game, I might not like that, but for a business sim, doing my own math feels great.)\n\nThen, for each individual ingredient, you can upgrade different stats as you go. For example, you can upgrade the quality of that ingredient, the quantity you keep in the shop at one time, or upgrade the delivery so that new shipments arrive faster. BE CAREFUL, THOUGH. Upgrading the quality of an ingredient will increase the COST of that ingredient, which also increases the production cost of every pizza it is on, so you will need to reprice all of those pizzas if you don't want to lose money from the upgrade. You will have to adjust the price of each affected pizza manually, so I find it's better to do quality upgrades for all ingredients at once if possible, so I can get all of the price adjustment done in one fell swoop.\n\nAlso, the longer you stay in business, the bigger your pizza menu gets. You start off only being able to have maybe 5 or so pizzas on the menu, but every day you stay open, you can add another pizza. On one hand, it's in your best interest to build really simple pizzas at first (e.g. just crust with sauce counts as a pizza) because you can build them quickly and they don't cost too much. However, more complicated pizzas (e.g. whole wheat dough, marinara, oregano, mozzarella, olives, feta, pineapple, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and bacon) can earn you a LOT more money per pizza sold, but they take a LOT more time to build and increase your chances of making a mistake during the building (potentially costing you money from the wasted ingredients and affecting your reviews). You'll want to strike a good balance of super easy pizzas (fast but low profit) and complicated pizzas (slow but more profit). It's also good to try and evenly distribute each individual ingredient across pizzas. For example, if you have 20 pizzas on your menu, and all of them use oregano, you're going to run out of oregano FAST, and running out in the middle of the business day could screw you over. But if you evenly distribute the ingredients, using each ingredient on only a few pizzas, then it lowers your chances of running out of ingredients in the middle of the work day.\n\nAnd then you get tons of other management options as well. You'll want to upgrade your parlor with decorations and features (arcade? music? disco ball? wifi? high chairs?), which can improve your parlor's reviews (atmosphere) and make customer's willing to wait longer (which you will definitely want). You can also buy a wide variety of advertisement with different prices, different levels of effectiveness, different times of day, and targeted at different demographics. You can set up different discount offers. You get to set your own hours, so you can open longer or stay closed longer as you need. You can purchase more tables, which allows you to accept more orders at once. You can acquire a tip jar and a comment box, and so on. There is really a lot to play with.\n\nA good sim always keeps new upgrade opportunities rolling in so that you are always salivating to make your operations better and better, so there is always something to work toward, and Pizza Express keeps that pace incredibly well. As an added bonus, the game even has a cast of characters and a story that involves corruption/scandal in the food industry that affects your characters AND your business (e.g. if there is a scandal involving the distributor of a particular ingredient, you might have to remove or replace it, etc).\n\nI really am pretty pleasantly surprised by this one. It doesn't look like much, but I'll be god damned if I can't stop playing it.","October 25, 2015","true","15.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Ok, it looks terrible, and it's full of talking animals. But it's actually really good.\n\nIn this game, you run a pizzeria. It's an authentic Italian pizzeria, so that's cool - don't go in expecting all donner / tandoori meat pizzas with garlic bread and fries. Expect Italian ingredients, and choice of about a dozen types of cheese.\n\nYou choose the names and what's going to be on the pizzas, the quality and quantity of each of the ingredients (each ingredient has taste ratings, e.g. how salty or sweet etc - so you can really balance a pizza), and the pricing, then each in-game day you'll be taking customer orders and making those pizzas. That bit's all fast-paced dragging and dropping.\n\nYou also get to control advertising, furniture, services (e.g. free customer wi-fi) and there's an overall story which is pretty funny.\n\nThe overall effect of having complete control over your naming and creation of each pizza is that every creation is your own doing - and in turn, you are in control of the game's difficulty. If you want to give your pizzas weird names where you're going to have to slow yourself down by looking up what's on it each time someone asks for one, it's your own fault. If you want to advertise to get more people through the door before you've bought enough tables to seat them all so they get impatient and leave, it's your own fault. But it's all ok, you will learn by doing.\n\nAlso, if all the business management and story is too much, you unlock arcade mode after a while where it's purely the pizza-making portion of the game.\n\nSo - to summarise:\n\nPros:\n* lots of detailed customisation in shop management\n* fun arcade gameplay, as challenging as you choose to make it\n* interesting story and characters\n* funny dialogue\n* I really like the chiptune music\n\nCons:\n* having all these animals in the kitchen feels kind of unsanitary\n* the user interface is a bit dodgy in places\n* the graphics are pretty ugly","March 18","true","14.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The game does a nice job of introducing elements at a good clip. It never feels overwhelming, yet there is always a sense of urgency to improve on everything you currently have control over. The actual ‘makin’ pizzas’ part of the game is enjoyable stressful. Maybe it’s the story that makes this a different experience compared to other sim games I’ve tried.

If you liked Cook, Serve, Delicious, you'll probably like this, too. There's an insane amount of customization - difficulty, store decor, advertising, challenge mode options, and most importantly, tons of excellent toppings and doughs - and plenty of side stories and mini-quests to discover. The characters, dialogue, and atmosphere are a delight, too: even the menus have charm. This is one of those games where it feels like the developer thought of everything.\n\nI have to mention my great experience with the developer - in playing through story mode, I hit upon a game-stopping bug. I posted about it on the game's forum, and in less than 24 hours, he'd fixed my save file and put it up on his website for me to download. Considering the he's pretty much running a one-man show, and that Pizza Express has been out a while, the fact that he cheerfully gave me that near-instant one-on-one help is incredibly impressive to me.\n\nI've finished the main story, now, but there's still a lot to do, and I'll be playing this for a while to come.","January 13","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got to name the pizza shop and make my own recipes. I even got decorating and advertising options! I also really enjoyed the music. That's pretty much it.

Text is sometimes hard to read, and overall visibility is usually low, especially before you get used to it...\nOther problem is Lucky, who is JarJar of Pizza Express... Very, very, very irritating character that you want to punch in the face all the time... You can skip the story parts, ofc, but that's not fun...\nAnd the last, but not the least; when you need to spread the dough you use the same click as for sending the pizza into the oven... So, when you accidentally double click, you make a mistake... And it happens a lot, when you are in a rush...

I actually spent a lot of time playing the demo that Onni Interactive very kindly gave to me and I was really enjoying it, so when it was finally released on Steam, I was beyond excited to get my hands on a full copy and attempt to take my pizza palace all the way to the top.\n\nThe aim of the game is simple. You’re hired by an anthropomorphic cat named Gastone who recently inherited his father’s old restaurant after it shut down, and his sole desire is to reach the top of the food authority – hilariously named F.L.A.B – best restaurant rankings.  Immediately you’re placed where all the action is, and this is where the majority of the actual playing of the game takes place – the kitchen. Your main task in the game is to provide the public with the pizzas they request in a timely fashion, which sounds easier than it actually is. You have to keep on top of everything more than just the order list, with restocking your toppings being a frequent challenge, as well as managing things like the menu, the amount of tables in the restaurant and even the décor around it. Being able to manage everything to make sure it’s all ticking over correctly and in the most profitable manner can be really fun to tinker about with in order to get the right balance.\n\nRead more at the Video Game Almanac[vgalmanac.com]","June 28, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I started my culinary career in pizza, and this definitely reminds me of it - sometimes a little too much (in a good way). It's pretty hectic, and each business day can be a relentless wave of clicks as you just barely manage to satisfy all your customers' orders. It can also be a painfully slow day if your menu sucks, or your pricing is off, and too many slow days will spell doom for your pizzeria. As a light simulation, it makes me think in a lot of the same ways as I did in real life about pizzeria work.

Not only that but the soundtrack is pretty amazing. Incredibly appropriate for the style of game provided for us. As far as errors go, I have yet to come across any fatal errors that ruined the game. I mean I'd get an error that would shut down the game every blue moon, but i'd play at the beginning of a new day, whenever the game was already saved. Afterwards I could usually just go back on the game and pick up where I left of.\nGreat game. It's a shame this doesn't get more publicity.","August 5, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A mix of the old PizzaConnection/Syndicate and other,more arcady approches with an awesome soundtrack. GFX are nothing to write home about but the character artwork is great,even if pixelated.\n\nGive it a try,the game is worth your time","May 8","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are SO many possibilities in this game, and it's so god damn addictive!!!!\n\nThe only negative thing I can think of is that awfully annoying tutorial, but you have the possibility to skip it every time you get one at least.\n\nSo bottom line, do I recommend this? YES!!!!!\n\n","March 28","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
