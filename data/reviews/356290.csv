The addition of the operational layer adds a whole new challenge to the game, causing players to wisely deploy battle groups, capture enemy resource centers, and counter enemy battle groups.\n\nIn terms of tactical gameplay, there's not much of a difference between Cuban Missile Crisis and Blitzkrieg, which is a good thing. There seems to be an additional logistics layer, where the player must now resupply fuel to individual vehicles. Artillery is much more versaitile now, with the ability to deploy air-burst minefields.\n\nOverall fun game, still worth a try especially at this price.","April 24, 2015","true","3.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The Single player is a blast! I feel it reminds me of total war except much more simplifed and obviously in a different universe with tanks, aircraft and infantry!\n\nThe Single player USA campaign is awesome! Going from battlefield to battlefield conquering the airbases, fuel depots, radar stations and defending them is fun.\n\nThe unit variety is quit nice also that makes the game more interesting- MBT-70, Abrams, M60, all sorts of anti-tank missile vehicles, its just awesome to see how they work, have proper armor values and realstic armor system on all the vehicles.\n\nIts 5 dollars! A great deal for a game you will get 20-40 hours of out in just one campaign!\n\nGreat game, I wish the multiplayer had co-op campaign and the multiplayer to be functional as doing it over virtual netowrking is pretty laggy and boring.\n\nThe graphics are also not fantastic, but if you have played blitzkreg or honestly don't care, it works for anyone.\n\nGreat game for any RTS/RTT gamer!","June 4, 2015","true","2.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

It was only on Cyber Monday of 2015, nearly a decade later, that I discovered the Ice Crusade expansion pack.  So I bought this and got back into the old groove.  It was just like I remembered.  I had to smile that even in the expansion pack, the enemy still has a prediliction for trying to take back radar installations.  I never understood why they did that, but they still do it in Ice Crusade.\nIf you are thinking of getting this but haven't played the original Cuban Missile Crisis: The Aftermath, play that before getting this.\nAlso, if you were wondering, the entire campaign isn't played on ice.  The first chapter is desert, with those annoying windstorms that could kill your guys, but were also useful, because they could kill exposed enemy troops and then show their location, even if your troops hadn't seen them before.\nThis game lived up to exactly what it was supposed to be: an expansion pack for those who couldn't get enough Cuban Missile Crisis and a classic Blitzkrieg engine game.","March 2","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would still also recommend it if you are really into this kind of thing, and the game is on a strong offer..... eg 75% off or better.\n\nThis game is indentical to the previous CMC game. Except, obviously, for new scenarios, some new scenery, some new units, but a hell of lot more REMOVED units!!!!! Not ONE of the bugs and faults with the original CMC has been addressed.\n\nI'll list those faults:-\n\n1) The English translations. Jesus Christ Almighty! I have NEVER seen worse in any game, EVER. Spelling mistakes, wrong words used in the wrong contexts, scrambled sentences, garbelled grammar, typoes, false information..... every bit of text across every part of the game is stuffed with them! All English text is almost unreadable gibberish!\n2) Pathfinding is absoulte ♥♥♥♥!\n3) Unit AI, both yours and the enemy, is also utter ♥♥♥♥!\n4) Captured a depot that says it holds 500k + units of ammo, fuel or spare parts have you? Looking forward to lots of loot? Forget it! You will receive NOTHING. I just captured a depot supposedly holding 479,000 units of spares, and my total spares count was at just 10,000 after I'd captured it.\n5) I assume resource producing (as opposed to storage) facilities also do not do what they ought! This destroys the strategic element of the game totally!\n6) All those lovely unit stats..... and not one means ♥♥♥♥. I penetrated a T-10M's 304mm frontal armour with a weapon that supposedly could only penetrate 180mm. Though to be fair, I am wondering if this is because I was on "easy" difficulty..... my units seemed to not get penetrated by low AP weapons, as normal.\n7) The bias toward the defender is too great. On attack the AI just rushes you, like butter rushing a hot frying pan.\n8) Whose idea where those f*ing tornado weather effects that just wipe out all your infantry, guns, trucks...... even when entrenched or in buildings? They need their bumps feeling! Only armour survives bad weather attacks. To be fair, the enemy also suffers this just as much as you!\n9) Missions are repetitive, and the maps for them are very small\n\nThe CMC games are precursors to Blitzkrieg I, and the much, much, MUCH superior Blitzkrieg II. Even though those two titles STILL have the utterly ♥♥♥♥ poor English translations!\n\nI would save the money by not buying CMC or CMC : IC and use it to get Blitzkrieg II instead!","June 5","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
