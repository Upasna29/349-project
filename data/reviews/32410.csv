"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ITrevinI/recommended/32410/","ITrevinI","Trevin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ITrevinI/","394 products in account","[MINOR SPOILERS for the very beginning of the game]\n\nLucidity would simply be about grief and loss if it were a book or a movie. The protagonist, Sofi, is a young girl who loses her grandmother and then determinedly journeys to find her while struggeling to come to terms with her death. Lucidity is a not passive linear media, however, but instead is a game, and its specific gameplay is very much about quick thinking and adaptation, as the player is asked to help Sofi navigate constantly changing environments using a continually randomized set of tools.\n\nThese themes from story and gameplay seem to be oddly paired, especially at first. As the game begins, and Sofi starts marching forward on her own, the player is taught how to use certain tools to keep her safe until she reaches the end of the environment. Sofi is not entirely helpless (she‚Äôll climb up small rises with ease), and the game might look much like it belongs in the platformer genre when viewed from a distance, albeit one that plays itself. If left alone, however, Sofi will die, and on later levels, die often, falling victim to giant enemies and treacherous falls. It will be up to you to keep her away from those living dust bunnies and spiky pits by placing things like staircases, fans and slingshots in her path, enabling her to jump and climb past danger.\n\nLucasarts described Lucidity as a ‚Äúchallenging puzzler,‚Äù and, well, I agree. The puzzle to be solved is fairly straightforward: get Sofi to the end of the level safely, navigating through a sometimes dangerous environment and around always dangerous creatures. I think it is important to point out that this particular puzzler does not derive its challenge from obscure solutions or mind-twisting scenarios; indeed, the game thrives on offering the player a multitude of solutions at any given moment. If the ground is covered in deadly plants, you might slingshot Sofi past them, build stairs to let her climb over them, place a jump pad to let her climb to a higher level of platforms, or bomb the plants out of existence. All of these actions would probably work with some degree of success. The challenge lies in choosing the best solution with the current tools available, and then in implementing the solution before Sofi runs into danger. The time pressure makes the relatively straightforward problem solving thrilling.\n\nLucidity deals with is treatment of grief by cleverly separating the bereaved character from the player, casting the player as the one helping the main character through her pain. The player must continually adapt while the playing field and pieces change, as Sofi must learn to adapt to the concept of death. The symbolic journey does falter a bit toward the end as the narrative pulls apart from the gameplay, unfortunately.\n\nThere are a few technical quirks that impact the experience enough that they bear mentioning. Because gameplay essentially involves placing level pieces on a grid, a gamepad offers a smoother experience here compared to a mouse (having a mouse cursor constantly snapping to a grid is an alien and unnerving sensation).","December 3, 2013","true","4.7"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/recommended/32410/","MakoSipper","MakoSipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/","3792 products in account","Lucidity is basically a platformer with a tetris mechanic, in which you have to cross levels and collect fireflies. You don't control the girl, who's always moving forward--you just lay down pieces to build a path for her. I wouldn't call it a puzzle game, though.\n\nI'll go straight to pros and cons:\n\nüëç Graphics are cute.\nüëç Music is pleasant.\nüëç A lot of content. It supposedly has 27 levels, and that's a lot of levels, since they're long and you'll have to repeat them if you want to 100% the game.\n\n¬± It has some back story going on, but it's underdeveloped. The intro didn't make any sense. You're reading stories, then you fall asleep close to your grandma, then you wake up and start running forever after a red firefly that's eaten by a frog.\n\nüëé The gameplay mechanic falls short and really gets boring after 1 or 2 levels. You basically get a piece, which you put in the environment or save for later (only one), and then you'll get a new one. Pieces are unlimited, so I found that the best way to succeed was laying down tons of pieces without thinking too much about it. And that's where this game lost its potential charm. Basically, doing everything fast pays off more than thinking about what you're doing.\nüëé Beating a level is way too easy, while mastering it (getting all fireflies) is way too repetitive, and sometimes hard, because it's luck-dependent.\nüëé Sometimes you have to replay the whole level just for one firefly you've missed. The bad thing is that she moves at a very slow pace, and you can't fast-forward. It got boring really fast.\nüëé Health system is a bit weird. I couldn't figure out how my health was, some enemies hit you and you're sure they aren't able to, sometimes you think you've been hit because the girl moans when she falls or climbs, so this part is a mess.\nüëé Sometimes it's hard to position a piece when the girl is jumping or falling. It feels a bit awkward.\n\nBasically, this game is really boring and repetitive. Don't be fooled by the LucasArts hype, or by that line up there in the description, saying "From the team that re-imagined The Secret of Monkey Island‚Ñ¢, comes Lucidity, an addictive puzzle platformer set in the surreal childlike dreamscapes of the little girl Sofi". It has nothing to do with Monkey Island, it doesn't feel like a puzzle, and it's really boring, and not one bit addictive. Don't be fooled by the cute graphics. Another reviewer called this game a "polished turd", and they're right.","December 17, 2015","false","0.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Although the game may look like a platformer, it is actually more of a puzzle game as you do not actually control Sofi but place objects in her path which cause her to change her behaviour. This is a very short game - you can easily complete it within a couple of hours - but to get the most out of this game, it is worthwhile 100%ing it by collecting all the fireflies you can. It will only take a few more hours to do so, but the challenge is worth it.","February 5, 2011","true","61.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","1"

I expected a cute, little puzzle platformer and, in a way, it is (especially the graphics look cute), but I expected a platformer where I could move MYSELF, instead of the game moving the character for me. It's basically an on-rails platformer, and you just give directions to the character. And the goal is to collect as many fireflies as you can.

Honestly, I try to be open-minded, tell myself I'm maybe not PRECISELY the intended target audience, blah-blah-blah, but this game is ultimately just frustration in pixelated form.  The premise is to help a little girl skip her merry way through myriad  imaginary landscapes, using conjured-up items (such as staircases, slingshots, bombs, etc) to provide her safe passage and remove obstacles and enemies from her path.  Easy enough at first, but as it progresses, your chances of making it through seem more and more dependent on the sheer blind luck of what useable imaginary object spawns for you next.  I don't think I've ever groaned so many times in my life, and I don't even mean big, expressive, exasperated groans...just very small, non-committal, "Oh God, do I have do this bit AGAIN?" kinds of groans.\n\nHonestly, my main criticism is that I can't quite imagine exactly WHO the "target audience" for this game/product even is, as it's clearly aimed at kids yet surely way too challenging and puzzle-orientated for the average six year-old to successfully negotiate.  A game for overgrown, forty year-old, game-addicted losers, perhaps?  No, wait, that would mean that YOURS TRULY should have enjoyed it; which frankly, I didn't.  This just wasn't much "fun", I'm afraid, and I finally allowed myself to throw in the towel after dying in the exact same spot more than ten times in a row (something I will more than happily tolerate from a really good game, like Limbo or Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack, but not from the mediocre likes of this).\n\nI'm almost tempted to give this a thumbs-up irrespective, in acknowledgement that it's not so much an "incompetent" game, just simply not a game "for me".  But I honestly find it hard to believe that ANYONE is gonna get much pleasure from this, no matter what their age (or gender)...which arguably doesn't make it a very successful "game" at all, period.  Does it?  If I ever have kids, I might force them to play this one for an hour whenever they're naughty.  "BEHAVE, OR I'LL MAKE YOU PLAY LUCIDITY FOR AN HOUR!"  "NO, DAD, PLEASE...NOT LUCIDITY!  PLEASE DAD...I'LL MOW THE LAWN...DO THE DISHES...BATHE THE DOG...BUT NOT LUCIDITY, PLEASE!!"\n\nThat oughtta learn 'em.\n\nVerdict: 4.5/10.","September 19, 2014","false","3.0"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","11","22","3","0"
