The very first five moves will be identical to those an hour in, and nothing changes. Period.\n\nThere is even an identical product by the developer on Steam with a few sprites changed.\n\nI can't refund someone else's gift, but I can warn as many of you away from playing a game that involves absolutely nothing but "taptaptaptaptaptap" over and over until boredom sets in, with no rewards or variables whatsoever.","October 30, 2015","false","0.1"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","39","42","0","0"

A story of a miner - we'll name him George - who was bored of his regular mining life. He wanted tod o something different, something that most would even consider to be impossible. George wanted to dig into an infite pillar of ore! Oh but of course they told him no, because that's just silly! George would have none of it, and thus he started to have a Miner Mayhem.\n\nMiner Mayhem is basically a clicker game where you need to move the mouse back and forth, avoiding the pieces jutting out of the ore, all while you try and get as high of a score as you can. Interesting in concept, and it does work... Just not in this game. A game like this desparately needs the ability to click both the right and left mouse buttons, not just the left. The sensitivity on where you can click got me killed more times than I can count. You can unlock additional skins for the miner depending on how you perform in the game, but that's all they are - skins. They don't do anything special or different for you.\n\nSkip Miner Mayhem and go play better titles (like Timberman). Tell poor George that his dreams are hopeless, all thanks to the TOO minimal controls within his poor game. He also needs to not go after ore that looks like it is straight out of Minecraft, and if he really wants to then he should just go play Minecraft instead.","November 28, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The game is repetitive and really rather silly.\n\nI can imagine some people might try to get epic scores like you see in the trailer but I can imagine those people have a lot of free time and (hopefully) very few real life responsibilites. But no I can't really recommend it for most people. I probably had more fun writing this review than playing this game.\n\nIt does have some positives though, the pixel art is charming and the audio sfx is ok too.\n\nThis is clearly a one man development team behind this and considering that, it is not too bad... thing is even for a one man team, I can't imagine this took very long.\n\n\n\n","November 22, 2015","false","0.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I will say for a cheap game itâ€™s a great way to kill sometime and challenge your friends to beat your scores.\n\n(My video review)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-nmmDck5Vs\n\nGame Review Gameplay  /  Graphics\n\nThe game play for miner mayhem is very basic. The games platform is a 1-D base platform where you stand still moving back and forth hit the ores in front of you. The way to hit the ores is simple you move back and forth using the arrow keys on the keyboard.\n\nBut there is a slight challenge to all of this, you have obstacles attempting to stop you from mining. But if youâ€™re very careful and fast you can pass these obstacles, which will lead to mining faster and getting a much higher level.\n\nWhen mining the blocks away to moving on the next objective you are timed by a bar with red inside of it. The slower you go the higher chance you have at failing the level. But if youâ€™re capable of going faster without hitting any of the obstacles, going faster will keep the red bar full so the timer wonâ€™t run out. But once you slow down it will begin to drain extremely fast.\n\nNow when most people see these types of games they wonder, whatâ€™s the objective to the ending of it? What makes us keep going. Well the developers in this game sadly couldnâ€™t deliver achievements or badges so they did the next best thing possible. Whatâ€™s that you ask? In-game store where youâ€™re able to purchase different miners as you increase your levels and blocks hit. A small but cool little objective which was added.\n\nIn side of this shop / player skin area there are several different skins you can unlock. Now to properly unlock these skins you have one of two ways of unlocking them either A. Reach a high score or B. chop an insane amount of ore. Either way youâ€™ll be playing for a long time to unlock some of the skins inside of the game!\n\n\nDevelopers\n\nMinery Mayhem was created by a group commonly known as Anarchy Enterprises. There website is covered in newer games they have created. They are also known for older games known as, Coffee Simulator and Moon Simulator. Along with its newer games Tiki man, Ant War and several other games.\n\nI have not had to ability to speak with any said developers of this company which is sad because  I would have liked to ask for other future games.\n\n\nOverall Game Rating\n\nWhen it comes to making games and keeping them going for years ahead are having the basics.
