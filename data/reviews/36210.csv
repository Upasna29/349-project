Only one song on the soundtrack and it will burrow into your head like a brain parasite. I played it all the way through and had a good time the whole way.","November 29, 2014","true","12.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

It's challenging in some spots, others not so much... just like any game.  In my own opinion, it's pretty rare to find a straight-forward tower defence game such as this.  Have had this game for a few years now, and it's one I find myself going back to every so often.\n\nAgain, not the best graphics, but if you're looking for some solid gameplay for a few bucks, this a totally worthy investment, in my eyes, for about $5.00.","February 3","true","54.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The scoring is very easily abused.\n\nI let the final boss eat the children, because they are only worth 100 points. But selling all my buildings is worth tens of thousands of points. Sorry kids, but you are monster food.","November 27, 2011","false","4.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","29","2","7","5","0"

I have to admit it was mistake. The game basically plays itself, the graphics are terrible and the experiance is just no fun. Do not waste your time or money on this game.","May 2, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Only downside is the lack of replayability. Well worth a couple of bucks.","April 6, 2012","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
