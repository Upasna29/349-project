Also, the game's processes can't be force-closed, so I had to shut down my computer for them to close.\n0/10 would uninstall and refund again","November 29, 2015","false","0.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaserFerret/recommended/405070/","LaserFerret","LaserFerret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaserFerret/","62 products in account","This game is so unpolished it is almost unplayable. With randomly spawning goals, you can sometimes get trapped in areas that make it impossible to continue. As well, enemies will sometimes not collide with their killers and walls, and can spawn on top of you. You fail as soon as you press go in hard mode, and there is no way to skip the score loading, so there is a 15 second + break in between the levels. I played for less than an hour, and have aready seen every texture, level archetype, etc; Almost everything is a basic unity texture/function. This game is a refund in progress. As well, with the asking price, you should just go buy yourself something nice, like the Binding of Isaac. If they were asking for a dollar, it might be reasonable, but this is clearly a poor attempt at a cashgrab.\n\n0/10 Do not buy.","March 6","false","0.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
