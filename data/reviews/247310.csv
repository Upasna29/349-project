For various reasons the act of rolling a spherical object around in a digital world almost always proves extremely frustrating to me, as there is a fine line between overt realism and cartoon looseness that is often stepped over one way or the other to make for an unsatisfying experience. Gravi personifies the bulk of my gripes with this style of game, a hodgepodge of bad design decisions, uninspired art and music, and soulless level design.\n\nGravi functions around a core mechanic: creating temporary gravity fields which suck you toward them, by which you make your way around the levels, flipping switches, avoiding traps, and getting to the end pipe. Actually creating these fields is not nearly as intuitive as it should be however, and the controls leave a great deal on the table with regards to movement and precision (whether using a controller or keyboard and mouse). Your ball is either rolling sluggishly or far too fast and shooting gravity fields is almost trial and error like with how quickly and erratically you have to place them to survive.\n\nThis is worsened by the almost instant difficulty spike which only grows higher with each passing level. Checkpoints are placed annoyingly far apart, certain switches are timed which calls for even faster movement than usual (and yet there is no distinction between timed and normal switches), and the developers even try to work in multiplane levels (ala LittleBigPlanet) which more often than not winds up breaking and glitching you into spikes or other hazards (I also experienced at least one glitch that put me inside a piece of the environment). Some will defend these problems because the game is listed as being "Early Access", but with how long it has been available elsewhere without a beta or otherwise incomplete label, I find it rather inexcusable and just inherent to the poor design.\n\nI played about halfway through the game before deciding to quit, and was bored well before I reached that point. The art direction is so bland and the music so generic, that the whole experience feels lifeless and disconnected. Even had the gameplay been better (or even good, which I would certainly not consider it) nothing about the way it plays or is presented is at all compelling and although I didn't expect a to actually become attached or care about a little glowing ball, I found it impossible to become even somewhat interested in anything the game offered.\n\nGravi is derivative, at times almost broken, and just not fun. Despite my prejudice against ball physics and games that utilize them, I feel I gave it more than a fair chance to prove me wrong, and yet all it did was further affirm my original thoughts while disappointing me all the same with its own form of mediocrity.","December 19, 2013","false","1.3"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","1"

Gravi is not really early access. The developers haven't updated any content in the game for more than a year and are entirely absent in the forums. It feels like they have given up on this game entirely.\n\nSeveral things are broken in the game. 3 of the first 10 stages would not mark themselves as completed after I finished them, even after completing them several times each. Almost every level has serious bugs where you get stuck or get killed by nothing. You will need to replay most levels several times because of the bugs.\n\nThe volume control menu doesn't work and the game volume randomly changes while you play. The shrink power really doesn't respond most of the time. I dread when a level requires me to use the shrink power because I know I'll have to replay the level many times.\n\nPlaying this game felt like a chore. I cannot think of any redeeming factors, especially considering the developers abandoned the game before it was even completed.","February 19, 2014","false","1.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

It has not crashed yet and game pad works just fine.\n\nGame character rolls around very loosely but i dont see that as a bug. i think it's designed this way to force the player to balance your gravi all the time near edges. See those curved slopes with spikes at either the top and maybe a flame at the bottom? Coincidence for sure.\n\nMenus look goofy with their cartoonish looks but i dont see any more need to spill more ink about that. They work and thats it.\n\nNot much backstory. Who or what is this anti-gravi seen in the pics?\n\nBiggest problem i see with this game is that it has painted itself into a game genre niche corner of a sorts: the only people i can recommend this are people who have beaten Super Meat Boy and are looking for a challenge. If you are new to this genre then this game is not a very good starting point.  Not as polished as SMB and not as fun as Escape Goat.\n\nIt is pointless to bash this game for what it represents.  it is quite simple with limited content,  maschocistic as hell and you need good pain tolerance and good nerves to proceed in the levels. But so are the much better known SMB and others.\n\nI had some fun with this - but now i must probably rest as the game pad will probably be smashed into the wall soon next to the pulp formerly known as Meat Boy.  I'll give this a careful thumbs up since the game is just fine and the buyer really needs to understand that this game is not casual in any way. It is just as hardcore as it's predecessors in the genre. Game is also often found in bundles and sales so it's unlikely that you will pay too much for this.\n\nedit: collectable count stopped working after awhile so there really is no point going forward until they fix this. After all this IS a game where you progress and try to achieve hard to get items/achievements.","September 18, 2014","true","2.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Even though it's on Early Access, the game feels complete. The controls are fine, while the XBOX 360 Controller plays perfectly with the game. The game was meant to be hard. The game is quite frustrating on the later levels (at least you get infinite lives). Though the devs didn't release the game on Mac or Linux yet, but they know how to keep a promise on these, especially the upcoming release of SteamOS. Music is very fitting for the lab theme (not if repetive), so does the background. The achievements aren't too shabby either. They give challenge and will stump even the cleverest of the puzzle-platformer boffins. Though the graphics resemble more of an actual OUYA game, (in fact, it was previously released on OUYA). Though there are only 40 levels right now (with more added soon), but getting 4 stars and collectibles will crank the challenge up a notch or two.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nMusic: 7/10\nGraphics: 6/10\nLasting Appeal: 9/10\nPrice Opinion: 7/10\n\nOverall: 8/10\nYou can't go wrong about this Early Access platformer that gives you that sciencific feeling.","November 25, 2013","true","1.7"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"

Roll around, fire out your little gravity bender, get pulled to it.  You can "resist" the pull, and use that to your advantage.  However, where this whole mechanism falls apart is in both the control scheme and the implementation.\n\nYour projectile also has to follow the standard parabolic path any first year physics student would be familiar with.  Trying to accurately aim this parabolic projectile with the mouse, while also controlling Gravi with your keyboard, seems to be entirely an exercise in frustration.   If this is where the developers were getting the "puzzle" part of "Puzzle platformer", I think they should revisit what that means.  There weren't times where I was trying to find my own path through a level, or trying to figure out which switch to pull when.  They levels were incredibly linear, and the only puzzles I could find were the mechanics.\n\nFor instance, there are areas near the end of chapter 1 that require you to "swing" from the ceiling, while avoiding the fire jets above, and the spikes below.  This turned into pure frustration for me- minor changes to the angle of my projectile caused it to miss the ceiling pillars entirely, or catch the side instead of the bottom and pull me into the flames.  When I could successfully hit the first pillar, transitioning to the next one seemed to be "how fast can you slightly adjust the mouse and fire again so that the projectile hits the pillar before you fall to the spikes below", not "can you make a good plan through this gauntlet".  Super Meat Boy was fun because of the precision required and how exact the control felt.  Gravi is not, because it requires similar levels of precision but has controls that feel much less exact.\n\nPerhaps it would be better with a controller, but I feel that the problem is not solely to blame on the control system, but instead lies in the combination of cramped quarters and need to exact responses with pixel-perfect precision.\n\nControl issues aside, the levels looked rather blah.  Graphically they are detailed enough to have some character, but the limited palette leads to some visual confusion at times.  It also felt at times like the detail of the background fights with the important information about dangers in the level itself.\n\nThe audio wasn't bad, but wasn't great, either.  I would consider the sound and music to be a wash, all told.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this.  There are better platformers out there, and I didn't really find the "puzzle" aspect to this.","February 1, 2014","false","1.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You never have enough time to analyze any situation in order to solve the issues before you, so it results in you bashing your little blue self against the traps over and over in a desperate attempt to manage these unwieldy obstacles. The mitosis aspect of the game wonky as could be, but that is fair to attribute to the game still being early access. This game definitely has some promise, but the controls are not intuitive and right now it's just an annoyance to play. I suppose I may have taken the "tolerance for pain" warning a little lightly, but I certainly didn't expect a Dark Souls level of frustration when playing.","February 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I like tough games, I don't mind being frustrated by a game that is well made and requires skill.  This... is not one of those games.  If you're looking for a Meat Boy or Mr. Bree like experience then keep on walking.\n\nGravi, the blue thing that is supposed to be the main character is lifeless and uninteresting.  The controls are as loose as possible and worse yet, tapping in a direction will randomly yield nary more than a nudge or you'll shoot off like a rocket.  Adding to this problem is that the ball never comes to a rest.  So be prepared to roll into spikes or lava or be electrocuted at any and all times.\n\nLevel designs are just god awful.  Incredibly generic and lacking in any sort of diversity to tell one apart from another.","June 28, 2014","false","4.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

You basically throw a projectile against a surface and, if you're within range, you're drawn to it like a magnet. I figured this would allow for some clever level design, but the ten stages I finished were short, cramped, straightforward, and filled with generic hazards like spikes. Level 11 introduced reverse-gravity spots as you would find in some Super Mario Galaxy stages, but I couldn't progress because they made me clip into the ceiling, making it nigh impossible to avoid a spike hazard. Maybe later stages are more interesting, but what I've seen so far makes me wary regardless.\n\nI also feel like left/right movement has too much momentum, especially when you're required to land neatly in between two spike hazards, or something of that nature. I'm fine with high difficulty, but I don't like when games ask me to do precise things with imprecise movement.\n\nI would watch a gameplay video or two before committing to this one. Maybe the game will improve upon full release, but I've lost interest.","December 11, 2013","false","0.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

But when you are trying to make a platformer, your controls need to be precise. While playing this game I never felt that I really had complete control over the character. The gravity mechanic is interesting, but it seems to never work how you want it to, often throwing you into spikes. The secondary method of control where you make yourself smaller has never seemed neat or useful my whole time playing it. If I need to be smaller, why do I have to hit the button four times? This could be a fun game, but the core mechanic needs an overhaul.","May 17, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But there are countless flaws and bugs in the game and it is basically abandonware at this point.\n\nBugs: The biggest bug you could imagine. The game freezes after the last level. There's supposed to be a final confrontation but it won't actually load the last section of the game.\nMany achievements are described poorly (saying the achievement is on a different level than it is), one seems to be actually impossible to get. The discussions are full of bug reports and the devs haven't responded in years or apparently fixed any. The level collectibles dont update properly so I've collected over 100 so far and the game only has 40 levels (I also still don't have the achievement for that either)\n\nGameplay: The concept is fine but poorly executed in some critical areas:\nFor a platformer where precise movements are fairly important, Gravi (you) slide all over the level at will. Precision jumping sections are a huge pain and will come down to a fair amount of luck and grinding several dozen deaths at just one section. Difficulty curves are all over the place as precision landing is incredibly difficult while some of the final levels aren't particularly challenging.\n\nAbandonware: The devs have left this game as is. It isn't coming out of early access any time soon if it ever does. The devs have actually been posting more about some other games they are working on instead of fixing one they already had customers pay for.\n\nVerdict: Buy a better platformer. Find a better gravity based game. There are many games that outclass this installment in every way. And those games probably also work right.","March 7","false","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
