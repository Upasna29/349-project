If you're curious about the game try the web based version on the fantasy strike site. The game itself is absolutely fantastic, however the design of the steam version leaves something to be desired.\n\nThe interface is exactly as it is in the mobile version, so everything is way too big if you try to play it at 1080p. The game is optimally played at roughly 800x600 unless you have a really tiny monitor. For a steam game this is not okay.\n\nIf you're curious about the game, I'd recommend checking out the web based version.\n\nI have almost no regrets about buying this considering the amount of hours I've logged in the web based version, however I do have a hard time recommending this to newcommers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/carpeguitarrem/recommended/287960/","carpeguitarrem","CarpeGuitarrem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/carpeguitarrem/","117 products in account","Okay, so let's break this down in a few different ways, shall we? I'm a recent Yomi fan who's been pretty pumped about this new release on Steam. You're someone who's probably trying to figure out if they should buy this game. Let's see what we can do about this.\n\nYomi will likely appeal to...\nPeople who are put off of the dexterity requirements for competitive fighting games\nCompetitive gamers looking for a new strategic game to master\nGame design fans looking for a new, interesting, well-balanced design\nPlayers who want to master a game and learn how to outfox their opponent directly\nWhat is Yomi?Yomi is the Capcom arcade fighter of card games, literally. Well, not entirely literally--it's not actually a Capcom project, although the game's designer (David Sirlin) did work on Streetfighter HD Remix. It takes the concepts behind the world's most popular competitive fighting games and translates them into a strategic card game.\n\nThere's four different types of moves (Attack, Throw, Block, and Dodge) which form an interacting triangle that should be familiar to fighting-game veterans: Attacks damage the opponent and blast through Throws, which also deal damage and wreak havoc on Blocks (which give you more cards) and Dodges (which let yoou counterattack), which in turn are great counters to Attacks. It's a cycle that gets easier and easier as you play the game, and then you start introducing wrinkles like character abilties, different cards, and special moves.\n\nHow Yomi PlaysThere's really three parts to Yomi play, and you have to get good at all of them. They feed into one another, so the better you get at one, the better you'll get at others.\n\nHand value: you have to be able to look at your hand of cards, and figure out what your strongest options are. If you're low on cards, Blocks become valuable. If you have a lot of high-damage cards, you'll want to look for ways to combo those cards into an attack to deal lots of damage to your opponent. Understanding how strong your cards are in a given situation is key to winning Yomi.\n\nCharacter playstyle: each character plays very differently, and you have to understand what your character's gameplan is--as well as your opponent's character. For instance, Argagarg the fish-person is playing a long game, with a special ability that deals damage to an opponent every turn. Jaina the hothead Phoenix Archer is a reckless rushdown character, with an ability that lets her return valuable attack cards to her hand after she combos them away...but she takes damage for each one.\n\nReading: also referred to as "yomi" by Sirlin and many players of the game, this is the skill of noticing patterns in your opponent's play and exploiting them...while realizing that they know you're doing it and are trying to outmaneuver you. This is the hardest part of the game to get a handle on, and it's a skill you'll have to hone very carefully over time, after you get used to different characters. It's also the most satisfying part of the game: when you get a read just right for the crucial final attack, it's glorious.\n\nThe Digital ClientSo, how's the implementation on Steam? Well, it's largely the same as the web client, but there's a few distinctions I noted, mainly in terms of performance. Steam Yomi is much, much smoother and faster, and it loads all the parts of the game much quicker. Having a bigger resolution is just wonderful, and it makes the cards look even better. So, relative to the web client on FantasyStrike.com, it's a massive step up.\n\nNow, compared to other digital card games, I think Yomi winds up as a solid middle-of-the-road. It doesn't have the rockstar pizzaz and spectacle that you'd find in Blizzard's Hearthstone, but the interface you do get is clean, fairly straightforward, and it feels smooth. There's a lot of little touches, like the visuals on the combat wins, which add up to a very enjoyable experience. I'd say it's comparable to what you'd find in the Sentinels of the Multiverse app, if not a bit better, and it's clearly head-and-shoulders over something like the app for Ascension. There's also lots of nice helpful bits to the in-game interface, such as the quick-access reference cards for both characters or the cards that you can sort and rotate in your hand as you like.\n\nThe Final VerdictYomi's not the fanciest game out there, but it's certainly tight, brainy, and sharp. It receives a high recommendation from me, both for a top-notch game and a smooth digital implementation. The 10 characters you get from the start are really fun to play with, and if you're interested in some more out-there playstyles, there's an expansion you can get in the game for $15. It'll last you a very, very long time.\n\nFIGHT!!!","May 9, 2015","true","91.3"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","52","58","4","2"

It's not very pretty, and there are a few mild annoyances with structure, but honestly you have to remember that this is - at its core - a card game.  If you'd rather not play a card game because the graphics aren't up to your standards , then you have some strange priorities.\n\n2) This game is not customizeable.  If none of the characters appeal to you, you are out of luck.  =/  (NOTE: This is also included as a positive, below.)\n\nSo one or two minor complaints.  As for THE GOOD:\n\n1) The creator of this game, David Sirlin, is kind of a big deal in the Fighting Game Community.  He was a pro until a nerve disability forced him to stop competing, so now he's a game designer with multiple big credits, a popular match commentator, and the admin of an educational Youtube channel about Fighting Games.  So he knows his stuff.\n\n2) The game itself is amazing.  Sirlin set out to replicate the "conversation" that happens in high-level Fighting Game play - the headgames, the "I-know-that-you-know-that-I-know" exchanges, and the judgment calls of when to take risks and when to play conservatively - without the 1/60th of a second reflex/dexterity requirements, or the hours and hours of drilling combos into muscle memory.  He succeeded.\n\n3) The game is simple, deep, balanced, and allows for a shocking amount of personal style.  The basic rock-paper-scissors mechanic is core to everything, but the characters manage to play SIGNIFICANTLY differently from one another because of their deck composition and character abilities.  In addition, there has been a HUGE amount of playtesting done (consistently, by hundreds of players, since at least 2010) to ensure that the characters are both true to concept as well as competitive with one another.\n\n4) The game is not customizeable, collectable, or pay-to-win.  You buy the game, you get the same game everyone else is playing.  Period.  The only reason I win (or lose) more than anyone else playing the same matches is because of personal ability, knowledge, and experience.\n\nIn closing, I would like to say that I kickstarted this exact game's physical copy last year, for $240.  What I got here cost me another $25 (sale), and I spent it HAPPILY.  Buy it.","May 10, 2015","true","45.9"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","37","45","3","3"

Over time the game has been refined into a really engaging, deep and most importantly, fun fighting game.  Each character is really strong on it's own merit, and there are no more really bad matchups, just slight advantages/disadvantages, far better than any other fighting game I've played.\n\nYomi is very accessible and easy to get into, but offers a lot of depth at high level play.  There aren't really overly hard game mechanics to understand.  At its core, the game is sort of rock-paper-scissors, but evaluation gets more involving.  There are always numerous options, which change constantly.  A strong combo can leave you without much hand strength, or get blue bursted(combo escaped).  Using your best and fastest moves early can limit your combat options if you're opponent still has his.  Throwing out and hitting DeGrey's Pilebunker is one of the most #YOLO moves ever, but so satisfying to hit.  It still takes some understanding of your characters attacks and abilities, and how they match up against an opponent's attacks and abilities to do well.  Then you get to the never ending game of trying to outthink and outlevel your opponent, which is really fun.  Being a card game there is some randomness, but it's not an absurd level like Hearthstone has.  Best of 3/Best of 5 sets are fairly standard, even when just casually playing or in a ranked quick match.  Long sets are nice to establish some history and level out the variance.\n\nPresentation wise the game is decent.  I've always found the art to be pretty stylish.  Character design is varied and well-done, thematically and gameplaywise.  Sprites on moves, especially special and super moves is great.  Rook, the Stone Golem punches hard, and doesn't dodge.  The Windmill Crusher special throw looks like it hurts and wow it does.  Setsuki, Ninja girl, is fast and evasive, but with low HP.\n\nOther miscellaneous things:\nThere are a number of helpful guides for each character over on the official Fantasy Strike forums, hopefully some guides get put up here too.\nCross platform play is pretty awesome.  Hearthstone barely runs on my iPad, but Yomi runs great on it, and the touch interface works well for it.\nSpectator mode and replays work well, which is a nice feature.\nFor new players, I recommend starting with Grave, Argagarg, or Rook, those characters are the most straightforward.  Feel free to give the rest of the cast a try and see who you like though.  Don't think that straightfoward or simple means worse though, I mained Argagarg for years when I started out and he's a still a very solid character.\n\n- Swiffle","May 8, 2015","true","31.8"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","26","36","3","0"

You can and should still invest plenty of time into the game, but it comes down to skill and mastery.  Gain -real- experience (not digital XP), learn strategies, practice and improve.

I'd prefer if the chat window wasn't a separate page and existed within the match screen, and merging my old account to use my preferred name was a little rough, but these are minor nitpicks. A more major nitpick is that the Expansion decks are $15, but if you view it as an expandable card game (and many won't since this is on Steam) then you're getting another 10 decks for what is the normal price of 10 decks, which is not bad. The other bit of microtransactions in the game, collectable cards that track match stats, is completely optional and therefore I feel does not detract at all from the game. (There is also EX characters, but these can be unlocked through gameplay and are just for fun anyway, so I don't really count them)\nOverall, there are certainly worse forms of microtransactions out there.\n\nThe core gameplay itself is fantastic, as to be expected from one of my favorite card games. It's nice to have an engine arbitrate the matches so there's no arguing over any rulings. The cards are all super high resolution, and the fight animations are entertaining for the simple little things they are. Finding matches has been extremely quick for me, and there's minimal lag in the game itself.\n\nHighly recommended!","May 11, 2015","true","3.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

However, (in my opinion) it was a runny turd.  I tried playing the "mind games" advertized by the developers, and did nothing but lost.  I read guides up the wazoo.  No luck.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gammalyrae/recommended/287960/","gammalyrae","NEKØ | Gamma Lyrae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gammalyrae/","207 products in account","I am a long time player of both fighting games, and competitive card games. I've played Fighters since the release of Street fighter 2: Championship edition, and have played games like Magic, Pokemon, and Hearthstone for a long time as well. My review will draw on these experiences.\n\n\n+++:\n\nThere is no pay to win here. Once you own the game, you own it. You will never be forced to fork over more money buying expansion packs or booster sets in order to stay competitive. For a competitive card game, this is HUGE. If you were initially attracted to CCGs such as Pokemon, Hearthstone, or Magic, you know exactly what it's like and exactly how much money you can end up investing into cards that quickly become worthless. There aren't even any grind to win or unlock mechanics here - you've bought a video game, and it doesn't waste your time or demand more money to _actually_ play. Imagine that, in the year 2015.\n\nIt is a surprisingly thorough adaptation of the concept of a fighting game - you get to make all of the same exact decisions you'd make in a real match, but at a much slower space. Two concepts were lost in translation, 1 of which being controlling space, and the other being meaty attacks, which has been delegated to a special ability of a single character. Everything else is here, though - pokes, combos, blocks, dodges, throws, special moves, supers, resource management, and most importantly, "Yomi", or, reading the opponent.\n\nYou always have access to key information about the match, such as whats in your discard pile, and your opponents discard pile. You always know how many cards are in your hand and your opponents hand, and you can look at your opponents character card to understand their abilities at any time, which can clue you in to what kind of opportunities they'll want to take advantage of. It is through all of this and more that the game has such incredible depth.\n\n\n---:\n\nThe interface isn't exactly amazing. It seems to be adapted from the mobile version of the game, which itself was adapted from the browser version of the game. It's functional and tells you everything you need to know, and it's certainly responsive enough, but it's not as pleasing to look at as other digital card games. The card art itself can be a little inconsistent, too - it seems that multiple artists were involved, and some were clearly better than the others. The music is kind of bland, but at least it's easily muted.\n\n+/-:\n\nI feel the game is being dishonest in listing itself as a $15 title with no DLC. The steam store purchase only grants you half of the characters, and unlocking the other half requires a $15 purchase made in-game. But if you can take a step back and really consider what you're getting here, even at the $30 price point, it is still a good deal. You wont ever have to drop money on expansion sets or booster packs, nor will you have to buy the Super Turbo edition of it next year or anything like that.\n\nIf you ever decide to transition to playing with the physical cards, you may be surprised to see that individual character decks cost about $10 each, which would place the price of the full game at $200, not including shipping, and this configuration would not allow mirror matches, either. This is not a price point that would allow you to own a complete set of the game and host tournaments with, but, again, take a step back here - every other CCG tournament on the planet requires you to bring your own deck, and for $10 you get a complete, playable deck. Single cards from "the other" CCGs can cost $10 or more. No matter how you slice it, money invested into this game will reward you with more gameplay options and less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t than CCGs and annually released fighting games.\n\nWorth mentioning:\n\nAs of this review, character unlocks are not shared cross-platform. What does this mean? Buying the game on steam does *not* give you access to characters using their webclient, or the iOS version of the game, and the same goes for the other versions - for example, if you've bought the iOS game and the expansion from the apple store, those unlocks do not carry over to the web client and steam versions - every platform is monetized separately, even in a very silly instance where the steam and web clients are nearly identical and played on the same OS, but are considered to be different platforms. Considering a single account tracks your win / loss records with each character, and stats tracked by unlocked cards are shared amongst all platforms, I am legitimately confused by the fact that unlocks are not shared. If the iOS version were priced to be competitive with other mobile games I could definitely understand this, but it's nearly a full priced game on that platform. They don't really make a point of stating this, so be aware.\n\nAs a final comparison between this and the physical version; the digital versions contain characters that have not yet been printed for the physical release. The physical game also includes rulesets for 2v1 and 2v2 combat, but they seem to be considered "for fun only" and no effort has gone into balancing characters around this ruleset, and as a result, the digital versions of the game do NOT include playable 2v1 or 2v2 modes. I suspect this is because the digital versions of the game have primarily served as a test bed for balance checks before David Sirlin had to commit to printing any one character, and the fact that everyone has been meticulously balanced over the course of several years for 1v1 play. Again, be aware of this if you were expecting the digital game to be a 100% feature complete version of the physical cards and their rulesets.\n\nJust like any fighting game, the single player experience is lackluster. You can practice against the AI, with two selectable difficulties, and there is some sort of survival mode for you to play around with, but the meat of the game is in playing against other human opponents. The AI will teach you bad, predictable habits that real people will see right through.","May 18, 2015","true","22.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","1"

Sirlin, the creator of this game, has slaved away for years to polish it to a mirror sheen.\n\nThe game is based on a simple rock-paper-scissors formula. Attacks beat Throws, Throws beat Blocks+Dodges, which beat Attacks in kind. However, the game goes beyond just throwing out options and hoping you win every time. Every character has special abilities and attacks that make some wins more important than others. One character has low combo damage, but every turn that passes slowly ticks away his opponent's life. He's quite content to sit and block all day! But that means everyone wants to throw him, so maybe he should attack in an attempt to beat those pesky throws. What to do? Every decision is tough, but success is so very rewarding!\n\nThe game features 20 characters, all very well balanced and have very unique playstyles.  The blazing fast Jaina will stop at nothing to rush you down, while the calm Argagarg will slowly and methodically grind you down. The patient Master Midori will stand against any attack, but once he can turn into a Dragon, it'll be your turn to take the beating!

I distinctly remember playing the Print and Play physical version in college... that must have been 4 years now at the very least. Needless to say, the game holds up well to repeated play and the Steam implementation leaves nothing to be desired (maaaaybe automated tournaments?).\n\n\nWhat seems like mindless Rock-Paper-Scissors at first turns out to be a complex interplay of resource management, evaluation, risk-management and reading of the opponent both in terms of making educated guesses about their hands and getting into their heads to guess their chosen combat option.\n\nThe character cast is large (10 +10 in the expansion), diverse and very well balanced. The community is active, welcoming and regularly organizes leagues and tournaments at http://www.fantasystrike.com/forums/index.php?forums/yomi-fighting-card-game.27/ .\n\nMaybe most importantly, this is NOT a collectible card game. 10 characters have to be unlocked by purchasing the expansion but every character is represented by a single, fixed deck. What may be a downside for those who like customization, this is great for competitive players who are looking for an even playing field. In-game purchases exist but are restricted to cosmetics, stat-tracking and (also grindable) overpowered fun-versions of the characters that can only be used in custom games.\n\n\nHighly recommended for fans of card and fighting games alike.\n\n\n\nNote that you can try the game for free at http://www.fantasystrike.com/forums/index.php?portal/","July 9, 2015","true","90.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I bought the physical version on Kickstarter last year, I have the iOS app and also have the characters bought in the browser client.\n\nThere seems to be 2 groups of people who enjoy this game, 1) people with a history of fighting games and 2) people with a history of card games. And it is interesting how the different takes on the game shows itself in the playstyle of each player.\n\nIt is also a very balanced game. In most competitive card games, there are decisive counter picks that just recks your opponents choice of decks. This is not the case in Yomi, every character stands a decent chance of winning against any other character in the game. This makes it a lot more diverse to play than a lot of the others.\n\nJust be aware that this game only grants you access to the first 10 characters, and there is an ingame purchase for unlocking the 10 other characters as well.\n\nAlso, the chat implementation is not that great sadly. While you have a chat bar underneath where you hold your cards, it would be better to have it look like the browser client does.

Completely unacceptable.\n5) On Linux, I only get crackling instead of music / SFX.

Every combat-reveal is super tense and exciting, and you get a real feeling like you are playing against your opponent. Matches are full of drama and twists and turns.\n\nLogistically, it is easy to find a match (I have never waited more than a couple of minutes) at all hours of the night, which is important for a game like this, because the single player is dull and just for practice really. Multiplayer is where it's at. While you wait to be ready to jump in, there are a few short tutorials and reference cards to get you up to speed with how the game works and what each character is capable of.\n\nAs a final word of praise, there is real depth and replay value here, with 10 characters to learn in the base set, and 10 more in the expansion. Not just how to play as them, but how to fight against them, as well. Every character is unique and balanced in their own way.\n\nThe interface could use some improvement, and I would like some additional features. Hopefully development is ongoing; I've seen indications that it is.

Fighting games, when you perfect your execution, become 100% about predicting what the opponent will do, and deciding what the optimal response is to that.\n\nThe game is somewhere between rock-paper-scissors, poker, and a fighting game. Every character plays uniquely, and controls game flow in their own way. The rock-paper-scissors mechanic is the most evident on a passing glance, which might give the game a shallow appearance, but the addition of varying damage on your rock and paper options, and varying abilities on each character means that every individual iteration of RPS has a grander significance in the match as a whole. It may well be worth losing three matches to win one very important one later.\n\nIf you want to learn basic fighting game strategy, this game will teach you. If you already know it but want to compete with friends who may not have the same level of execution skill as you, this game will do that.\n\nYomi has the rock-paper-scissors of movement vs attack vs throw, it has mixups, it has meter building, it has supers, and it has much more. The game emulates a fighting game as perfectly as you can in a turn-based format. I think anyone who has a competitive spirit will find enjoyment in it.\n\nThe only flaw I would find with this game is it is difficult to grasp the rules in the early stages in a digital format. The physical game made that simpler. I don't know if this is a concern possible to fix in this format, but your first couple games might be rough. Pushing past that is definitely worth it, though.","December 26, 2015","true","65.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperridley/recommended/287960/","hyperridley","Norbert Beaver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperridley/","33 products in account","Note on price: Currently the game in the Steam store is just to buy the base characters (10 total), with the other 10 being an expansion you purchase in-game. There are intentionally broken EX characters you can use to goof around with friends, but you can't take them into ranked games.  There's been some confusion as to what you're actually getting so I'm setting the record straight.  Ignore all the people who says it's pay-to-win, there's 0 things you can buy that improve your chances of winning.\n\nYomi is what happens when you take a deck of playing cards and throw it in a blender with the fighting game genre.  There are combos and combo-breakers, blocking and throws, special moves, super moves with a type of "meter" system, heck there are even knockdowns and mix-ups!  It all translates really well to card format.\n\nThe main gameplay is basically rock-paper-scissors on steroids.  Imagine if there were situations where paper could beat scissors but they had to have fulfilled a special condition first, while rock gave triple the points of the others.  It gets crazy and complicated, yet still manages to be nicely balanced, as you can always overcome a disadvantages situation if you know what your opponent is about to do.  The trick is making it as difficult as possible for your opponent to know what YOU'RE planning.  There's 20 characters with different abilities based on actual fighting game concepts, even including a "ranged" character in the mix!\n\nThe graphics are pretty basic (this is a card-game after all) but they get the job done.  The art for the special moves is nice at least.  The music is intense and sets the mood, though in the abstract I do kind-of giggle thinking about epic music playing in the middle of a methodical card game.\n\nDespite all the complexity of the system, it's fairly good at helping new players get into the swing of things.  There's a good tutorial and the fighting game metaphor helps players of that genre get into the mindset to deal with the things the game can throw at you.  Basing the character decks on a traditional 52 card system (plus 2 jokers) provides a nice foundation for keeping track of your options, and it has real gameplay implications too.\n\nOverall, Yomi is a really fun, intense, strategic card game that is a great translation of the fighting game genre.","May 18, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Say what? In Yomi, each character is represented by an unique deck that consists of Attacks, Throws, Dodges, Blocks, and Jokers. What makes each character unique are the variable numbers of each cards, character abilities, life, etc. The game plays like a rock-paper-scissor game where things like attacks beats throws, throws beat dodges and blocks, etc. But the game is so much more than that. Depending on which card you use, winning gives you different benefits. Winning with an attack leaves your opponent open to combos (playing straights or special cards to link cards), or winnign with a dodge lets you counter-attack with a single attack. I own the physical card game and this PC version is very faithful to the original source. I highly recommend it to people who love card games or always wanted to play a fighting game but are not too great with inputs, memorizing moves, and other stuff.\n\nFor a better in-depth how to play, check out Watch It Played's Yomi Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yb0C9yZBM","December 24, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's easy to learn and highly accessible in all sorts of ways, though the UI could use some optimization.\n\nDue to the strong emphasis on the complex set of interactions between characters, the psychological aspect to this game is intense as it's moniker would suggest. Admittedly, both players do need to first understand the incentives in playing certain cards over others in a given match up since each character has a different distribution of possible plays.\n\nI played when online Yomi was still on version 1 rules, and main'ed Gloria, who specializes in card recycling, life sustain, and guaranteed damage mechanics. Despite her crippling nerfs, every game feels very close against everyone. That part was tongue-in-cheek because Gloria used to be disgustingly OP... Anyways, if you even start beasting (and you will get games where you outplay every move), it will feel extremely rewarding because you are literally in your opponent's head.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent roster of characters, each representing a typical fighting game character archetype.\n+ Mimicks fighting games very closely, without any of the button input execution frustrations.\n+ Unique set of rules that relies on hovering exactly one step ahead of your opponent.\n\nCons:\n- Setsuki OP (in all fairness, this is due to everyone else getting nerfed).\n- Frustrations will happen anyways due to occasional misclicking.\n- These rules also mean staying two steps ahead of your opponent will result in a disadvantage.\n- 10 optional DLC expansion characters to round out the cast\n- UI is not optimized (chat text is still hard to read as of 7/4/2015, can't copy and paste, etc).\n\n-------------------\nFinal Verdict: 10/10 Oh god I can't do anything against Setsuki please help m-\n\nWhat?

Music's generic. UI/Design is pretty low rent.\n\nEverything is pretty low quality except the game play, really. It's the kind of thoughtful, belabored product that you would except from board game maker David Sirlin.\n\nTo put into perspective how woefully out of touch the pricing is for this game ($15 for half the cast, +$15 for an additional in game purchase for the rest of the cast), Shovel Knight is the same price as this game.\n\nIf the whole cast were available at $15 I would recommend this because Yomi is just a wonderful game with no real competition in terms of genre at the moment. But you're better off just saving money and buying the physical game itself: you get a lot more for your money's worth. This is, at it's heart, a card game, and nothing about this electronic rendition justifies the price point.","May 14, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The digital version is well done and intuitive. The in-game tutorial is decent, the game is easy to learn yet deceptively deep.  Watch some youtube videos and try the web version for free if you are on the fence. There are links to several resources for the game in a post on my Digital Card and Board gaming site: http://realmchat.forumotion.com/","May 10, 2015","true","34.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The problem is that the game bills itself as based on fighting games yet the game has half the roster locked behind a paywall. They can be unlocked but the time required to do so is F2P tier.\n\nIf a regular fighting game had a roster of 50% DLC characters, it would be a joke. So, in reality, to appreciate this game you need to throw down $30 for the complete package.\n\nPlus, RNG dictating whether or not you can poke, block, or grab is really lame.","June 22, 2015","false","3.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Yomi is for you!\n\nGameplay wise, it's smooth just like the card game, the rules work nicely and make matches quick.\n\nBut it's a boring game visually, no flare or spectacle.\n\nPlay virutal chess and what you see is what you get, a clean game for the thinking man.\n\nPlay Yomi and what you get is pumping loud (Not very great sounding imo) music to boring static characters who rotate horizontally to indicate they're knocked over.","May 9, 2015","false","1.1"," 12 of 36 people (33%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","33","12","36","4","0"
