And your towers. And your strawberries. And everything else.\nWith diamonds you'll research/buy new towers or upgrades in a special "shop-map" and said red berries are the per-map-currency with which you can buy weapons which you can either plant into the ground (fixed positions) as stationary defences or plant into yourself for additional firepower or utility.\nYou plant seeds in fixed spots that grow more strawberries regularly. But the more you build, the more you have to maintain/repair which will get very demanding in later waves.\nYou can also plant repair-arms, factories which gather berries themselves, small droids to help you fight, etc.\nAnd what you have planted, you can pickup again and plant elsewhere. Or keep it on yourself. Whatever floats your boat here.\nAt some point in a level the strawberry-production will be stopped and you'll have to do with what you gathered so far, so you better hurry up in the first place, which is easier said than done :-)\n\nThe level selector is a map by itself, which is a neat idea. There are "only" 12 maps, but each with additional challenges and more to keep you going. There's even a nice "zoo" where you can see all creatures you've encountered so far.\nYou can then compare your results with your friends. The Dev plays the game himself and has awesomely high scores. I bet he cheats :-)\n\nThe good (what to love):\nUnique and one-of-a-kind!\nIt's adorable and got a cute art-style\nWalk around as heavy armed artillery? Or a repair-god? Or as a berry-gathering maniac? Or as a weakling in a heavily defended base? Rely on YOU or your towers? Your choice.\nEach weapon (if you attach them onto yourself) can be charged for an additional punch. And separately if you wish to do so. E.g. Left arm makes PEW PEW PEW!-lasers while the right arm charges a big missile. Awesome!\nYou don't just place a tower and leave it be. No, they will get destroyed too. Did someone say micromanagement? Hell yeah!\nBerries, seeds and diamonds vanish over time. So you need to grab them ASAP. Oh and of course you only can carry a limited amount of each, so you need to deliver them to your base all the time. OR you can attach a factory onto yourself and...\nCool music\nIt has COOP-features, which i have not tested yet\nThere's a story. But I really don't care about a story in a TD. But it does not hurt either :-)\nEven with a totally overcrowded with hundreds of enemies and explosions and whatever else it remains playable. Performance is very good.\nThe bad (not good, but not gamebreakingly awful):\nIn some maps, at some points it can get horribly overcrowded up to the point where it's easier to oversee snowflakes in a snowstorm than enemies and towers :-)\nThere apparently WAS an in-game-shop or something like that. That thing's still there in the map-selector with only a "closed" sign. That's annoying. Wanna see it all!\nThe ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):\nNothing!\n\nRecommended?\n\nYou like Tower Defence games and maybe action shooters and some RTS too? Definitely worth a try!\nYou hate one of the said genres? You MAY still like it anyway.\nThere's no game I could say that is quite similar, so a comparison is out of question here.\nI really enjoyed it, although it's no "classic" TD.\n\nToo sad it didn't had the commercial success it deserved. Maybe the Dev should have named it "Fingered" or "NotGTAV" :-(","September 6, 2015","true","12.9"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","44","47","4","7"

Rest of review below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/LOHDHqzm0yI\n\nIn it you're a little rover returning home with your rather silly shuttle, only to find your once beautiful planet has been ruined and its spirit silent. As the two of you set out on a quest to not only find out what's happened, but to restore the planet to its once beautiful self.\n\nThis is done planting trees, and of course lasers, along with varied other weapons.\nThe planet has been fracked, and its resources drained. Leaving it barren and its fauna and flare horribly mutated. The game might be rather linear in its story, but it lends itself to it very well and never having a boring spot.\n\nThe shuttle is the voice of reason; to some extent. Telling what to do, how to do it and why. It's you're job to save the world, and protect not only the shuttle but yourself. As a little rover you can mount any item you can make, whether that's a little bonsai tree, a robotic repair arm, or a set of lasers!\n\nDuring the missions, aliens, and mutants are hell bent on stopping you. They've become rather accustomed to the horrible lava filled and corrupted world. This is where the tower defence mechanics come in, although you simply do not drop a turret and leave. Oh no, the creatures will happily destroy them on their path towards the shuttle, and you have a lot of micro managing to do. Running around repairing turrets, upgrading them, planting trees, and harvesting strawberries and diamonds.\n\nThe two things that you depends on your fuel, and research. During the hectic battles you still need to try and harvest as many strawberries as possible. They are they currency with which you buy much needed items, and weapons. Take to long and they either disappear, get eaten, or the dreaded Strawberry DRM kicks in. Each mission has an undisclosed countdown, to when the DRM kicks in. Effectively turning the strawberry plants into crystals and halting your supplies.\n\nThis makes the game quite hectic as you have do all this, your objectives, and fend of hordes of mutants.\nAdding to this is the collection of diamonds, which are used to research newer weapons, and items, along with upgrades for current ones. Not only this but they're also used to buy special items that can only be used during missions. These are vitally important. Especially for the later missions that feel almost impossibly difficult.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the severe upgrade cost for items. Some need 1000 diamonds, and they're already hard to get and keep. As once you've used them for a mission item you need to earn new ones. This is done through the various arenas and challenge missions, although they can be even more difficult than the last missions.\nThis forces you to have a nasty grind in the quest to get diamonds, especially since the early challenge missions only reward you with around 25-30 if you do very well.\n\nAlso you can only pick up and carry a set amount of diamonds and strawberries, and they all go into the same pouch. Meaning that in a rather difficult fight you need to try and pick up the correct ones, while managing your defences.\n\n\nOverall the game blends all these things extremely well, and it's a very addictive game. I simply could not stop playing, even despite the bit of a diamond grind. I would easily recommend this game to people that just want a good fun game, with some weird humour, and lots of lasers.","September 5, 2014","true","8.1"," 61 of 74 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","61","74","0","0"

Played this co-op in beta with my son and nephew, then 10 and 8 years old. It was a joy to play then, and it has only improved since. It combines Tower Defence with strategic action. You can place towers in pre-determined slots on the map, and additionally carry one tower on your back.\n\nAs you defend your spacecraft from attack, you have to consider repairing towers and your spacecraft, and defending and gathering of ressources. This is where co-op is particularly fun, as you can divide tasks between you, and devise a strategy together to beat a level.\n\nThe graphics are colorful and cel shaded. As with all cel shaded graphics, this can become tiresome for the eyes. On the other hand it creates a nice display of colours, and makes items and entities easy to identify.\n\nThe music is simple and excellent, fits the theme of the game well.\n\nThe story is a little generic, but is suitable and when everything combines, it makes for a great game for adults and kids.\n\nEven in beta the game was well put together, something not always the case these days when it comes to Greenlit games on Steam. The price may be a bit too high, but the three years in the making shows, so maybe it's reasonable after all.","September 10, 2014","true","9.0"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","1"

The pace is on the slow sid.  It is fun and can be occasionally challenging.  It can also be slightly confusing.  I am enjoying it, picked it up in a bundle a long time ago, and it just recently hit Steam.  It's a unique tower defense and I give it a cautious thumbs-up for introducing some new ideas (and plenty of nods to other tower defense games, especially the strawberries of Defense Grid.)\n\n","November 23, 2014","true","2.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

To me you can’t even compare this game to other tower defense I was hooked instantly. I know I only have a 100 minutes but I will complete it all  :D. The research place is also interesting because most game tower defense games don’t do that you get better stuff by level. The characters I meet so far are cool I like the jokes the ship makes and your robot has already impressed me too me this game would make me look at other tower defense. If someone asked me what I would give it, I would give it a 9/10. The things that bother me are that you can get stuck easily on the monsters and other stuff and so can your robot dogs and die ;(. The story I have mixed feelings I don’t like it nor do I hate it, the reason why is because it seems a bit bland to me.  But that wouldn’t stop me from playing I would recommend this to people I know even if they don’t like tower defense games, this game has me in its hands.\n","September 5, 2014","true","10.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Everything is good, from gameplay, to progression, economy, enemies, ect.\n\nEvery match you plant seeds in pre-placed seed beds, which produce strawberries, which act as the games currency for buying and upgrading towers. This adds a additional element many tower defense games don't have, as you need to defend your strawberry patches. The other currency is diamonds. Diamonds are gained from certain enemy kills, and are used to buy tower upgrades and special abilities.\n\nThere is alot of variety with the towers and upgrades, and the game is fun both in single and multi player. There is a limited number of campaign levels, estimated about 5 hours playtime. However there are hardcore and survival versions of almost every level which can ramp up the game time considerably, and are very fun. Playing online is also considerably fun.\n\nAll in all a great game, worth the money and recommended to tower defense and arcade shooter fans.","September 9, 2014","true","8.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It is part Tower defense, part 3rd person shooter, part RTS. It has good graphics with good game mechanics as well. You can play for any period of time to either kill some time or just go BALLZ OUT and just destroy everything and everyone to see how far you can get within the levels. The best part of this game is that it is actually very challenging.\n\nEach level has its own style and you have to find that sweet spot just to clear it. of course you will never be happy on how you did on the previous level, so you'll want to retry it yet again and do a different build. And the best part is, each level has a challenge level and a nightmare level where you get to play from where you left off at in your previous playthrough instead of starting from scratch. So if you end up getting your butt kicked (and you will) you can go back and redo the easier mode to set yourself up better in the harder difficulties.\n\nAnd just when you thought you had a good strategy and build, you unlock and upgrade more and more towers and weapons, which is awesome, but is also like throwing a wrench in the gears, because you have to rethink everything you have just learned. But its all good, that is a great feeling and adds so much more to the game.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who has just the slightest interest in Tower Defense, Challenging games, building games, cutesy games, ect. This game may not look like much, but it has more than you can imagine. Try it, buy it, get involved.

While planting and harvesting strawberries, you have to keep the "local population" away from them and prevent your own destruction, because they bite and shoot.\n\nHandling is very easy,\nJust run, collect and upgrade.

It’s a timeless story about you (a puppy-like robot named McDROID) and your friend SHUTTLE crash-landing on the dying Planet M. You must plant and harvest strawberries as a form of currency to build and upgrade towers to fight off the corrupted creatures that have taken a stronghold on Planet M. This may really sound strange, but it’s also a truck load of fun!\n\nMaintaining your calm, like John Spartan, is crazy essential to McDROID. If you don’t keep a clear head you’ll start forgetting to maintain your defenses so you can gather stuff or you’ll forget about gathering strawberries and have nothing to buy towers with. Things can go from good to “Oh sweet mother! Where did all THAT come from!?!” fairly quickly. That’s part of the strategy/challenge though.\n\nSince the game comes off as having a tower defense game foundation one can assume a usual set of rules: set defense->kill monsters->gain money repeat. McDROID rarely gives you the currency needed to buy towers or to beef them up from drops (while in the stage). You need to find and plant seeds to grow your strawberries. You’ll usually start with a few seeds and then get more from monsters to plant later. Then, not only do you have to pick them when they ripen, but you also have to take them to SHUTTLE. Then you can spend them on defense. Also, you can only carry a certain amount at one time.\n\nAll this takes time away from the front lines of battle. You’ll quickly learn that if you ignore the front line for too long in hopes for more profit, the front line will be in your face in no time. Eventually you’ll get blueprints for a gathering tower the helps by harvesting strawberries and gathering diamonds nearby. Don’t scoff at the idea like I did; use this helpful tower!\n\nOf all the things that the bad guys do drop, you will receive diamonds from some of them and these are essential. High scores… screw’m. You can come back later for that. Diamonds help a lot more in the long run. They are used in the researching of bigger and badder guns to help repel the waves of no-goodniks. Oh, I guess you could also buff your defenses too, but isn’t the best defense a good offense? That does come with a cost though. If you unlock all four levels of your laser turret, you may only be able to have one fully upgraded turret instead of multiple lower end ones. Is that worth it? It varies on each situation. Sometimes the upgraded turret can function differently than the previous levels and you may not even like it! Spend you diamonds carefully… or not really, you can always get more!\n\nSomething else that stands out in McDROID is the humor. It’s… strange. Not the “so far out of left field you can’t fathom it” strange, but you will probably tilt your head and question if you just heard what was said. It’s nothing inappropriate, just different. Some of the things said in McDROID also had me rolling. This is a light-hearted title that holds a crowbar behind it’s back. One minute it will have you laughing and the next the sudden change in a battle’s tide will have you crying.\n\nOne of the best parts of McDROID is the coop. Normally this is something that is just tacked on for me and is nifty, but not all together necessary for me to have a good time. While single the single player campaign is great fun, playing this crazy madness with friends is simply a blast! It can be a bit confusing at first with the strawberry collection being shared and one teammate (read: me) spending all of them on some venture that he thinks is a great idea. Hopefully it pays off, but it won’t 100% of the time. Diamonds collected go to each individual person, but when spent only get taken from the one who purchased said item. It’s a very nice touch.\n\nScore: Gewd./Tasty!\n\nOther than a small issue with the back button on my controller causing some problems, McDROID is a delight to play with or without friends. The concept is great and executed fantastically. It’s not super deep, but it’s got depth where it needs it. If you are a fan of strategy/tower defense games, you owe it to yourself to pick this up and give it a try. It may not be a walk in the park, but there are some nice views to take in while your rampaging across Planet M.","September 5, 2014","true","42.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Not really understanding the decision to only allow the droid to pick up a finite number strawberries or gems.....really annoying when you are trying to pick up gems for upgrades but you can't because your guy picked up the strawberries instead.  Also,  Need to maybe make a no kidding tutorial.  I had no clue what was going on other than by pressing buttons and seeing what happened.\nGood feature is the auto attack while you are running around.  I noticed the hit box is a little unforgiving when human controlled.

If i am missing something please let me know, but according to it i finished the tree of life and thats pretty much the end. So i payed £13.50 for a few hours of gameplay some which were just painful grinding to get diamonds. i have to compare this to say kingdom rush - £6.99 for  70 hours+ gameplay. in its current state this game is well overpriced.\nNow deleting!\n\nI purchased this with very little to go on, only around 3 reviews at the time of purchase. It's a great game i do however think it is more inclined towards multiplayer if you want to advance at a reasonable pace. I seem to have to be "grinding" to get diamonds to unlock upgrades etc in single player. Also the tutorial doesnt really explain things very well and as your thrown in at the deep end ( in single player ) it can seem a little overwhelming, As you realize that your wasting the diamonds you need for upgrades on mines etc, evetually it causes you to play a lot more strategically to save resources for upgrades.\n\nGraphically its nicely done and it all plays very well. The only problem i really encountered was whilst i was carrying a turret at one point i seem to become lodged in the "mother ship" there seemed no way to free myself and it forced me to restart the level. Also i noticed that trying to traverse the pathway from level to level with the keyboard causes your droid to walk diagonally ( i saw a few people fall off the path - having the same problem ) this problem however doesnt occur with a  controller.\n\nAll in all a good game with only a couple of minor flaws ( that i have found so far )","September 6, 2014","false","10.8"," 9 of 31 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","9","31","0","8"

Levels progress slowly, it takes forever to kill enemies, the diamond upgrade system also seems like a grind. The fact that there is a tower on the player just seems gimmicky, and just makes it so you are constantly hovering over enemy’s with your mouse, a brainless activity.

I like tower defense games so I figured I'd like this but there are quite a few unique things for this one.\n\nPros:\nLighthearted (Tries it's best to be ridiculous with it's dialog)\nCrazy (The turrets talk, your main currency to buy things is strawberries, the main character looks like a toilet with the basket on its back)\nSmall, this game seriously only takes up 800 MB or something at the time of writing this.\nMultiplayer, always nice to play with friends.\n\nCons:\nShort (I haven't finished it yet and haven't tried the challenges but for the regular maps I think I'm already half way done.)\nCharacter customization seems to be disabled at the moment, you can interact with paint cans to change your color but not much else.\n\nOn a random note you fight using the turrets by attaching one to your head, this makes you a mobile defense base more than it gives you a weapon though, you can command nearby towers to shoot a given place anyway and the one on your back is no different, it'll also shoot automatically when you're not commanding it. It's a bit different and doesn't make a huge difference but I found it a bit of a strange system at first.\n\nDefinitely worth a look if you're into coop tower defense type games.","June 1, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
