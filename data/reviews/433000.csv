"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/433000/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Susan has to save again the Lost Lands from demons that were awaken from their stone prison... because humans touched a cursed gold, found in a ancient tomb. However, she'll meet new friends, see familiar faces and visit new places...\n\nLost Lands: The Golden Curse is the third game in the series. After saving her son from a dark overlord and defeating the Black Horsemen, Susan has to save the Lost Lands again from demons that were turned to stone centuries ago. At this point, the story seems common, however, with the new friends she's making and the fact that she'll face new enemies, it's still very well-written. As for the chapter bonus, you'll finally know what happened to Sandra, a fisher, when she was a young girl.\n\nNothing really changed in terms of gameplay, it's still an hidden object games, though the scenes are still a silhouette one, making it hard to achieve it without misclick or under a certain time (achievements, achievements). The majority of the puzzles are easy. Also, some items can be combined or inspected to find another one.\n\nDespite not being indicated in the title, this is a collector's edition: it means that you can replay minigames, unlock the music, concept art, bonus games (puzzles), etc.. It's always nice to have some extras or more chances for achievements (concerning minigames). You even have a quizz with twenty questions to see if you did follow the story! I don't know if it's unlocking something but well, it's reminding me the questions at the end of a CSI case to earn more points.\n\nThe graphics didn't change from the previous game: Susan has changed again her haircut, the Lost Lands are still full of surprises and brightful, you're even visiting a castle that could lead to madness with many problems to solve, you're visiting floating isles: one is under the snow while the majority of them are more showing a spring/summer weather... And the soundtrack didn't change too, which is also a good thing as it was good. Voice acting is also correct.\n\nThe Golden Curse seemed less longer than the other games, however, the cutscenes aren't short. As you can't skip them if you want an achievement, you have to go through them.\n\nHowever, there is something that Five-BN should avoid. After important scenes, you have suddenly a screen asking you to rate the game (I suppose write a review here). You're under the impression to be into a mobile game. It was very annoying. Seriously, the screen popping once, I can understand. But so many times? Anyway, that's how I knew that I would enter a new chapter of the story.\n\nLost Lands: The Golden Curse is a nice sequel, where you learn more about the Lost Lands. However, it would be nice to let Susan a little in peace and maybe have a local hero. Why not a game set in the time where the druids cursed the gold? Or why not being a young Marroon? Or maybe an adult Fiora? Why only reserve bonus chapters to locals? Anyway, if anything, the game is sold to an interesting price for a collector's edition. Go for it!","April 3","true","10.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Twenty years have passed in the Lost Lands since the Dark Horsemen roamed the Lands causing strife and destruction, this time she has been brought to help lift a petrifying curse that reaches into her own world.  Third in Lost Lands Hidden Object series (The free to play games do not count) and by far the most complex.\n\nStoryline:  Before Maaron was born, the Druids in order to end Gorasar Conn's, the conqueror dwarf's reign agreed to pay a tribute to him and his four generals; a golden tribute, gold the Druids cursed to petrify him and his generals.  The dwarf conqueror and his generals, a harpy, a fiery golem, a minotaur and a snake woman, indeed became petrified.  The chest of cursed Druid gold was taken by Lephron Conn (leprechaun pun- lol) last of the Dwarf Priests after the defeat of the conqueror dwarf, Gorasar Conn, his brother, and he hide it where no one in the Lost Lands could find it (in the human realm).  For centuries the dwarf conqueror and his generals remained petrified until an archeologist in the human realm stumbled across the crypt of Lephron Conn and the cursed gold.  Curious, the archealogist removed a golden key and became petrified releasing the petrification spell on one of the generals, the Harpy.  Susan is brought back to the Lost Lands to undo the curse that has now affected her world and to defeat the four generals once again.\n\nGameplay: Hidden Object interactive silhouette picture scenes, a massive find and use inventory, point and click, a huge variety of puzzles and mini-games, and the absolutely necessary fast travel map.  (Fast travel in this game is definitely encouraged and the player can "bounce" through all five mapped areas doing things to accomplish a single task.)\n\nFive-BN went to back to the roots of gaming by creating a huge open world minus the bottlenecks, making game progression based solely on tasks performed.  The order of the tasks is actually quite logical and linear in their progression and would be how someone confronted with the same events most likely would prioritize the tasks needed to be done.  Here is where the player is either going to hate this game or love it.\n\nAs I mentioned before, this is a huge open world, and yes the player can easily collect inventory items in the first several scenes of the game that have no use until several chapters later or even the end of the game.  Now add to this the ability to know where things are but not necessarily interact with them until also late in the game.  For example, finding a box in the hollow of a tree early in the game but not being able to open it until the end of the game.  Or having a mechanical eyeball in your inventory found almost at the start and not needing it until the end of the game.  Or even seeing that item out on the lava bed but not being able to reach it until much later (when snowshoes are found).  Play on casual mode (for active locations), or use the strategy guide on hard mode, because unless one take notes or has a superb memory the player will most likely forget where something is.  There simply is that much.\n\nThen, of course, we have the fast travel map which can quite helpfully send the player "bouncing" through all 5 map areas and any location within that area to complete a task.  For example: Discovering rose petals are needed when standing in the Castle of Madness, Minotaur's lair.  Now where to get rose petals?  Oh yes, I planted a rose bush earlier in the game.  Where is that rosh bush again?  Hmmm..., oh yes the Cemetary, located on the Dark Lands map.  Go there get them, come back, all very simple with fast travel assuming the player remembers where the rose petals are in the first place.  This is quite common throughout the game.   Love it or hate it the whole game plays like that.\n\nPuzzles: Highlights of the game - a "chutes and ladder" board game played with dice, and an actual dot-to-dot puzzle.  Such fun and quite the novelty for anyone who remembers either or both.  For music "lovers": the music puzzles actual give the player the order of the notes BEFORE solving.  (Yeah!!)  The trick is finding the solution in the first place.  There are rotating sliders which seem twitchy but are not.  The rings lock in place when they are in the correct place with a little musical twinkle. Even with that they are still a challenge to do since they rotate backwards, as well.  Mazes, matching, logic, tangram, among other types of puzzles.  Huge variety.\n\nHidden finds: Morphing objects, collectibles, manuscript papers and the contents of Susan's purse which can not be missed since the player finds and uses them as inventory items.  If the player manages to find all the collectibles this unlocks the Bonus Game which unlocks after the bonus chapter is completed.\n\nAll Extras become are available after the bonus chapter is completed.  Extras include the Bonus Game which is "Flow Free" since I do not know what else to call it.  (The game where the player connects all the different colored dots without overlapping.)  There is a 20 question trivia quiz which restarts if you answer incorrectly, plus picture puzzles.  All the mini-games can also be replayed in this section.  If the player missed the achievement during gameplay the achievement can be earned in the Extra section.  (Love this feature.) Extras also include wallpapers, concept art, music, and cutscene videos.\n\nAll achievements can be earned during a single playthrough.  There is one achievement that can only be earned during the bonus chapter.  Unfortunately, there are no trading cards which is a shame since the artwork and graphics are so detailed, colorful and beautiful.\n\nHighly recommend this game, the whole series in fact.","March 28","true","14.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
