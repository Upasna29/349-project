"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/32430/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is an action adventure game releasing initially on PS2, PS3, Wii, Xbox360, iOS, Nintendo DS, PSP and who could forget, the N-Gage. The Ultimate Sith edition of the game finally released on PC and Mac OS in November 2009.   The plot in The Forced Unleashed is between the first two trilogies of Star Wars films, but acts as an original story.  You play the role of Darth Vadar’s apprentice, as you are tasked with hunting down Jedi – but you slowly become part of the Light side as things do not go as planned.\n\nThe game play is very hack and slash style, with the good old classic lightsaber action and with a drop of force action too, the combat is very exciting and pack with all sorts of fancy attacks and duels. Part of your force powers includes the use of electric shocking your enemies too; this can be extremely pleasing to do on large groups of Stormtroopers. The combo system with the lightsabre is easy to get a grip of, and you can soon be showing off some crazy attacks, that look simply awesome.   The game does have quite a lot of QTE’s throughout, these normally occur at the end of a regular fight, allowing a more cinematic dramatic end to a fight, normally I am not a fan of QTEs, but these are done in a way which allow you to enjoy what is happening on the screen whilst also testing your speed and awareness of what is going on.\n\nThis game is old now, having released almost six years ago, the graphics are becoming to look a bit dated, but that’s not to say it is a bad looking game at all.  It is certainly not up to the standards we are used to now, but if you stick this on 1080p, you can still get some really nice looking scenes. The animation of all the characters are done brilliantly, and all of the levels look fleshed out with some really cool looking backdrops.\n\nPlot wise, this has got to be one of my favourite Star Wars games. I really enjoyed playing as the Dark side for once in this type of game, but you can’t stay as the Dark side, as events unfold, you soon start becoming part of the Jedi’s and working to over throw the Emperor.  It will really get you in the mood for watching the film series again.\n\nThis isn’t a very difficult game; the only times I died were due to errors in the platforming side of the game and I ended up falling off the edge of the world. The difficulty can be ramped up, so playing on hard mode may be the way forward to get more of a challenge. The end boss fights pose a little bit of a challenge, but nothing that you can’t really overcome. I’m looking at you, Star Destroyer boss!\n\nEven though the game is very linear, the levels are all of a decent size, and have multiple paths to the end.  With plenty of hidden items for you to collect as you go, you’ll be jumping and fighting your way through plenty of enemies to find them.  I was a little disappointed to see that a couple of the levels were essentially the same map, just done in a different order so to speak, just seemed a little lazy on that part.\nThe game is also on the short side, having completed the game in just less than four hours on a normal difficulty. There is little reason to play it through for a second time unless you are trying the harder modes.\n\nI had a couple of technical problems whilst playing. I did go into the game expecting there to be some given the age of the game. The first issue I had was, even when selecting 1080p, the game still doesn’t play in a full screen, you get black bars down the side of your game, which are very annoying. Secondly, the game is capped at 30fps – I can only assume that is because it is a port of the PS3 game. Thirdly, the sound on some levels just cuts out for no apparent reason,  this has been reported as a common bug on the game, and a simple reload will fix it, so just an annoyance really.  I did also encounter a couple of random crashes which resulted in me losing a bit of progress – again I expected these due to the age of the title but would be nice if a patch could be released to fix the problems.\n\nTo sum up, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a pretty good action game. The game play is really good, and the plot alone all deserves your time and attention. The only thing that really lets it down is the length of the game. I would only say it is worth half of the £14, 99 price tag for that reason alone.  Due to the premium name of the game though it won’t go on sale very often so keep your eyes peeled.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's undeniable proof of LucasArts's state of total disarray during the generation, and it's ridiculous this game was ever deemed release-worthy.\n\nHowever, I still recommend it....because I had fun with it and liked it.\n\nThe story is fantastic; containing awesome moments, excellent plot twists, great original characters and deepening existing Star Wars characters. It contains a brand new original score that is wonderful and is up to the quality of John Williams' own work, and the graphics and rendition of the Star Wars universe is breathtaking and exciting once you get past the poor coding and glitches. The DLC for the game (included here) includes an alternative version of the Star Wars trilogy that is also really well done and pure fan service for any Star Wars fan.\n\nAt the end of the game, I was left wanting for more....which is exactly what I want from any game. Go ahead and play it if you are a Star Wars fan, because you may have a blast.","October 25, 2014","true","20.6"," 200 of 235 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","200","235","11","0"

No, far from it. Is it the best Star Wars game out there? No, go play Knights of the Old Republic you fool.\n\nThe game is based between episodes 3 and 4 of the Star Wars movies. The story, if you pay attention actually is well-explained and well-placed in the 20-ish year gap between the two. It explains how the Rebel Alliance came to be and all that good stuff (if you pay close attention you'll even see where the symbol for the rebels came from), and wraps itself up in the end nicely as well, but this is just story-wise. Are there a few plot holes, probably, but the force is the ultimate way to explain them, right?\n\nAnyway the game isn't bad, it takes about 6-8 hours to beat and it is super fun to blast everything to death with Force Lightning.\n\nOutside of that, if you are a Star Wars fan, you'll probably like the game, if not, I'd try KotOR first then see how you feel. They aren't the same type of game but if you aren't a Star Wars fan and don't find yourself liking Knights of the Old Republic, then don't bother with this game.\n\nOne last thing, as a warning, and I will leave this with MINIMUM spoilers. Towards the latter part of the game you end up taking on a Star Destroyer with the force, it took me 3 sequences of manipulating it with the sticks. The third time, it tells you to bring the right stick down and stays red, it is supposed to turn yellowish/green when you are in the correct position (when you get there you'll see what I mean) just keep holding that stick up. It is a bug and I can't believe they didn't fix it, but you'll thank me later when you waste an hour going "WTF WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO"","December 9, 2013","true","10.3"," 119 of 135 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","119","135","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/32430/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","So, back in 1996, George Lucas, creator of Star Wars wanted to know whether the world was ready for more Star Wars. After all, it had been 13 years since the last film had been released. To gauge the public’s opinion, Lucas launched a massive multimedia project quite unlike anything seen before. The entire Lucasfilm marketing engine would produce and publish everything that would tie in with a feature film release, but without actually releasing a film. The result was the Shadows of the Empire chapter. Basically Star Wars 5,5; rich in plot, lore, characters and other elements you’d expect from a Star Wars feature. The project was such a success that it motivated the release of the Special Editions one year later, and finally the prequels.\n\nWhen you consider that project’s success, it isn’t hard to imagine why Lucas would revisit the concept to continue the Star Wars line, even after the release of Revenge of the Sith. Once again, the marketing machine was awoken and the fires of the multimedia forge flared to give shape to: The Force Unleashed\nThe Force Unleashed bridges the gap between episodes three and four. It tells the story of the founding of the Rebellion and the uneasy relationship between the Emperor and Darth Vader. The story is compelling enough to keep you playing. At the same time the game boasts an interesting three-way of physics engines that create a spectacular environment to test your mettle. The package is rounded out with great concepts and art direction, but it is stained with severe cosmetic glitches.\n\nThe game’s story, and the project’s main plotline follows the exploits of Galen “Starkiller” Marek, who is taken by Vader to be trained in the ways of the Sith after he killed Starkiller’s father himself. Darth Vader raises and trains the boy in secret until he is ready for trials. Vader then sends Starkiller out test his mettle against a number of Jedi who escaped the purge with the ultimate goal of preparing him for a showdown with the Emperor whom Darth Vader seeks to overthrow. The plot ultimately leads to betrayal, rebellion and finally a test of resolve that either leads the universe into the natural course of the larger Star Wars line, or you can derail the entire plot and force the premature end of the rebellion.\nWhile strictly linear and with hardly any exploring to do in both gameplay and lore, the game does offer an interesting bridge between the prequels and original trilogy. Both as an explanation for the founding of Rebellion, as well as Vader’s old personality still seeking revenge against the man who turned him a mechanical monster. The newcomer Galen is a rather disappointing affair. He is your typical bald space marine and communicates through whispers and shouting, but no measure in between. He merits more exploration, because the game makes him out to be stronger in the force than any Jedi seen before. The game makes a set piece out of this by having you drag a mile-long, gargantuan, Imperial Star Destroyer out of orbit with the Force just to draw the Emperor’s attention.\nThe story is compelling, and certainly interesting for Star Wars fans, but it also introduces some awkward subjects. Like the robot Proxy, who is programmed to both train and kill Galen, while also appearing at the most impossible locations to provide some gratuitous fan service. Or the character of Juno Eclipse, Galen’s love interest, who seems to be just an accessory. All in all though, the story is interesting and enthralling enough to warrant a good romp. The included DLC chapters play a fun “what-if?” game with the original trilogy events, but they’re short, and unsurprisingly, non-canon*.\n\nThe Force Unleashed is a technological show stopper with some very clever design, but also riddled with clichéd traits and other gameplay substitutes. It runs a total of three physics engines at the same to time govern a set of parameters. The first engine, Havoc, controls ragdolls and other jiggle bones to give the game its organic aesthetic. Alongside runs Euphoria, the engine that controls the enemy AI to interact with the environment. That way, enemies with grab on to objects to prevent being thrown away with the force. Lastly, the DMM engine governs the world’s materials and their reaction to collision and impacts. Glass shatters realistically when you send a poor sod hurtling through it into deep space. Everything comes together in LucasArts’ own Ronin engine where you basically play like Kratos from God of War, but with significantly more lightning.\nAs Force prodigy, your abilities stretch far beyond your regular Jedi. Force push isn’t just a shove; it’s more like a hadouken. Force lightning now lights up the night sky. You can weaponise the environment by throwing everything and the kitchen sink at you enemies. It is inviting and fun to rip off the walls to toss at your enemies in every new room. However, the multitude options has its limits. A lot of enemies are still dealt with through boring and poorly executed quick-time events. While the physics generally hold up well, they can get buggy at times. It wouldn’t be the first time a boss would sink through the floor after zapping him. Or that the ground suddenly stretches to insane lengths. If you’re entirely unlucky, the game can even give up on you and crash. However, as a PC port, it holds up reasonably well. Don’t expect the illustrious 60fps or 4K resolution. It’s a 2009 game.\n\nWhile its age does show, the art makes up for it. Although not as stylised as Republic Commando or the Clone Wars cartoons, the game does a good job looking like a technically advanced version of the original trilogy. The bedlam around you is well married to the fine-tuned art of the levels and characters. Electricity arcs convincingly, characters recoil and writhe in accordance. Air rushes out of rooms as you break the windows; explosions blow enemies away. Trees move and sway in the wind and shockwaves. Some bosses have seen a very stylish makeover from their film versions. Everything is accentuated with John Williams’ impeccable score to heighten the mood.\nHowever, that is where the problems arise. The game shows cracks in the veneer. The music suddenly stops and doesn’t come back on until after a reboot. Or that the sound effects are horribly out of synch with the cut-scenes. Last time, my lightsabre didn’t deactivate during a cut-scene; resulting in a hilarious display of senseless eye-poking. However, it’s such a mess at times you just want to stop playing.\n\nIn the end though, the game is enjoyable to Star Wars fans. Especially people who got involved during the original era will get a kick out of the focus on the empire over the clones. Interesting characters and satisfying storyline make it worth at least one romp at a good discount. The tech is a thing behold when it doesn’t bug itself out too much. The same goes for the visuals; while a little dated, they use the source material in a dignified and well adapted manner for a more brutal game. This media project paid off my opinion. Give it a go if you like Star Wars.","October 11, 2015","true","9.9"," 170 of 208 people (82%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","82","170","208","19","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/32430/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Forced Unleashed skip to Results and read from there.\n\nLucasArts offers a game that brings the force to modern-day systems; although, riddles with pitfalls in the design the Force Unleashed is still a fun and dynamic play-through.\n\nStory:\nYou play a young Sith warrior who was taken under Darth Vaders’ wing to become his apprentice. You sole purpose in life is to become a powerful Sith warrior and join Vader to take down the Emperor and control the galaxy. Yet, not everything is how it seems and as you are sent from planet to planet to slay the remaining Jedi a whole new tale unfolds.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign offers a decent length - depending on how you play it can take anywhere from five (5) to eight (8) hours. The story is divided up into approximately nine missions, which take you through a large variety of different environments. As you progress through the campaign you unlock new force powers, which change how you defeat your enemies. Each level has hidden Holocrons spread throughout it which offer you more experience, skill points, or customizable features. The enemies tend to repeat themselves fairly quickly and the combat dynamics become repetitive, but the bosses offer a nice twist which keeps you wanting more. Each boss fights differently, which causes you to constantly change up your strategy.\n\nGameplay:\nThe main issue with this game is the poor design. Firstly the camera controls are awful, there are more times where you are fighting the camera than fighting enemies. Trying to grab objects with the force can be rather cumbersome and I noticed that I never really grabbed anything because the time it took to get the object to move in the correct direction would cause me to take tremendous damage from surrounding enemies. Another major issue was being pinned by enemies, who would knock you over suddenly turning you into an elderly person who required a warm up before being able to stand up.\n\nHints:\n>Don’t play on the hardest difficulty (Sith Master) as the bosses scale poorly - the particularly Kazdan Paratus who was damn near impossible to defeat especially when fighting against the poor game mechanics.\n>Make sure to search the maps for the Holocrons they help you level up much quicker and afford you with more force powers.\n>Remember to go in and look at your lightsaber, as you play through the campaign you unlock lightsaver powers which help boost your lightsaber. This can be really useful to change based on the mission you are playing.\n\nResults:\nAll and all if you’re a Star Wars fan this is a game for you - if not them you probably find the listed cons to ruin the game. I personally like the Star Wars series and found this to be a good addition to the story even though some parts were cheesy. The game offers a decent sized campaign and a relatively fun experience.\n\nPros:\n+Customized level structure which allows you to choose how you want your character to grow.\n+Lots of combos, which can make fighting incredibly dynamic.\n+Control over many aspects of the environment, which you can wield in battle to your advantage.\n+Awesome boss fights, which force you to change your play style.\n+Beautiful level design with many different environments.\n+Nice addition to the Star Wars saga, and great new story elements.\n+Prologue was just awesome, walking around as Vader and destroying everything.\n\nCons:\n-Not readily made for Keyboard and Mouse gameplay.\n-Poor game design – difficult camera control, poor force power control, off targeting system.\n-Limited to no description of objectives, can leave you standing around wondering what you’re supposed to do. I found myself shocking things with lighting, before realizing I had to grab them or slash it with a lightsaber.\n-Repetitive enemies, typically finding myself fighting the same thing over and over. This wouldn’t be bad, but some of them were more annoying than difficult to kill.\n-Limited game customization, there was no ability to control graphics levels. Resolution was controlled before starting the game.","March 8, 2015","true","9.2"," 89 of 103 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","89","103","6","1"

As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I enjoy most good SW story lines and this game has a very nice (cinematic) story line.\n\nThe graphics are excellent, however the controls, combat and general game play are nothing amazing. Same with the customizations that you can apply to your character, I personally found that they make very little to no difference (except one or two).\n\nDifficulty wise its fairly easy and my feeling is that it was intentionally made to not be too challenging so that the story arc flows without long gaps.\n\nWould I recommend it ? If you are a fan of Star Wars = absolutely... but view it as an interactive movie/story that you will go through once and never play again. Still, its an enjoyable experience, just keep in mind what it is, so you don't get disappointed after a full playthrough.\n\nIf nothing else it is quite fun to play such an overwhelmingly powerful character, that can mow down entire armies singlehandedly.\n\nOn the other hand if you are not a fan of SW... I would probably tell you to stay away, though it will appeal to casual gamers and young children (who are at least mildly familiar with SW).","August 28, 2015","true","28.1"," 74 of 92 people (80%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","80","74","92","11","0"

I've enjoyed them because of the unique features that they made for each platform, and I thought they would offer the best experience when they ported it to the PC if you have a good gaming setup. Well, they weren't wrong about that.\nAfter playing it at my friend's house, I never expected it to have a lot of bugs, glitches, and crash issues.\n\nI gave the game another shot when I saw it on sale, knowing I might experience the same thing. Thankfully, it's more playable than the last time I remembered it...of course with the help of a few tweaks.\n\nSo far, here are my impressions after fiddling with the it:\n- Xbox 360 controller option works like a charm.\n- Keyboard and Mouse controls are a bit clunky, but not that bad at all if bound properly.\n- You can only adjust the video resolution. Textures and other details of the game are still fixed.\n- Visuals are good despite of its aging engine (played this on my HDTV).\n- Loading screens on the options..everywhere.\n- Camera controls are bad, but bearable.\n- Force gripping/throwing enemies can be very entertaining.\n- Boba Fett has a certain bug that makes him invulnerable unless you send him flying with force lightning.\n- Seeing Ben Kenobi soaring and sliding across the screen after doing force combos is hilarious.\n- Wampas are fragile creatures.\n- Still full of bugs and glitches. Sometimes cool, most of the time funny.\n- Applying the 60fps fix gave me a better experience while learning the lulz of the Force.\n- I was able to fix my in-game crash issues by turning the cloth physics on and disabling the high details. Additional shadow and texture details were sacrificed in exchange of stability.\n\nStar Wars: The Force Unleashed is an old game, and had quite a number of issues on the PC version. But as for me, it's not that bad if you apply the fixes and needed adjustments. It's still a great game and I've personally enjoyed every moment I had with it.\n\n\nVerdict (tl;dr)\nIf you already have Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (including the DLC's) on your PS3 or Xbox 360, feel free to skip this one. As for the fans who bought this game just like me, or who wish to get it while it's on sale, be sure to check the steam community forums. There you will find some guides and links for the fixes you'll need, including the missing sounds and the 60fps unlock.\n\nAnd if you're playing The Force Unleashed for the first time, you won't be disappointed. It has a well-polished storyline that any Star Wars fan would appreciate. Character customization is also a huge addition in this game. And last but not the least, the mix of lightsaber hack n' slash with the Force is fun as hell.","May 4, 2015","true","3.7"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","0"

Most of them are good. Some are legendary. This one is a gem for a Star Wars game  and a fun time for every other kind of gamer. It's one of the best SW games and makes it stand is the fact that it runs even on the newest system. Have you ever wanted to be someone who unleashes his power, being devasting from the start, and being unstoppable in the end? If you like the ideea, then you should buy this game, because this ideea is executed well.\nIn the SW universe, you get to play as Darth Vader(only in the prologue) and Starkiller(one of the most powerful Force-users ever). The latter seeks to find his place in the galaxy hoping to find himself. It's a quest that involves a best friend droid, a gorgeous pilot, a mysterious past and a double betrayal. In the end, you get to shape your destiny, being able to chose between a light side and dark side ending. The former option will end up in the birth of the Rebellion.\nGameplay wise, you'll have fun using your power, such as pushing enemies in oblivion, getting lightning bolts everywhere, repulsing everything that's nearby, throwing your lightsaber, gripping all kinds of thins to turn them into all kinds of projectiles and covering yourself in lightinining for your own good. The thing that may ruin the fun is the targetting system which sometimes can make you consume force energy for nothing.\nGraphics have aged pretty well, since the art style is strong. The numerous skins can make things look a lot more interestings.\nAll in all, it's a great game, it's only drawback is being short, but it's worth your money. Cleaning the floor with Sith Lords never gets old. [8.5/10]","May 8, 2014","true","16.9"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","39","47","0","3"

You are a sith that helps jedis, which is cool.  It's a hack n slash in the star wars universe, which is cool.  Some of the action sequences and cut scenes are pretty cool.  But there are A LOT of problems, and quite frankly, they put minimal QA into this game.\n\nFirst I want to start with environment.  It's wonky, to best describe it.  He can't run up some hills, you have to double jump it.  Some ledges you just run over, and it isn't realistic, while other ledges is just the right height so you have to jump.  It's quite frustrating.  Sometimes you just slide off, which is very frustrating.  Some times, like in one of the last boss fights, I've gotten stuck somewhere and I have to wait to get hit to get unstuck.  It is just stuff like that that they needed to polish out with QA, but they probably had a limited budget.\n\nThere is skilled jumping in this game.  What I mean by that is there is very seldom platforms set up for you to just jump, or just double jump.  You have to gauge it.  I don't mind it, but it did make me frustrated.\n\nThe combo system.  It had such good potential to have a great hack n slash, the problem is, you don't really need it.  Not only that, you can never pull off the advanced combos.  Either they die too quickly, or they just absorb damage and knock you out of the way or something.  It's like the enemy doesn't respond to your damage, and sometimes they do, and when they do, they die with the basic combo.  There are a few combos that you have to have, and I think that's why they brough this system in.  But the rest of the combos that you unlock, are only there to consume a combo point when you lvl up.  That's my theory.  They were never really designed to be used in the game.\n\nWhen Starkiller get knocked back, or receives damage, it's like it takes him 2 years to get up.  And then damage is pounded onto you, and I think that is the intention of it, because they couldn't come up with a game where Starkiller gets damage.  It is quite frustrating.\n\nOne last thing then I am done.  You can't dash or block in mid combo.  WTF!  I don't think you realize how maddening that is if I could of disrupted my lightsaber attack with a block, or a dash.\n\nIn the end, the only real reason why I would play the second one is the story, that's it.  Which I probably will beat.  I've beaten these games before, but I remembered them to be much better.  In the end, more problems than benefits.  Thumb down.","April 19","false","36.4"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","49","68","0","0"

So far, so unexciting. The real kicker is the realization of the Force Powers - true, other games (especially the Jedi Knight-titles) featured Force Powers but the way Force Unleashed does them is actually unique. For example you can grab, lift and hurl enemies around - with a lot more control than earlier titles allowed for. There is also A LOT of punch to certain powers like Force Push (which can even be charged for maximum effect) and it is quite convincing as well as enjoyable to send rows of troopers flying or blast massive doors open. Bring enormous Rancors to their knees using amped up Force Lightning is also highly entertaining and you can even combo Force Powers into your lightsaber attacks. If you want to feel badass, Force Unleashed got you covered.\n\nThe main reason to recommend this game (for me, anyways) would be the story, writing and the characters. Eventhough the main twist of the story is darn stupid, it is highly entertaining thanks to good dialogue and some cool characters (like your android sidekick Proxy who tries killing you at every given opportunity) - it feels very much like a legit piece of Star Wars, NOT easy - in my opinion. And even if you are not into the whole Star Wars thing, this could work out for you because it's simply well done and some of that classic Lucas Arts magic shines through. It also looks the part and has amazing art direction - some places are REALLY impressive, even by todays standard.\n\nNow, you might say: "dude, all of this sounds pretty good - why the tumbs down?" - because this game is one of the worst PC ports I own on Steam. Locked frame rate, rather unstable and with completely broken sound in the final levels - some of that stuff can be fixed, but the game is broken out of the box and nobody ever cared about fixing the actual Steam files - as mentioned before, the game has a few issues as well - mainly some difficulty spikes and (more annoying) half of the game is spend revisiting locations you have already been to - which, considering it is rather short, feels like lazyness on the developers part.\n\nGrab it at your own risk, some good stuff to be found here - but broken software sucks.","November 26, 2015","false","5.2"," 130 of 218 people (60%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","60","130","218","10","2"

You play as Starkiller, the 'secret apprentice' of Darth Vader. Though you are initially tasked with hunting down Jedi Survivors, your quest quickly changes after you make some friends, enemies, and are put through extreme measures. It is honestly one of the best stories featured in a Star Wars game, and the story accounts for so much of the momentum while playing (I should note that as with all other star wars games, the story is considered non-canon in the universe, which I personally don't mind).\n\nThe gameplay is a bit cumbersome at first, but once you've gotten used to it, the lightsaber and force combat is extremely addicting and fun. After sometime, you'll start making heavy use of combos, combining force lightning with lightsaber attacks, or force push with force dash, etc. There's tons of combos to be pulled off, all visually satisfying and very useful when taking down enemies. The AI is overall intelligent, apart from some enemy types with very basic reactions to the player, but that's easily excused by the wide variety of enemy types.\n\nThe game spans 10 levels, taking about 45 Minutes (give or take) for each, so the game ends up being really short. Each level is filled with hidden Holocrons, giving timed buffs or unlockables, such as lightsaber crystals or upgrade points. A boss battle usually concludes each level, mostly being unique and very challenging. You'll face down Rancors, Sith Assassins, Imperial Walkers, the list goes on. It always gives you something to look forward to at the end.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this is definitely a console port, as the framerate is locked and there's little to no optimization settings or menus. The game overall looks and runs decent, apart from sound issues on very rare occassion. If you play on a potato, I'm sure you'll be fine.\n\nOverall, The Force Unleashed is a worthy game for any Star Wars fan, and double for a fan of Sith characters. The Ultimate Sith Edition just adds 3 bonus levels as an epilogue to the game's alternate ending, but they're nice additions. Despite being incredibly short, the game offers a lot of replay value with the combat system, collectibles, and harder difficulties.\n\n7/10 - Great Deal if discounted (which happens very rarely for this title apparently, so your money, your problem. gg no refunds)","December 29, 2014","true","26.2"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","2"

This means you can blow through a battle only to fall off a cliff because of a bad jump and have to do it all over again. I was not expecting the bend physics, but they impressed me and the only criticism i have is that they are a bit weak when interacting with stuff.\n\nOtherwise i almost hope that a movie be considered for this game because it has a legitimate story that shines light in an area that we dont see in the star wars movies. also the new movies havent nessesarily disproven or denied the lore elements.","April 30","true","11.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

Picking up objects with the Force is a guessing game that feels like you're blindly stirring spaghetti with a shovel.  Sometimes I kill enemies by accident and sometimes I'm tearing my hair out.\n\nThe developers put a lot of time into giving you different combat options, but I can't justify using the full breadth of the library.  90% of them are too conditional or too difficult to remember.  The remaining are cheap tricks that have a high success rate and easy on the mana pool.  If you run too low, there are plenty of areas to hide and recharge.  Not that you can play this as a stealth game (which might have been cooler), but the baddies are pretty dumb and can't be bothered to seek you out.\n\nThe whole concept of The Force Unleashed is that this is the Star Wars you already knew, but all the stops have been pulled out.  This works in the art direction because the world feels threatening and extravagant, but the music is the same old fasioned Williams-esque riffs that we have shoehorned into virtually every Star Wars product.  And the story is pretty basic.  I don't really care about the protagonist that much, but to be fair, I don't know of too many games where I ever actually do.\n\nMost importantly, the actual gaminess of the game isn't very well realized.  I don't think the Force ever *was* unleashed.  Combat feels half-baked and sloppy.  The levels aren't designed to have players moving around in them and doing awesome Jedi things.  This is what games are built out of.  You do things in places.  And though the places have neat things in them, the way you interact with them is clunky and unrefined.\n\nI'm surprised I went in as far as I did, and I think I liked the world of TFU more than I did slogging through it.  There's a real inspiration to its art direction that, had it carried across to the other departments, might have provided for a really interesting game.","December 21, 2013","false","20.0"," 49 of 81 people (60%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","60","49","81","11","4"

While it's on sale? Sure. Right now? Please don't.\n\n\nAt it's core, The Force Unleashed is just another linear hack-n-slash with little to no story depth and an unusually short campaign, however, that doesn't keep the game from being entertaining in it's own right. The story is full of clichés, and it's difficult to relate to the main character. The soundtrack is an amalgamation of musical scores from the original Star Wars saga and original compositions from Mark Griskey and Jesse Harlin. My main gripe with the soundtrack is that although it's great, there's little to no variation in it. There are only 4-5 songs that'll play during combat throughout the entire campaign, and it's easily noticeable.\n\n\nThe gameplay isn't varied either; different Force powers become available to you as you progress through the storyline, and you'll find yourself spamming the same combos on the same enemies time and time again. Boss fights are deceivingly simple, with no more than three progressions in strategy throughout each bout. It might be fun as hell, but it gets stale after some time.\n\n\nOnto the most pressing issue: the port from consoles to PC. This is a mediocre port at best. There are performance inconsistencies across Windows versions. The SFX (such as foley) and music cuts out completely in some levels, and the game requires a reset for it to cut back on. The game crashes at random with a surprising frequency. There are graphical errors. The list goes on.\n\n\nThe replay value is nil; the game does in fact have two different endings, but both of them are equally dissatisfying.

The levels are lengthy and well designed with unique atmospheres and terrains that guarantee exciting game-play. No matter what challenge you face you are almost always able to get take care of the depending on how you level up your powers, combos, and talents. While not a perfect game (levels can sometimes get stale and repetitious, enemies can be rather uninspired), Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a fun pick-up-and-play type of game.","December 28, 2015","true","192.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wasnotwhynot/recommended/32430/","wasnotwhynot","wasnotwhynot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wasnotwhynot/","1054 products in account","the most important part to enjoying this game is the spectacle. there are scores of games that do this better. don’t expect dynasty warriors or even the god of war it rips off. it’s painfully paint-by-numbers with an ignorant combat system that discourages melee and has no difference in combo versatility other than length. what creates the spectacle is, after all, the ranged combat. starkiller dumps lightning from his fingers and has better hadokens than any street fighter. all you gotta do is blast the rag dolls away with your midichlorian powers. if being a magical laser deathmachine isn’t on your list of ‘entertaining spectacles’ then you’re going to take issue with this game. that’s not to say there are no redeeming qualities - there absolutely are - but its success hinges so much on enjoying being a destructive brutish jedi.\n\nyou have a four string combo and that’s pretty much it. it can be delayed to get more hits in but since enemies have armor values it ends up doing less damage, which is a pretty amazing oversight. at any point of your combo you can opt for a finisher, either lightning style or spirit gun. lightning knocks bads down and blasts knock them away. finishing the tail end of your combo with force will instead knock an enemy up, symmetry be damned, leading into a second air combo. if you were to play to efficiently, you'd do this to every enemy, and end with a throw. it does overwhelmly more damage than any other string, though playing like that would become mind-numbing. I ended up using different finishers arbitrarily, pretending like the invincibility frames from grabbing were needed, the aoe of the lightning swipe was tactical, and that blasting the enemies away secured my safety. the depth could be there, but it’s rendered brainless by design flaws.\n\nI’m torn over which is the worst offender, so I’ll relate linearly. force unleashed’s cardinal sin is having a level up system. whatever depth we can allow the game doesn’t matter; it’s locked out to you. it’s not even as if there’s a gradual curve compensating for your progression like a rpg, enemies from the second mission forward get no bulkier, which isn’t something I wanted mind you. it does take considerably less points to acquire every combo, though maybe it was simple luck that allowed me to have them all before the end, because of another beautiful offender: level ups are also tied to hidden collectibles. if you’re a sleuth hound (or play with a guide) you’ll have a nonsensical advantage over the player whose focus is on combating the level. I’m not against progression in a beat ‘em up, but if the progression overrides basic skill and locks out mechanics that should be in the game to begin with then it’s served no purpose.\n\nits next big ticket in wasted design is very poor enemy philosophy. arrangement of enemies is not all important in a beat ‘em up. some games do this very well, others do not realize there is a purpose to it. both approaches honestly serve just as well and the force unleashed is not without finesse. sometimes it crafts thoughtful encounters. now I’m not so concerned about its technical design, because its ruined from the gate. difficulty is supplanted by giving enemies specific immunities to your jedi magic. the force powers are the most fun part of the game, so this is lamentable, but respectable considering their overpowered nature. however, they couple such immunities with enemies that are immune to knockdowns and hitstun. it’s absolutely stupid for a beat ‘em up to have enemies with constant super armor, because it downplays what should be the focus of the game, its close combat action. on top of diluting its focus, it shuts down a half of your ranged attacked, hampered further by the fact that you might have spent all of your levels on your favorite force powers. you have to grind out high hp enemies using attacks that you don’t favor. there are all kinds of solutions, like putting a window of vulnerability after the enemies attack string, or a successful finisher staggering the enemy. on that note, mechanical enemies weak to electric always stagger to sith attacks and are immune to force. which means the best way to dispatch is repeating the same three hit electric combo. absolutely monotonous.\n\nnote that despite these flaws, unleashed is still satisfying to play visually, and is not broken, just a far cry of being sophisticated. starkiller moves quick and is carefully animated. hit detection feels great, favoring you instead of enemies, though sometimes the priority seems wrong. the ragdoll physics are absurd but I wouldn’t want it any other way. my spirit palm should send every idiot flying. rooms are continually different, I was more than surprised, and enjoyed the level design more than anything else in the game. if two missions (that’s like a fourth of the game) didn’t take place on the exact same planets as the first two missions, and if the final level didn’t feel so rushed, I would be singing fat praises. as it stands, though, two levels are remixed environments. they’re still a lot different from the source they reuse, but without the different enemy models and textures the game had been throwing at you up to this point it loses a ton of its momentum. at least starkiller’s fashion always changes between levels, something I still can’t get over.\n\ngraphically the game is great, high-budget values everywhere. I’m probably ignorant of games from 2008 but damn it looks good. nice and shiny with an art direction that’s definitely star wars. I don’t remember if it’s the first or second time you go to raxus prime, that’s the stupid game’s fault, but there’s a part where you’re in a huge mushroom-thing with interconnected bridges sprawling upward. it’s like something pulled out of nintendo’s playbook. there’s a lot of detail on the planets and in the space ships. this stems from a desire of having all kinds of things to throw at badguys, even when it stops being useful, the clutter is less than clutter and is real organic. this degree of detail that will probably go unnoticed, simply because the gameplay is no where near as detailed. even better than the graphics is the game’s music. it’s probably star wars standard to have rearranged star wars tunes for their games, but holy crap is this some top shelf classical. makes all kinds of modern games sound like a joke.\n\nnow the story is nothing more than a saturday morning cartoon. it doesn’t feel stupid or contrived, but it seems more motivated to get starkiller to fight certain things than to orchestrate his apprenticeship. I found the voice acting awesome and able to carry the whole game and darth vader to be absolutely convincing, sealing the simplistic premise to something I could wholly enjoy. the only thing that would make darth vader cooler is if he was an exiled prince of zeon. it’s not incredibly in-depth, but you know, neither is the phantom menace. it has some hard hitting moments and the writing is pretty serviceable. frankly it’s not the best or the worst, so take it as is and have a ball. the dlc levels are slipshod compared to the main game, I’m not going to grace them with my words, but I’d like to shout out the hoth campaign where starkiller gets luke to turn to the dark side and make luke his apprentice. that’s freakin cool.\n\nso yeah, this is just a spectacle brawler. it has great levels and great theming, but doesn’t quite sink in the gameplay. it isn’t mangacore either, so its missing its targert market, heh. if you’re down to shoot thunder and lighting, to bend spines with your fingers, to cut puppety flesh like cheese with a glowstick, and fly around inside a neutered space opera, then the force unleashed is a successful game. those are all things I wanted to do, I just didn’t know I wanted to do them","April 3, 2014","true","12.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Decent story. But were it really shines is combat and movement. It has revolutionary combat which utilizes corners and walls like never before. Let me elaborate. so say you're fighting a boss and he has his "special ragdolling super-move." the dude gets close to you and you're now trapped between ragdoll god and a wall. he's ragdolling you constantly, you can't get up. What do you do? hope to god you can un-ragdolls for the 0.03 seconds it takes to jump out of there. This only happens about 20% of the time If you have good reflexes (or mash spacebar uncontrollably). Never before have I seen the environment integrated into immersive combat so effectively. The second great aspect is the movement, or more specifically the fact it doubles as a surfing simulator. Sometimes you might get in a battle that killed you 6 times and took an hour and a half to complete. You've finally done it and you walk a meter away from the intended path and BOOM. you've found a sufable corner. The surfing animation is without a doubt one of the best I have seen in a game to date. the only downside is that usually after about 10 seconds, the physics engine decides you've been surfing on the spot for so long you're probably at like 200 kph by now so it rockets you outward into the firey abyss of doom (or some other abyss of doom.) Fortunatly because of the amazing checkpoint system, you now get to fight ragdoll-god once again and continue trying hopelessly to escape that corner while getting ragdolled for another good portion of your life.\n\nSo, is the game good you ask?\nYES! You should certainly get this game.\n11/10 would ragdoll for 17 minutes straight again.","May 11","true","12.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Picking up a stormtrooper with the force and flinging him off a balcony is pretty satisfying.  Every boss fight and mini-boss fight have cinematic "finishing sequences" with Quick Time Events, and that's kind of annoiying if cool looking.  The boss fights also have a fixed camera angle which make for a more cinematic fight sequence, but a harder to control one.\n\nThe story was ok, and this game is overall ok.

The main premise of the game is to go from point A and reach point B, whilst unleashing your force powers on hapless and not so hapless victims. You might think that being a force user equipped with a trusty light saber would make you most powerful against the toughest of foes, but ultimately as you play through the game, you’ll find that being an all powerful force user isn’t necessarily all that easy.\n\nThe game takes you on a journey across multiple environments from inside spacecraft to swampy organic environments. There’s enough variety here to keep you interested, and although there’s a fair amount of corridor running around, you’ll also be faced with some impressive outdoor or more open expanses. I actually thought the graphics where pretty good for the most part and provide a slick looking game world to mess around in.\nThe soundtrack is typical Star Wars fare, and you’ll instantly recognize the music and sound effects lifted from the movies. This creates an authentic Star Wars experience and will please the fans no end. Even the voice acting is of a high standard.\n\nIf you’re going to run around the game world hunting for all the easter eggs and secrets, then of course the game is going to last quite some time. However, if you’re the type of gamer who’ll select the default difficulty and merely run from point A to B without really taking it all in properly, then your experience is going to be rather a short lived one, depending on your skill.

Everything the game does should make we not recommend the game. But I still do. Here is why... Right out the gate you’re going to see simple textures, bad pop in and a 30fps frame rate. Yet I always had fun. The game is an excellent “simulator” of being a sith lord. Maybe this is the star wars nostalgic but this game even though is broken I really liked it.\n\nIn depth:\n\nPerformance - a 30fps frame rate. Funny thing is the game still felt and looked smooth. Not to mention the semi-destructible environments are a huge pro.\n\nGraphics - Below average in places. Right out the gate you’re going to see simple textures, bad pop in. Locations are beautiful from far and very different.\n\nGameplay - Solid. II love throwing people into statues and watching them break apart or forcing pushing them up in the air, throwing my sabre into his chest and throwing him into a tree. Feels great. The camera is a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥ and controls are a tad clunky but it did not annoy me too much. Bosses are challenging, Sometimes cheap won’t name any names but you will know don’t worry, and to beat a boss results in a QTE that if you fail punishes you hard. I hate QTE as it’s lazy but in this case it still was great as it felt like you kicked the living ♥♥♥♥ out of a boss and that was your reward to see your character look like a badass. It’s also very repetive but it did not feel that way due to the range of powers, abilities, locations plus the sandbox destructible environments.\n\nThe story is actually quite interesting and decent. Fits in right between episode 3 and 4 and to be honest should be made into a movie. I love proxy and his relationship with the protagonist was unique. All the powers and combos vary up combat making you into a badass. The costume selection is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I count like 40+ unique outfits being different variations of the protagonist or different characters in the star wars lore. The three missions outside of the main story are nice what if spin off missions and are quite good but familiar to main story. Some glitches only one was game stopping and one crash.\n\nReplayability - As you can unlock everything in one playthrough, if you’re good enough, it does lack here.\n\nConclusion - Overall a game that’s weird but I really enjoyed despite bad cons which would break other games.

Great game if you are a Star Wars fan where you can wield the powers of the Sith and unleash awesome lightsaber combos. Battles and locations are awesome, however at times you will struggle with the PC controls and it becomes very frustrating during a certain section of the game. Overall it is a good game with some minor flaws in controls.","August 8, 2014","true","13.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The PC version is based on the PS3/X360 version.  Of course, the Wii version had lesser graphics, but there were also quite a few difference in the levels, due to being a less powerful console and using the Wiimote.  So, I always wanted to to play it on PC, and I finally got around to it.  The Sith Edition adds three new levels to play outside of the main story.\n\nOverall, I like this game and had a lot of fun playing it. Graphics are good, although not the best I've ever seen last gen.  There aren't a lot of settings in the game, but you can turn on anti-aliasing and other features in your video card settings to improve the looks.\n\nThe game is not without its faults. I had a lot of trouble with the targeting system.  There is a targeting button that helps in some cases, but it doesn't solve the problem completely.  Many times I died were due to targeting.  That's not to say the controls are bad. The controls are pretty good for the most part.  YMMV.  I also found that some sounds were missing in the last two levels. If you run into this problem, search the Steam forums for a fix.\n\nThe real highlights are the story, characters, voice acting, and production values.  This could easily fit as the true "canon" between Episodes III and IV.  It gets thumbs up from me.","May 15","true","22.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

When the game works, you feel like a true Sith. Throwing things at enemies, firing Force Lightning at them or just flat out throwing them off ledges/into walls is immensely satisfying. You feel like a god among men. The problem, though is that the times the game works are few and far between.\n\nOverall, the game just feels wrong on PC. The combat controls are loose and the camera is painful, even with an Xbox 360 controller. Several enemies have way more melee range than you do and are guaranteed a knock down. Their animations are also hard to interrupt, meaning the fastest way to defeat them is actually to use Force Grab and throw them off the nearest cliff/down the closest pit. Using Force Grab to throw things at enemies just does not work most of the time. It sort of works with a controller and about 30% of the time, you'll throw it at an enemy. The other 70% of the time, you'll either throw it off a cliff or into a wall about 30 feet to the side of the enemy. Trying to do it with keyboard/mouse is even more impossible.\n\nForce Lightning is satisfying, but only with the second upgrade where you can actually hold the button and fire lightning for as long as you have Force energy. The first level is useless for the most part as it only affects one or two enemies, though it's nice for stunning them.\n\nI won't comment on the combos because I'm terrible at combos in any game I play and thus consider them stupid in all games.\n\nThe quick-time events (and there are a lot of them) are far too quick. You will have to repeat them at least once unless you have above average reaction time. This would be alright except that failing a quick-time often will heal the boss/miniboss, which is a terrible but effective way to pad out a fight's length.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have, though, is that the game is riddled with bugs. The game crashed for me three times in the same boss fight. The only time it didn't crash, the boss' attack knocked me out of the world, trapping me outside the boss arena and making the fight impossible to complete. There are numerous other bugs I could add to this list, but those are the worst offenders. Having to restart a boss fight four times because of bugs/crashing is unacceptable and frustrating.","June 27, 2015","false","4.8"," 59 of 110 people (54%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","54","59","110","11","2"

After witnessing your father killed by Darth Vader at a young age you are taken by him to be his secret apprentice and tasked to kill the remaining jedi in the galaxy. Over the course of the story you experience betrayal and side with an early Rebel Alliance. The game tells a pretty solid story, but the gameplay gets repetitive overtime. The game makes you feel like a badass as you kill multiple enemy types and are given multiple force powers like force lightening and repulse.\n\nPros:\n- wide variety of force powers and upgrades\n- skins and lightsaber crystals\n- excellent story\n- range of planets you visit that are each distinct and feel star wars\n- great voice acting\n\nCons\n- sometimes repetitive combat\n- mixed quality in level design\n\nverdict:\nOverall this game has stuck with me for a long time and the characters like starkiller have been very memorable.

Worthy of the Star Wars saga. So go away and read the book. This game lacks a lot where it needs to be at least accepteble. Its a bad port. Menus are for a game-pad, the texture in the game is for big screen tv, making the game take enormus amount of your harddrive without looking good. You need to be lucky if you want the game to run good on your computer, a expensive video-card or processor dont ensures you anything.\n\nGameplay looks great, but it really lacks the nice flow in battle that you can find even in the worst of the Assassins Creed or Batman Arkham-games. Its... stiff. And even if many attacks are fun at the start, you get tired of them. And its a hack and slash game thats very repetitive. New bosses or enemys dont change the formula that much at all. And all too soon the game ends. Its a real short game.\nIt would have been great if they extended the first part of the games story with some more dlc. Intead we got non-canon endings and the dlc is very bad integrated in the game. Probobly the worst Iv seen.\nThis game got potential, but dident live up to it at all. Its not a very bad game, some people do find it fun, even great, but all I see and feel is what it should have been. Look for Kotor-games if you want the great story, and Jedi Knights-game if you want great gameplay and force powers.","November 26, 2013","false","36.9"," 26 of 47 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","26","47","2","10"

Have dominion over the force and use it to crush your enemies or unite your allies? Then this might be the game for you\n\nThis game was tremendous amounts of fun. I am biased because I like Star Wars but still, with a ton of force powers and duel lightsabers, this game was just fantastic. Even from the beginning you feel like a one man army, ripping ships from the sky and hurling them at anyone who stands in your way. The power trip you get from literally cutting your way through a horde of bad guys is something to behold.\n\nThe setting is wonderful, obviously, as its Star Wars. The levels take place on many different planets and starships leading to a reasonable verity of settings and environmental challenges. The enemy design is fantastic and varied; from Wookies to Tie Fighters you battle them all. The game is not the best looking but it still holds up to this day as rather pretty.\n\nThe characters and story were both very engrossing and I was compelled to see what happened to everyone and how it would play out in the end. It even adds some depth to the original movies, showing what goes on behind the scenes and adds to the feel of a living universe.\n\nThere were a few issues however that hampered my enjoyment. This is not a good port at all. The controls can feel clunky and the menu operation is a pain. There were a few glitches, not so many that they spoil anything but enough to notice. There was one section that was almost impossible with the mouse and I had to look it up, it was really obvious once I found the answer but the game doesn’t do a very good job of explaining.\n\nI would recommend this game to Star wars fans and haters alike. Its super fun and a great time.

I therefor was pretty disappointed by it in the beginning. The things that annoyed me:\nAbysmal PC-port. Capped at 30 FPS with physic screw ups when unlocked, no mouse control in the menus. Keyboard and mouse control is flawed, I managed to bear with it since i don't have a controller, but you may not want to bother with it.\nThere are levels missing sound files! There is a fix available on PC Gaming Wiki, but it still is incredibly annoying.\nExcessive amount of QTEs. This one probably bothers me the most, especially when you are forced to go through the same one over and over again. Having to look at the button prompts while there is a nice scene playing out is infuriating.\nPretty bad tie in of game mechanics and story. Instead of having a cutscene where the apprentice gets taught force lighting by Vader (which would be interesting since Vader can't summon it) or discovers the skill by himself there just is a text popping up at the start of one level.\nThe game starts of slowly. Literaly. While it is cool to be Vader in the first level, he moves like a slug. That leads to the level way overstaying its welcome and almost had me quit the game prematurely.Now, why do I still recommend this game? Well, after getting a bit more comfortable with the game mechanics I had fun with this game:\nThe combos and fighting in general. You really see where they put the focus when developing the game. My favourite thing probably is to charge up my lightsaber with force lightning. It looks amazing, feels amazing and also is effective.\nThe level variety is phenomenal. From the surgical steel of an ISD to Sarlacc intestines you get to see a lot of one of the most interesting universes there is.\nThe Story is nice. It really fleshes out Vaders character and his relationship with emperor Palpatin in a similar way Shadows of the Empire did. It is no longer "high canon" with Disneys new policy and may soon be overridden by the Rebels cartoon, but it still is worthwhile. It is not incredibly deep and sometimes not too believeable, but then again, has Star Wars ever been?\nThe graphics were revolutionary when the game came out. As any game with photorealistc graphics they did suffer brutaly from age. What saves it is the quality of animation, it feels just on spot in so many situations. This ties in closely with the combos being so statisfying.So in conclusion I would say get this game when it is on sale and if you have a controller. Do not expect a masterpiece that will blow you away. It is a nice Star Wars experience with pretty sweet combat.","May 22, 2015","true","11.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The keyboard controls aren't great either (I used a 360 controller).  However these issues aside, the game is damn fun.  You have multiple different force powers and tons of combos you can pull off as well.

It is very similar to games such as DMC, Ninja Gaiden, and God of War. The story takes place in between episodes 3 and 4 and you play as Starkiller, Darth Vader's secret apprentice. The story is actually really good and has tons of set pieces throughout the 9 main story levels and the 3 DLC levels. You're tasked with assassinating several Jedi that survived Order 66, but later wonder if working for the empire is the right thing to do. The story has two endings, one that is the good/right ending and the other is the bad/wrong ending. The DLC continues off of the bad ending in which Starkiller goes full Sith and is tasked with hunting down several of the original trilogy's cast members, including Obi-Wan and Luke. The gameplay is pretty standard for a Hand and Slash/ Spectacle fighter game. The only new thing it has to offer is the force powers you can use in between Lightsaber combat. You get force powers such as force lightning and grapple. You can also throw your lightsaber later on. The game is locked at 30 frames per second and it does have a few bugs here and there such as the sound from blasters not playing or certain characters having textures that makes them look like the're covered by some sort of shadow. Overall though this is my favorite Star Wars game, yes even better than Knights of the Old Republic and Battlefront 2. I highly recommend you pick it up regardless of the price as it is well worth every penny if you are a big Star Wars or just looking for a fun action game with a good story.","December 12, 2015","true","20.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Not sure what the negative reviews are about; the controls are a little loose and tough to master but all it takes is a little practice.\n\nGameplay: Really fun and immersive. It does get slightly repetitive, since about half-way through the game you've already met all the enemies. I did find three bugs and I had to restart the level to fix them but overall a decent port. The Force powers are varying and really fun to use. You're supposed to use combos to kill enemies but you only need to know one or two main combos to deal a lot of damage. Apart from 3PS murder there's quicktime events for takedowns (which are fun and at the perfect level of difficutly, since you'd land a perfect one about 50% of the time and towards the end of the game you have them memorized for easy killing) and one sidescrolling level that was a pain to do but enjoyable.\n\nThe customization is one of the strong points of this game (even though the menus take forever to load). You can change costumes into droids, stormtroopers, clones, a variety of Sith or Jedi, and about ten alternate Starkiller costumes.  You can change lightsaber colors and also pick a passive effect for the lightsaber, such as health drain or added crit.\n\nThe boss battle are fun for the most part. I had to restart the Star Destroyer boss level multiple times because of a reoccurring bug, but I encountered no other issues. Honestly, most of them were slightly too easy; I beat them in one or two tries.\n\nGraphics: Outdated; it's an old game. Still, they're not bad looking. In the cutscenes especially, the level of detail on Starkiller's face is amazing. Yes the graphics are old; no they are not bad nor do they deter from the game.\n\nMusic: Really fantastic. A good mix of the classic soundtrack and totally new, dark themes full of powerful swells that really make you feel awesome. There were a few spots in the game where there was no music and that didn't feel right; the sounds of slaughter DO need accompaniment.\n\nStory: The story itself is quite good. Unfortunately, it's really low on character development; you can tell everything you need to know about a character simply from looking at them. The Force Unleashed books really fixed that; if you love the story its a good read and a slight improvement over the game's story. Still, its an epic saga and it really gets good towards the end as it becomes less mindless Jedi killing and there's actually emotion. The ending is fantastic.\n\nOverall, it's made its way into one of my favorite games off all time.","December 25, 2015","true","10.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

Graphics are great, if a little ropey and inconsistent at times. The controls are mostly really good but the camera can be a little shakey at times which results in the usual quick turns, or not, and a somtimes messed up targeting system, i will note that i played this with an xbox pad as i didnt think it played well with mouse and keyboard. The story is reallly great and in many ways the star of tthe show and it takes you to a great mix of locations from the sw universe, there are rp elements in that you can upgrade your powers and abilities as you level and there are holocrons littered throughout the stages for you to find and collect.\nOn a negattive note its pretty unfinished and badly optimised for pc with stuttery cutscenes and most of the stages can actually be just run straight through, what i mean by this is that minni boss thype encounters can simply be ignored for th most part and you can really just boss rush most of the game.That aside its really fun and enjoyable, should take you about 5-7 hours to complete but ng+ is fun too.

He's obviously a very calculating man who appreciates the big picture and knows what it means to move a plan forward in agonizing slow increments.\n\nThe powers are a lot of fun to play with, reminded me a lot of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy but with all that meaty Star Wars lore to bask in, and the only grips I have are with the controls during some of the platforming.","December 9, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The first missions you are sent on assassination missions and unlike assassin's creed, you actually feel like you are hunting down your targets. However this is a personal story, Starkiller, Galen Marek's story. And without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the story is worth while. However I have to point out some of the dialogue: its not always good, some of it would need to be re-worked. Why? Because it can create strange plotholes, and while still using different words it could all be fixed. Such as ( i don't consider this a spoiler because it is right after the prologue but i'll cover it anyway)  After the prologue Starkiller pulls the lightsaber out of Vader's hand. Next cutscene Vader says: "You were weak when I found you..." This doesn't make sense. It could have been: "Your training is nearly complete..." or "You are now stronger than you've ever been..." and this would have fixed some of the dialogue  By having better dialogue you can have a better story.\n\nGraphics. You know what? They're not that bad mainly because this is a third person game, you don't get to see the textures from really close. But yeah, there are some textures that are low-res.  WARNING: THE GAME IS LOCKED AT 30 FPS However it can be fixed with an fps mod fix on pcgamingwiki.com . I played the game with the mod: I can't stand 30 fps. I recommend using an xbox controller since this is a port.\n\nVoice acting is good. However one issue: I got a bug on the first mission where I could not hear Juno's dialogue. I tried to find a fix for it but nothing worked so far.  Turn on the subtitles so you won't miss any dialogue\n\nFinally the gameplay. This is where I both like the game and dislike it. First of all this is what I like: Combos, you can unlock alot of combos in this game and the animations for it are really cool! You have to memorize combinations of attacks and there are enough variations to keep you invested in your 11-13 hours play through. You can unlock different types of lightsabers which provide different buffs and you can choose the color as well. This is awesome because you are not force to use the same lightsaber and you don't have to look at the same colors are well. You can chose the buffs and the color independently of each other.\nThe movement system, this is where the game falters. It is not fluid enough, not responsive: you should be able to interrupt while you're in the middle of a combo, because when you're pressing X,Y,X,Y and you see a missile coming straight at you, well prepare to rage alot. This is my biggest problem in the game: sometimes you can't avoid dying. Most of the times when I died I could not do anything because i was in an animation, I could not avoid the danger. It feels like the game forces you to die occasionally. When you are locked in an animation you can take damage and there is nothing you can do. The worst issue is when jumping: and you get shot by a sniper or a rocket, you fall down and for some reason you slide on the floor for 30 meters. The problem is that it is an animation and you are locked in it so no matter what happens you can't get out of it. Some levels allow you to fall off the map and when you start to slide, you know five seconds ahead that you will die. Hopefully you understand why it can get really frustrating. And you might have to redo sections multiple times, not because you played on a hard difficulty but because you were extremely unlucky.\n\nLoading screens? I have to talk about them because they're bad. They can take a while to load 10-20 seconds and the worst part: WHY ARE THERE LOADING SCREENS INSIDE OF MENUS?!?\n\nThe enemies could be a bit more varied, I don't mind slicing through hundreds of grunts but the mini bosses need more variations. Some enemies are really anoying such as the purge troopers. You have a lightsaber, you should be about to slice through them without a doubt, but this is an overall complaint in the game: lighstabers don't really feel like lightsabers when fighting against tougher enemies. I don't like also how some types clones can resist my force attacks, isn't the point of the game to unleashe the force on them?\n\nSo overall I really like the game even with its flaws. To me it is an above average game with many flaws but you can still find enjoyment in it.","January 30","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/32430/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","TLDR – Third person hack & slash similar to the Jedi Knight series, but you don’t get any guns, and it’s more fast paced. The game takes about 10 hours to beat the first time through and doesn’t have that much replay value.  6/10\n\nStar Wars: The Force Unleashed is a console port that doesn’t seem to have been optimized for the PC (25 GB download!).  The controls are clunky (in some areas dangerously so) and the game’s menu screens don’t use the mouse. You navigate them with keyboard only, which is a clear sign of an incomplete console port.  Oddly enough, just navigation between different options in the main menu often has its own “loading” screens.\n\nThe game’s story takes place between Star Wars Episodes 3 & 4, so it all happens a few years before the original Star Wars movie events take place. Darth Vader finds and trains a young apprentice, who he wants to eventually overthrow the Emperor with. Vader’s convoluted plan involves having his apprentice (named Starkiller) go around causing trouble and raising an army to fight Emperor Palpatine. It doesn’t make much sense to me if I’m being honest. Anyways, the moral is don’t trust the bad guys, they’re always stabbing each other in the back.\n\nYou play the Sith assassin Starkiller in the third person perspective, similar to the Jedi Academy and Darksiders games, with your lightsaber being your melee attack, and the force as your ranged weapon. Lightsaber swings are very quick this time around unlike Jedi Academy, and your force powers are more limited, but they flow better in combat. All your force powers are offensive, so you don’t really have “buff” skills to power yourself up prior to fights (except the lightning shield which only lasts a few seconds anyway). Your most used attacks will be combinations of lightsaber swings and force push / force lightning.\n\nOne of the noteworthy gameplay elements is the partially destructible environment in many areas. There is a lot of loose debris (or chunks that you rip off the walls) that you can use to throw at your enemies. Every time you kill an enemy you regen some of your life back, while your force power regenerates on its own (pretty fast too, so you can keep blasting). Along with the fact that you don’t use guns, this means that the only collectibles in the game are “force holocrons,” which can give you experience or lightsaber parts for customization. Each time you level up you get points to upgrade a few of your character’s skills or stats. Some holocrons give these skill points directly, while others give random bonuses. Holocrons are often hidden in out of the way areas or behind destructible walls, so throw force power around bountifully and be rewarded.\n\nPros:\n+Expanded story for Star Wars fans, including the birth of the Rebel Alliance and an alternate timeline (DLC included in the Ultimate Sith Edition) where Starkiller gets all up in Luke Skywalker’s business.\n+Starkiller is extremely powerful, probably a lot stronger than any of the Jedi you have played in other Star Wars games. It’s good to be bad, and I’m considering changing my legal name to Starkiller.\n\nCons:\n-The controls are often frustratingly clunky, especially when it comes to locking onto enemies for ranged force attacks. There’s also a section involving a star destroyer that might make you want to pull your hair out. It’s not that it’s a difficult section, it’s just hard to know if you’re doing it right your first playthrough, and it just drags on and on.\n-The game really is poorly designed for PC, the large download (compared to the sequel, which is like ¼ the size) and the odd menu format really stick out. Also, it might be a bug but I think you need an internet connection to launch the game. I lost my connection for about 15 minutes and found that I couldn’t load my saved game.\n-The boss fights can be frustrating because there really isn’t a tutorial on dueling and it feels like I’m missing something important (especially related to blocking).\n\nAll in all, the game has significant problems but is worth playing through at least once for the story. Especially if you got this in the Humble Bundle and want to play part 2. I don’t think I’ll be playing through it a second time for a long while though. It just doesn’t bring too much to the hack slash genre.\n","April 28, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The "I recommend it" goes for when the game is on sale... if you can get it for like 2-3 bucks, like I did while it was on sale, then go right ahead.\nHere is the reasoning behind this:\n\n- The game HAS some things going for it. You do feel pretty powerful, and throwing around big containers and stuff, causing explosions, force-throwing them into groups of enemies etc... all that is FUN. It really is.\n\n- However, there isn't much depth to it. It's basically hack, slash and force-throw stuff, kill everything that moves, and do the objectives. I can imagine that rather quickly, even with upgrades and unlocking more powers or stronger versions, the gameplay will become dull.\n\n- The graphics are ok. Keep in mind this game is a couple of years old. That doesn't bother me usually, so I don't mind that the graphics certainly aren't up to date.\n\n- However, the performance is... ridiculous. I played this on a system that can, without problems, run GTAV, Witcher III, MGSV, Fallout 4, AK, AC Unity at good to ultra levels. However, this game is so badly optimized (which might explain the 30 GB!!!) that even on that PC, even today, the framerate has frequent drops. I don't even WANNA know how bad this was back when the game was new, and I find it rather unacceptable to have such a bad performance from a, what, six year old game on a modern, decent PC. It's not game-breaking, but it's annoying how badly this performs several years after its release.\n\nSo, my verdict:\n\nPros:\n- Decent SW vibe to it (setting, graphics, force powers)\n- A lot of fun especially early on to throw stuff, blow open doors with the force etc.\n- Decently down force control system (throwing items)\n- graphics are ok for an older game\n\nCons:\n- Lack of depth, both to fighting and to the story\n- Saberfighting is basically just spam a button type slashing. Other games have done this better\n- Terrible performance even today on a modern system that can run much more recent and much more advanced games more easily\n\nRating: 6/10 if at sale, 4/10 if not","December 7, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no antialiasing and no way to enable it. And frame rate troubles will haunt your every saber swing. It's too bad that so little respect was shown for the platform--and to those that will spend money on this product--because the underlying game is rather good. As Darth Vader's secret apprentice, you slice through grunting Rodians with your glowing lightsaber, go head-to-head with slobbering rancors, and punt jawas into the distance as if they were pigskins.

Some of the force powers you have are so strong that you can take down AT&Ts and later on a star destroyer, too. You do, literally, unleash the force in this game to its full potential. This also means that the focus is on the action not story telling so you may find this game disappointing if one of your favourite SW games is the Knights of The Old Republic or another RPG taking place in the same universe.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is horribly optimised. You install 25 gigabytes on your hard drive. Today this size is common but this is a 5-year old game. Additionally, there can be bugs and glitches and just because the Ultimate Edition is offered for purchase for PC gamers it's not an excuse for not looking into its issues. Personally, I did not find the story particularly interesting. I got that it was about Vader's secret apprentice but there are so many games out there taking place in the era of the old trilogy as well as the new one that I was already fed up with these.\n\nAnyway, this is not necessarily a bad game. It is an interesting concept and you really have some amazing power at your disposal.

So, spoilers. Deal with it.\n\nYou are Starkiller, Darth Vader's secret apprentice. But you never really feel like a Sith. Nor a Jedi. Starkiller seems a bit of a badass in-between character, with skills that hint at both.\n\nThe story feels quite engaging, if you are into Star Wars. If you are a fan, you'll gleefully smile at the references, appearances and the style of everything.\nI'm not an expert, but all the locations truly feel like they are Star Wars planets. And Starkiller's outfit design that comes with every level is a notable feature too.\n\nGameplay wise, aside the quirks an old game is expected to have, the game runs smooth. The cutscenes have frequent syncing hiccups, but it's easy enough to find them on Youtube and watch them with Overlay.\n\nWhile I really want to say the controls react perfectly, they don't...not really. There are many moments where an attack animation can't be interrupted, especially with a dash. Leaving you at the mercy of your foe (and their heavy attack)  whether you'll be punted away.\nIf you aren't being thrown around, though, you'll usually have proper controls.\n\nThe quality of the game is pretty nice, especially since Patch 1.2 comes with an HQ pack (comes with the installation). It's not super modern looking, but it's still pretty nice.\n\nWith the Sith edition comes many new outfits, even from characters that don't or make a single appearance. Such as Proxy, Starkiller's "assistant" and training droid, turning himself into a holographic Darth Maul to battle-train him.\nWhich was a tough fight, I'll have you know.\n\nThe real fan service comes in the form of extra missions.\nThe first one is from the old Jedi Temple, providing him with a small and personal adventure (in the shape of the Jedi Trials), showing Starkiller his "possible" future.\n\nWhich possible future you may ask? You might already know this, but the main story end leaves you with a Light or Dark Side choice. Save your friends from The Emperor, or kill Darth Vader, whom you already had beaten right before that (but who seems fine to do it all over again).\n\nThis is where things get interesting for the fans. The Light side choice (defeating Palpatine) is the canon ending. With Starkiller saving his friends, allowing them to start the Rebellion, and him dieing in what I consider a sense of sacrifice.\n\nBut the Dark Side choice is pretty badass in on itself. Not only do you replace Vader, but a little 'incident' (which I won't spoil for you) causes him to be gravely wounded as well. Resulting in him being assigned a pretty unique helmet with a breather that sounds a little bit like that of Vader. However, his design is much more designed for Acrobacy, and he also has kept his limbs, so there's that.\n\nBy the way, everything is unlocked in the extra missions, including all the lightsabre crystals, except for a few skills in the Jedi Temple one.\n\nThis is the point where the other two extra missions take place. You are now the Emporer's enforcer as Vader was. One mission takes place in Tatooine, where you hunt for two familiar sounding droids...\nThis has you passing by familiar characters, such as Jabba the Hut and Ben Kenobi, whom you have to kill, twice, in succession. Yeah, something about that spirit of his...\n\nThe second mission, and my personal favorite, takes place in Hoth during the famous assault on the Rebel Base. Starkiller has donned an outfit similar to that of Darth Vader, but built for acrobacy and flexibility. In my opinion, it looks ten times more badass than that of Vader. And I don't say this lightly.\n\nBut the real fan climax comes when you fight Luke for the second time. What happens there at the end gives so much fantasizing juice. Makes you feel bad that Lucas Arts didn't design a whole game around Starkiller taking the Dark Side.\n\nThe game is old, and it shows. But the story is strong and the gameplay is fun, but tough enough. It's been quite the trip, and I can't say I've really regretted it at any point.","April 26, 2013","true","13.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm happy to report that I at least didn't have any issues getting this to run in W10, on a gtx 980. Only small detractors in that area, the game doesn't support 1440p or above resolutions natively. Also be sure to get the 60fps unlocker, its an unofficial patch that's easily findable and makes quite a difference if your used to playing at 60 fps whereas 30 can seen choppy if your not accustomed to it.\n\nNow on to the game itself. Its starting to show its age, you can tell its crossgen title between ps2/ps3 or xbox and xbox 360. There are alot of low resolution textures to be found, also details and animations look a bit old. On the upshot it controls great, responsive, and while I'm only played a couple levels, its fun using even the early force powers.  Add to that the low price the Ultimate Sith Edtion and it wass a hard offer to pass up. Overall I'd reccomend it, just don't go in expecting shiny graphics and you won't be dissapointed","December 25, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

I like Star Wars a lot, but this game's gameplay is just too frustrating for me to be able to enjoy it. Let me give you a few reasons why that's the case. First of all, the controls are terrible. Making fine movements is a chore, aiming for a precise place to land when jumping is close to impossible. The camera gets constantly in your way, stuck in objects, etc... Using the force is fun, but the aiming is horrendous. Half the time, you're grabing something else, throwing it somewhere you didn't want to, etc... The level design is monotoneous and questionable at best, I've died several times because I just wasn't able to differentiate whether the character can stand on what seemed like solid ground or whether he will slide down into a pit. Battle mechanics are VERY limited, get boring quick and some design choices are real head scratchers to me, like: why you always have to move forward when swingin the light saber? You can't hit somebody standing on the edge of a pit or you'll fall in too. Add bugs, crashes, an incredibly slow loading menu and you're in for a huge disappoinment.","May 4, 2014","false","3.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There is no checkpoint/quicksave system, requiring you to redo the insane boss battles over and over again.\n\nThe battles? Boss battles should be moderately enjoyable, to be able to pull off some combo attacks. Well, no. Every boss has unavoidable attacks and will annihilate you before you have any chance to get the boss to 50% health.\n\nStick to Battlefront II or any of the other fantastic Star Wars titles, skip this miserable mess.","February 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","12","23","3","0"

Also REQUIRES virtual memory/paging to be turned on with no way to skip it (even if you have a system with 16GB+ of RAM).\n\nConclusion: Could have been an awesome game, but it has a multitude of issues that will have you throwing your keyboard/controller in frustration.

It is not a game fitting for the avid lightsaber fight loving Jedi/Sith personality, as this game's name; 'the force unleashed', is quite literal. You get 'way' more options in this game in terms of using the force, than you do with lightsaber combat...Frankly, lightsaber combat in this game is more of a 'last resort' deal, or if the enemies are so weak/few that it honestly would take longer to beat them with the force.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, however, the game is extremely entertaining, and thanks to the game's commendable difficulty curve, from Apprentice to Sith Master(last one has to be unlocked), the game sports an absolute TON of replayability, from alternative endings, to new lightsaber colors, to new unlockable costumes and entirely new characters, the game is one of those gems which has you coming back for more!\n\nIn terms of lore, the Force Unleashed opens a new, previously unexplained gap between two movies, I believe its number II and III(not the newer videos). It tells the story of a rogue Sith apprentice to Darth Vader, codenamed simply as Starkiller, who works under the strict and vicicous tutelage of the Dark Lord himself, effectively hunting down exiled Jedi. However, as the story presses on, the young Sith apprentice begins, for varying reasons, to feel less secure in his apprenticeship to Lord Vader, and his life takes a complete U-turn when he meets his new ship pilot, Juno.\nThe story is believable, as it fills in a lore gap to explain what happened in the space between movie II and III.\n\nGraphics wise, this game is on par with modern video games, and takes quite a bit of effort on your GPUs part to keep up the Framerate counter, however, it can easily be resolved by lowering the resolution, and unchecking the High detail box prior to starting the game, which pretty much eliminates framerate lag(Unless your computer is a potato with copper wires in it)\n\nDo I think this game, and its sequel, are worth adding to your Star Wars game collection?

The controls are a bit sluggish, the camera isn't always where you want it, but it's playable.\n\nBut the gem and the real reason you should play this game is the new lore: an interesting chapter in the Star Wars saga, and a character that would have deserved his own trilogy. And the actor who played him in the game (and the basis for the character's face in the game) would have been perfect for the role. Think of this game and its sequel, Force Unleashed II, in the same way as the animated Clone Wars series. They both fill in gaps in the story.

It is not a game fitting for the avid lightsaber fight loving Jedi/Sith personality, as this game's name; 'the force unleashed', is quite literal. You get 'way' more options in this game in terms of using the force, than you do with lightsaber combat...Frankly, lightsaber combat in this game is more of a 'last resort' deal, or if the enemies are so weak/few that it honestly would take longer to beat them with the force.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, however, the game is extremely entertaining, and thanks to the game's commendable difficulty curve, from Apprentice to Sith Master(last one has to be unlocked), the game sports an absolute TON of replayability, from alternative endings, to new lightsaber colors, to new unlockable costumes and entirely new characters, the game is one of those gems which has you coming back for more!\n\nIn terms of lore, the Force Unleashed opens a new, previously unexplained gap between two movies, I believe its number II and III(not the newer videos). It tells the story of a rogue Sith apprentice to Darth Vader, codenamed simply as Starkiller, who works under the strict and vicicous tutelage of the Dark Lord himself, effectively hunting down exiled Jedi. However, as the story presses on, the young Sith apprentice begins, for varying reasons, to feel less secure in his apprenticeship to Lord Vader, and his life takes a complete U-turn when he meets his new ship pilot, Juno.\nThe story is believable, as it fills in a lore gap to explain what happened in the space between movie II and III.\n\nGraphics wise, this game is on par with modern video games, and takes quite a bit of effort on your GPUs part to keep up the Framerate counter, however, it can easily be resolved by lowering the resolution, and unchecking the High detail box prior to starting the game, which pretty much eliminates framerate lag(Unless your computer is a potato with copper wires in it)\n\nDo I think this game, and its sequel, are worth adding to your Star Wars game collection? Without a doubt. This game's shere popularity, and Lore accuracy, makes it a 'must play' in order to get insight into a truly intense and entertaining part of the untold-in-the-movies story!","April 4, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

But I'm gonna give credit to Asyper, for they've pretty much fixed all of the bugs and made this an almost flawless Star Wars experiance.\n\nThe story is really intreguing and the graphics look fantastic. Characters have depth to them and real backgrounds, which is nice but could have been explored more. SWFU does have additional content when you beat the game, but that content is rather short. Addionally, the game has this habit of making you explore the same planet about 80 gazillion times. There isn't enough variety in the levels.\n\nAll in all, you'll be paying for a pure single player experience for the main game (which takes about 8 hours to complete) plus 3-4 free DLC mission packs (which aren't all that terrible).  For it's price, you could do better, but you really should play Force Unleashed in some way if you haven't already.\n\nVerdict: WEAK BUY\n\nI don't advise you to buy this unless it is at a really low price (like $15 dollars or less).","November 30, 2010","true","9.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The lock on is trash. No combo depth. Pretty much no combos. The invinsibilty frames when you are knocked down, so you just keep getting knocked down over, and over without having a chance to get up. All the "Harder" characters just poise through everything and continuesly knock you down. you have to resort to the same moves. Trying to force grab a lot of objects gets you killed. The level design started nicely, but began to get boring as you see the same enviorments over and over. I personaly play a lot of hack and slashes, but this one is absolutely terrible.

Ever since the Force Unleashed came out, I've read the books and have 3 different versions for 3 different systems (nintendo ds, psp-3000, and the Wii). The other three versions I bought were pretty nice (+rep to those devs), but this looks like another rushed and botched pc port; which has become all to prevalent these days.\n\nPros:\n- None, all three other force unleashed I've owned are far superior in every way (Wii was the best)\n\nCons:\n- Horrible physics engine\n- Numerous game crashing bugs (primarily in boss battles, which make them the worst timing)\n- Can't move around in the Rogue Shadow\n- QTE's don't always specify whether the button needs to be mashed repeatedly or just tapped once\n- Enemies are FAR too difficult even on normal\n- Save system frequently corrupted after trying to reload it\n- 30 FPS frame cap, causes slow rendering and screen tearing (I have a GTX 960 so this shouldn't be a problem)\n- Not holding to the actual book in many respects, like on the scrap planet you have to move an entire destroyer\nbut the "Ultimate" edition assumes that's too unrealistic i guess (even the ds version had the destoyer part lol, so                                     can't  blame it on system limitations)\n\nMy advice is, get it on any other system, NOT on pc.\n\n3/10\n","December 8, 2015","false","3.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","1"

The auto-target is ... bad is the only word, constantly locking onto things off screen instead of the foe centered in your view. The controls can only be adjusted before you start playing, and the tooltips in game use the default control scheme anyway.\nThe camera is a kludgy mess. It pans around randomly, does not line up for you to be aware of the bottomless pit you're about to step into, and refuses to follow enemies even during boss fights. Boss fights get their own camera angle, altering the basic camera behavior from "behind the character" to "cinematic overview", without adjusting the control scheme for the altered perspective.\n\nFights with large foes will suddenly become quick time events for "cool kills". Unfortunately, you're so busy with the timing that you can't appreciate the cool thing you're supposed to be doing. Thus, these "cool moments" exist in my memory as random button icons flashing on a screen.\nThe story is bland, and spoiled by the "sat on main menu too long" in-game trailer.\nThe characters are shallow and predictable.\nBosses randomly, and with no indication of when, become invincible while fighting. This seems to last for three to five seconds, and is most common when the player begins to get a series of successful attacks chained together.\n\nTL;DR: Bad. Don't buy it. If you get it for free, don't install it.","February 23","false","2.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you must play this game, i do recommend playing it on easy mode and just breezing through it as you swing your glowing wiffleball bat at enemies until the next story beat. The combat is not its strong suit, its unremarkable and often very disempowering for whats supposed to be a very empowering demigod force wielding character when he is picked up by enemies like a small child and then tossed around like a rag doll and almost every single enemy has a means to block or outright be immune to basic light saber attacks, so for a majority of the time you will not be actually using your light saber. It requires mana to use combo attacks, so you will be hindered in the amount of combos you are allowed to perform over time, meaning it does not incentivise you to perform them. The horse isn't dead enough yet, because I have to talk about how awful the targetting system is, because a large amount of boss fights require you to use force powers at key moments and target flying objects that may or may not be trying to kill you, they rarely respond to targeting. You will be doing those sequences multiple times, over and over, in frustration and just wanting the ride to end, but it doesn't end, not yet, oh no, there are more QTE's to get through.","February 1","false","11.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DinoKeeper/recommended/32430/","DinoKeeper","Gentlefish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DinoKeeper/","129 products in account","The Force Unleashed is a miracle of bad game design. Poor explanation of controls? Check. A tutorial (for throwing stuff with the Force, at least) that comes after the prologue level? Check. Bosses- and regular enemies- that can block attacks, knock you down, use attacks that you can't avoid or block, and make you forget all those neat combos in favor of button-mashing? Check. Seriously, one of the later levels gives you two or three purge troopers (who can knock you down), an AT-ST (which can also knock you down) and an assortment of stormtroopers (who can't knock you down but will constantly interrupt you by shooting you). Any difficulty above Apprentice, on which I still got killed by the aforementioned spam, is unthinkably nightmarish during or after the second boss. Not that the second boss is ever anything but.\nThere are also insultingly pointless quick-time events. You're given a surprisingly long window for each button press, and if by some perverse miracle you press the wrong button... either you can immediately initiate the QTE again or, if it's in a boss fight, you just get to press the right button. I failed to press X at a moment when doing so would prevent Starkiller from being fatally beaten in a saber lock... and I was just asked to do it again as the saber lock continued. Just let me kill the boss and watch the finisher or something. Sheesh.\nThe camera is rather irritating to control, though in my experience that's nothing new. Some people have complained about the fact that most of the boss fights have  a fixed camera, and while I understand that it's annoying, I'm actually somewhat glad that for once I don't have to bother with rotating the camera.  You can lock on to enemies, though, so that's a plus.\nThe game also only has three tilesets. We see Kashyyk in the prologue and in the story proper, we go to Felucia (how I hate Felucia) twice, and two different planets have the junkyard tileset. There might be more instances of this, though. I haven't finished the game.\nTo try to tie together the disparate complaints in this review, let me tell you about my favorite area in the game: a certain open area on Felucia. It's a clearing with some islands of foliage and weird tentacles that react violently when you shock them (this is probably meant to help you clear out enemies, but it didn't seem too helpful to me), loads of obnoxious Felucian warriors, some large, explosive fruits surrounding the clearing, and not one, not two, but THREE Rancors.\nQuick rundown of Felucians: they have bone swords with forcefields that can block your attacks, they have forcefield shields that can block your attacks, they have shamans that can render them invincible, and they have another variant that shoot lasers at you from a staff. There are, as I mentioned, loads of them in this particular stretch of jungle, and they make it nearly impossible to take the necessary time to grab and throw fruits at the Rancors. They also seem to spawn continuously, though I could be wrong about that. Note this: the rushed, out-of-touch or downright sadistic people who made this game give the player an efficient means of dealing with the dangerous enemies in an area and then make that means essentially useless. I had to downgrade from Sith Lord (regular) difficulty to Apprentice (easy) to get through that area. At the point in the game I'm at the player is frequently pit against AT-STs, which are essentially Rancors that can consistently hit from a distance, and either not given any obvious throwables (not that they help against an AT-ST in firing range) or mobbed with stormtroopers.\nThis is all very tragic, really, because TFU had the potential to be a good game. There are points in the game where I've felt like the overpowered Sith I'm supposed to be, but these are few and far between when all sorts of enemies can block my lightsaber, force push or lightning and then repeatedly knock me over.","December 19, 2015","false","8.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Games like dragons dogma, dark souls, skyrim, devil may cry, dynasty warriors, toukiden, and eventually God eater and for honor, seem to be the only few types of run around jump action titles that exist with melee combat on the PC genre. However, all of those games have mechanics that will actually support your playstyle, this does not.\n\nSome examples of these bad elements include bosses endlessly countering attacks, randomly losing 40 percent of your health from attacks, missing with your sith thunder attack, faulty attack priority, getting locked into enemy combos, slippery slopes while exploring, bad camera angles, cutscenes everywhere, and a throw system that trumps the combat system because of the ai.\n\nGranted, games of this time have always been full of gimmicks when choosing the hardest available difficulty, however, in action games, it's almost necessary to do so to enjoy the variations of combos the game has to offer. Though the ai makes a point to walk through half of your combo to the point where it feels like you're playing a dragon ball z game, and it's almost an implicit need to throw and blast everything rather than even try to punch anything. That's a big no no if you're trying to make an action game... it'll end up being like dragon age... where mages and archers destroy the game for any type of melee. Moreso with the latter.\n\nIt's not a bad game though... the visuals, movement, enemies and effects are still a strong point, the visual fluidity and normal difficulty pacing in the game makes for some of the more fast and curious platform games I've played in the past and adds action from other games that lack the speed or traversal appeal that this game boasts. It's one of the main reasons I've bothered picking it back up despite already playing through most of it on 360. But despite how much I do like the game after I bench some of the more irritating elements, I would never recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fair and honest challenge. Because let's face it, outside of exploration, the main reason for playing it is to kick butt Jedi style. Not kicking yourself for the game being too cheap to play how you want.","May 18","false","6.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Make sure to get a fps unlocked .exe though or your eyes will start to bleed.\n\nNow to the bad ... the game is very hard and unforgiving ... now .. not hard in a "oh you newb you just don't know how to play  lolol" , no , not like that, but in a "oh you didn't time that jump perfectly" or "oh no you actually can't jump here now you die falling down the abyss and then we let you restart from before the last boss battle ... again" kinda way. Also it has some weird difficulty spikes, which really make you wanna (or do make you do lol) ragequit sometimes. Actually, i got so frustrated about the stupid ways you can die in this game. Last time i died,  i was stuck and stun locked in an explosion and little by little all my life went away and i died .... and had to redo the  whole area again ...\n\nTo sum it up :\n\nCombat is a chore.\nBoss fights are either ♥♥♥♥ easy (if you know which attack to spam lol) or\nBoss fights are impossibly hard (if you don't know which attack move or force etc to spam).\n\nMovement (and by that i mean jumping) is a PITA.\n\nNormal combat (i.e. not vs bosses) is either easy as pie or bugged as hell ,like not doing damage against something, without any indication of why ... and i am not talking enemies that can block blade attacks or are "immun" to the force, but enemies that are just not taking damage, period.\n\nFrustrating progression. It's just one big grind to reach the next cutscene (do yourself a favor and just watch them with a bik player lol).\n\nFeels like work ...\n\ndo NOT recommend ...\n\nPS : played with a xbox controller","May 11","false","11.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So if you encounter some framerate issues, no, your computer is not to blame or some irritating battle clitches, its not your skills, its the game.

The controls feel awkward, the force powers aren't as fluid as they could be. Enemies can hit you while you're on the ground which can be very frustrating as health does not automatically regenerate. The worst part of the gameplay is the terribly done boss fights. Each one gives you a terrible camera view and lightsaber fights are not nearly as cool as they could have been. If you even try to swing your lightsaber at the boss, they just defelect it with the same annoying animation every single time. Most of the more difficult enemies just require you to spam force push/lighting with follow up short lightsaber attacks and they're just not fun at all. The worst part of the game was probably in the last few levels where you're tasked with destroying a ship using force push powers and the objects never travel in the direction your aiming, making it very difficult to take out enemy TIE fighters. Another pretty stupid part of the game was one of the levels bosses. The developers thought it would be cool for you to fight Darth Maul, so they had your comic relief robot hologram character randomly fight you in the middle of the mission. It just came off as lazy and frustrating.\n\nThe graphics are expected for a game from 2009. Unfortunetly, the game is a pretty obvious console port, with a painful 30fps lock that keeps the game from running as fluid as it could. The lighting and textures are average but what really stands out is the fantastic physics engine. While the controls are terrible making it difficult to do, it is still awesome to be able to pull objects off the walls and throw them at your enemies just like you would see in the movies.\n\nThe story is this games only saving grace. It takes place between the original trilogy and the newer prequel series with Darth Vader hunting down the last remanents of the Jedis in the galaxy. You play the roll of a new apprentice "Starkiller" who is tasked with going to planets (all of which are locations Star Wars fans will recognize) to kill a bunch of locals and hunt down the jedi hiding there. The cutscenes are done very well with great voice acting and new original characters that fit perfetly into the Star Wars universe. The scenes even have that cheap looking transitional fade that the original movies had which really shows the attention to detail in making what appears to be a real Star Wars movie. The ending does feature two endings depending on what you do, but I won't spoil why/how.\n\nUnfortunetly, this is a video game, and the story alone is not enough to be able to fairly recommend this game. If you love star wars, you can probably make it through the terrible gameplay just to see the cool cutscenes and story, but if not, avoid this game.","May 14, 2014","false","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's completely devoid of any of the low quality fantasy stuff that has been forced down our throat such as Darth Kreya on a quest to "destroy the force" (I'm thiking of you, Chris Avellone) or Jerrod looking for the "valley of the Jedi" (your turn now, Justin Chin). In the front, we've got a war plot AS IN the Original Trilogy, with a war in the main stage and Jedi mysticism elegantly laying in the background,\nThe acting's pretty decent (Sam Witwer is great), cut scenes are nothing short of awesome, and the two or three throwbacks to the Prequel Trilogy (the "hologram" of Darth Maul, Bail Organa, the Jedi Temple made of Junk, and the Jedi Purge) are well executed. Two of the three DLCs (Tatooine and Hoth) provide an wesome icing to the cake, being a REAL pleasure to go through --the are "what-if"s in nature,with the evil ending protagonist taking a Vader-like role, rewriting parts of the Original Trilogy story in a damn well-connected manner. I only wish the ending to Hoth were a bit different.\nA must play, with its only downside in the slightly lazy port from consoles.","May 11, 2014","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylorh/recommended/32430/","taylorh","TaylorHuston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylorh/","297 products in account","I want to like this game. It has so much potential. And sometimes when you're playing it there are moments that are really, really fun. When you're jumping from Stromtrooper to Stormtrooper, your lightsaber combos are flowing beautifully, you're force throws are on point, you feel really powerful. The close you can ever feel to being a real Jedi.\n\nBut unfortunately those moments are too far between. What could be epic gameplay is, more often than not, hampered by shotty targeting, bad camera angles, weird boss fights that block everything so you can't really use any good combos or slick moves, annoying sequences where you will get hit by an attack that knocks you down, and it takes your character so long to stand back up that you're hit by another one immediately, and this repeats until you die while you scream at your monitor. Seriously for being a badass Jedi, this guy stands up at a speed that would make my grandpa laugh. For every time you epicly force grab something and throw it at an enemy, there are three times where you force grab something and for some reason throw it in a completely random direction. Or when you try and force lightning someone, and for some reason you force lightning the air right beside them while they stand there and look at you like you're crazy.\n\nThe game is difficult. But not in a fun way. I like a game that is a challenge. If I make a mistake, punish me (didn't realize how dirty that sounded until I said it out loud). But this game isn't difficult in that way. It's difficult in a lot of the enemies have slow, repetitive unblockable attacks that knock you down over and over and over again. It's difficult where the boss just randomly becomes invincible/blocks everything you have so you just have to wait for him to let you start attacking again. Really any lightsaber duel feels less like a duel and more like you using force lightning and just running away because that's significantly more effective than actually using your lightsaber due to the enemy blocking all your attacks and all of his attacks being unblockable. It has entirely too many jumping puzzles for a game with a bad camera and an erratic, unreliable double jump.\n\nLittle things like that that should have never made it through any kind of QA testing.\n\nThe DNA of a great game is there. But it needed another 6 months of polishing before release, at least. This is on the top of my "games that didn't live up to their immense potential" list.\n\nAnd that's not even counting how bad of a PC port this is. Straight port. 30fps. No extra graphic enhancements. Nothing to take advantage of being on a PC. Just seems lazy.\n\nI played the game all the way through because of those brief moments of fun. But I would say I only really enjoyed myself about %30 of the time, the other %70 I was just more annoyed and frustrated than anything else.","April 2","false","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is fun. Great even, for a while. This game basically links Star Wars Episodes 3 and 4 together, by way of telling the creation of the Rebellion, and how Leia became a forerunner of it, etc. It has a cool story line, and is generally just fun. I don't know, this is the first game of its kind I've played, I think.\n\nAs for being a console port, my review for this game definitely goes down.\n\nAs I've just said, this game was a console port. That means that it was made for the consoles first, and then converted to pc code to be played there (even though technically it's first made with pc code, depending on how they made it, I digress). One of the missions in this game, has you -SPOILER ALERT- take a Star Destroyer out of space and into the ground.\n\nThe reason why I'm mad about that, is because of the gameplay part of that. You have to spam your mouse up and/or down to get it into position, as well as use a or d to move it laterally, and then when it's in place you can bring it down. Well, unless you know that you don't have to frantically move your mouse, you're probably going to end up destroying it accidentally, by way of friction. Also, even when you know you don't have to do that, it's still very difficult to do. I couldn't.\n\n\n\nDon't buy this game on PC. Buy it on console, if you still can, or watch it, if you're interested. It's a good game, with an okay port, until you get to that mission - somewhere midway through the game I think.","May 21","false","24.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Great, so many combos to use...if it wasn't for the fact that you will never use most of them. Especially the longer, most powerful combos are useless - weak enemies will be dead long before you finish them and strong ones will interrupt them 99% of the time. Also most of the stronger ones have superior power on melee range, so you'll just end up pouring electricity into them from safe distance until it stops being funny.\n\n- Oh, wanted to list something more, but just realized that 'tis a part of the cmbat system as well. There is not really anything else in this game than combat anyway. So, okay - using the things lying around to fight. Sounds fun, right? Just tearing a block of metal from the wall with the Force and smashing it into your enemies. The hell it does! But it takes so long you cannot use it. First you have to target the object (more on targeting later, that's the stuff of nightmares). Use the pull ability on it, the slooooowly float it around, direct it on the enemies and release...there you go! Oh, damn, why am I lying on the floor with half HP gone? Something must have gone wrong in the process. The thing is you cannot move while doing this so you'll probably get hit by a missile or five before you get to the carnage part. Did I mention getting knocked off your feet interrupts the pull? So this one's a no go.\n\n\nThat's it, my list of "what could have been pros if better executed" is officially over. Now for the cons:\n\n- Characters. They have no character whatsoever. And their behavior makes absolutely no sense. No thinking being would act like that.\n\n- Story. There is a story? Must have missed it. Kill this, kill that, kill something more. Oh, the Dark Lord betrayed us? Let's kill him as well.\n\n- Enemies. They are plain stupid and predictable. If you don't try to use any of the longer combos or never stop to chuck some debris around, you will pretty much never get hit with anything that hurts. Which basically limits all the abilities and combos to using 3-4 things (out of dozens) over and over again.\n\n- Boss fights. The camera turns into a 1990 abomination during those.\n\n\nAnd the winner of our "worst thing about The Force Unleashed" contest is (without any competition to speak of) the targetting system. You have no crosshair, no cursor or anything to pick a target. You just look in the general direction and hope the game picks the one you want. Normally it's pretty much a 50/50 thing, so it is still playable. But during the boss fights, with the atrocious camera, targeting becomes nothing short of abysmal. Most of the fight you spend running in circles around your enemy in a hopeless strive to target him/her. Mostly you hit things just by accident - when you aren't even trying to. Blocking their abilities is even worse, because you often have only around half a second to target them. I consider myself a patient person - I don't have a problem with repeating something I did wrong many times over until I get it right. Well, I'm also very stubborn, so I will keep trying even if it meant dying for the whole day. But this...this almost made me quit the game a couple times. Not because of the dying, but because I knew I didn't do anything wrong, just the mechanics are atrocious. Now that I've finished it I wish I rather quit. Not worth the time even if it was free.","May 3, 2015","false","12.0"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","20","42","2","0"

Yes you, the person who's about to thumbs down my review. Did you notice that I actually LIKE the game? Just because I didn't recommend the game didn't mean I didn't enjoy it.\nThis game fell right between the lines of "recommend" and "not recommend" and that's a sign to me that most people probably would rather play something else. You're welcome to disagree with me, but at least comment to tell me why.\n\n-Quick Review-\nEver want to blast people with "UNLIMITED POWER"? Like the idea of picking up stormtroopers and throwing them into the abyss? Have you ever wanted to try mixing lightsaber moves with various force techniques?\n...Then this... ....MIGHT... ...be the game for you?\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: you play as Starkiller, Darth Vaders Secret apprentice. Star killers been put into a twisting story of nearly constant betrayal, being a spy and agent for Lord Vader tends to have that effect on you.\nStarkiller's soul purpose is to hunt down the enemies of the empire and bring them to justice, Starkiller learns various force and lightsaber techniques to assist him in his hunt. The story takes place after the clone wars, but before the first Death Star is fully constructed.\nYou can play through the story in maybe 6-12 hours, depending on how much extra collecting you do and difficulty you play on. The game also does the cheap fork-story-ending, so you need to go back and make your choice over again, if you want to see both endings.\n\nGame Play: This is where the game hurts... sometimes literally.\nthis game was designed to be played with a controller, but even with a controller the game is a mess, the camera is tricky, targeting is terrible, you need to spend a majority of the first few levels learning simply how to pick up the correct object (since it's linked to which way Starkiller is facing, INSTEAD OF MY CAMERA. Sheesh)\nTo be quite blunt and fair, the controls of this game are a very good reason for people to steer clear and spend their money on a game they might actually enjoy playing. However this game did have great potential, and brought a lot of great concepts, but it definitely needed more work before it was released.\n\nTo talk really briefly about the various attacks, you have force lightning, force push, lightsaber attack, and block. There are various combinations of these four to make up your combat type in the game. The game seems to prefer you supplement your lightsaber strikes with force moves, instead of going full blown Master Yoda mode.\n\nThere is one final thing to say about the Game Play... Screw Quick Time events. They don't NEED to be bad, but they are in this game. You'll also have them memorized; it gets repetitious fast.\n\nAchievements: There were achievements on the Xbox version, there might be achievements some time but as of now there are none (03/19/15). We should probably count ourselves lucky. However, the accomplishments, unlockables and extra's are still in the game so you still can obtain them, if you so desire.\n\nPrice I purchased The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition from a humble bundle, so naturally I suggest waiting for sales before purchasing. The standard price for The Force Unleashed on steam is $19.99. Not a fair price, in my opinion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord_Vic/recommended/32430/","Lord_Vic","Sprawlie (LordVic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord_Vic/","99 products in account","What can I say about force unleashed? This is a hard one to review because I have not been able to finish this. I'm not one to claim to be a great video game player. I play most of my linear style games on easy / medium settings and I look for more plot and direction of the story. A good story can often overcome some bugs and glitches or bad game mechanics.\n\nNot with this game. This is a bad game. Its not often I will say this but this is a game to avoid. When you are introduced to the story, there is so much hope and promise, But unfortunately the rest of the game gets in the way.\n\nThe gameplay is unpolished. The mechanics are boring and repetitive. What looks like it could be a well thought out fight mechanic quickly turns into button mashing adventure of whack a mole, as computer controlled oponents constantly spawn and run at you. The AI is terrible as most enemies will stand there and take it. UNfortunately, The Enemy AI, being extremely weak is compensated for by boss fight mechanics that are repeitively annoying. We're not talking about, 5-10 moves that are varied up. Most enemy bosses will come at you with no more than 2-3 moves. Often will just stun / slam you into a corner or invisible wall (more on thos later!) and repeat that for 20 or so seconds while you watch in disbelief unable to even interact with your character. Many enemies have artificial buffs to try and counter you. They are extremely one dimension. SOme are immune to force. Some autoblock lightsabers. Some can't get shoved, some cant get electrocuted. it seems artificial and fake.\n\nThe gameplay itself is extremely 1 directional. You follow the path forward at all points. This isn't necessarily bad for a platformer. I tend to like directed story games. But this one isn't good. You're often rudely interrupted while running for cutscenes that are abrupt and out of place. The paths look like you might have multiple ways of going, but you quickly find that they are just invisible walls and that your direction is set no matter what.\n\nThe biggest offender though of the game mechanics? the overuse, constantly abusing you with QUicktime events. If it's a non standard enemy. So, Any AT_T walkers, rancor, or the like, which come more and more frequently as you progress, will end with a Quicktime event. You will do thousands of them. And they're not short either. many of them taking 20-30 seconds of watching you kill the enemy with some completely arbitrary, pre-scripted event that has nothing to do with the way you fight in game and acts as a complete disconnect to the battle system.\n\nThen you get to the worst boss battle in any star wars game I can ever recall. Perhaps one of my least liked boss battles ever. The Star Destroyer. Combine all that is wrong in this game, add in broken gameplay mechanics, incorrect instructions on screen and constant waves of enemies that are timed on purpose to prevent you from finishing this boss quickly, I just gave up.\n\nAnd just when you thought it can't get worse. it does. The Camera system is frustrating. it does not always follow you smoothly from behind and during many fights, you will find it swinging widly around, changing how your character responds to your button presses. Then Boss fights introduces brand new camera mechanics. It attempts to emulated a 1v1 side scrolling fighter, but horribly. The camera finds a fixed position off in the distance and just shows you the "map" you are to fight in. Except, the controls don't lend well to this view and you will find yourself runing into walls and posts and getting stuck with things in your feet between you and your foe, making most boss fights a fight against the camera, not the enemy\n\n\nThis game, with only a few hours played ahs become oen of the least enjoyable experience I have ever had in the star wars universe. My final rating is a 1/10 stars. or whatever rating you want to give it. I recommend reading the story on wiki instead of wasting your money, time, and frustrating emotional outbursts on just how terrible this game is. Avoid at all costs. I have deleted this game from my steam library. I never intend to play it again nor the second.","December 19, 2013","false","7.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"

The lock-on key is useless, and force powers are extremely difficult to aim. Lifted enemies and objects fly in crazy directions that don't seem to take any input from keys pressed or mouse movements. Boss battles add to the frustration, as bosses can shrug off force powers and lightsaber attacks with impunity, and often seem to be completely invincible during scripted movement and combat sequences.\n\nEven on my relatively nice gaming rig (GTX 680 x2, i7 3820 @3.6Ghz, 32Gbs RAM) this game suffers constant stuttering, and  odd split-second flashes of other scenes when using some force powers and lightsaber attacks.\n\nJust from a technical standpoint this game is a failure, but the ridiculous (and unfortunately canon) storyline only pushes this pile of garbage further into the "forgetful" realm of gaming.

In fact, you can't kill most large enemies without executing one. They aren't difficult, but they aren't especially fun, either.\n\nFurther, the characters are bland and uninteresting, the main character is a gigantic Mary Sue, and there are many ridiculous aspects (breathing and talking in vacuum, a shapechanging, Force-using droid??????) that make it hard to stomach.

This game is a Like God of War type button mashing combat game. A lot of similar mechanics are used like quick time events to kill bigger enemies and button combonations to encourage chaining attacks for maximum damage. The QTE part of the game feels kind of flat and not as epic as some games have been able to make it, and the combos are for the most part useless. The hordes of enemies that come at you either wont live past the first couple of hits or can just not get hit some how. Boss battles consist of fighting jedi (so far, it changes later on but I don't think I'm going to finish this game) and some of these battles can be really tough because Jedi can just cancle what you're doing or not be effected by your attack. This makes the boss battles really boring and annoying.\n\nThe good news is that the story is kind of neat, although it is badly done through the cutscenes in the game, so here what I suggest you do, if you're interested in this game, go buy the book.

Combat is not satifying at all, as you find yourself killing waves and waves of enemies without trying. During the second part of the game different variants of storm troopers arrive, in order to kill them you have to use a particular technique, this gets boring FAST. Most boss fights are pretty lame as well, as many of the bosses limit or restrict your uses of the force powers, or they require constant button mashing. This makes the boss fights boring and not rewarding, a good example of a well designed boss fights would be the colossuses in Shadow Of The Colossus, all the bosses were unique. Mr Freeze from Batman Arkham city would be another one, as Freeze adapts to your attacks, evades, and movements. It was a multi step fight with out lame QTE sequences or out of placed cutsences, which were everywhere in The Force Unleashed.\n\nStory- The story is mediocre, which is really sad because the Star Wars universe is very interesting. The main character Galen Marek is very dull, and has no emotions, a good comparison to Marek would be Connor from Assasin's Creed III, which is not a good thing. Other characters are not much better etheir, everyone just seemed so boring and unteresting. The missions are not much better ethier, they all feel the same, as you slaughter waves and waves of enemies. level design was flawed, as many of the levels looked very similar and were boring to play through. The Force Unleashed has two endings, both were terrible, the good ending being a little bit better than the bad one, but thats not saying much at all. In the end you find yourself not being able to make any decisions as the game does that for you, but it really does not matter as the build up and the characters along the way were boring and painfully average.\n\nOverall opinion- The Force Unleashed is game made only for Star Wars fans, if you want a hack and slash game, go ahead and buy DMC, it's much better than this. If you desire a game that explores the lore and mythos of Star Wars, this not the game for you etheir. The people that would enjoy the Force Unleashed would be hardcore star wars fans and people that want a easy game where you feel like a god. At the end of the day Star Wars The Forced Unleashed is a disappointing  game, it could have been great but instead it fell short, The Force Unleashed is not a terrible game, but it's not a good one etheir.\n\nRating- 6/10 Average game.","January 15","false","1.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemming77/recommended/32430/","lemming77","Lem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemming77/","619 products in account","The game's main selling point is its physics engine. It combines Havok, Euphoria (of GTA4 fame), and DMM to rather remarkable results. And for those of you who don't know, DMM is a more in depth material modelling engine. The idea being that you get objects which bend and break like their real world counterparts. Glass shatters, wood splinters, metal bends, and plants swing. And it's remarkably effective. Often it adds to the wreckless destruction your jedi powers leave in their wake, as all sorts on the sidelines gets caught in your wrath. And at other times, it's used to open doors. Two layers of steel blocking the way? Not a problem, just punch it out of the way!\n\nHowever it's not an open ended game. It ultimately has you navigate a linear path, which is fine. But in order to do this, it has to put up immovable barriers to keep you there. Which rather horribly juxtaposes all that dynamic damage they have going on. In fact, in order to make sure the game's still completable, there's a lot of indestructable level geometry. The only bridge across a chasm won't break, for instance. But next to the impressive DMM magic, it feels astonishingly cheap. At times, that damage engine can just feel like a gimick you get brief glimpses of, as some areas make very sparing use of it, so the game falls back on raw gameplay for enjoyment.\n\nWhich brings me to the biggest problem I have with this game. The levels feel very drawn out and artificially lengthened, and get tedious quickly. Especially as fighting enemies isn't particularly fun. The infantry type enemies don't pose any real threat, leaving you only with the choice of which force power or lightsaber combo to kill them with, coupled with how cruel your sense of humor is. The boss fights are more interesting, with moves like blocking suddenly becoming useful, but even those drag on enormously.\n\nOn top of that, there's a few issues with the PC version. It's locked to 30fps and the lack of detail leaves a lot of the game looking rather bleak and apocalyptic in ways it's clearly not supposed to.","February 26, 2014","false","4.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The storyline is trash, the voice actors are all incredibly annoying, and the camera angles are something straight out of the third circle of hell. Then theres the god aweful targeting system. Unless what your trying to electrocute is right in front of you, dont expect your character to pay much attention to what your aiming for. all of the movements in this game seem very slow, and it's at the point that the ai seem to fall over just trying to walk that you wonder if they copied the movements of a toddler learning to walk. Occasionally there is supposed to be sound, but it seems like the developers over looked that part. sure, it's not the biggest deal breaker, but if you're already flat out heated about something, it'll make you question the drugs you were on when you purchased this utter trash. If you have a high sensitivity mouse such as a corsair rgb or a deathadder, be prepaired to lower your dpi to its lowest levels. This is due to the stupid camera that occasionaly likes to hyper look ion the wrongest angle possible. Getting back to gameplay, if your character takes even the slightest hit, he will freeze, put up his hands and write ''shoot me, I'm open" on his chest. he will do NOTHING to attempt to save himself, but crawl shakily to his knees.

I carried on with the game until I got to this impossible mission where you have have to bring down a star destroyer and gave up. The game tells you to press the the buttons which i do but it's too slow too bring down then the tie fighters start shooting at you so you have to release and is on an endless cycle! I searched this and am not the only only one with this problem. I also noticed some annoying audio glitches where some sound just cuts out.","April 14","false","13.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

However, the PC port is literally just a data-dump from a blu-ray disc.  The installation is 30 gigabytes.  Yes, you read that correctly.  The game is also not optimized for keyboard use whatsoever, so I recommend plugging in an Xbox 360 controller.  If you have the patience for the insane install size and the practically mandatory controller requirement, Force Unleashed is a pretty damn solid combo-based hack-n-slash RPG.  The extra content in the Sith Edition is cool too, mainly because you can MURDER LUKE SKYWALKER.","December 30, 2012","true","19.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There are a TON of bugs and glitches, the enemy attacks don't always work, the AI is insanely aggressive and blocking is pointless.

Now do not get me wrong, force unleashed 1 and 2 are great games and you need to play them. But, unfortunatly my gameplay ends here. Loved the game through my playthrough and will indeed play it again, solid combat, cool takedowns and an awsome story. But it is one mission.... that ends it. The f'in... star destoyer level. I dont like using guides ecpessially for games like this so i make my way through by myself and dont use any hints to what i do. Any of you could say "look up a guide" but its not the fact that i dont like the mission... its the fact they put it in, i know alot of people who stopped playing force unleashed because of the level. bassically you are supposed to bring down an impirial star destroyer using the force, sounds cool, whats the issue? Well my friend... its the COMPLETE ANNOYENCE THAT IS THE TIE FIGHTERS ATTACK RUN. First off, bringing down the destroyer is bad enough. It takes around 5 minutes to get it into place.... and then you are hit with tie fighters again and again reverting the star destroyer to its orignal postition. of coarse i love this game and played it again and again on ps3 and still love it to this day... one day ill finish this level but it needs patience and accuracy, brining down the tie fighters is a pain in the ♥♥♥ itself but they spawn so frequently that its just repetitive and annoying. You wont neccercerily die alot... its just the fact that your stuck there and cant continue that i cant stand. Please get the game and i hope you like it as much as i do... but this mission is just... no. If you are turned away by the mission play a breif portion of it as i do garentee you will like it in some way shape or form its just...

It's a typical american vainilla game, just that features a jedi. It could be batman, or any other thing. You will have your robot enemies, flying enemies, exploding enemies, bosses, crappy "puzzles" to solve, you will have to jump over platforms, and collect boosters like invencibility, damage booster and that sort of things... Really disappointing since I'm quite fan of Star Wars.\n\nIn adition it doesn't feel any like you are beeing an actual jedi (or sith). If you want to feel so, buy instead another game, Jedi Academy, which is older:\n\nThe good part is the art design and the cool graphics. Nevertheless, you won't feel like you weld a real lightsaber.

Combat itself is extremely enjoyable, coupled with leveling up in a sense to develop new skills.  The biggest disappointment is the lack of a true Good/Evil/Neutral system...the options are fairly obvious which would be fine for an older game, but just detracts from a game as new as this one.

If you are one of the unlucky ones who got it prior and payed more than 5 bucks you pretty much got ripped off.\n\nAt first I was really looking forward to playing this load of crap game, as I am kind of a Star Wars fan.\nBut already after the first hour into playing this, I already got extremely frustrated. Apart from several bugs concerning\nthe audio , which sometimes cuts out the music and some of the SFX during a mission and never comes back again ever, even after restarting the game and on several occasions happening\nthe cutscenes , as the game randomly crashes to desktiop after some and last but not least\nthe ragdoll system , which had me glitch out of bounds on two occasions, when a Purge Trooper grabbed me and slammed me not into, but through the ground below the world, where I was stuck, forcing me to quit and reload the save, because there is no "restart from last checkpoint"-optionthis game features some ♥♥♥♥ing infuriating gameplay-designchoices:\nThere are absolutely no invincibility frames. None. Meaning, when you get hit by an enemy attack, which leaves you stunned for a solid second, you will get hit again by another enemy within this peroid,without you being able to defend yourself at all. If you're unlucky, you will be combo'ed to death several times when you face more than one or two enemies at once.\n\nMany attacks by the bigger enemies you will encounter, like Rancors, are unblockable. They mostly cannot be interrupted and are really nearly impossible to avoid when you go at them with your lightsaber, leaving you often times with cheesing the fights and abusing the poor AI to get them stuck on terrain and Force-Lightning the ♥♥♥♥ out of them over and over again, as your only option to carry on with your sanity intact.\n\nAll of the boss battles feel really unpolished and imbalanced. There is little feedback on how strong your opponent really is and especially on the later bossfights, you will be twoshot by an unblockable counterattack. Not to mention the incredibly stupid "bossfight" against the  Stardestroyer which you have to pull down from orbit singlehandedly with the force  in a ridiculous minigame in which you have arrange the analog sticks as shown on screen. Not only is this as silly as it sounds, they also give you the wrong directions, so you have to try around for at least 30 minutes to find the right spot to finish this ♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nNeedless to say that these design flaws don't add to the enjoyment you will get out of this game, as it just feels clunky, unfinished, unresponsive and poorly playtested (if at all).\n\nFurthermore we have another great example of a crappy PC port. There are basically no graphic options and the game is locked at 30fps, it does feature mouse and keyboard control, but you have to edit the keys in a seperate launcher.\n\nThe only reason I finished this, was my interest in the  story, although it wasn't particulary well written and the hope, that I will get some sort of satisfaction out of it, without having thrown away 10+ hours of my life.\n\nTL;DR: Crappy port, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of aggravating bugs, infuriating combat mechanics, okay-ish story with flat characters. 2/10 would not play again.","February 11, 2015","false","9.7"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","46","17","37","6","3"

It feels like it was developed by howler monkeys, with no hands and typewriters.\n\nAlso: pressing start to skip a cutscene minimises the game and returns to your Desktop and upon opening causes a multitude of bugs including text crawls being buggy as-well as varying audio and graphical glitches.\n\nIn light Force Unleased as a game it's OK. Nothing really special, has a nice physics engine. (Which Lucasarts spent heavy time marketing it)  but aside from that. Character animations are meh, animations are stiff and robotic, etc,etc.\n\nI do like the extra content such as the added campaigns though.\n\nHowever, as a PC gamer. I can't recommend this ever.

I just about had an aneurysm out of sheer rage while trying to finish a level I gave up on before. Lemme put things in a list.\n\nStory: Well, it's not terrible. I've seen worse writing plenty of times. It just isn't very grabbing to me. Don't take my opinion on this, though; I've never put much thought into the backstory of the Star Wars franchise.\n\nWorld Design/Graphics: About what I expected. Looks like a Star Wars game. Some of the expressions and character models look like they were made in Garry's Mod, but it's bearable.\n\nPhysics: RUN. RUN FAR AWAY. The physics engine in this game is just god-awful. Platforming is a pain; accurately judging a jump is like trying to throw a ball whose density is constantly fluctuating. Some of the terrain is horridly rough, with smooth ground being un-walkable in random spots. Of course, none of this helps while fighting. And speaking of that...\n\nCombat: The control scheme for fighting isn't too bad. Basic combat maneuvers, such as jumping, slashing, lighting, and dodging are all on natural-feeling buttons. The AI, however, is an absolute NIGHTMARE. Enemies will constantly gang up on you, slapping you around like a pinball in combos that are infuriatingly hard to get out of: blocking and dashing while being hit are impossible. And when the guys right next to you aren't hitting you, the ones halfway across the map are picking you off with impossibly accurate potshots that must be either swatted away by the auto-deflect feature (which has about a 2% success rate) or deflected manually by holding the block button, meaning you can't do ANYTHING ELSE. Which leads to you getting beat over the skull by all those guys right next to you. Crowd control is unlocked about halfway through the game, and DUMPS your force energy gauge. No spamming the "Get away from me!" button.\n\n\nMy reccommendation: Steer clear of this game. It's not worth the pain and suffering.","February 4, 2015","false","3.8"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","12","27","2","2"

I'm sure the game was kind of great for consoles (mostly Xbox) but this pc "port" is an insult, an INSULT, pure and simple.\n\nList of offenses against pc gamers: a motion blur glitch which ruins the backdrops and severely affects gameplay in medium-hard difficulties (currently unfixable for many graphic cards), the random crash to desktop (fortunately not that common), lack of configuration options other than resolution (yes, believe it or not it's true), pause menu straight from the xbox (doesn't support mouse), limited save options (you only have ONE save file for EVERY walkthrough you may attempt, that means you won't be able to randomly replay your favourite levels once you've finished the game), 29 GB (!!!!)  for a 07-08 game that, if properly optimized, shouldn't have been more than 11; LACK of DLC for the pc version; the list goes on and on...\n\nand last but not least: shame on you Steam, this pc port isn't even worth 5 bucks, and you know it\n\nlol, do you still want to purchase, install and play this game?? you've been warned\n\nthe game itself (the console version, I mean) is ok (6,5/10, maybe a 7): serviceable hack-n-slash, varied force-powers that, once mastered, are truly helpful, nice sound design, etc. The levels usually overstay their welcome, though. The story starts very strong but nearly collapses with a twist that is forced and makes you feel confused and full of questions...the story tries TOO HARD to be relevant to the events of the New Hope (yes, it smells of rotten retcon)...\n\nMy advice= buy this on a sale and go for a quick "easy level" walkthrough, because what the hell, it's Star Wars; and then stick with Jedi Outcast/Academy and all those solid gold mods out there. Of course, if you own an Xbox by all means, IGNORE the pc port and buy the proper console version if you really need to play this game.\n\nRIP LucasArts, indeed","May 13, 2014","false","4.1"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","1"

The game sticks to the Star Wars universe’s famous lack of health and safety regulations, so any false step will send you plummeting down a chasm. The camera is less than helpful here and there’s an obscene number of invisible walls placed seemingly at random (jumping towards a bridge, hitting an invisible wall mid-air and sliding down into the mouth of Sarlacc was a particularly ignoble end).\n\nThe story is nonsense with a painfully bland protagonist. You are meant to be uber powerful but even your force powers are unsatisfying to use, when using force grip it feels like you are wobbling an object in to place rather than showing any mastery. The only time you actually do something impressing is in the numerous quick time sequences with pop up to disrupt any sort of flow in the game.\n\nOh and that Star Destroyer sequence from the trailer.. it’s one of the most of the most painfully terrible bits of gameplay I’ve experienced.\n","April 5, 2015","false","8.0"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/recommended/32430/","thelonesoldier","Cyrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/","188 products in account","The Force Unleashed is a game where you take... hold, on, let me start over, I've already ♥♥♥♥ed this up and called it a game. The Force Unleashed is a franchise-themed BDSM simulator where you play the part of a hapless consumer who pays a monolithic giant to hold you down against the floor and violate you repeatedly.\n\nThe Force Unleashed is a great example of what happens when none of the developers communicate in any way. First you have the nerdy tech people like myself who start drooling in their trousers when they think of all of the things you could do with a physics-heavy engine designed around the use of Force powers. They brought ground-breaking technology like Digital Molecular Matter, which allows materials like metal or wood to deform or shatter in dynamic, realistic ways when you do something like Force-push them or slam a stormtrooper into them, or Euphoria, an AI engine which allows those stormtroopers to reach out and grab on to nearby objects in a vain attempt to stop you from flinging them around like a screaming hackey-sack. Unfortunately, the tech people never communicated with the rest of the team, so their fancy tech doesn't really get used at all and the engine is essentially wasted. The tech people also didn't communicate with REALITY, and actually told the general public that the game would only be released on consoles because PCs weren't powerful enough to handle their physics engine. Somehow this didn't stop them from releasing the game on the Wii.\n\nNext are the level designers, who were busy constructing their linear set pieces. Apparently they were too caught up trying to make outdoor environments feel like narrow hallways to speak with the tech team, and didn't even find out about the fancy Digital Molecular Matter system until just before release, the result being that there is about one conspicuously-placed object that actually uses the system in each level. We can also see that the level designers didn't actually watch the films, because in The Force Unleashed the Death Star consists entirely of an interlocking grid of gigantic hangar bays.\n\nThe gameplay designers were apparently never told that they were working on a Star Wars property at all, and so they worked from the offset under the model that every enemy should have exactly one weakness, and that each enemy should have a different weakness, apparently not knowing that your character is always holding a ♥♥♥♥ING LIGHTSABER.\n\nLet's look at this lightsaber issue further. One of the core game design problems faced by every team designing a Star Wars game that includes lightsabers is that the lightsaber quite obviously should be a one-hit kill weapon, but unlimited-use one-hit kill weapons don't usually make for the best game design. Therefore, the designers always have to find some way not to let lightsabers effortlessly carve through all opposition, either by encouraging ranged combat or by limiting the damage of lightsabers for gameplay purposes.\n\nTFU, however, is set between the three Star Wars films and George Lucas's parody prequels; we see claerly in the films that no one has lightsaber-proof armor. In TFU, every later enemy has a sword or shield or armor that is completely 100% lightsaber-proof. In TFU the only difference between a lightsaber and a pointy stick is that a stick doesn't require batteries. Well, I suppose there is also the fact that a lightsaber never gets dull; I wish I could say the same of the gameplay.\n\nIt's ironic that in a game where it seems that 100% of the effort went into graphics and gameplay, the gameplay is really quite terrible. As previously mentioned, the lightsaber is really quite useless and you are only able to kill enemies with Force powers. While this doesn't sound bad on paper, in reality each enemy is only weak to exactly one thing, and so for the most part combat alternates between guessing which power is going to kill a new type of enemy, and long sections of fighting that same type of enemy over and over and over in the same exact way. Wait a minute, I thought this game was supposed to encourage creativity?\n\nThe only enemies you are given true freedom against are the hapless standard stormtroopers, who fart their blasters ineffectually at you until you go barelling through them or pick them up with Force grip and bash them around a bit. Since the basic stormtrooper is the only opportunity you have to really have fun with grip and push, they are actually given quite a lot of durability, so you can sadistically bash them back and forth between two walls like a future serial killer swinging a squirrel between two trees by the tail. This is fun at first, but if you aren't actually a future serial killer, after a while you actually start to feel bad for the poor stormtrooper who was just doing his job until you decided to smack him around like an unwanted baby at a post-delivery abortion clinic.\n\nOf course, making you scream in rage at all of the enemies who are immune to ♥♥♥♥ING LIGHTSABERS wasn't sufficiently sadistic for these developers. As the game goes on, you start running into more and more enemies whose primary weapon is a homing blast that knocks you over, and whose rate of fire is exactly equal to the amount of time it takes you to stand back up. By the Death Star, when you are fighting gigantic killer robots and stormtroopers with cloaking devices who all somehow disappeared from the Empire's arsenal before A New Hope, you will be facing thirty enemies at once who all have a homing missile that knocks you down for exactly the length of time it takes to fire another homing missile, and you'll start to feel like the cheerleader who told the entire football team to have their way with her at once. The game turns into a screaming ragefest of dodging around endless hanger bays killing a single stormtrooper every thirty seconds when you happen to have the luck to land directly behind him between jumps, until by the end of the nightmarish ordeal you are a heavy drinker and need 5 years of therapy.\n\nIf you aren't convinced that the "game" design is balanced around sado-masochism, consider this: if you die, you retain any experience and abilities that you gained before you died, despite being taken to the last checkpoint. The game is actually designed so you can grind through the torturous end sequences by dying over and over.\n\nWhen the developers realized that gaming PCs are in fact much more powerful than an XBox 360, they released a 30-gigabyte version of TFU for Windows. If you happen to like to customize your games and are fool enough to change any of your keyboard controls, you will be enraged at the boss-fights (which consist entirely of quick-time button sequences like some strange combat-themed DDR) because the keys they tell you to press on-screen are the original keys, not whatever you rebound your controls to. Maybe the screen is telling you to press WQAD and you actually have to press EWSF. I emailed the company about this and they actually told me the onscreen controls were all hardcoded and to consider using the default controls. Well, you gigantic ♥♥♥♥♥♥, if you didn't actually want me to be able to change my controls, you could have done the sensible thing and not let me change my ♥♥♥♥ing controls. Instead, each boss fight for me became a repetetive pattern of reaching a quick-time button sequence, writing down what keys it said to press, translating those keys to my actual controls, memorizing what I really needed to press, and then beating that sequence and making it to the next sequence to start all over again. Wait a minute, does that sound familiar? Now I'm just studying for a test. If I wanted to study for a ♥♥♥♥ing test, I'd be at school instead of trying to squeeze two seconds of fun out of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game.\n\nThe only saving grace for The Force Unleashed is that it is only a few hours long and thus won't waste as much of your life as the prequels did","September 20, 2015","false","17.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","4"

Spoend your time and money on a cheap excellent indie game like Invisible Inc. Don;t waste your time on this game, go play something else.\n\n* Combat is repetitive, just hack and slash.\n* No skill required in combat.\n* No story,\n* No character progression.\n* No loot to collect.\n* No weapons dropped by enemies.\n* No weapon pickups.\n* No loot in destroud boxes or objects.\n* Linear path, just follow the dot, no alternative routes.\n* Console port with no PC specific additions. Framerate loecked at 30 frmaes per second (fps) is a disgrace to PC gamers.\n* No tradeables with other NPCs.\n* Pre-rendered video, Full motion video cut-scenes.\n* Bland levels with lots of brown, dark brown and dark colors.\n* Repetitive scenery.\n*(Enemy) difficulty increases by increasing the number of enemies.\n* Enemies rush up to you and all you have to do is cut  'em down.\n* No skill based combat. If your upgrade for 'skill points' was not right you'll take much longer to defeat an enemy, whereas with a game for example Metal Gear Revengeance one could defeat an enemy on skill.\n* It is totally possible to speed run through whole sections/levels, avoiding combat.\n* Gfx is horrible console ported, even for 2008 standard. A digrace to PC gamers.\n* Plays like an arcade coin-up game, but the endless version.\n* DirectX9 game not compatible with my LG 3D displays.\n* Horrible framerate, only 30 fps. According to Steam forumsa this was how the game was designed to run, framerate locked.\n* Played with a wireless XBOX360 controller on PC.\n\nDon't waste your time on this, go play something else. I have invested a lot of my precious time in this game. I knew I shoul've played Invisble Inc, or Endless Legend or  Withcher 3 instead... but now I'm this far I might as well finish this.","December 4, 2015","false","11.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I played this game on the PS3 and Wii. If you have a console, buy it on the console (even on the Wii it's a lot more fun). This is a terrible port to the PC and I'm very very disappointed.\nCons:\n-Locked on 30fps\n-Loading screen for everything\n-Loading takes a long time\n-Only singleplayer (on console there was a fighting mode)\n-Feels choppy due to the frame limit\n-Shift + TAB Steam overlay glitches during cutscenes\n-Very boring when playing with Keyboard and Mouse\n-Repetitive\n-Awkward Camera position during boss fights\n-Background graphics look like crap\n-Why can't i play as Juno Eclipse?\n\nPros (as experienced from this PC version only)\n-Not so awful visuals for a third person game\n-Decent physics\n-Good storyline\n-Good character development and amount of characters\n-Cheat codes\n-A lot of costumes\n-A lot of force combos\n-Many different map design and you go on a lot of different planets\n\nOverall this game is not so great on the PC. You can play with a controller, but still, you're playing with 30 fps so why not play this on console instead. Besides, you can go to gamestop, get a $5 pre-owned Force Unleashed instead. If you don't own a console and you want this game, just don't get it at full price. I got mine for $6.60 instead of $20. If you think youre computer can't even play this game above 25 fps, then I guess it's ok. But I built a gaming PC just so I can play a crap port on 30 fps.","May 5, 2014","false","117.8"," 16 of 36 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","16","36","0","11"

It's the story, and this one is crap due to that.\nThe story so linear and following a scripted line even Dynasty Warrior have better story than this.\n\nAnd please, don't let me mention about the bad port to PC. It's really a disgrace for us, PC gamers.\ncapped at 30 fps, ♥♥♥♥ing 30gigs in size but jagged texture and bad character models.\nCompared to the game released that year;take a peek on Prototype; It's just a letdown..\n\nNo, buy this at your console PS3 or Wii, or don't buy it at all, you'll not regret it tho.\n6/10 SWTFU : Loading Simulator.\n\n\n\nedit (after finishing the whole story)\n- It's still a no, but not a big no, it's just.. the story is great but it's so so compared even to SW animation series. It's like there's a big hole in the story.. if you finished you'll be getting what I mean, if you're not bored to death beforehand.\n\n- The idea of "finishing blow" is good, but it's just become a standar QTE because it's so repetitive and have a little variation. And for the big boss it's just a single variation for finishing blow.\n\n- We like lightsabers, we love to have all colorful gems and crystal in it. but.. can we have another type instead the standart like the one in the movie ep 4-6...\nhey but, if I can use a short-bladed lightsaber, or a longer one lightsaber, or! the one like a police baton just like one of the boss in game.

The lack of control while in combat is atrocious. I can't aim and even when surrounded by enemies, frequently attacks will "miss" even if force attacks like lightning are literally surrounding them. Since you aren't totally in control of aiming, targeting objects and enemies can be rather ineffective and ruins the whole purpose of having awesome force powers. There is a loading screen every time you view an option or abilities screen, and when you go back even if you aren't changing anything. Also if you are in the middle of an attack or if your enemy in attacking you or you are getting up from being knocked down and also sometimes while in the air, control is taken from you and you can't move or attack. This leaves you open to getting killed quickly even from full health in a few seconds. Example: You get knocked down and as you get up, you can't move, before control is given back to you allowing you to dodge, you are knocked down again, and again until you are dead and you have no chance to move or defend yourself, and if you do, the attack might miss or go through your enemy anyways and you get knocked down. I don't even feel like I am even playing most of the time. And the there are the issues of poorly programed platforms you are supposed to stand on and the game decides your character can't stand on the bridge you need to use to go forwards and you slide of to your death making you have to do the whole area again. This is such an insanely awful game. The story isn't even all that great, in my opinion, either and I love Star Wars. The second game was much better, I finished that one. The story still kinda sucked though and some of the voice acting is not that great, especially general kota. It will sound like he is asking a question when making a statement. I am glad this came in a bundle of other games I much enjoy or I would be upset I paid for this.","October 24, 2014","false","19.8"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

The lightsaber use and combo is reminiscent of the aforementioned games, but there's a few new bits that are truly great. I personally love this game, because I enjoy crushing storm troopers against the wall, or smashing the airlock and watching rebels get sucked out. It is, however, incredibly repetitive, and the novelty gets old. I pushed through the glitchy physics, the ugly levels and the poor performance because the AI was very responsive and fun to destroy, and the force powers were just fun to use. The levels are very linear, however, and the port is very poor. The camera controls poorly, and the control scheme is terrible (but if you change it, the QTE prompts don't change). Overall, it felt like a quick cash-in (even though it wasn't), but was still enjoyable FOR ME, because I love this crap. Not everyone does.","December 29, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(And a pain to navigate)\n\nThe game CAN get enjoyable at some parts, but most of the time it feels tiresome to play it.

Just about to kill a boss in your last breath, but only manage to die and start it almost all over again.\nBosses are a spam to play, sometimes even outright annoying with the limited saving capabilities you have, and are sometimes even unfair.

You can only hit the boss once per combo, while the boss can punch through your defences and ruthlessy spam it)\n\nIf you like QTE's you might actually like this one a lot.\n\nTL;DR Game portrays you as a powerful jedi and falls on spam tactics and QTEs.","February 9, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loaded this up set it to full hd 1080p graphics are all set to the max, xbox 360 controller supported sat back and played away like a good little Jedi. The game ran perfectly with no major issues at all nothing game breaking, maybe a few random bad bits of level design but nothing that can't be avoided in the first place. The combat was good, a little stiff and sometimes sluggish especially when standing back up after being knocked down and then getting knocked down straight away and to have that repeat 3 or 4 times is very annoying, but not game breaking.\n\nI had an issue on the last level of the game where my sound was missing i could hear slight lightsabre effects but everything else was missing, but this was cured when i downloaded the fixed files from the forum and took seconds to do and was easy to do.\n\nThe game itself is alright nothing spectacular it reminded me of Devil May Cry meets Star Wars, its a lot of hack and slash but with force powers and cool lightsabres. You dont use any pistols or ranged weapons other than force powers and throwing of the lightsabre, so dont expect to use rifles etc because you cant. There is a basic but effective leveling up system for your character and the force powers, you can also collect crystals for your sabre to change colour and to add perks to your weapon. These can be found through the levels and by completing various challenged throughout the game.\n\nThe game can be frustrating and sometimes lacks proper intruction but nothing major i found and completed all objectives/side missions and enjoyed doing so. One thing I would recommend is that you take breaks when playing this game i spanned it over 3 nights playing for a couple of hours at a time. I did that because its repetetive the same enemies over and over some with added powers/abilities and the odd mini boss before the inevitable end level boss.\n\nThat brings me onto the next point i had, Bosses, they didnt seem very tough at all, in fact i found the mini-boss battles with the AT-ST and others that wont be mentioned were a lot tougher at points during the game. The bosses seemed to be over in a few minutes and a lot of them were defeated the exact same way as the previous one but because they were so short i wasnt too fussed.\n\nNow the music, the music. What can i say we all know what the Soundtrack to anything Star Wars is gonna sound like and this game does not fail in providing us with the well known star wars classics. They really do make the game feel more epic than it actually is, i was enjoying my lightsabre massacre with the epic star was soundtrack playing in tempo to the slaying of many, many clone troopers. I would say the soundtrack alone made me enjoy this game more than i should of.\n\nGraphics - I was running it in 1080p as stated earlier with everything set the to max. It ran perfectly not graphical issues at all it looks quite nice for an old'ish game. The only issue i had was the terrible camera angles in various parts of the game but once again not game breaking.\n\nOverall -  There is little in the way of storyline to keep you going it was ok the cutscenes were great, music spot on, graphics were good for the age of the game, QTE was a little annoying with little time to react to some. The only issue i had was with the sound glitching out on the last level but i fixed that so overall i give this game  7/10, could be better but could also be a lot worse, if you are a Star Wars fan and you also like Devil May Cry hack and slash action then this might be the game for you, just dont expect next gen gaming physics or graphics, but what you do get is a few hours of fun.\n\n","February 9, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Force Unleashed takes place between episodes III and IV, following Vader's secret apprentice, "Starkiller."\n\nHaving played this game on the PSP, I was dissapointed by the console version. The PS3/360 version of the game had many parts cut out, severly shortening the game. So far as I can tell, the content in the PC and PSP versions is roughly the same.\n\nThe only issue I have encountered so far is distant objects and the environmental backdrop. Distant object simply do not appear, making it difficult to prepare for large fights or see where you're going. The environmental backdrop looks like a shmere of color, fanning out in a strange pattern any time something passes- such as a star fighter or debris falling from the sky. While this issues cause some minor difficulty, the game still runs perfectly fine, meaning only some of the visuals are effected.\n\nBonus campaigns, skins, abilities, and lightsabers are also available. Even with the visually unappealing graphics bugs, this game is still worth a play!\n\nEdit: This game just lost some major points with me because 1) there are still parts of the game missing- the PSP version has much more content- and 2) the Star Destroyer scene- everyone who has played knows how *****ing impossible that can seem- is pretty much unbeatable if you have the same graphics glitch I do. I litterally cannot see the Tie fighters as they fly in, and the Star Destroyer is marked only by three large glowing exhauses from its engines. Now, in the PSP version I can pull this thing down in no time because I CAN SEE IT. Here, I have no clue what the angle of the ship is, so I can't make the proper adjustments, and we all know who faulty the on-screen button display is.\n\n8.5/10 for PSP\n6/10 for PC because of graphics issues","December 26, 2013","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutly loved both games to death! I walked into this game expecting it to be of a similiar gameplay type. Unfortunatly, it was much different than I expected. The gameplay felt really unnatural. maybe it was the way the camera moved, but the way the main character jumped felt really weird. The overall mechanics of the game were really distracting to the badassness of the level design. The level design, (general atmosphere) was wonderful! But the gameplay was very painful. I havne't yet completeed the game. It feels more like a bad movie than an active adventure through the star wars universe. It was a valid attempt at make a star wars franchise game.

The game really shows how badass jedi/sith can be, and is great for stress relief.\n\nMy only two complaints are that (1) the game can be difficult to control in combat (you feel knockback way more than some enemies, and can easily get stun locked at times), and (2) the DLC (included in teh Ultimate Sith Edition) feels very separate from the game itself.  The DLC isn't added into the game itself, to allow you to continue levelling up and such in new missions, but instead are three new options when you start a new game, providing you a pre-levelled character to use.\n\nOverall, though, it's a great game, and definitely one I'd recommend to all Star Wars fans.\n\n(PS, if my low game time seems suspicious, it's because I put most of my time into this game on my console, and only recently purchased it for Steam)","August 25, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is the worst console port I have ever experienced.  First of all, play with a mouse and keyboard is fairly awful in many main battle scenes.  It asks you to press some random buttons at certain moments that not only ruin the experience but are very difficult to do without a game controller.\n\nBut the main killer are the boss battles that are played with a fixed camera position.  I thought the "side-scrolling" sections of the Arkham games were bad....this is a nightmare!  Now all 360 degrees of movement rely on the keyboard (mouse is useless for direction here) and while you are struggling to aim your attacks in the right direction, you are getting your butt kicked at the same time.  After the third one of these, I uninstalled the game.\n\nOh and btw-- this game takes up an impossible 29 gigs of hard drive space!!!

Gameplay is serviceable, although the boss fights are a glitchy mess.

Buttons wont work half the time and sometimes my character will stop moving. I cant look at how to do combos because of course the button doesnt work. I have no idea what made the developers think that they could release a game with this many problems. And dont even get me started on the Mission where you have to pull the starship into the ground. I got so sick of aligning the ship so I could pull it down just when the next wave of tie fighters came. And then eventually it stopped guiding my alignment and it said that I was always wrong no matter what I did. In short, this game does have a lot of potential. It just seems like it was rushed and thing were not thought through very well at all.","April 9, 2015","false","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Can this game be fun? Yes. Will it be frustrating? YES. Would you be missing out if you never played it? Probably not.\n\nThere's something enjoyable about this game and getting to use force powers in an excessive way. I enjoyed it on my Wii and I'm enjoying it now.\n\nHowever, this game is not a very well made game. Level design is not good, enemies are either too easy or stunlock you until you die, checkpoints are not close enough together and you will ALWAYS be fighting the camera. I probably wouldn't play this without a USB gamepad. The controls are not tight at all and it's hard to get your character to do what you want him to do. You will fall off of edges a lot because the platforming is terrible. There are QTEs at the end of boss fights.\n\nPersonally, this game feels like it has a spectacle-fighter sort of vibe. Except, it lacks almost everything that makes a spectacle fighter good. If done correctly, this game could have been amazing.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good (aside from the cutscenes). But honestly, nothing dates this game more than its terrible control and camera issues.\n\nOverall, I think the game is fun, despite its shortcomings. I would probably only get this game at a heavily discounted price though. This is a bargin-bin game (which is where I bought my Wii version). It is good fun for that kind of game. But I find myself setting the game down at least once every 30 minutes because of how frustrating it can be. Unlike something like Dark Souls, this game controls so sloppily that you do not blame yourself, you blame this poorly made game.","April 9, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And knockback, don't even get me started on knockback. Very little time spent in between levels; you grind your way through a linear level, kill the boss, watch a brief cutscene and are immediately dropped into the next mission. Story is mediocre, visuals are pretty good by 2009 standards, but the textures can be pretty ugly at times. Almost too much of a reliance on mattes makes anything not in your immediate vicinity look flat and motionless. One of the better looking Star Wars games out there, though, but it's also one of the only recent ones.\n\nIf you're a really big Star Wars fan, grab it during the summer sale.

Enemies can stun lock you by giving you a stern look, while multiple slashes with hot plasma and force attacks that could move a battleship do nothing to any foe stronger than the basic trooper. Dodgy keyboard controls add to the poor design choices, if you do play this game then a controller is highly suggested.\n\nWhat finally did it in for me was the final battle.

I never understood the negative reviews and arbitrary hate this game recieved. That said, the PC, specifically the STEAM version has some pretty negative points that you may overlook, but I find pretty disheartening.\n\nFirst off, 2 levels lose their audio partially. All you can hear is your lightasber, powers, sometimes music and stormtrooper screams as you cut them donwn. The issue is within the files downloaded from the Steam server, as retail disc versions do not have this issue. It's been 6 years since release and no official fix has been presented. You have to replace the faulty files yourself from whichever source you can get.\n\nAside from that, and I'm sure other reviews cover this, there's the issue with the visuals. The extent of graphics customization is limited to resolution and a check box for high detail, that's it.\n\nIf you want to enjoy the gameplay, an Xbox 360 controller is a must-have. Mouse and keyboard is very clunky and I am not aware if there is any other third party gamepad support.\n\nAs for the core game, it is fairly entertaining and challenging at parts. It does suffer from invincibility frames, enemies pulling off attacks that you cannot block and sometimes not even evade.\n\nAll in all, it is playable and a very decent game, but the technical issues are not warranted for something you paid for.","May 26, 2014","false","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game really shows how badass jedi/sith can be, and is great for stress relief.\n\nMy only two complaints are that (1) the game can be difficult to control in combat (you feel knockback way more than some enemies, and can easily get stun locked at times), and (2) the DLC (included in teh Ultimate Sith Edition) feels very separate from the game itself.  The DLC isn't added into the game itself, to allow you to continue levelling up and such in new missions, but instead are three new options when you start a new game, providing you a pre-levelled character to use.\n\nOverall, though, it's a great game, and definitely one I'd recommend to all Star Wars fans.\n\n(PS, if my low game time seems suspicious, it's because I put most of my time into this game on my console, and only recently purchased it for Steam)","August 25, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's monotonous, linear and after a while a tedious chore. The bossfights are outright idiotic -- suddenly, you no longer play a 3d person shooter but an isometric hack&slash with quick-time events to finish the boss. If you customized your key controls, the game still instructs you to press the default keys which is frustratingly confusing. And, as it goes with quick-time events, you get to watch a scripted sequence with occasional keypress which steals the rewarding feel of defeating the opponent all by yourself.\nThe story is nice but all characters have dead eyes so there's less life in them than in Jedi Outcast or Jedi Academy. Also, Vader's got different voice actor.\nI wanted badly the negative reviews not to be true but they are.

Can this game be fun? Yes. Will it be frustrating? YES. Would you be missing out if you never played it? Probably not.\n\nThere's something enjoyable about this game and getting to use force powers in an excessive way. I enjoyed it on my Wii and I'm enjoying it now.\n\nHowever, this game is not a very well made game. Level design is not good, enemies are either too easy or stunlock you until you die, checkpoints are not close enough together and you will ALWAYS be fighting the camera. I probably wouldn't play this without a USB gamepad. The controls are not tight at all and it's hard to get your character to do what you want him to do. You will fall off of edges a lot because the platforming is terrible. There are QTEs at the end of boss fights.\n\nPersonally, this game feels like it has a spectacle-fighter sort of vibe. Except, it lacks almost everything that makes a spectacle fighter good. If done correctly, this game could have been amazing.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good (aside from the cutscenes). But honestly, nothing dates this game more than its terrible control and camera issues.\n\nOverall, I think the game is fun, despite its shortcomings. I would probably only get this game at a heavily discounted price though. This is a bargin-bin game (which is where I bought my Wii version). It is good fun for that kind of game. But I find myself setting the game down at least once every 30 minutes because of how frustrating it can be.

The story is told picking up from the end of Episode III and fills in some of the abyssmal gap between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy.\n\nSome fair plot twists and some darn good storytelling make this a game worth playing for any Star Wars fan. There are several familiar character cameos and some nice subtle tie in's from both trilogies. All of the characters are very well voice acted and the story elements provided me with the majority of the incentive to get through the title.\n\nLight Saber combat is fluid and fun against most of the weaker to medium foes. However, the larger enemies and boss encounters end up being an excersize in discovery and repetition. That is, you find the bosses weakness and continually exploit it until victory is achieved. I found myself spamming force lighting for most of the game to this effect.\n\nThe control scheme did not translate well to the mouse and keyboard. I would recommend a gamepad for this title. Either a 360 or PD3 controller should do the trick. Force Grip and throw seemed to be fairly useless for the most part as my inteded throw destination was often overwritten by a completely random direction. Similarly, in the boss fights the camera postioning becomes fixed and I often found myself tossing lightning around the arena rather than at my enemy.\n\nSome simple custimization options let the player make small changes in the protagonists appearance which is a nice touch.\n\nIn the end I would give Star Wars - The Force Unleashed a 6/10 for a casual non-star wars fan for the poor combat dynamics in the boss fights. I would award it with an 8/10 for a Star Wars Fan for a spectacular universe expanding story and tie in with some serviceable lightsaber combat.","May 2, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can choose from many "costumes" - play as a Luck Skywalker, Stormtrooper, or Qui-Gon Jinn.\n\nLevels are sworming with low-lifes just waiting to feel the power of the Dark Side. There is bonus for almost everything. You can grab some crate, or enemy and throw them in front of each other; you can use lightsaber combo with lightning in it, and finish it wiht force push, just to grab your pray and crush it into the ground.\n\nSome of the "world" parts are aslo avaible to grab and throw. Sometimes you have to bend objects with your power which is very cool. You can also use lightning to enable some devices.\n\nI like the way the "secrets" modify gameplay. If you find that special place, you also obtain holocrons. You can use them to modify your lighsaber, your force powers, combo technics or general skills.\n\nIn this version there are also 3 new scenarios (with new costumes). The Hoth, Jedi Temple and Tatooine.\nJedi Temple is beyond my skill right now, I'd get killed every single time after 2 min. They all are ok and fun to play.\n\nThere is also database - you can read about all equipment and objects used in the game. If you like star wars because of details, you'll find them.\n\nModels are done with great detail. My favorite for now is Darth Sion. I was very suprised when I've found out that you can choose dark lighsaber colour. It's almost like ancient saber used by leader of Death Watch.\n\nGame should be played with controler such as Xbox 360 for example.\n\nThere is only sigle player mode, and autosave after checkpoints.\n\nMay the Force be with you :)\n","May 3, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(And a pain to navigate)\n\nThe game CAN get enjoyable at some parts, but most of the time it feels tiresome to play it. The sore need for a save after a risky, long battle can get especially tiresome, since if you die after the battle, you will be spawned back to the last checkpoint.\n\nThis especially comes up when fighting bosses. Just about to kill a boss in your last breath, but only manage to die and start it almost all over again.\nBosses are a spam to play, sometimes even outright annoying with the limited saving capabilities you have, and are sometimes even unfair. (ex. You can only hit the boss once per combo, while the boss can punch through your defences and ruthlessy spam it)\n\nIf you like QTE's you might actually like this one a lot.\n\nTL;DR Game portrays you as a powerful jedi and falls on spam tactics and QTEs.","February 9, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loaded this up set it to full hd 1080p graphics are all set to the max, xbox 360 controller supported sat back and played away like a good little Jedi. The game ran perfectly with no major issues at all nothing game breaking, maybe a few random bad bits of level design but nothing that can't be avoided in the first place. The combat was good, a little stiff and sometimes sluggish especially when standing back up after being knocked down and then getting knocked down straight away and to have that repeat 3 or 4 times is very annoying, but not game breaking.\n\nI had an issue on the last level of the game where my sound was missing i could hear slight lightsabre effects but everything else was missing, but this was cured when i downloaded the fixed files from the forum and took seconds to do and was easy to do.\n\nThe game itself is alright nothing spectacular it reminded me of Devil May Cry meets Star Wars, its a lot of hack and slash but with force powers and cool lightsabres. You dont use any pistols or ranged weapons other than force powers and throwing of the lightsabre, so dont expect to use rifles etc because you cant. There is a basic but effective leveling up system for your character and the force powers, you can also collect crystals for your sabre to change colour and to add perks to your weapon. These can be found through the levels and by completing various challenged throughout the game.\n\nThe game can be frustrating and sometimes lacks proper intruction but nothing major i found and completed all objectives/side missions and enjoyed doing so. One thing I would recommend is that you take breaks when playing this game i spanned it over 3 nights playing for a couple of hours at a time. I did that because its repetetive the same enemies over and over some with added powers/abilities and the odd mini boss before the inevitable end level boss.\n\nThat brings me onto the next point i had, Bosses, they didnt seem very tough at all, in fact i found the mini-boss battles with the AT-ST and others that wont be mentioned were a lot tougher at points during the game. The bosses seemed to be over in a few minutes and a lot of them were defeated the exact same way as the previous one but because they were so short i wasnt too fussed.\n\nNow the music, the music. What can i say we all know what the Soundtrack to anything Star Wars is gonna sound like and this game does not fail in providing us with the well known star wars classics. They really do make the game feel more epic than it actually is, i was enjoying my lightsabre massacre with the epic star was soundtrack playing in tempo to the slaying of many, many clone troopers. I would say the soundtrack alone made me enjoy this game more than i should of.\n\nGraphics - I was running it in 1080p as stated earlier with everything set the to max. It ran perfectly not graphical issues at all it looks quite nice for an old'ish game. The only issue i had was the terrible camera angles in various parts of the game but once again not game breaking.\n\nOverall -  There is little in the way of storyline to keep you going it was ok the cutscenes were great, music spot on, graphics were good for the age of the game, QTE was a little annoying with little time to react to some. The only issue i had was with the sound glitching out on the last level but i fixed that so overall i give this game  7/10, could be better but could also be a lot worse, if you are a Star Wars fan and you also like Devil May Cry hack and slash action then this might be the game for you, just dont expect next gen gaming physics or graphics, but what you do get is a few hours of fun.\n\n","February 9, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I quite enjoyed the book, and eventually gave the game a try. It's been kind of a mess; I spent as much of the story as I could get through not understanding what in the heck was actually going on, the actual gameplay's a generic hack-and-slash, and the sheer number of graphical and gameplay glitches made it borderline unplayable, on a powerful Origin PC that was actually able to run Arkham Knight at launch. Pop-in is atrocious and constant, cutscenes flicker oddly, and the 30FPS limit still comes with occasional slowdown. All of this would be tolerable if there was enough game to really keep you hooked, but in my case, there isn't. In my time with the game, it randomly crashed mid-level without warning and without saving very, very often. It's rather generic. Save yourself the trouble; if you want the story, get the book, and if you want to play as Galen Marek, get SoulCalibur IV or LEGO Star Wars III, really.","November 20, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You end up throwing something in completely the wrong direction due to some sort of aim assist. You also have to lift up the mouse a lot when doing puzzles that require moving something with the force. The gimmick gets old after the first time you do it and would be better off if you only had to hold the button down.\n\nBoss battles against Jedi/Sith are grindy. Forcing you to unbalance the enemy, then spam damage while he's down. Repeat about 20 times till you get to a quicktime event. There's also a quicktime event where you hold down some buttons for 10 minutes to "force pull" something, with breaks that you have to force throw things to kill them. Remember how force throwing is a pain to use? You could also try to throw the enemies into each other, except you can't reach them unless they're right on top of you. Nevermind the fact that you are trying to force pull something miles away the entire time.\n\nThere is a freaking LOADING SCREEN to enter any submenu. Want to upgrade your powers? LOADING SCREEN. And the menues ignore the mouse cursor like a typical console port.\n\n[Spoilers ahead]\n\n...\n..\n.\n\nThe ending was lame.

This was somewhat irritating for ranged combat when i couldnt move and block when got a constant fire on me. (Minor issue that if timed right wasnt too bad,but still certainly took away from the smoothness of the game)\n\n\nBonus mission issues: With the mission where you go to the jedi temple for trials,just felt underdone. You kill a few enemies on the way there but thats about it,wasnt expecting a ton of things but it was literally just go here,lift it up,do the same thing on the other side and walk acrossed,just keep the ball on line and a fight where you literally just had to use a simple maneuver to break through his guard and push him off the edge repeatedly and your done.This area was included in the version i had played originally and included various boss fights and added to the story such as one took on the form of juno for parts of the fight which starkiller reacted to accordingly. The little ending video i will confess i thought was great though and added to the story in a positive way towards his reluctance to completely relinquish his ties to the dark side and fear that vader would always have a hold on him and served as a vision of sorts towards the dark side ending to the game itself. The Tatooine mission was alright though lacked a sense of story to it beyond just that basic stuff given away at the start of the mission,the inclusion of proxy was unnecessary and did not contribute anything to the story as it didnt tell you how he got there,it was interesting to fight Ben Kenobi though.But with the Boba Fett fight again it just felt very easy. Then there was the Hoth mission,which was nothing more then a follow up to the Tatooine mission,and like tatooine it served as a "what if" but beyond that added nothing,you fight luke but thats really about it. None of them contained any real sort of puzzles beyond just paying attention to the game.\n\nOther Issues: The biggest thing i noticed when comparing this to the game i had played years previous to this was the difference in customization. the positives to this ones was the many variations of armor appearences though most were other characters that anyone looking to play through on a more story based gamestyle likely wouldnt use,but had a few custom gears that were pretty cool. As for lightsaber customization it still had the power crystals though they didnt feel very diverse or add any effects visually to the saber (Minor issue) the color crystals i was pleased with but there really wasnt too much they could do to screw that up beyond a rainbow crystal (A part of me just died imagining that) Biggest issue with customization was the total lack of any sort of modification to the hilt whatsoever.\n\n\nOverall this really just wasnt worth buying unless you had never played the game before and just want to see what force unleashed is. The side missions did nothing for the story and were just a couple bonus fights that took very little time to complete with the exception of the temple mission which as i mentioned there was a more extensive version included in the regular force unleashed i bought years prior to playing the sith edition. lost hilt customization entirely but there is crystal customization. The combat was not something i enjoyed very much though could still complete my objective without much trouble. Boss fights were done pretty well,though sadly lost a few in this version for the main story. This did however feature several various types of storm troopers i did not see in the regular. The game is adequate at best in my opinion and for every gain with this i feel there the loss of something as well.","April 7, 2015","false","69.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

To the most part it IS fun, the first couple times it can be rewarding if you get a given combo right, but on the long run, it's pretty boring and let me tell you, the controls are CLUNKY.\n\nThe way they've decided to do the targeting feels absolutely horrible on PC. Get into the menus and you'll see why: this is a console port, and one of the worst kinds in that. Press [ and ] to change between menus? WHAT??\n\nAlso you'll notice that there's barely any graphics settings. Keep in mind, this game is fairly old, and not very demanding hardware-wise, but it still won't run over 30 FPS.\n\nThe game contains quite a few QTEs, which you either are or are not a fan of. I personally loathe them, some people probably like them, but it just slows the pace of the game down - and at some points, the controls are horrible, as mentioned in the next paragraph.\n\nI have not actually completed the game this time around. It wasn't because it was difficult or boring per se, but towards the end in a given mission a mini-game has taken me more than 45 minutes and I still couldn't finish it (not because I didn't know what or how to do, and not because I was playing on super-star-destroyer-sith-lord-grand-master difficulty either.) Wasting so much time on that one single mini-game I enraged so hard that I immediately hit the uninstall button and clicked the "write review" button.\n\nI did try to play the 2nd iteration of the game, only to find that it doesn't even start :)) It crashes instantly even before the lucasarts logo can finish its animation.\n\nGood thing I got these games dirt cheap in a Humble Bundle, otherwise I'd be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.","April 5, 2015","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is told picking up from the end of Episode III and fills in some of the abyssmal gap between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy.\n\nSome fair plot twists and some darn good storytelling make this a game worth playing for any Star Wars fan. There are several familiar character cameos and some nice subtle tie in's from both trilogies. All of the characters are very well voice acted and the story elements provided me with the majority of the incentive to get through the title.\n\nLight Saber combat is fluid and fun against most of the weaker to medium foes. However, the larger enemies and boss encounters end up being an excersize in discovery and repetition. That is, you find the bosses weakness and continually exploit it until victory is achieved. I found myself spamming force lighting for most of the game to this effect.\n\nThe control scheme did not translate well to the mouse and keyboard. I would recommend a gamepad for this title. Either a 360 or PD3 controller should do the trick. Force Grip and throw seemed to be fairly useless for the most part as my inteded throw destination was often overwritten by a completely random direction. Similarly, in the boss fights the camera postioning becomes fixed and I often found myself tossing lightning around the arena rather than at my enemy.\n\nSome simple custimization options let the player make small changes in the protagonists appearance which is a nice touch.\n\nIn the end I would give Star Wars - The Force Unleashed a 6/10 for a casual non-star wars fan for the poor combat dynamics in the boss fights. I would award it with an 8/10 for a Star Wars Fan for a spectacular universe expanding story and tie in with some serviceable lightsaber combat.","May 2, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do also like the choise u have of whether or not to kill Vader or fight the emporer at the end (sorry for any spoilers, if people care). But thats probly just part of the ultimate sith edition, which is why i was impressed by it, having  not played this version before. The only thing that I would complain about is the volume ratio of voices to action to cutscenes. The voices were pretty quiet, the action was louder, but when it came to the cutscenes, it was just blasting (and yes i did play around with my PC sound and the ig sound, so it's not just me).","July 10, 2015","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can choose from many "costumes" - play as a Luck Skywalker, Stormtrooper, or Qui-Gon Jinn.\n\nLevels are sworming with low-lifes just waiting to feel the power of the Dark Side. There is bonus for almost everything. You can grab some crate, or enemy and throw them in front of each other; you can use lightsaber combo with lightning in it, and finish it wiht force push, just to grab your pray and crush it into the ground.\n\nSome of the "world" parts are aslo avaible to grab and throw. Sometimes you have to bend objects with your power which is very cool. You can also use lightning to enable some devices.\n\nI like the way the "secrets" modify gameplay. If you find that special place, you also obtain holocrons. You can use them to modify your lighsaber, your force powers, combo technics or general skills.\n\nIn this version there are also 3 new scenarios (with new costumes). The Hoth, Jedi Temple and Tatooine.\nJedi Temple is beyond my skill right now, I'd get killed every single time after 2 min. They all are ok and fun to play.\n\nThere is also database - you can read about all equipment and objects used in the game. If you like star wars because of details, you'll find them.\n\nModels are done with great detail. My favorite for now is Darth Sion. I was very suprised when I've found out that you can choose dark lighsaber colour. It's almost like ancient saber used by leader of Death Watch.\n\nGame should be played with controler such as Xbox 360 for example.\n\nThere is only sigle player mode, and autosave after checkpoints.\n\nMay the Force be with you :)\n","May 3, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even with all these problems and many more, Force Unleashed is still a very good Star Wars game, being, in my personal opinion, a 7 out of 10.\n\nStory-wise, the game is a cluster♥♥♥♥ of non-cannonical stuff, trying to set the stage for the start of the original trilogy of movies. You play as a generic as ♥♥♥♥ guy who's trained by Vader himself to become a sith and end up, along the way, turning yourself into some sort of good guy ridiculously fast. Seriously, in the first half of gameplay you'll outright murder everyone, including a whole bunch of jedis, only to repent and become a saint among men in the last half of the game. Its simply unbeliavable how fast things turn around, making the story a complete piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe gameplay, as it should be, is where the game shines. You'll have access to a whole lot of lightsaber crystals, changing its color and adding great passive powers to your weapon. There's a pretty standart RPG progression in the game, were you'll get XP in the form of force points to spend in force powers, combos and passives. If you master a few of the combos you buy, the game will get fun as ♥♥♥♥. You can throw two guys in the air, slash through them and land with a force blow that'll knock others away. How about that for a start?\n\nThe "Ultimate Sith Edition" comes with a few DLC, including three missions that are separated from the main game. Not very interesting, but since this edition has become sort of the standart edition of the game, chances are you'll have access to these DLC, so why not play it.\n\nGameplay - 8/10\nSoundtrack - 9/10\nGraphics - 7/10\nContent - 4/10\nChallenge Level - 6/10\nReplayability - 2/10","February 4, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Truly the most broken game I've ever played. I rarely feel compelled to write reviews but after rage quitting a few seconds ago, I feel strangely motivated. Despite the mixed reviews, I went into this game with an open mind. It didn't last long- I only got part way through the second level before the game became ridiculous for me. I beat the mini boss several times (mind, you, this was with witness various glitches along the way) only to die on a jump which should have been simple, only to be sent back to fight the mini boss all over again. Nevermind the fact that a one point at the beginning of the second level, I had to restart becasue I had unknowingly caused a glitch which prevented me from lifting an obvious platform with force grip.

To the most part it IS fun, the first couple times it can be rewarding if you get a given combo right, but on the long run, it's pretty boring and let me tell you, the controls are CLUNKY.\n\nThe way they've decided to do the targeting feels absolutely horrible on PC. Get into the menus and you'll see why: this is a console port, and one of the worst kinds in that. Press [ and ] to change between menus? WHAT??\n\nAlso you'll notice that there's barely any graphics settings. Keep in mind, this game is fairly old, and not very demanding hardware-wise, but it still won't run over 30 FPS.\n\nThe game contains quite a few QTEs, which you either are or are not a fan of. I personally loathe them, some people probably like them, but it just slows the pace of the game down - and at some points, the controls are horrible, as mentioned in the next paragraph.\n\nI have not actually completed the game this time around. It wasn't because it was difficult or boring per se, but towards the end in a given mission a mini-game has taken me more than 45 minutes and I still couldn't finish it (not because I didn't know what or how to do, and not because I was playing on super-star-destroyer-sith-lord-grand-master difficulty either.) Wasting so much time on that one single mini-game I enraged so hard that I immediately hit the uninstall button and clicked the "write review" button.\n\nI did try to play the 2nd iteration of the game, only to find that it doesn't even start :)) It crashes instantly even before the lucasarts logo can finish its animation.\n\nGood thing I got these games dirt cheap in a Humble Bundle, otherwise I'd be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.","April 5, 2015","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game is on sale so why not, bad idea.  This is NOT that game.  It is not a bad game per say if you have never played another action game and you started playing video games in 1998 or so...  But by today's standards it is awful.  The first thing you will notice after you get to say the third or fourth level is that the camera gets caught behind things.  Then the play control, it is out of this world awful.  You do a button combination and it delays for a second.  Your character will take a while to set up his moves, but thankfully the computer AI is super fast.  Trying to levitate a rock to throw at a character, well you better have at least a second before.... too late the computer can instantly hurl rocks, lasers, or rockets.  Which leads me to ... blocking.  You really can only block when you know way in advance you want to do it, other than that it is pointless.  But when you are getting pumelled don't worry the game developers thought enough to allow you to keep getting attacked till you do a very slow get back up.\n\nThis game is crap on the play control and graphics and this is 2015.  There are ton of other action games that put this game to shame.  One of the few games I will probably finish because the story is a little intriguing but the gameplay is godawful.","May 14, 2015","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Little did I know that even with unofficial files to help make the game more playable, the game is still broken.\n\nMost of you probably didn't have the same issue I had but I'm gonna say what issues I had.\n1. When the game starts up, on the battle of  Kashyyk, the audio started off EXTREMELY off balance. You could barely hear either voices or music thanks to the sound effects and this was all on normal settings in the audio option\n2. When facing the jedi as vader, the camera is locked away from where the battle suppose to be, making it difficult to actually see what's happening (I beat him, he's not ment to be hard anyways)\n3. This is more of the issue from the fps unlocker but some reason you'd constantly levetate anything upwards, making the use of the force annoying\n4. The break on the cammel's back, When fighting the jedi on the space station, the audio gave up and just died. Literally it gave up and no audio was coming out. I though there was something wrong with my hardware but it turns out it wasn't cause a cutscene to interrupt the boss fight played and there were sound.\n\nYea, I rage quit afte that but after seeing this kind of problem, I should have known that playing this on the pc would be a bad idea to the point I'm pretty scared to see how the 2nd game (Force Unleashed II) would perform if the first game had this slew of problems.\n\nI really don't recommend this game to anyone unless you are covered in good luck to not run into this landfill of bugs.","March 17, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a completely horrible port, that constantly glitches with various video settings (every played with bottom half of your screen disabled?), doesnt have working audio (in some cases, audio can actually BSOD you), and is just overall a giant PITA.\n\nIn fact, the technical issues are so bad, it doesnt matter how good the game itself is (hint: it's not that good), because you never get to play it anyway.","May 5, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is told picking up from the end of Episode III and fills in some of the abyssmal gap between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy.\n\nSome fair plot twists and some darn good storytelling make this a game worth playing for any Star Wars fan. There are several familiar character cameos and some nice subtle tie in's from both trilogies. All of the characters are very well voice acted and the story elements provided me with the majority of the incentive to get through the title.\n\nLight Saber combat is fluid and fun against most of the weaker to medium foes. However, the larger enemies and boss encounters end up being an excersize in discovery and repetition. That is, you find the bosses weakness and continually exploit it until victory is achieved. I found myself spamming force lighting for most of the game to this effect.\n\nThe control scheme did not translate well to the mouse and keyboard. I would recommend a gamepad for this title. Either a 360 or PD3 controller should do the trick. Force Grip and throw seemed to be fairly useless for the most part as my inteded throw destination was often overwritten by a completely random direction. Similarly, in the boss fights the camera postioning becomes fixed and I often found myself tossing lightning around the arena rather than at my enemy.\n\nSome simple custimization options let the player make small changes in the protagonists appearance which is a nice touch.\n\nIn the end I would give Star Wars - The Force Unleashed a 6/10 for a casual non-star wars fan for the poor combat dynamics in the boss fights. I would award it with an 8/10 for a Star Wars Fan for a spectacular universe expanding story and tie in with some serviceable lightsaber combat.","May 2, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
