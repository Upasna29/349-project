"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imper1um/recommended/109700/","Imper1um","Imper1um","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imper1um/","188 products in account","Achron is a very interesting concept for a strategy game. If you like seeing entirely new mechanics for games, Achron is definitely something to pick up. However, obvious pitfalls make this game incredibly...tiresome.\n\nThe Good:\nThe time mechanics in the game are interesting, and mostly intuitive. Travelling throughout a 7 minute time period (5-6 minutes behind, 1-2 minutes ahead), you can see things that have happened, and can actually change the events that have happened. If you have problems with understanding, "What happened with that group?" you can just rewind to see why that occurred. The interface is also intuitive enough so you can understand when some things happen. Movement, orders, and normal actions doesn't deviate from the norm in top-down strategy games, so a player that plays other top-down strategy (Supreme Commander, Command & Conquer, etc.) will not see any kind of problems getting into this game.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe interface needs some serious tweaks to understand your actions, and what your actions in the timeline are affecting. Its also extremely hard to tell when your changes are getting propagated to the present when it has nothing to do with unit on unit combat. If you (or another time traveller) jumps back to the past, makes a change, and you (in the future), could see a change that doesn't exactly make sense (such as a building or unit not getting built). While you do have the ability to jump into the past and see the changes why, the user interface incredibly lacks when, why and how things are getting modified.\n\nPathing in this game is also a joke. Most games, you can just right-click the location and they will path around obstacles. However, in Achron, if you right click on the right side of the map, and in the center is a one-entrance gully, which they have to go to the North or South to avoid, they will enter the gully, and get stuck on the eastern edge of the gully and stop, without trying to repath. Also, groups have hard times keeping together, since formations do not exist. Friendly "nudging" to get out of the way of a building being built, or a tank trying to get through a line of friendly soldiers, does not exist. Even with this garbage pathing, one unit can only have five orders active at one time.\n\nThe unit creation queues are also a joke. You can manage it once its in the queue effectively, and the queue is hard to understand, with health bars on the queue for some odd reason. Its hard to tell if something is made for a purpose or not, and the creation of buildings with the wrong unit mentions "at a higher cost," but fails to tell you how much it costs. Also, if you place down one building, that area is not "reserved" for other friendly units to not build buildings on that spot, so you'll run into the issue that you might build where a building is going to go.\n\nThe fact that you can't stop Major characters from moving to repair/help build unless they are leagues away annoys me considerably. I can't count the times in which the main characters (that aren't supposed to die) broke formation to heal a front-line unit, and ended up getting killed, requiring me to go back in time to tell them run away.\n\nTeleporters are also really terrible. Rather than teleporting units as close as possible to the specified point, they are teleported anywhere within a 20 block radius from the chosen point, creating problems that units end up on top of impassible terrain, or in the middle of canyons, unable to get out, even with a nearby teleporter.\n\nThe game also takes control too early for major objectives, using the simulated "future time" (1-2 minutes in the future) to determine when an objective is finished. Because of this, it causes major characters to die because the computer takes control of the characters and moves them out of formation, requiring you to go back in time to rectify it after the unskippable cutscene ends. Also, unskippable cutscenes (which doesn't pause the game while doing it) in game.\n\nThe Ugly:\nIts evident that they worked on the time-manipulation system for 90% of the time. Maps are built incorrectly; they have impassible 85 degree inclines with textures that resemble a rock formation rather than walls that are textured properly. The large walls, which are blended together with the floor patterns, make the inside of ships and buildings look like outside with just really steep walls.\n\nVoice acting and story, I would say that its really dumb. Okay, that's being generous, the storyline is probably one of the weakest things in the game. Game introduces Tyr, an AI, but people talk to it like a person when it comes out, makes it confusing when Tyr is introduced as an AI later on. When you encounter another AI later on, everyone treats that same type of AI as the enemy, despite Tyr being that same type of AI. Events in the game occur in reasonable order, instead things happen that suit what the storyline needs at that point in time. Even when a chapter switches, which makes you go to another race and control it (ala Starcraft), is disjointed, problematic, anti-climactic and dumb. Character moods are inconsistent, and flat. Voice acting is lifeless, and I find myself skipping cutscenes just so I don't have to listen to characters that I don't care about drone on and on, making me more sleepy than when Ben Stein is talking.\n\nOverall:\nAchron is a great and new game element into a game that would be great as a concept game, but fails to excite with lackluster AI, UI, Storyline and Voice Acting. 3/10.","January 7, 2014","false","8.0"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","37","40","2","2"

With Archon you can literally see the future or the past of the battlefield in real time and you can actually effect that battlefield in the past or future. Further just because you've been defeated doesn't mean the game is over - if you can travel back in time and alter it you can literally "undo" your defeat. There is a limit to the amount of time you can travel and the number of orders you can give, but overall the battlefields of RTS have never seen this scale of Time Travel. You don't even need a TTC. Lemme go over the Pros and Cons real fast:\n\nPros:\n+Time Travel on the battlefield like nothing you've ever seen in RTS.\n+Easy to pickup, Hard to master - You'll be on the first few levels of the campaign for hours, but you can play "skirismishes" or "multiplayer" in a cinche, most of the campaign's difficulty is in how to overcome the handicaps in the first couple of missions.\n+Pause/Slow/Fast Forward The Current Time-line while you issue orders - but don't mistake this for turn-based because the time you can "pause" is limited (excludes full system pause, which cannot give orders) and the time-line continues on in the present.\n+ Send your units backwards OR forwards in time using a "Chronoporter". BYOR (Bring your own Reinforcements)\n\nCons:\n- The Campaign is a poor place to start in this game Your better off playing a few rounds against AIs in Mock-multiplayer rather than trying to start cold-turkey into the main story.\n- The "level editor" is like trying to learn "blender" backwards (ie the 3d Studio Program)\n- The Game isn't really upto modern Graphics Standards, but for RTS fans the graphics aren't as important as the gameplay.\n- I can't really speak for the multi-player experience as I'm not much of a multiplayer kinda person but, if the AI is anything to judge by the time-line can get really warped with Humans going at it.\n- There are a few bugs, mostly annoying - less critical more like "I wish that mission objective would stop replaying it's sound/text every 1/2 second" but I've only encountered that one on the second campaign mission.","September 2, 2014","true","13.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slugfiller/recommended/109700/","slugfiller","SlugFiller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slugfiller/","249 products in account","Are you looking for a strategy game which involves intense tactical action across time? If you are, then you can keep looking, because this isn't it.\n\nInterestingly enough, the main issue with Achron is the time travel mechanics themselves. In theory it sounds about right: Use future knowledge to plan your strategy, or fix past mistakes. It worked well enough for Prince of Persia. Where could it possibly go wrong?\n\nTime waves. That's where it first starts going horribly wrong. In theory, you should be able to jump to the past, make a few fixes, and then jump back to the present and see the results, right? Wrong. You have to wait for the "time wave" to hit, and erase the incorrect present. And how long would that take? Well, as long as you've jumped back. The time waves only move at double speed compared to normal playing. During that time, you have to play in the past, at double speed, or at least re-watch it.\nYou can't keep playing in the present, because as soon as the time-wave hits, many of your orders will actually be wrong for the situation, if they remain valid at all. And that's assuming that the units to whichyou need to give orders even exist in the present. You can't just wait, either, because the present doesn't stop, and by the time the time wave reaches that "future event" to which you were reacting, it is already, itself, far in the past. So, even if you only make one change, and let everything else play out without interaction, you still have to play in the past just to continue from the same spot that was previously the present. It probably wouldn't be so bad if time waves moved at 5 or 10 times the speed of normal play.\n\nMost of the time, it's best to just play in the present, or even a bit in the future. If you need to "undo past mistakes", save games work much better than time travel. Of course, this all goes flying out the window once you have an achronal enemy. The AI seems to thrive on playing in the past. And every time the enemy makes a change, you have to go back and re-watch the whole thing, because it's enough that one of your units moved 3 inches left for most of your future commands to not work. And there's nothing more annoying than taking out the last of your enemy units, only for a time-wave to hit and suddenly your whole army is gone and you don't know why. Be prepared to watch the timeline UI VERY closely, because it's not too obvious when major changes occur. And, of course, if you notice it only when it hits the present, then it is far too late to go back and fix things, since, as said before, time waves are VERY slow.\n\nOnce you get past the idea of having to replay or at least review the same section of time over and over, you're hit with chrono-energy. In a time when most RTS players pride themselves on their click-rate, you get a game that actually tells you that the number of clicks you have is limited, and horribly so. Forget micro-managed tactics, it'd be too easy for the enemy to screw them all up by changing one tiny thing, and it would cost too much chrono-energy to undo and redo them when that happens.\nIt probably wouldn't be so bad if you were just limited to not making too many CHANGES to the past. But, as noted above, you are often forced to play completely in the past, unable to jump back to the present, so you're actually being limited on the number of actual practical things you can do throughout play.\n\nBut the worst part isn't in how little control you're allowed, but rather how the game tries to compensate for it. It seems like decades of RTS evolution were thrown down the drain, and instead you get a control scheme that is worse than what Dune 2 had. Since group commands cost as much chrono-energy as individual commands, you're supposed to organize units into "hierarchies", where giving orders to "the leader" gives that order to the rest of the group. As tedious as it is to arrange these heirarchies, it becomes even worse to control them. Beside having to keep track of "whose the leader", be sure that a command asking them all to move to one place will send them all scattering in all directions.\nAnd yeah, by the way, if going up against an achronal enemy, you can be sure your leader will be targetted back in time, rendering all of your commands invalid. Sure would have been easier to spot major time waves if the "advanced timeline UI" had an indicator for "given a command to a dead unit".\nThe units also have individual AIs so that you won't have to give them commands to do every little thing. Too bad the AI is horrible, forcing you to waste tons of chrono-energy trying to tell your units NOT to move. Too bad there's no "stop" command. There's an "idle" command, which basically means "stop doing what I say, and go commit suicide instead". I'm not asking for Supreme Commander level of unit AI and control here, I'd just settle for my units following orders.\nAnd all that is AFTER you've the "undo" command - the command you are going to be using the most, as you repeatedly replay the same section of events.\n\nOnce you take away the utterly broken time mechanics, what you're left with is a rather poorly balanced strategy game, with really poor controls. There are a few units which are clearly more powerful than anything else, and they aren't significantly more expensive to create. In fact, some of them are actually cheaper than other units. A group of 5 octoligos or twin MARs can take out most anything. Except for an army of MCBs or black birds. Units with self-repair tend to have the most broken balance, as they are neigh-invincible, so long as you can convince them not to move too far from each other (See: Horrible controls). I guess that's the reason only the humans have them. I spent most of chapter 3 just making sure the one MCB I had was free to join the fight, since it was usually a game-breaker. Oddly enough, I got an achievement for it, even though it was the most obvious thing to do.\nIf you're thinking of creating mixed armies of aerial and ground units with anti-air and anti-ground, you can forget it. It would require too much micro-management to use these properly, and that, as noted before, gets screwed over fast, thanks to the time mechanics. You'd think the per-unit AI, given that it's probably intended to reduce the need for micro-management, would do something useful, like targetting aerial units with anti-air and ground units with anti-ground, but it seems to more often do the exact opposite. Fact is, it's better to just have a large enough all-purpose army, which can simply be told to go from point A to point B and destroy everything in its path. That tactic works WAY better than it should. Probably because, no matter how many times the enemy replays the battle with the overly large army, there is nothing it can do to prevent the resulting annihilation.\n\nThe main counter-measure the game offers to the "large enough army of all the same unit" is limited resources. And most maps sure do limit resources. Of course, there's nothing like using every last resource to build a huge army, destroying all of the enemy's units, and then getting a surprise mission to "build this and that" with resources you no longer have.\n\nSo, having covered how bad the game is all on its own, let's get started on the bugs. And this game sure is rife with them.\n\nLet's start with the simplest one: Windowed mode does not work. I mean, it works, but the graphics are scaled based on the total window size, including the title. This makes the top of the screen be cut off. Too bad that's exactly where your resources are shown. The thing is, this should have been the first thing that should have shown up on even the simplest QA. It's like no one even tested if the game manages to go to windowed mode.\n\nThere's more I'd like to say, but it seems I'm out of room in this review (Why is this limited?). Suffice to say, there are worse bugs, but not enough space left. You have been warned.","May 7, 2014","false","36.2"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

In short, you can give orders to units in the past and in the future, and there are "update waves" which travel at about 3x faster than normal time. Also you can teleport units across the battlefield with teleporters and into the past/future with chronoporters. So, basically, you can do tricks by sending units into the past to help their older doubles and so on - use your imagination. This sounds like an amazing game decades ahead of its time, but sadly its poorly designed tutorial and heavily scripted missions will turn off most players and make them drop the game in frustration. I heard good things about multiplayer but you won't find anyone thru the lobby, only thru forums of this game's fans, which are in short supply.\n\nI could endure only the demo and 3 missions, even restarted the game and played them once again to understand the mechanics better. And though I did understand how this game works with some effort, I doubt many gamers even would.\n\nToo many units are introduced too fast. The tutorial popups ask you to do stuff but don't let you do it before you press OK which actually hides the instructions about what you need to do. The scripted events take control off from you unexpectedly, place new units and give orders to other units, creating even more confusion than the already complex time-traveling system. While the control is taken away from you, characters are talking and the battle goes on. This feels like a nuthouse. Sometimes you aren't even sure if what has just happened is a bug, a scripted event or a game mechanic in action.\n\nI found the story trashy, though if you have nostalgic feelings for Star Wars (I don't), you may find it ok, as even the main character has the name "Luke". The 2D art is amateurish and, together with this Star Wars-like setting gives this game a "trashy" feel, like it was a school project done by teenagers - while the ingenuous combat system of this game deserved so much more. The 3D units are hard to tell from each other. The ground is covered with big uniform textures taken from some free online libraries, with strange lighting and huge, almost unit-sized bumps and long black shades in which smaller units get lost. The huge low-polygonal terrain objects look ugly next to tiny, much more detailed units. The air units hover so high above that you can't see where exactly they are located in relation to ground units (and their shades are shifted) - and where you need to bring your anti-air units so that they could fire at those air units. The controls are clumsy, the GUI is poor, with too few tips. The music is pretty good though.\n\nThe game introduces an interesting mechanic of grouping units with hierarchies of command - which also allows you to save on orders while giving orders in the past or the future (the number of orders you can give is limited by "chronoenergy"). But hierarichies don't work well, as units following a leader don't have a fixed formation, tend to spread and walk in ever expanding crowds which leads to edge units getting killed with no one helping them because the rest of the formation is out of range and won't come to assist other units in the formation.\n\nSave files get corrupted and don't load, so if you fail (e.g. in the very first mission 8+ marines must survive in a fight which comes unexpectedly) you may have to restart the whole mission. Missions are long and heavily scripted, sometimes the instructions are given while you are busy fighting and fail to concentrate.\n\nVoice acting is amateurish and lifeless, as if the actors were bored/annoyed with the story as much as I did. When you click on the timeline (an innovative tool to show the battlefield's states up to 5 mins ago and after), it takes the game 1-2 seconds to load the state of the battlefield at that time point which makes the whole thing feel clumsy, especially when you are already stressed by struggling with this complex game and its heavily script-influenced mission objectives.\n\nBtw I bought the game some time in 2014 and it had all graphics glitched on my laptop  (AMD Radeon HD 7670M video card), but it finally ran on my new desktop computer which has GeForce GTX 970. I think the devs need to try a Kickstarter campaign to get funding for Achron 2 and make a proper game on the same concept this time.","December 4, 2015","false","6.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Then 3D. We even have 2.5D (3D models in a 2D world). Could it get any better? Achron thinks so, and they have added a new dimension to gaming. The 4th Dimension.... Time.Achron - Adding the fourth dimension to real-time strategies\n\nThat’s right, Achron is the first game that allows you play in the past, present, and future.... simultaneously. Self-described as a "meta-time strategy", Achron is essentially a mix of a Real Time Strategy game and a Stephen Hawking book. Now I know that sounds complicated, but surprisingly you pick up on the gameplay and strategy rather quickly.\n\nAchron: Time Travel\n\nLet’s be honest. Nothing I say about this game will be understood, until you first understand the time travel mechanics in the game. Like most RTS games you have the same basic controls. Unlike other RTSs, the bottom of your screen is filled with a time line and an energy meter. The time line allows you to see when a skirmish is taking place. Any changes that you make to the time line in the past require Chrono-energy. The bigger the change, the more energy required. This keeps things balanced by keeping people from exercising God-like power, and encourages good strategizing in the present.\n\nWhen changes are made in the past, a time ripple will pass by and you will see the battle shift on the timeline before your eyes. But be careful that you don’t move units into an occupied location in the past. The result is what the developer calls "chronofragging", where only the strong units survive (though with substantial damage)\n\nAchron Single Player\n\nThe single player campaign tells the story of the human race. As they explore space, they are faced with an enemy that seems to be unstoppable. That is, until scientists stumble on technology that allows you to not only teleport units spatially, but also chronoport them through time. Equipped with this newfound technology, it is your job as an Achron (someone who can see the whole timeline and make changes to the past) to lead your Marines to victory against an enemy who seeks to destroy you.\n\nWhen I started playing the SP campaign, I have to admit, gameplay felt incredibly slow. I am primarily an FPS gamer and the reduction in pace tested my patience. That said, I fully understand the reasoning for the initially slow gameplay. Hazardous Software is introducing an entirely new concept to games, and this slow introduction was necessary to prevent a steep learning curve.\n\nAll in all, the SP campaign was solid. At times, I had the feeling that I couldn’t lose because of my time manipulation abilities, but the developers compensated for this by making your allies self-centered and self-preserving.\n\nI would venture to say that it is necessary for everyone who tries this game to play an hour or so in the SP campaign to familiarize yourself with time manipulation and tactics.\n\nAchron requires careful thought and time line tracking\n\nAchron Multiplayer\n\nStarcraft, move over. You finally have some competition in the RTS genre. After familiarizing myself with the 4th dimension, it was time to play some multiplayer. Everyone knows that multiplayer is what makes or breaks an RTS game, and Hazardous Software has delivered a winner.\n\nStarting out on a multiplayer map, the only learning curve that you start with is learning the new names of some traditional units you have in all RTS games (like the resource collecting unit, building to research new technologies, etc). Within 45 minutes, I had it nailed down.\n\nWhen I felt like I had enough of an army built up, I proceeded to attack my opponents. Boy was I wrong. My enemy had massive forces built up and proceeded to destroy me. In most RTS games, the match would have been over quickly. But don’t forget, time is on our side. Before it was too late, I chronoported my forces back in time, and stopped them from attacking an enemy that was too powerful. Laughter ensued as I heard my friend on team speak shout "What the? Your guys are disappearing!?!"\n\nThe only logical response was for my opponent to go back in time as well. Which I responded to by moved into the future. The rest of the match was cat and mouse until squad by squad, my death became unavoidable.\n\nHanging on to my last 10 units, I ran for my life, back and forth through time. Upon going back in time, I noticed that I had about double the units. Excited, but seeing my inevitable demise, I pushed for one final assault. As I began to attack, I noticed different characters disappearing suddenly. Then it all became clear to me!!!! The units that I thought were extra were actually the same ones that I already had! They were disappearing because I moved them into the past. I had become a victim of a TIME PARADOX!\n\nAchron Final Thoughts\n\nAchron is a game that will keep you begging for more. This is sure to become a LAN favorite across the globe. Plenty of thought, plenty of laughs, plenty of head scratching as players disappear and reappear before your eyes.\n\nThis game is a must buy for any fan of the RTS genre, anyone intrigued by time travel, and everyone with a keyboard.\n\nGDN Silver award","June 19, 2014","true","0.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

By this I mean you can send your entire army into an unwinnable battle just to see what is in he enemy base, then go back in time and cancel the attack.

Save yourself!  Don't buy this game!\n\nSuch a great concept, but such a bad game.  Starts off slow, and you will be too frustrated at the game to figure out if it picks up.  It seems like a time travel game would have amazing amounts of freedom to beat each level however you would like.  But not this game.  You must click exactly how it (very vaguely) tells you.  Don't exactly understand how you were supposed to click?  Then you can wander aimlessly for hours, because you aren't going to beat the level until you move your troops exactly where it told you.  The second level is best described by the constant beeping (a bug that constantly checks to see if your units are in the right spot, and beeps if they are not), and slow wandering of your troops around the map.  Also included are two unavoidable deaths so you can learn the game mechanics, one painfully slow click at a time.

I only played the game for a short while but I can say from this first encounter with the game I wasn't taken by It. The concept is astoundingly unqiue, not something I have ever seen done. But it's specialisation to this 1 game mechanic means it sacrifices qualities in other areas. Many of the models could have stood to be improved or more defined. The story better planned and explained. The artwork needed some final touches. But the voice acting is by far the biggest qualm I have with the game. It just did not engage me in the slightest.\n\nBy no means is this game bad, infact i was very torn as to rate yes or no, in the end I chose by saying that while I personally was not drawn to the game, that does not mean you might not enjoy it yourself. So I say look at videos before you play, this game is not anything spectacular.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mah4jesus/recommended/109700/","mah4jesus","EngineerInRL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mah4jesus/","76 products in account","Pros: For those seeking an RTS with a mind-melting game mechanic look no further! This game delivers an amazing new way to play and think about an RTS; it is truly in a category all its own. I've stayed mostly in the campaigns but the game seems to have some unique settings such at 500% game speed, a key toggle for showing the mini-map 4 times larger, and the ability to zoom way, WAY out. Also IMHO campaign storyline is engaging though there clearly wasn't the budget for cut scenes!\n\nCons: The amazing game mechanic comes with some strong drawbacks, especially if you are used to the distinct, polished, instant gameplay of StarCraft II. The game has some considerable glitches from time to time (nothing a save and reload hasn't fixed yet), my favorite being that the in-game voice overs are tied to game speed so playing at 200% game speed turns everyone into unintelligible chipmunks. Pathing is mediocre and quite delayed, though maybe that is intentional. Units favor traveling in the coordinate directions rather than going diagonal. Anyone who is used to unit micro will be sorely disappointed; the pathing and response is far too slow to allow for stutter step tactics and even something simple like moving a damaged unit out of combat is very hard to do. Because of this it seems to be a very macro oriented game.\n\nOverall: Amazing game, though unpolished with a steep learning curve (even in the campaigns). Absolutely worth it though. This game requires a-typical thought patterns and is NOT a button spamming APM/micro oriented RTS. The game mechanic forces a limited number of commands to be issued and thus rewards the player for thinking carefully rather than fast (after all, what does fast even mean when you can travel back in time!). I hope one day there will be an Achron 2 (or even just updates to Achron) which will be more polished; if there is BUY IT because that will be the greatest game of all time.","February 7, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game might look interesting with its time travel mechanic, but that's precisely where the interest ends. It might be interesting if an actual good RTS used these mechanics, but instead we have this. It's as if the developpers spent all of their time working on the time travel mechanic and simply ran out of time to make the rest of the game up to par.\nHowever, if you are interested in video game design, then I would in fact recommend this game as a learning experience. Pick it apart, see where it fails, come up with a better system to utilize the time travel mechanic, possibly.","February 1","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaidusrecon/recommended/109700/","zaidusrecon","ZaidusRecon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaidusrecon/","131 products in account","A four-dimensional RTS game. That's Real-Time Strategy if you don't know. You should.\n\nIt is the most satisfying thing to do ever, to defeat an enemy commanding their army in the past, present, and a little into the future. It is epic to teleport your soldiers and tanks through time (or 'chronoport') and into some point where it was before chronoporting, allowing the same one twice or more. It is really challenging having to think in four dimensions while time is still moving on and battles are still happening.\n\nIt is so so sad that the actual RTS part of the game is so terrible. I don't care for graphics. But the gameplay is so clunky. It is as though the game has gathered its RTS gameplay from the past decades. Tiny units walk slowly. Buildings are built so plainly. Battles are fought with pixelated miniature explosions. Unit death animations are forgettable. Units lack variety and functionality. Unit AIs are really, really ironic. Even the ability to make your units follow your orders is an obstacle in executing strategy. It does not feel at all like war in four dimensions when the first, second, and third are not properly depicted. Saying that, you can only edit the fourth dimension within 10 minutes of game time. When an event has gone into the past further than that, it is history.\n\nFurthermore, it is not meant to be war in four dimensions. The game mechanics are based around the story told in the campaign. No huge scale battles are fought. They probably could be if you play the skirmish right. But it is not designed that way. It is designed for mystery and an atmosphere of artistic precision - very much similar to a time-manipulation film called "Primer". Unfortunately, this designation is not a good factor of replayable, refined, multiplayer real-time strategy gameplay, and that is what is valued by the most players when they play an RTS.\n\n(On a side note, the reason I purchased this game was to enjoy the time manipulation, and I am complaining about something else. I guess maybe the game is built this way just so that it can cope with the complexity of changing past events and updating them into the present. But I do enjoy the fourth dimension part of the game, just not enough to compensate for the rest of it.)\n\nEDIT: Despite the rest of this review, I still feel that this game is undervalued. It has not got enough appreciation for what it has done right. There are many players out there who would love this game, and Achron deserves to be played and appreciated by them. Unfortunately, it looks as though they will never hear of this game, since popularity amongst the greater picture of average gamers is not something Achron is currently achieving.\n\nTo clarify: I do not recommend this game to most people. However, I highly recommend this game to individuals who would enjoy the core aspects a great deal.\n\nDOUBLE EDIT: Yes, I changed to positive. After exploring to a further extent the RTS genre as composed by its games, I have come to the realisation that this game is entirely unique. It offers something that no other game can offer. Even if what it offers is not as great quality as it could be, it is a type / a direction / a form that every gamer -nay, every mind- should experience. (I can't believe I said nay >.<) Perhaps it cannot entertain as well as other games, maybe it will not entertain people at all, but it's like education. You don't go and get an education because it's fun. You do it to enhance your mind. Sorry to sound like a school teacher, but that is the reason everyone should play this game (for enough time to allow them to gain about 163,082 neurons).","November 26, 2013","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
