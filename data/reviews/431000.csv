SOme things are blocky and other things are REALLLY blocky which seems weird and cheap.  The important thing is the gameplay though and here its merely ok.  Controls are good enough but there are a lot of unavoidable hits that don't seem fair.","January 4","false","2.2"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","27","43","6","0"

There are three games that could have been made here, stretched around mechanics that can't sustain them.\n*Erratic enemy patterns combined with uneven hitboxes makes it difficult to not take damage.\n*Speed and enemy placement means you can get hit before you can even react.\n*Underdeveloped sound means bad mixing and basic sound effects that don't measure up to the art.\n\nIt's a shame, because the art is charming, and the animation and feel of using the bow is excellent. This feels like a game that would have benefited from a "soft launch" on something like itch.io, where it could have been refined into something much more playable.\n\nI don't regret paying $3 for this, as the work put into it justifies it, and i've definitely spend more on worse. Steam is just the wrong place for it.","January 13","false","0.7"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"
