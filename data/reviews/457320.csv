The graphics are simplistic and colorful but have a sharp design style.\n\nThe opening lobby is an empty room that contains a number of pedestals with different difficultly levels on each one. initially, the only selectable difficulties are Zen (practice mode) and easy.\n\nI started off with easy mode.\n\nThe ball is tee'd up for you to hit and the controls are simple. You swing at the ball and, depending on how hard and what angle you hit it at, it will direct your shot. You want to aim at the sweetspot (outside edges) or angle your shot to bounce off of one or multiple walls. The object, just like pong, is to outwit and outshoot your AI opponent looking to return your serve.\n\nAlso, it is good to note there is a leaderboard which I think is a staple and necessary in any arcade type game. It's just another carrot on a stick to keep users striving to do better and encourages players to continue coming back to the game. In the current iteration the leaderboard is only visible once you enter the room. My suggestion is having a way to bring up the leaderboard without having to leave the game and come back.\n\nAfter some witty quips from my computer opponent I took my shot. WHAM, ACE +100 points. First impressions are great, the accuracy relies completely on the user ability to control the motion controls and the speed in which the shot is taken.\n\nThe AI opponent is comical with its retorts and it motivates me to hit my shots correctly.\n\nThere are 5 rounds and the player has to reach 5 points in any game, before the AI, to move onto the next round.\n\nI did well and made my way through easy without too much difficulty and was very amazed at how much fun it is to play. I quickly restarted easy to get a better position on the leaderboard.\n\nAfter getting my bearings I moved onto medium difficulty.\n\nMy first impression was that the room increased in size. Ok, that's a cool idea and mechanic.\n\nQuickly, I realized my 7 ft tall ceilings were not going to suffice for any difficulty past easy.\n\nI tried my best to not crush my ceilings, but unfortunately a number of shots went above my reach and it happened regardless.\n\nI made my way through Medium with some lackluster results after restarting a couple times and having learned to let some shots just go by to save my drop-tile ceilings.\n\nI moved onto hard and the room grew bigger. After the first return, I had to leave as a lot of the shots were above my head.\n\nAfter trying out Zen difficulty I found an equal amount of fun to be had in this very different racquetball type style training simulator.\n\nI did not notice any bugs in the initial testing I've done but will continue to check out the game and see if I find any in time.\n\nSo, after an hour of testing I think this game has a ton of potential. The controls are very intuitive and the gameplay is inviting and fun. The difficulty ramps up fairly but my main complaint is that you would probably need at least 9' ceilings in the games current iteration if you are a tall individual like me at 6'3".","April 25","true","3.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

The gameplay is simple: score against an AI by hitting the ball with one of your paddles. The game's difficulty ramps up as it continues and each round introduces a modifier such as speeding up the AI or increasing hit power.\n\nLeaderboards encourage replayability and I'd love to see online multiplayer in the future. One thing to note is that you'll be swinging your controllers pretty hard. Make sure you have adequate play space and are aware of your position in your room. I'd personally like to see an outline of the play space much like Space Pirate Trainer to increase positional awareness. (Update: The developer has since added this along with other suggestions sent pre-release. Excellent turn around!) My play space is about 3.3m x 2.8m and I didn't have any issues beyond being overly cautious.\n\nHoloBall takes a classic game into the world of VR and executes on this idea well. This is well worth the cost of admission, especially once you consider the launch sale.","April 25","true","0.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Absolutely worth the price of admission!\n\nGood:\n\nVery fun to play, easy to pick up and hard to master (I can't make it beyond the Hard difficulty). I love this visual style, reminicent of the old Tron movie mixed with some polygon backgrounds from the old Virtual Boy era. Sense is scale is really nice, feels like you are in a big hall/hangar. One thing I absolutely loved was the haptic feedback of the racket. It has this long veil/ribbon streaming out of the back and as you move it, you feel it swoosh around. Really sold me on having that sci-fi racket in my hand instead of the Vive controller.\n\nBad:\n\nA bit barebones with regards to gameplay modes and options, but the base game has enough to offer initially. Future updates should include more modes (many balls come toward you, specific areas of the court give more points/are blocked, etc) and possibly power-ups (more balls, racket size changes etc). Multiplayer would also be very cool but it would require big changes to the gameplay (can't go as high vertically). One final note of warning: make sure you have a lot of space or stand as far back as you can! I have about 2.8x2.3m and was so immersed and focused on winning and smashing the ball that I scratched the controller on the wall twice in a row the first time I played it. I had no problems being aware of the bounds and not hitting them with any of my other games, so be warned!","May 3","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I personally haven't had any experiences with anyone letting go of the controller yet, but I've seen plenty of evidence elsewhere, and it's a bit telling that Nintendo has suddenly sold out of every color of wrist strap except the basic white, so if you don't always keep a good grip or know someone who might not be too careful then you might want to get a beefier wrist strap before you play this one.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's simple but fun, like most of the cheaper Vive games I've played. It's sort of like pong mixed with tennis, in which you play against an AI. If you've got a spectator they can also take over the AI and play with WASD, but in my experience they won't stand a chance and it's better to just leave it to the computer. There are four difficulties that you unlock as you complete the previous one, and it can be a pretty good workout on the later difficulties. It's not necessarily the sort of thing that's super impressive on a technological level, but for the price it offers a fair amount of entertainment unless you manage to break your wrist strap, in which case the only people being entertained may be the TV repair company.","May 6","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then, that child grew up, and had a baby with the classic indoor sport of racquetball. That wonderful, miracle, of a baby, is named; HoloBall!\n\nHoloBall is a competitive sport-like game in which takes place in what appears to be a neon version of a racquetball court. The goal is to win against a snarky, sarcastic, comedic AI, and attempting to get the highscore to get your name up on the leaderboard. Doing so, immenses a challenge and a great amount of fun! The different difficulty levels, really help to match your level of skill. The harder the difficulty, the larger the court and the smaller the ball. The racket has perfect physics! It feels all so very natural swinging at the ball attempting to get it passed the AI. Not only is this game a large amount of fun, its a great workout too if you really get into it!\n\nI highly recommend purchasing this game for anyone who even has a slight interest in; Racquetball, Tennis, or even the original Pong.\n\nWarning: DON'T LET GO OF YOUR CONTROLLER!

The only thing I don't like about it right now is that there's only one music track. Maybe the developer will add some more, but it's not bad as it is.\n\nBut BE CAREFUL. I had someone try it out and while playing, the wrist strap on the controller SNAPPED OFF and he lost his grip and the controller flew into the wall and stopped working. Thanks to a guide I found online I was able to fix it by opening it up and reconnecting a strip, but it's much better to not have your controllers break at all. So hold those controllers tight when you're playing this game! I would even recommend putting something different on for a wrist strap.

So while I played a paid copy of the game, I won't let this influence this review.\n\n\nAs someone enjoying sports involving rackets like Tennis or Badminton, I feel like this game is absolutely fantastic fun! Let's start with the concept. You hit a ball with a racket, either with your left or right hand, and watch as it travels towards a huge wall covered by a floating AI opponent platform. Said CPU tries to return the ball and the goal of course is to get the ball past the player. It's basically pong meeting squash. There are three alternate modes: „Zen“ is classic squash, with the player having to repeatedly hit the ball of a wall. Then there are three different difficulties for matches against an AI, each consisting of five games, first to score five wins a game. Players are rewarded points for winning and performing bonus actions like an ace serve, but get points substracted for time spent. In this highscore-based mode it's all about time basically. To round the content of, „Endurance“ has you playing against a bot with only three lives to survive. Fundamentally, you have to score as many points as possible without letting the ball get past you more than two times. While each mode contains more or less the same key gameplay elements, they still all play diverse. Zen is best played rather slow, as you want the ball to travel as slow as possible to be able to return it as precise as possible over and over again. On the three difficulty enemy encounters, I tend to play more and more aggressively. While „Easy“ really is quite easy, „Medium“ already managed to give me a workout. „Hard“ definitely is a challenge and I tend to absolutely smash the ball whenever possible to get past the enemy. Spanning five rounds each, the AI gets better with the rounds played. It moves faster or returns the ball harder, giving you a great progressive increase of difficulty even within the different modes. „Endurance“ also comes with a change-up in mechanics. While the three other enemy modes have a „sweetspot“ zone on the edges of the wall that you'll definitely want to hit, leaving the enemy no chance to reach it, this zone doesn't exist in Endurance. All my play in the three difficulty modes usually focusses on aiming at the sweetspot-zones, making it feel different to Endurance. Here, you need to out-play the enemy, once again involving forceful smashes and quick directional changes. All of the playing modes ultimately have you hitting the ball, but while incorporating the same mechanics, they still manage to feel different due to varied circumstances.\n\nThe actual gameplay is absolutely mad fun! The Vive controller just works awesome as a racket. I'm playing in a 3,8m x 1,8m space and the use of room scaling is fantastic. It can be quite exhausting running from one end to the other, though it never seemed unfair in my time with it. When the ball came through, I always knew I was too slow. All in all it feels like a work out, but a very fun one. As hard as I kept hitting the balls, I felt sore muscles just few hours later the first time I played it. The game encourages me to use both arms, as each hand is equipped with a racket. While you theoretically still can play with one controller using forehand and backhand hits, you're way better off using both. I'm usually terrible at doing anything with my non-dominant arm and as the game encourages me to still use it, I think it actually helps me getting better with it. At the start I couldn't hit a ball with it, but it has already gotten better at the end of my first session and it keeps improving. Haptic feedback on the controllers makes the swinging all the more satisfying.\n\nOne of the most fun experiences I've had in VR with the Vive so far has been jump-smashing a ball to victory. It feels so satisfying to run and jump, smashing the ball with as much force as possible. It makes me feel really bad-♥♥♥, especially if it's still precisely aimed at a sweetspot zone. The game becomes a frantic, awesome work out on both the Hard difficulty and Endurance, as the enemy tends to return the ball harder and harder. My reflexes are greatly tested as the ball can come back in any direction in my 3,8m playspace width. Smash the ball and you face quite a workout with the enemy giving you a real challenge.\n\n\nWith all the talk about smashing a controller around, I didn't come close to hitting any furniture or walls in my time with the game so far. There's a room requirement for a reason, and I think as long as you have the required 1.5m x 2m or greater, you're good to go. The room scale use seems perfect and thanks to Chaperone, I'm sure there won't be a case of destroyed furniture or controller :p I ended up hitting myself with the controllers though which is a first for me with the Vive. The heavy hitting makes it difficult to slow the controllers down in time in some occasions and thus I hit myself regularly in my first hour. The more I played though, the less this happened. But a short, important advice: It seems crucial to wear the controller wrist straps. All the smashing in combination with slippery hands can make controllers fly through the room. I actually had a controller slip happen to me, while wearing the straps though – thankfully. So remember to use them or you'll regret it.\n\nVisually, the game is looking great. The neon colors are vibrant, though the black largely black background keeps it light on the eyes. The controller rackets feature some cool visual effects, but I would suggest not to hold them directly in front of your eyes – they are very bright. The visuals give me a Tron-esque vibe and it feels great. The sense of space is fantastic! Depending on the game mode and difficulty, you play in a smaller or larger hall. Especially the large one really impresses with the threedimensional portrayal and with the ball traveling longer than in the small room, it's part of the reason why this game feels very immersive. I tend to forget that I'm wearing the Vive and that is always a good sign! The CPU is trash-talking to you during play which is fun, even though its lines become repetitive after some matches.\n\nWith the most important aspects out of the way, there are some miscellaneous things I want to talk about. The menus are fantastic, very intuitive. All the modes are right in front of you (though you have to unlock some by completing the previous ones first) and you choose a mode by putting the controller into the respective icon. On top of that, the game has super quick loading times which always is a great plus in my book. I'd appreciate another way to access the leaderboards. Currently, you can see it before starting a new match. As an arcade game pretty much revolving around highscores, I would appreciate a simpler way of having a quick look at the leaderboard. Also, I tend to press the Vive home button when things get heated so I'd wish for an option to disable all button presses while playing. Nitpicking though :) The game feels very polished and I've yet to face any kind of bug.Just a short disclaimer: All of my experience is based on the build that I played on the weekend before official release. I didn’t see any patch provided so I assume the final version is the exact same as I played. As polished as it is, there’s no real need for a patch anyway.\n\n\nHoloball is a very fun experience and I can see myself playing this every day for some small workout. Three modes with increasing difficulties play more diverse than I thought and chasing highscores quickly got me hooked. The price of 10 bucks is great and if you can imagine yourself having at least a tiny bit of fun equipped with two rackets, smashing every ball the AI is testing you with, I can fully recommend the game to you. If you don't mind a little workout, you're in for an insanely fun game that has you jump-smashing ball for ball like a badass!","April 25","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The controller rackets feature some cool visual effects, but I would suggest not to hold them directly in front of your eyes – they are very bright. The visuals give me a Tron-esque vibe and it feels great. The sense of space is fantastic! Depending on the game mode and difficulty, you play in a smaller or larger hall. Especially the large one really impresses with the threedimensional portrayal and with the ball traveling longer than in the small room, it's part of the reason why this game feels very immersive. I tend to forget that I'm wearing the Vive and that is always a good sign! The CPU is trash-talking to you during play which is fun, even though its lines become repetitive after some matches.\n\nWith the most important aspects out of the way, there are some miscellaneous things I want to talk about. The menus are fantastic, very intuitive. All the modes are right in front of you (though you have to unlock some by completing the previous ones first) and you choose a mode by putting the controller into the respective icon. On top of that, the game has super quick loading times which always is a great plus in my book. I'd appreciate another way to access the leaderboards. Currently, you can see it before starting a new match. As an arcade game pretty much revolving around highscores, I would appreciate a simpler way of having a quick look at the leaderboard. Also, I tend to press the Vive home button when things get heated so I'd wish for an option to disable all button presses while playing. Nitpicking though :) The game feels very polished and I've yet to face any kind of bug.Just a short disclaimer: All of my experience is based on the build that I played on the weekend before official release. I didn’t see any patch provided so I assume the final version is the exact same as I played. As polished as it is, there’s no real need for a patch anyway.\n\n\nHoloball is a very fun experience and I can see myself playing this every day for some small workout. Three modes with increasing difficulties play more diverse than I thought and chasing highscores quickly got me hooked. The price of 10 bucks is great and if you can imagine yourself having at least a tiny bit of fun equipped with two rackets, smashing every ball the AI is testing you with, I can fully recommend the game to you. If you don't mind a little workout, you're in for an insanely fun game that has you jump-smashing ball for ball like a badass!","April 25","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The core game was solid, but my only gripe was that each shot felt more like a ricochet rather than an actual swing. When I would serve the ball with all my might, sometimes it'd be a cannon, and sometimes it'd be a dud. You'd get a lucky defensive shot ricochet with power into the AI's sweet spot. You really just had to make contact to stay competitive with expert AI.\n\nSince the update, ALL these problems have been resolved.  EVERY Time I serve, it zooms across the court like I intended.  Also, those fast serves get a FAST return volley.  If you serve with power, be prepared to react within a split second. Now my defensive shots are slow and easy for the AI to pick up. Against harder AI, you truly have to earn each point and smash the ball into their sweet spot.\n\nIt also now gives you a warning to use your wrist straps and perhaps replace your Vive straps with Wii straps. I am a victim of Vive straps breaking off, causing the controller to fly into the wall.  You do not want a $110 repair bill from HTC support. Trust me.\n\nGreat game: A must buy for racquet ball, tennis, squash players, or anyone with a mild interest in racquet sports really.","June 4","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is a blast to play. Think "pong for VR." Three modes: one zen (basically you hit it with yourself), easy/medium/hard vs AI, and endurance, which allows you to keep playing until you lose.\n\nBeating the three difficulties doesn't take long, but climbing the leaderboards provides for something to come back to. The game lends itself perfectly to multiplayer (not yet in), and I can't wait for that.\n\nVery polished as well. Any issues I had with the game were minor (occasionally easy to lose the ball blended against the background, sweet spot on the AI's wall that gives you an automatic point if you hit it is a little too generous).\n\nOne of the games I most enjoy, and keep thinking about after I'm done playing.

It's enough of a workout (to my slightly overweight, sedentary self) to test the sweat-absorbing capabilities of the face pad, too. And at the same time, fun enough to play a few rounds to work up that sweat, making it a more consistent "exercise" option than, you know, actual exercise.\n\nIt's not like it's complex, or especially deep gameplay, but it doesn't need to be. It gets you moving in a fun way. And since that makes it WAY cheaper than a treadmill, that all adds up to a recommendation.","May 5","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
