I can see myself putting tons of hours into it, just for the pure enjoyment of watching the entire finished fireworks show that I've created.\n\nAs a side note, the Devs have abandoned this simulator. You will get no help from them, no updates, no bug fixes. Only the community can help you, but we are all having the same problems. Buying this game now is just paying the ones who don't care about their game or their community.","December 19, 2014","true","73.6"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","27","32","2","2"

But unfortunately it's just not as good as it makes it out to be. On the simple side, there are overused sounds, quite a limited set of fireworks and it's just simply overall quite a poor design for a simulator - it's more of a worktop or, do I call it a sandbox? On the technical side, it's even worse sadly, it takes up far much more GPU power than it needs to and the way it has been coded makes it hard to edit or even try open back something you've made without it causing errors, even for someone as tech-savy as me who understands the Windows Registry can't seem to even get it fixed. I had really high hopes for this game when I saw it released on Steam, but disappointed with the outcome even for a $10 game - overall I've spent less and received much better developed games.","January 21, 2015","false","0.8"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

Fireworks Simulator is brand new into the market released only two days ago and come to think about it I'm sure your'e all thinking "well here's ANOTHER simulator game..."\nBut let me stop you there, Fireworks Simulator is unlike anything I have ever played on Steam before and in a good way.\n\nWelcome to this crazy, psychedelic world of bright lights and explosions.\nI booted this up to try it and found myself 2 hours later in awe of a pretty awesome firework show I had built from scratch to music from my computer I had previously imported.\n\nIf you buy this game be prepared to have your imagination captured, skills put to the test and most importantly have a lot of fun regardless of your age.\nI can assure you this is way more than placing pretty lights and watching them go bang.\nUnlike other "flop" simulator games I think this might just become a hit and the developers deserve every credit for it.\n\nThe question is, can you top the London New Year Fireworks? You can certainly try!!","November 27, 2014","true","3.1"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","18","32","0","0"

But there is a lot of settings that is missing that would have improved the game a lot.  It is hard and unfriendly to use.\n\nThe possibility of starting the "play" anywhere would let creator testing some effects instead of restarting the video everytime we need to see how it goes.  At les in the sequencer, instead of the pic of the place you are shooting, put a simulation of your show.\n\nHaving the possibility to call effects directly in the sequencer and place it after would have been a great thing to have too.\n\nThe is absolutely not enough effects to play with.  These effect should have more descriptions like time of the effect (I like the prefire time showed in sequencer by the way)\n\nAnd shooting places is limited to 2, it is fastly becoming boring to make shows in these conditions.\n\nI cant believe WECO put their name on that.

It has lots of shells to work with. The display graphics are great if you have a 2Gb video card or better.

You launch from either bardges or a golf course. If you forget and create a display with an artists music some social media will remove it and warn you about breaking copyright laws.","February 26, 2015","true","17.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

If i save a custom effect it glitches once in a while but i don't have problems with that because the next time i press save it does work.

You can see the shell going off because of the glow on the landscape. I tried different resolutions and qualitysettings. (ps my PC runs ARMA3 on ultra settings so it's strong enought for a fireworksim...). Gameplay is awesome and i love tha fact that you can upload your own music.

"Fireworks Simulator" takes that a step further and adds the ability to adjust music and camera angles.  I would have really liked a freeform camera that let you zoom around to any position you wanted...instead you're limited to about six preset angles.  It's a solid simulator and it works once you figure it out, but I didn't see a whole lot of content.

The menus are poorly designed, the User interface is confusing and quite frankly look like they were designed in 5 minutes by a 13 year old on his first computing project.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ILoveboobies/recommended/323780/","ILoveboobies","ILoveboobies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ILoveboobies/","190 products in account","This game is fun. You can load your own music into it and then it becomes a time burner as you spend the next hour  testing all the different fireworks and getting it just right so the fireworks coordinate to the song... only to save it and lose everything. Patch 1.1 did NOT fix the save issues. I just lost the past 60 minutes of music/firework coordination and I was only 1/3 done with my song.\n\nThat sucks.\n\nThis game is in beta mode at best.\n\nThere should be a copy and paste function as well as a drag and drop to facilitate firework placement. You should also be able to 'see' the fireworks along with the music when you are in the sequencer instead of constantly having to switch back and forth between placement of the fireworks and then trying to line it up with the music. Also every time you hit save it does not need to make a new copy of the game (that doesnt work anyway). It should save over the previous work unless you rename it to something new.\n\nThe game only has two working backdrops. More is better. Being able to rotate your POV around the landscape would also be a plus.\n\nI dont plan on playing this game anymore until they fix the save feature. It is pointless to waste your time on a simulator that doesnt save your work.\n\nI'm still giving it a thumbs up because it has potential, mostly I want  to encourage the developers to fix their program and the fireworks are beautiful in high resolution. Someday this will hopefully be a great simulator.","March 11, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
