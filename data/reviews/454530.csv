It can be played solitaire or against a human opponent, and sports some of the strongest AI in the industry.\n\nThe game combines an easy-to-play but very deep turn-based divisional scale wargame with an extended role-play of command management.  This combination creates a brilliant and unique game system that is as important and revolutionary as the invention of card driven games for board wargames.  After playing Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa you will never look at another wargame in quite the same way, because without the role-playing command layer something very important will be missing.\n\nThe German player has to slalom around cranky colleagues, unruly subordinates, and irrational superiors while conducting a demanding military campaign that threatens to come unravelled if you run out of fuel or if too many of your trucks or panzers break down.  The Soviet player gets to be Stalin, wrestling with ineffective subordinates and growing paranoia while trying to keep the military situation from falling apart.\n\nThe game is not an orgy of micromanagement.  Many things appear to be handled abstractly, but appearences can be deceiving. The game focuses on the important decisions an overall theater commander must make and their influence on short-term combat operations.\n\nAnyone who has ever worked in a large organization has at some point taken a proposal to senior management for approval. You may already know the executive who has to sign off on the proposal, and you scan his face while he reads it hoping for advance warning on what is going through his mind. You listen carefully to his questions, trying to understand his thought process. You answer even more carefully, trying to steer him into your way of thinking. And to your delight, the questions that he come back at you with tell you that he is thinking about the proposal the way you want him to. When he summarizes the issues and the decision he has to make, you know that he fully understands why he needs to sign off. And then the unfathomable happens: he turns you down.\n\nDecisive Campaigns: Barbarossa played from the German side puts you into the role of that senior manager. You are constantly being asked to make decisions or delegate the choices to a subordinate, which amounts to pretty much the same thing. It is often painfully clear what the intellectually correct choice should be, and you repeatedly find yourself compelled to make a poor choice, or even the worst choice, with full understanding of what the unpleasant consequences are likely to be.\n\nAny action you take is likely to upset someone. Antagonize a subordinate and he'll be slow to carry out your orders, which won't do wonders for your next performance review. Annoy your peers and your fuel allocation will get diverted to Western Europe, or your supply trucks won't get repaired when they break down. Anger your superiors and count yourself lucky if all that happens is early retirement. Anything you do or don't do comes at a political cost, and you rarely have enough political capital stored up to do what absolutely needs to get done, let alone what you really want to do. So you perform a heart-breaking triage on the decisions you have to make, repeatedly making bad choices so as not to upset the apple cart because you need to keep your political powder dry for the big fight over that one thing you think you absolutely need.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a wargame. There's a big detailed map, with lots of units to move around and lots of places for them to go. But you're playing as theater commander. You sit there looking longingly at the map, thinking of all the brilliant maneuvers you could make and all the clever things you could do, if only you could get your subordinates to follow orders. And then you remember your inbox. It's a big inbox.\n\nSo why do you have to read through all those reports instead of focusing on moving your troops around ? You could delegate to your staff, and you can even ignore your inbox entirely. Many commanders throughout history have done precisely that. But it's part of your job, and sooner or later not understanding fuel consumption, railroad track gauges, and broken down trucks will bite you in the ankle, especially when the weather is starting to freeze over and your troops haven't been supplied with winter coats.\n\nPlayed from the Soviet side the game presents you with a different but equally challenging set of problems. You have to figure out how to get a brain-dead, incompetent, and terrified officer corps to do something (anything) while navigating around Stalin's episodes of paranoia. Less than ten years before the game begins the functional part of the Soviet officer corps had been purged, and the consequences of that purge are still very much in evidence in 1941. You survive in the Red Army by towing the party line and not being too prominent or conspicuous: showing too much competence or initiative was a one-way ticket to Lubyanka prison or the Gulag. In that environment, the natural inclination of a Red Army general with any hope of life expectancy is to do nothing. When he isn't descending into paranoia, Stalin can nudge the Red Army into action by dispatching Zhukov or Khrushchev to keep things under control or restore order. When playing the game from the Soviet side a player will find himself in a constant war with inertia.\n\nPlaying from either side you have the option to remove the management exercise layer from the game before it begins, and what you'll be left with is an engaging division-level wargame in the style of its predecessors in the series, Decisive Campaigns: Blitzkrieg Warsaw to Paris and Decisive Campaigns: Case Blue. But playing with the management layer turned on elevates Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa to a unique experience that demonstrates at a visceral level that there's a lot more to being a good general than just making the right moves.","April 29","true","33.9"," 98 of 128 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","98","128","6","3"

The last few years no other wargame managed to suck me in like this. Either they were too much on the easy side or to complex. This one is exactly right. The feeling you get managing the Ostfront is unparalelled.\n\nFirst there's the basic hex wargame. I don't have to manage each and every little artillery regiment, special unit or air wing. It's all on the divisional level with a fair amount of abstraction. This makes the game playable. No micromanagement slugfest here.\n\nNote: It's still a hex counter wargame, so complexity is rather high if you're used to RTS games or Risk or something like that. Learning and knowing unit stats, supply behavior and action point costs is a must. Good thing: the guys made help videos, accessible in the game. Grab a beer, coffee or whatever else and take some time watching them - else I predict frustration.\n\nSecond we have the political meta game. This is such a nice, well done thing - I can't praise it high enough. See the tears in my eyes? These are tears of joy. The meta game is what sucked me in. I feel as if I'm actually in a chain of command. I feel that my decisions matter. That's awesome. Having to manage my political  relations with Generals, my Chief of Staff, Hitler, bloated Goering and many others is what makes the game stand miles above any wargame I played in the last 25 years.\n\nI am in my second game vs the AI, turn 3. This turn I mainly brought my armies in position, Army Group Centers and Army Group Norths Panzer Groups stand ready to encircle large contigents of soviet troops next turn. I can't wait to do see my glorious plans come to life. Once I played 2-3 games vs the AI I will look for human enemies. Just you wait! :)\n\nSo, enough talk. You like wargames? You like WW2? You like making hard decisions? You are able to concentrate and read text? You like the feeling of being a commander in the biggest war in history?\n\nGet the game, it's worth every penny - a labor of love.

Strong role-playing mechanics that make for some interesting decisions and a political system that kept me playing for a solid 6 hours straight without coming up for air. While I'm no where near finishing my first campaign, I can safely say this game deserves at least a glance from strategy gamers... whether they are fans of wargames or not.

The Germans code-named the invasion Operation Barbarossa and their intent was to defeat the Soviet Union before winter. Anyone who knows a bit of history knows how that worked out...\n\nAs the German player you are placed in the role of Franz Halder, the Chief of Staff of the eastern Theatre of Operations. You are not Hitler - you are not even the highest ranking German officer! This is VERY important to game play as you navigate a myriad of relationships with superiors (including der Fuhrer) and subordinates (Army Group commanders) who EACH have a bias in favour of (or against) you and an overall "relationship" level with you (from say Terrible to Superb and everything in between). This relationship network is variable from game-to-game.\n\nOn the Soviet side, you play as the big guy, Stalin, and get a larger measure of control than Halder, but you are paranoid! If things start to go wrong on the front (losing territory) you have a "paranoid episode" and start executing commanders who you perceive to be a threat to you! Needless to say, this grinds the whole Soviet command and control apparatus to a halt for a few days.\n\nAt its core, DC:Barbarossa is a hex and counter wargame but the role-playing aspect outlined above makes this game unbelievably immersive and interesting to play. Casual players will not like having to move and attack with hundreds of divisions while managing supply etc... but for grognards this is no problem. It takes about 30 minutes to do a turn so this is not a "twitch-fest". The game is more streamlined than monster games like those of Gary Grigsby, however.\n\nI have played exclusively against human opponents, but according to the forums, 90% of people play against the AI and many have a LOT of trouble winning even against lower levels of difficulty! As a human-human struggle, this is BY FAR the best computer wargame experience I have ever had in over 40 years of board wargaming and computer gaming back to the C64 days.\n\nThe designers are actively tuning the game balance and supporting the fan base's requests for new features but they are also turning their thoughts to a new game using this engine. This is great news.\n\nIf any of this is remotely intriguing for you, check this game out!\n\nNOTE: I have several dozen PBEM games completed and hundreds of hours of play prior to the Steam release today!","April 29","true","0.1"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","33","52","6","0"

I love world military history and am a master of Hoi 1,2 &3. I also have played ck2, panzer corps and other games in the multitudes of genres to death. I have stayed away from these Decisive Campaigns because of what I perceived as a limited scope. I said to myself, I don't want to just fight to paris or just to fight the eastern front then have the game be over. This kept me away for years from these types of games and damn I've been cheating myself.\n\nThis game is the perfect mix of strategy, tactical combat and role playing. It is a an excellent addition to any fan of military history, strategy, tactics or lovers of the turn based game. What is so very unique is the multitude of decisions you get to make as the overall commander of operation Barbarosa. I can not stress enough the journey you get to make as both officers above and below you haggle, beg, demand and interfere with how you execute the war. While these games have been around awhile, they are relatively new to steam and this is absolutely a fresh take on ww2 that I'd like to see more of......what this game does absolutely better then another other is put you in the generals chair.\n\nAs far as specific mechanics go.....the learning curve is actually very reasonable as far as strategy games go. Inside the game are 14 approximiately 2-2:30 tutorial videos explaining the mechanics and it is clear, concise and all relevant material. The game has a huge manual is thats your thing but you don't need it, after the videos, play one turn, get the reports from your next turn and it all falls into place.\n\nAnother thing i was concerned with was replay value, this value is different to each person but to me it does that job in two ways. You can play as stalin and control the soviets, which is excellent and because of how each side had to wage the war you really get 2 games in one. Another way they make it replayable is by having some very important option buttons for your game, you can choose to play historial or a more fluid game with more possibilities. You can also choose to have geneva convention rules apply or more realistically where they arent being followed. I applaud them for the historical context and the choices you have to make as commander.\n\nthe tactical game is easy to learn yet mastering it is going to be on your individual ability to handle not only combat, but logistics and juggling priorties since you are in overall command of all 3 theatres or army groups north, south, and center.\n\nIf you like strategy, tactics, turn based gameplay i highly recommend this. If you are a beginner or veteran war gamer that wants a deeper, richer and more immersive experience I highly recommend this game. Feel free to ask me any questions I'm happy to share my thoughts with like minded gamers.","May 12","true","112.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I suspect newbies to the genre will find this one of the more accessible titles around, though you will still need to do a lot of micromanaging and the sheer amount of units that you need to individually control may be intimidating. Smaller introductory scenarios, maybe limiting you to the role of an army group commander for a single theater (eg. north, central, south) would be a welcome addition.\n\nThe logistics system is one of the most intuitive I've encountered in an operational level wargame. All of the information is straightforward and easily accessible. If you don't have enough fuel, it's easy to pull up information about why. Other than that, veteran grognards won't find much of note in the battle system to write home about. But that's OK, it sticks to a formula and does it well enough. The AI is competent and a worthy challenge. It seems easy at first, but wait...\n\nWhat differentiates this game from other wargames is the decision and staff system; you need to negotiate and compromise to achieve your objectives. I've not actually seen anything like this done properly before, and it's very cool! For example, one of the significant issues that arises is how to proceed with converting Soviet railway lines to be compatible with your German trains. Going for the the "I don't care, do it was fast as possible" approach will likely put your supply officers off side and make them less likely to support you in future, while opening you to other potential problems like train breakdowns, partisan attacks, etc. But slowing down to install signals and water towers, provide proper security, etc. will irritate some of your army officers, who want those supplies *now*. And when they don't get enough supplies, they'll be reluctant to push as far as they possibly can.\n\nAnd don't forget Hitler, trying to micromanage everything you do...\n\nAnother interesting aspect to this decision system is that a toggle option in the menu can enable or disable controversial material (disabled by default so as not to cause offence). It's handled intelligently, without glorifying atrocities. It adds an interesting ethical dilemma, though - do you spend significant political capital trying to stop Himmler's Einsatzgruppen, or not bother and focus on winning the war instead, using that political capital on other things? I appreciate that the development team decided not to ignore this; most wargames do. It's an interesting challenge trying to be the good guy fighting on the side of the bad guys.\n\nIn summary, this game makes you feel like you're an actual general as opposed to "Army God" (with the caveat that you can turn off all of the above, and play like a traditional wargame if you choose). This aspect alone makes it quite a clever game, and a unique take on what was possibly the most brutal conflict in history.\n\nDefinitely recommended for genre fans looking for a somewhat different take on the formula.","May 1","true","24.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Your superiors and subordinates will always look up to you and your decisions will affect their relationship with you, which in turn may affect the operational aspects of the Barbarossa Campaign. The game comes with a nice video tutorial available in the main screen and you may refer to it if a point remains obstruse.

The single act of choosing to read the manual instead of starting the game will consume game time while the main menu is open! Close the start just after choosing "read the manual". I **hope** this won't 'consume' game time...\n\nThe advertising screen suggests a very overhead, management oriented game, where you basically gives directives and generic orders and let your captains do the details... But it is *not this*: it is a simple wargame where you have to micromanage every attack and move in the game. The chain of command is becoming more and more of a cryptic thing to me... The effects of relations between your general and the captains, that is the *main* feature of the game ends up in responding question over question, with little obvious results. The effect of your relationships with the division leaders is not something perceptible.\n\nAll this would be ok, if the interface wasn't so clumsy: I had to read the full manual even to start the game.

No way to quickly see what units are left to move.\n- Tutorials are videos that you must watch outside the game.\n- The menu steals game time.","May 22","false","11.8"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","0"

I've dithered a lot on if i SHOULD review this title as it's clearly a game with a very specific audience that doesn't really mesh well with the overall gameplay idea's [removed: most people] I look for in a Grand Strategy turn based game.\n\nedit:\nWhen i think "Grand Strategy" and where this game "missed" the mark for me that i came in expecting a mix between Europa Universalis 4 and Total War.  A solid PC title set in WW2. Instead i got a Solid WW2 set in a poor PC experience.\n\nYou can watch the full video  here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3uBCzxv3F4\n\nTextual:\nAs always, a short summary can never compare to a full video review - as such please watch the video for the best possible impression of the game.\n\nSo this covers Germany's attack into Russia during the spring of '41. The title offers a full campaign playable from both sides with a few modifiers for the various options so you can customize your experience. From Historical, to more and less detailed decisions.\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, this game is AMAZING - and thats where people come from when they like this game... And i cant complain at all about their multiplayer method for turn based a-synced play. The level of detail and nuance in every decision you make,every piece of information available, every parameter from available supply trains, terrain, weather, political standings and so on and so forth... it's absolutely phenomenal.\n\n..BUT.\nAs a PC Game overall, i feel it's REALLY weak.\nthe sound & graphics are beyond weak. they are limited, sub par and have had no upgrade that i could find compare to their other titles. Which is also where my final critique is from...\n\nAs a full priced release, the game offer no new improvement to the PC release, offers no rebindable keys, not even the option to change resolution, has no actual full screen mode and also has a tenacious dislike for constraining the mouse to window.\n\nOverall, i can ONLY recommend the title if you REALLY want the historical accuracy, methodical planning of each move and detailed units... but if you want a good PC gaming experience, a in dept RTS game or any deviation of from the campaign...\n\nThis isn't anywhere close to it. and for the third game in the series, having no improving to any technical system that i've found is a damnable.","April 30","false","5.6"," 38 of 97 people (39%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","39","38","97","5","5"

Demy turned me on to the series and mostly liking anything SLitherene puts out I tried it.\nBeen mostly rolling as Stalin and playing PBEM++ game with DEm currently. this game once you get the basics continues to draw me in , the depth is amazing . I FEEL AS THOUGH i HAVE  reallY only scratched the surface ,BEST PART SO FAR for me has been  the operational aspects of the sim\nwhen playing as COmmie I find myself trying to sort out armies and get them lined up correctly is emense fun, can really grasp that feeling of being desaparte and trying to be diciplined at the same time,\nI would recommend this game flat out if you like the OST front get this gaME ,\nmade me pick up about 6 books minimum and dust them off to read all over again the struggle at the Kickoff June 22nd 1941,\nI have played +60 hours\n, I got lucky and SLith sent me ... get this a 38% discount for being a slith member for 12 years... anyways i got the game direct from them and realized later  that gave me free steam key ,\nI had tried before to write review but at the time I did not have the steam key ,  this game is LEgit---> lovin IT","May 28","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
