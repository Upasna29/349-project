"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/290380/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","Micron is a fun puzzle game consisting of 51 levels (plus 12 bonus); the objective in each level is to guide a stream of balls towards the exit by placing some special obstacle tiles that change the stream’s direction: there are vertical/horizontal blockers, diagonal ones and teleporting gates (that are unlocked during mid-game levels).\n\nThe first half of the game is fairly easy, the puzzles are not very complicated and have nice solving ideas that sometimes can seem to be repeating a bit too much, but this wasn't an issue for me. However, the last few levels are pretty difficult and the bonus levels are extremely challenging to the point of frustration because you might find yourself trying to come up with a solution for hours and you simply can’t find any. For those that want to obtain all the achievements in this game, this might be a bit annoying unless they resort to consulting a guide.\n\nAlso be warned that some of these puzzles are timed; you need to coordinate to the second the timing of placing the special blockers on the board. This again requires a lot of trial and error.\n\nI’ve also tried a few levels from the workshop and they’re nice and enjoyable; I appreciated that the game automatically downloads the workshop items that I’ve subscribed to, without needing a restart.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","March 11, 2015","true","9.6"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","6"

While this is easy at first, the puzzles get harder continuously, although only few are really difficult. Some can however be described as tricky - if you don't pay attention to the setup and pieces you have, you can't solve them, as you might need to use pieces for more than one purpose.\n\nAfter all, it is a nice little game I would recommend for a price of maybe 1.50 to 2 Euro, as it will take you around two hours to solve everything, unless you get stuck on difficult puzzles.\n\nA smaller version of the game is available for free on Kongregate.\n\nRecommended: For puzzle-fans.","July 24, 2014","true","2.2"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","0"

With its simplistic design and musical sound effects I found it quite enjoyable and would highly recommend it.  The concept is simple.  Balls are shot from an opening and you must place angles and or portals to get it to open doors and get them to the end.  The difficulty is you must put them in the proper spot at the proper time to achieve your goal.\n\nIt is a great game for all ages however those under ten may need help to finish it unless they are unusually patient.  A great game to play with your children though.  Get their little problem solving wheels turning!  The game has some difficult levels but not overly so in my opinion.  I did however cheat on one of the bonus levels and look for the answer elsewhere.\n\nThere are a number of free levels for download in the steam workshop as well.  Just subscribe to them and they will be downloaded the next time you start the game.\n\nI did not find any bugs and was not able to complete any level using less than the full complement of pieces provided.   Note: This is edited because I could not find the level editor. I did find the level editor it is in your steam files.\n\nIn my opinon it would be worth the full price of $4.99 or even better to purchase it on sale!  However I prefer to let the gamer decide how much a game is worth as it is a subjective matter.  Hope this review helped.\n\nEnjoy your Gaming!","January 14, 2015","true","6.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","2"

Guide at least one micron to the final exit, to complete each level while listening to the effect your placements have on the music.\n\nThis game was quite fun. New mechanics are introduced from time to time, and they have you master those before bringing in a new mechanic. When your microns 'hit' objects, they produce a sound effect that meshes directly into the background music. Musically inclined players will get hints in the harder levels if they are on the right track as the effects will confirm their ideas with proper inclusion in the background music.\n\nSound: The background music is very relaxing and is conducive to puzzle solving. Combined with the sound effects as your actions affect the microns, it's a very well done auditory experience.\n\nGraphics: Simple and elegant. Nothing overly elaborate, but again, unneeded for this type of game. Colorblindness was not an issue for me with the red/green in the game, so they must have been far enough apart.\n\nGameplay: Simplistic and easy, when using the mouse. I tried with the controller which it supports but the d-pad movement is too fast, and the analog is a bit slippery. Could be my controller. Keyboard mouse was much easier for this. Difficulty doesn't scale too quickly and you have 51 primary levels to beat. Beat those and there are an additional 12 levels to bang your head against.... while enjoying the music.\n\nOverall: 7.3/10 - If you like puzzle/logic games, this is a definite must have. Challenging in the later levels, and may take a few tries to really get it, but you will get there eventually. Price tag of $5 isn't too bad for what it is. Personally I like discounts and this has been in several bundles. Will likely reappear in one, so if you see it there, be sure to grab it. Or just pay for it. If you get a coupon for 50% most people won't complain over that price tag for what the game is.","May 30","true","3.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The game itself and the music is neat, that's for sure. As for the complaints (actually complaint) about the "annoying music", it actually is relaxing music and you could just turn it off anyways. The difficulty curve is good as well, people complaining that there were "way too hard" levels within the first 10 levels have clearly not played any puzzle game in their life. As for the controller support, why would you need it? This game is perfect to relax for a couple of hours just clicking here and there every now and then, there's no need for a controller.\n\nTL;DR: This game is short, relaxing and worth playing, not sure I'd recommend buying it on full price but you could throw a couple of bucks into this.","September 24, 2015","true","4.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I would consider it purely average, providing good gameplay with fair polish, but treading familiar ground.\n\nI was expecting some rhythm elements, but they really don't exist. Each level has sounds associated with bullet reflections, which helps to generate the music. Nothing is really based on moving to the beat, and some puzzles require actions between the beats. Most levels don't require speed, but a few require timed actions to catch bullets at the right time. The difficulty curve varied widely due to these timing-based levels, forcing several restarts to complete. Still, the game is quite easy.\n\nThe music is fair, but is not a real gameplay element. Most levels are short and can only be solved in a certain way, so replayability only comes from Workshop levels. Puzzles were interesting but not hugely satisfying. Later levels became more frustrating, as one mistake meant a full restart. Once levels feature over 10 objects, I was wanting an Undo button instead of a full restart. Granted, it didn't take long, but the short game length could mean that 20% of your time is spent restarting and rebuilding levels.\n\nMicron didn't do anything bad, but didn't inspire me much. It's a decent game at a fair price, a nice way to spend a few hours but not really compelling you to challenge your mind. I would recommend a sale above 50%, below $2.50 USD is a good time-value. If you are looking for rhythm gameplay, keep looking.

Micron is advertised as a "fusion of puzzle and rhythm gameplay", but the rhythm portion of the claim doesn't really hold water.

The 60-ish levels don't really ever become frustrating, and can all be solved in a reasonable amount of time. In fact, clearing the game 100% only took me a couple of hours.

It's a very simple concept that is immediately understandable, but it turns out that some very interesting puzzles can be created with it.\n\nA number of obstacles present in the levels create the challenge of the game. Present in every level is a barrier that requires four bullets shots to destroy. These do not make much of a difference in the early levels, but create much of the challenge in the later levels where you are forced to cut off the source of your bullets in order to complete the level.\nGates which are initially closed also appear, and they must be opened by a bullet hitting the correspondingly colored switch. In levels with multiple switches of the same color, bullets must hit the similarly colored switches at the same time in order for the gate to open. Finally, there are barriers which only bullets of the same color can pass through.\n\nLater on in the game, portals which the bullets can travel through are introduced. These are a nice addition that add further complexity to the game, but they also make you wonder whether there is anything else that could be added to the game, as they are the only pieces you can place that aren't ones that the bullets bounce off of. Why not have a "vortex" piece that always makes a bullet turn left or right? How about a "splitter" piece that duplicates a bullet? There is a lot of potential for the concept of this game, and I feel that it is not always realized fully.\n\nThe game is also rather short, with only 51 main levels and 12 bonus levels. Most of these are easy and can be solved within a few minutes, although a select few of the later levels are quite difficult. Steam Workshop support helps alleviate this a bit, but currently there are not many user levels available.\n\nDespite this, for $4.99 ($1.49 in the current holiday sale), the game is cheap enough to warrant a purchase for any puzzle game fan interested. The game seems to take a "quality over quantity" approach, and for what the game is, that's perfectly fair.","December 24, 2014","true","53.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, Micron stands apart in a couple of ways:\n\n1. It doesn't get stupidly hard (see caveat below)\n2. It doesn't go on longer than it should\n3. Each level doesn't take too long to complete\n\nMost games of this time get to a point, and it's clear the developer's been holding back some painfully hard levels, and has run out of 'ramp up' levels, and all of a sudden drops you off a cliff.  You're sitting there looking a level thinking "The last level took me 2 minutes, and I've been staring at this for more than 20. What happened?" (I'm looking at you P.B. Winterbottom amongst others). This doesn't happen in Micron... The levels are iteratively harder, and many of the 'nice interlude' levels (as I think of them) give you a strong hint as to what the twist in the upcoming level is going to be, while being pretty easy in themselves.\n\nThere are some strategies you learn, and sometimes you just look at a level, the selection of pieces and it all just clicks.\n\nOkay, here comes the caveat. There are a couple of levels which require you to do something a tad differently to the levels around them: Bonus 9 comes to mind.   For those, there was no choice but to go have a look at a hint.  Every permutation I tried just wouldn't work.  In those cases, it's usually because you need to do something with precision timing, and Ijust hadn't experimented enough.\n\nI like the little tricks it plays with your assumptions on colours, and the ways it makes you think about stretching 'flight time' to synchronise events.\n\nThe game would have only taken me one evening to finish, if I'd played it in one sitting.  All in all, I think about 3 hours of playtime, which was perfect.\n\nFor a quid or two, a nice little puzzler, perfect for a plane flight, train ride, or just whiling away a little time with a cup of tea.","January 19","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles are never really actually that hugely difficult, there were a few that caused me a couple or so more minutes of thinking to solve, but there were only a few of these within a total of 63 levels (including the bonus levels).\n\nYour actual goal is basically guiding these different colored balls towards the goal of the level by placing down varying types of barriers that will, depending on their direction and orientation, bounce them in a different direction. More and more obstacles will eventually be added throughout the game the more levels you complete, like colored lasers that won't let any differently colored balls through.\n\nAdditionally, in various levels, you actually gain the ability to place portals to further influence your control on these various balls. While some of the latter levels are definitely far more complex than the early ones, I doubt a guide would be needed for most of the levels. Personally, for me, all of the main and bonus levels took me about an hour and a half in total to complete. While that's relatively a short amount of time, I enjoyed the puzzles, liked the look of the game, and especially enjoyed the music. Additionally, there are also Steam Workshop levels if one still wants to play Micron after they finish all the original levels.\n\nUltimately, Micron is a rather enjoyable although not frustratingly hard musical somewhat short puzzle game that I would say if puzzle games are your thing, is worth the five dollar price as long as you're fine that it's somewhat on the short side. Otherwise, go for it when it's on sale or in a bundle you're already interested in.\n\n7/10","October 15, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely of the best puzzle games on steam. The minimalistic music works well and helps to absorb you into the game. The main game is a bit short, but the steam workshop allows you to play user created levels, or create your own.\n\nSome of the later levels are quite difficult if you don't examine the puzzle close enough. Stop and think. Backwards deduction helps. Even then you will miss things and may get stuck. If you want a real challenge try the player created content, some of it is insane!\n\nThumbs up.

I could have done better with Garageband in 5 mins. This certainly isn't Circuits (music is the game) or Electronic Super Joy (great soundtrack).

Maybe it makes a sound or something but even then just let me complete my puzzle 5 seconds faster so I can move on.\n\nAll in all, if you like puzzle games you should defintiely play this one, regardless of how simple it looks and how quickly some other people have beaten it.","November 27, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each ball triggers a note or musical segment. The puzzles eventually become quite challenging. It engaged me enough to complete the game, so I have to give it credit there. The graphics are extremely simplistic as is the sound/music, but neither are bad in any regard. Rather, they're quite fitting for the game. If you like puzzle games, this one is probably worth a try, especially if you can grab it on a sale.  7/10","November 29, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other reviewers have summarised the game much more eloquently than I could.  Recommended if you need a quick game between or during whatever you were supposed to be doing.\nOnly negative point: Not really replayable if you have a good visual memory.\nBut you can build your own levels instead!","December 29, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"I can do that!" I cheerfully assure myself...by the third level I am hopelessly stuck. I look around to make sure nobody is observing how monumentally thick I am being, then I remember I'm at home and my partner is already asleep. Phew, that was lucky.\n\nMoments later I stumble upon the solution! I consider roughly waking my partner to show her how clever I am but remember that she is a pregnant insomniac and this may not go down well.\n\nMicron turns out to be quite a lovely little puzzle game. It features a clean minimalist art style, clever and challenging level design and, best of all, a beautifully implemented audio system which syncs the impact of every pellet with a different sound depending on the surface it hits. At its best, this system provided some gorgeously atmospheric soundscapes with sweetly tinging xylophones and triangles mixing with bass and drums or sometimes, just the gentle sound of rain.\n\nIt will take fourteen years for me to finish.\n","September 11, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Using angles, straight lines, and portals, direct colored pellets to triggers to open doors, then get at least one pellet to each exit portal. There's more to it than that, and the interesting thing is that the music is created by the pellets moving through the level. It's interesting, and the puzzles are pretty interesting, until the final few which are just frustrating. Even with a guide, some of them are challenging to pull off. But overall, it's an interesting concept well executed, and a good simple (if not easy) puzzle game.","September 26, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
