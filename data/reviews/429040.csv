Codrin Bradea : Satana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CodrinBradea/","527 products in account","This game reminds me of my life.\n\nAll I see is black and white, obstacles and obstacles and I'm running desperately jumping and dodging to get to the next level where I do the same. Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won’t either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to feel the pain to get you moving on. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to dodge everything coming your way to get to your goals and be on the next level. Figuratively or not.","January 5","true","0.5"," 97 of 108 people (90%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","90","97","108","41","9"

The controls are very simple and by level 11 you already know the full game, its just a case of completing the difficult levels. If you dont like rage games, dont play this. Music is very good also!\n\nI'd give it a 8/10","December 22, 2015","true","1.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

Smooth control avoiding the traps with the Furfly makes the game experience very satisfying . The levels are well designed and advancing through the game they become more challenging. Intuitive choice for contrast colors (white/black) that highlights exactly what needs to be avoided, makes this game different and in some aspects unique. I recomend it for sure! Totally worth the buy . 10/10","December 18, 2015","true","0.2"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","13","23","3","0"

Ok game but mostly as a time waster.  The music is good though.

It didn't grab me but didn't ♥♥♥♥ me off too much either.  Ultimately though it's clearly a game that was meant for mobile.  There are way better and more interesting platformers on Steam.","December 18, 2015","false","1.9"," 5 of 20 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","5","20","0","0"
