It has a lot of fun animals, buildings, and decorations.\n\nMy only complaint is the maps. There are not very many of them and they all have challenging weather which can be a hastle (especially if  you are trying to keep plants alive). Most maps do not have a lot of precipitation which means the gardener constantly needs to water them (and he doesn't do a good job). They are also either really hot or really cold. My plants always end up dying.\n\nThe expansions for WLP2 don't tie together very well. For example, if I wanted to play Farm World, I could still get the Crazy Zoo animals, but thats it. None of the plants, buildings, or decorations would transfer to the other expansion, which is kind of annoying.\n\nAlso the icon is a creepy looking clown.","August 2, 2014","true","2.9"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","22","25","3","0"

Also I had previously read that each DLC is like a seperate game. Each with different animals and content. So was discouraged from buying DLC. But now that they have enabled all DLC to be merged and played in freeplay mode it is definitely worth getting. And after playing the original wildlife park 2 for over 25 hours I had to get crazy zoo as I must have wolves, artic foxes and Australian animals as wolves are one of my most fave animals along with foxes hence my user name.\n\nAnd for those saying they aren't sure how to play, make sure you get the original wildlife park 2 as the first 4 missions for that game are a tutorial which explains how to do most things except build the horrible marine environments.","February 18, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

One thing that really bugs me is how you hire people to work in your zoo. What you do is buy a whole building to cover a small part of your zoo. So you have random buildings all over the place and sometimes in your enclousures. Which really ruin my fun. Also everytime you wanna look at something in the menus, then for some reason click off you have to start back at the begining. Everytime!!!!! At first I didn't care but playing this for 9 hours it gets old. I keep doing things how I want but seem that there is always a problem which makes it feel limited on what you can really do. Plus there are no tutorials which is sooo dumb. Your really on your own figuring this game out........ I give is a 4.5/10 :( not worth.","August 18, 2015","false","10.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

While it was fun for a while it has become super buggy. I also noticed that I was getting a ton of pop ups when I went on the internet. I uninstalled the game because it was so bad I couldn't even use my internet. Uninstalled it and all the pop ups went away!","May 15, 2015","false","9.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","3","10","2","0"
