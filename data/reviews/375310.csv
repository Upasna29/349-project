"http://steamcommunity.com/id/javocmola/recommended/375310/","javocmola","Arxabin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/javocmola/","263 products in account","Be aware! This is not part of the "Mighty Switch Force" series of puzzle-platformers! This is a port of the mobile spin-off, a cute little series of puzzles loosely based around the mecanics of the main MSF series.\n\nThe objective is now to put out the fires that appear on the level grid, using the pipe-blocks to control the direction of your hose's stream. All the levels revolve around this gimmick, however they quickly become more and more complex as more mechanics are introduced. The game eases you into every new thing, but it is not afraid to put your spatial skills to the test.\n\nEverything that made MSF2 great is still there: the cute girls to rescue, the same (fantastic) music, the same protagonist... ¡And also the time challenges in every level, for speedrunners! That is the part where I think the game lacks a bit. The port is fine for the most part, but achieving the best times requires insanely fast hands. This is of course expected, but the controls with the mouse are a little bit clunky at times. It is very clear it was intended for touch screens, and it didn't translate very well. Also, since there is no menu to see the controls or change the options, I discovered very late that you can press the spacebar to use your hose, while using the mouse to move the tiles . That should help the speedrunners, but my suggestion would be to ignore the time trials and take your time on the puzzles. It doesn´t have any achievements to unlock (other than, you know, personal satisfaction).\n\nAll in all, it is a good timewaster. Good distraction, and a decent introduction to the MSF saga, which is soon coming to Steam. However, if you happen to own an Iphone, you should probably look into buying it from the apple store. I believe it is cheaper, and you can take it on the go.","June 4, 2015","true","3.1"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","44","47","0","0"

Hose It Down! is a spinoff of the Mighty Switch Force series that takes inspiration from the classic DOS game Pipe Mania. You direct water through a winding series of tubes to douse fires, tear through mud clots, and save the trapped Hooligan Sisters.\n\nDespite being a mobile port released on Steam for only $3, there's a pleasant amount of content available; unlike the iOS version, the bonus level pack is included in the Steam release by default, meaning players have 50 levels to mess around in. I've clocked 3 hours already, and I'm by no means a completionist. Enthusiasts have the option to beat the developer time trials, all of which are incredibly tough even for quick-witted players. The learning curve is accomodating, and the puzzles never feel too easy or too difficult.\n\nWhile all the music and most of the art is imported from Mighty Switch Force 1 and 2, it should be said that both are excellent. WayForward have some of the most talented sprite artists in the industry, and Jake Kaufman is a composer who churns out instant classics like no other.\n\nWhile Hose It Down! isn't as meaty a game as the proper titles of the Mighty Switch Force series, it's a fun little timewaster that will keep you entertained for a couple of hours. For a casual puzzle game player or a diehard WayForward fanboy, this game is well worth the price of admission.","June 4, 2015","true","3.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

It's a small, rather short, puzzle game where you can only control the blocks in the map and shoot with Patricia.\n\nOverall thoughts on Mighty Switch Force! Hose It Down!This is a charming little puzzle game, I've been always longing to play one of the Mighty Switch Force games and although it is VERY different from the platform-puzzle games that Mighty Switch Force 1 and 2 are, this is far from a disappointment and is a solid addition to the series.\n\nThe difficult curve is mostly fair, but some levels, especially from World 3 onward, may take a good deal of thinking to beat. Nothing particularly horrendous or unfair, though.\n\nA game good for Casuals gamers...This is a fairly straightforward game: douse the fire and you'll proceed to the next level.  The final level of each world requires you to save one of the Hooligan Sisters as well.\n\nSounds simple? It is. That's why this game is good for people who just want a relaxing experience. But...\n\n... It also offers a good deal of challenge as wellI'm sure completionists will have a REAL rough time figuring out how to beat each Par time. While the game itself is not hard, several levels can be very difficult even to figure out-- let alone beat the Par time and get that star.\n\nHow long it can be?I said it's a short game, right? It has 50 levels in total and as of this writing I've clocked almost 10 hours in it to get the Par time right in the normal levels.\n\nOf course, if you are just wishing a run without caring for that the game still can last long hours. The difficulty can really get brain teasing on World 4 onward, so be prepared for not-so-easy to figure puzzles.\n\nControl complaintWhile it's a good game, Mighty Switch Force! Hose It Down! biggest problem is it's (simple) controls.\n\nDragging the pipe blocks can be a little clunky, unresponsive, and that alone can severely affect your Par time every once in a while, particularly irritating in levels you must make a lot of block moving. You must slide in a perfect line or else the pipe block won't come with you; you also cannot slide it diagonally when it would save a lot of time.\n\nLast wordsMighty Switch Force! Hose It Down! is a good game. It's fun, challenging for both casual and challenge gamers. It's well worth its modest price and as mentioned by the developer, Mighty Switch Force HD (Hyper Drive) WILL be coming to Steam.","June 5, 2015","true","18.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HYBRID_BEING/recommended/375310/","HYBRID_BEING","[HYBRID BEING]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HYBRID_BEING/","558 products in account","I would not recommend this game unless you have a touchscreen. Dragging blocks requires quite precise cursor movements - you have to actually trace their path - less they'll just get stuck in a place, which is rather rage-inducing considering par time. Such mechanic would work well with a finger, not so much with a mouse. While that might seem like not that big of a problem on it's own, the game itself is not that long in the first place, and frustration from dragging blocks dampens the whole impression.","February 6","false","2.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eckin/recommended/375310/","eckin","Roundabout","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eckin/","472 products in account","This is a Puzzle spin-off, not a plataformer like the main games of the series\n\nHose it Down! is a great and simple puzzle game, with just as much personality as the main games have. While the game may feel short at first, since it took me about 2 hours to complete the base 25 stages under the time limit for each "Star", I was surprised by another 25 EX stages. At that moment I knew I had to tell the world about this game.\n\nThe challenge is there for those who want it, with the previously mentioned "Stars" in each level, in case you complete them under a certain time. If you just play casually you can still have fun, but the thrill of shaving off each second from your previous best time while trying to get each "Star" is a superb feeling.\n\nThe music is great in my opinion, it certainly made me feel pumped even while facing hard stages and I caught myself humming some stage themes a few times.\n\nI do have one complaint, and it is the control. This is a port of a mobile game, and it shows. Dragging the blocks around can be a little iffy at times, and you must make horizontal or vertical moves only, if you by mistake try to move a block in a diagonal (even if you have space for it), you may end up not moving the block at all. This can be an issue while trying for better times, leading to frustration.\n\nAnd I haven't found a 'gallery' option in the game to check the cool pictures you get after each completed set of stages. Bummer.\n\nEven with the controls being a little annoying at times, I still recommend the game for its price. It's a great pass time and challenging too.","December 27, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This time around, its a puzzle game of the Slide Puzzle/Oil Spill variety\n\nOnce again you control our mighty Firefightress, but she doesnt do much moving - you control plumbing blocks within the buildings, moving and flipping them to reach and extinguish the fires.\nthe Stages are each 5 puzzles long with the 5th being a "rescue Puzzle" where you have to extinguish all fires and rescue a person from the grid by building a path to the ground level and have her exit right.\nEach Stage introduces a new Item/mechanic, such as flippable pipes that turn 90 degrees and cant be moved, Mud as a destroyable obstacle (similar to fire, but not needed to finish the stage) or Neon Pipes that only show what pipe they are when in contact with water.\nThere are 5 Stages in the regular campaign as well as 5 EX-Stages (5 levels each) for a total of 50 Puzzles\n\nthe music is neat and pumping, but has some little knacks here and there, such as bad looping (song started over and then immeadiately jumped to a part in the middle)\n\nthe game is rather short but for the price, I would say its worth it","October 16, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are no options, not even volume options, and the controls are entirely based on the mouse, except for actually hosing, which is based on space bar, although nothing in the game tells you any of the controls.  Neither is there any tutorial for how any of the blocks work.\n\nOr, for that matter, any story at all.  I know "Patty Wagon" has a backstory because I see other games with her in it where she's a cop, but it's not covered in this game, so I have no idea who any of the characters are, or why she's a firefighter now. I guess "the building has strategically placed fires and blocks you can apparently control through firefighting police telekinesis," is the only story you need.  Clear five levels, and you get a reward of an image Patricia Wagon burning her smores at a campfire with two other girls who are never introduced before being told to fight more fires.  Who knows why!\n\nI'll give this a thumbs up because it's cheap and it more-or-less works as advertised, but it still feels like laziness on the part of the developers to not even bother with some of the mandatory basics of making a PC game, like options menus or telling you what keys do what...","January 1","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It still has the same great art and music, but instead of being a platformer with the switch mechanic, this game is a sliding puzzle game where you have to slide blocks with gaps in them to align them in ways that let you spray water from the bottom left corner into the grid to put out fires and rescue people. It's still a fun game, though the sliding controls are finnicky every now and then in ways that can easily mess up your attempts to finish stages in the par time. It's only $3, so if you're into sliding puzzle games you might as well pick it up I guess.","June 11, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","8"
