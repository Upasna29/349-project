Most of the content is locked away behind a paywall.  And I don't mean cosmetic items on doo-dads to make you level faster. Most of the actual CONTENT you have to pay for. It's free to play in the same way WoW is free to play... you get to play some beginner content, and then you have to start paying to continue.  If you don't pay them at least $5 to upgrade your account to "premium", you are basically on your own to play a trial. Even if I wanted to give items to new players that are free to play (which I do), I can't, due to the very restrictive limitations on free players, and even premium players.\n\nSo, assuming you pay... is it a fun game? It varies mission to mission. Some mission mechanics are downright idiotic, with no fix in sight (Stompa in HH... players will know what I'm talking about... or even Paradox Wave for that matter), while others are reasonably satisfying to run (Desecrated Cathedral is a good 4-man mission).  But the learning curve is STEEP.  There are many ways you can fit your character, but only a handful of correct ways. Many players have been carried all the way up to the latest tier (currently tier 7), only to have to come to terms with their utter lack of understanding of the game, and are now expected to perform. Be prepared to suffer through many unsuccessful raids as you try to progress. And don’t even bother trying to progress a villain character at this point… the villain side is all but dead.  They were going to have cross-faction mission support on the last update, but it was cancelled at the last second… that leads me to the final point…\n\nThe biggest issue with the game at the moment is support. Since Daybreak took over from SOE, support is now cut way back, and certain employees maintain clear grudges against players who raise issues that they would rather not deal with.  Both myself and the youtuber “MUD2MMO” encountered this issue with Ted Stone, aka “Mepps”, the Community Manager. When raising awareness for issues with Game Update 47 earlier this year on the DCUO forums, we were both banned.  After a few weeks passed, Mepps admitted to the problems we rose, but never apologized or repealed the bans.\n\nVerdict? Pass, until it's verified support has improved.","October 18, 2015","false","905.0"," 445 of 530 people (84%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","84","445","530","27","36"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redeemerd/recommended/24200/","redeemerd","RedeemerD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redeemerd/","1009 products in account","I’ll start by saying that I started playing this game since it launch and it wasn't on Steam, so the amount of hours I've put into it is sadly more than you can see. Also I am an Legendary/All Access member, so I have no restrictions in this game that you as a F2P player might encounter. I leveled a F2P character to the maximum achievable point, and I can tell that the only restriction that you will feel is the character slot limit (if you want to try all mentors and powers) and 1500 cash limit (you are allowed to carry only this amount with yourself, if you go over 1500 it will just go to the escrow and you won't be able to access it, only by paying). You can invest 5$ and some of the restrictions will get lighter, but the maximum amount of cash will be 2000, and believe me, you won't really feel it.\n\nI once wrote  loving review for this game, it was in 2012. Time is moving forward and yet the game does not. There was once a great amount of charm around this game, the road from 1 to max level was fast and colorful, and it was all based on quests. Yes, quests, filled with brilliant voice work and actually building up to the idea that Justice League will accept you as their member. Although there was a part of me that didn't really like this idea of levelling like a sidekick (after City of Heroes and Champions Online), but I was intrigued by the idea of what will open when you actually become a member. And then, after reaching max level, the problems started.\n\nLet’s talk about the endgame structure. After reaching level 30 you get introduced to a new vertical levelling system – Combat Rating(CR). All the endgame content is divided into Tiers, and each tier requires a certain amount of CR. Each tier consists of a few Challenges (Solo missions), Duos (2-man content), Alerts (4-man content) and Raids (8-man content). From each of this activities you get random loot drops (once a day) and a certain amount of currency that you can use to buy better gear. The better the gear -> the higher the CR -> the higher the tier that is available to you.\n\nSo, let us continue. With introduction of new Raids and Alerts, the story still treated you like a sidekick. But that isn't really a problem. The problem was, that there wasn't an actual story behind any new content. Yes there are few Investigations/Briefings(game's variant of Data Logs), a few cutscenes and an "epic premise" behind the scenes, which you don't have an ability to enjoy. In all the modes you get a little glimpse at something epic. And that's it. They did try to implement daily story missions in some DLC's but the last fun ones were in "Home Turf", since then it was only getting more boring.\n\nNow remember that to get further in that little story, you need to have an appropriate CR. But until reaching the needed CR to open a new tier of content and some development on the story, you're just replaying the same few alerts over and over, grinding as if you're in an Asian MMO (which are changing to the best lately). Without any variation. Until you reach a new tier you are just replaying the same few activities. And the sad part is, that they reuse the same content in every new DLC, you will see instances that were there even from the launch of the game. And every new zone that they actually create in the latest DLCs are suffering from a copy paste syndrome, where the starting zone is something new, but when you walk a few meters all you get is catacombs with one repeating section. I've heard an argument that maybe they do this so that PS3 will run it without problems, but come on, Defiance on X360 has more variety.\n\nAnd that is the main point, comics are all about the story and characters, so was this game (from 1-30 levels). But in the end the focus shifted and instead of creating and implementing new campaigns, they create a few grind arenas. And after you reach that maximum CR there is nothing to do, except maybe feats that grant you some Skill Points, but you will need to replay the same content that you will probably hate.\n\nOne thing that you can actually praise the development team for is balancing and patching. Although this praise can be nullified, because when you see their live stream where, after this many years, they are proud that some Bosses are no longer turning instantly, but they do take their time, it is just preposterous. But they do balance the powers towards each other, although instead of creating different instances of your power in PVE and PVP, they meshed it up and occasionally PVP players will cry about something, which will lead to PVE nerf for that power and brake someone’s style of playing.\n\nAll in all, I do hope, that they will get back to their roots of creating stories and original content. Now that SOE has become somewhat independent, it can lead to great things or turning the money into a complete cash-grabber.\n\nIf you are interested in this game, don’t invest money. Just play the game from 1 to 30, after that there is absolutely nothing, that is worth your time. Although, if you really like DC Comics, grinding, praying to RNG and story isn’t that important for you then go for it ^_^. If for you story is a must and you want to feel involved in DC Universe, then just go from 1 to 30 and forget about this game. Your time and money can be spent better. To everyone else, who don't look for Superhero MMO and DC Comics, I cannot recommend this game.\n","February 12, 2015","false","279.4"," 445 of 537 people (83%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","83","445","537","35","37"

A remarkable balance between gear dependancy and flexible, action-based combat makes the game progressively more interesting as you fight your way through a variety of well designed maps and boss mechanics. However, the skill system may seem rather simplistic at times.\n\nContent is plenty, often you may find yourself re-running certain raids and instances for marks and specific gear but the polished combat system makes this experience anything but a grind.\n\nThere is a good amount of character customisation and an impressive amount of clothing items ranging from casual, iconic to just plain wacky. This combined with a wide range of power sets allows you to make a character specific to you.\n\nA caveat: The free to play model of this game is severly limited. Bank space, inventory, money (all of which necessary for a comfortable progression) are restricted to a point of frustration, especially as you enter harder raids, where a single potion (soda) can entirely drain your bank balance. While it is possible to individually increase these assets, doing so, and buying the many content DLCs, will cost upwards of $100 or a $15 a month subscription.","December 3, 2013","true","046.5"," 218 of 267 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","218","267","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spamang/recommended/24200/","spamang","Trump 2016","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spamang/","144 products in account","Awesome concept carried out decently. The combat is good and is mostly fluid, and PvP is a lot of fun. The quests can get a bit dull, but they break the regular MMO grind by throwing in boss fights every few missions and lots of rewards for exploration and story completion. The story itself is decent enough, especially in Gotham where you take on Bane and Scarecrow. The only major flaw in the story is the HORRENDOUS voice acting for the Brainiac characters and most of the cops in the nightclubs and police stations. The voice acting on those characters is so laughably awful it completely breaks immersion and sometimes actually makes me laugh aloud. However I will say that the voice acting on the hero and villain NPCs (Joker, Superman, etc.) is fantastic. It's really awesome to fight alongside Batwoman to take down Scarecrow, or Superman to take down the Brainiac horde. There are also some annoying things that should be addressed:\n\n1) When flying/running near enemies, if they attack you just once it slows your movement speed drastically, making navigating the city below the rooftops nearly impossible.\n\n2) Sometimes stun abilities just won't work on certain enemies with no explanation as to why. There was a boss fight in which we fought Power Girl and she was regular size, no outstanding special abilities, but was completely immune to being stunned or knocked down, which was annoying because my character was control and that's the entire point of my build.\n\n3) The flow of melee attacks can be awkward at times, mostly due to desync between players.\n\n4) Enemies that have stun and knockdown use it CONSTANTLY, and you have to sit there spamming shift to get out of it.\n\nOverall I give the game 7.5 out of 10, and would give it an 8 if they patched some of the player desync issues.\n\nALSO, forgot to mention, the game has a decent community and a lot of older players are helpful to new players.","June 24, 2014","true","38.1"," 111 of 132 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","111","132","0","0"

Some people claim there is a good, loving community always available to help. Some say it's an acidic community that leaves people feeling insulted. Personally, it depends on when you log in. To be honest, while MMO's are frequently about community, so much of this game could be played alone for the Super-Hero experience.\n\nThe game is, very much Free. While high-end content requires DLC expansions, you can play from Level 1 to Level 30 (Max) without much care. If you want to play certain powers, then yeah, you have to buy something - but despite a lot of claims, these powers aren't the powers you "Pay-to-Win" for. It's no different than when other MMO's release new classes. The builds are broken. There are exploits, but after a patch or two, the power levels match up again, and it becomes about skill once more.\n\nAs far as the Combat goes, it has a Rock-Paper-Scissors feel quite often. Melee breaks Range. Range breaks Block. Block breaks Melee. While annoying at first, it allows you to know that you should always be able to escape an otherwise inescapable combo by just knowing what breaks what. Melee Character wailing on you? Block it. Dual Pistol Character kiting you at range? Hold Melee and get a lunge in (every Fighting style has a lunge of some kind).\n\nThat's another thing about the game that's rather nice. The fact you get to place the Fighting style of your choice, with the Power style of your choice allows you to create a custom "Class". And with each Power having two different trees, the variety increases more. A Bow/Nature (Flora) will play a lot different than a Martial Arts/Nature(Fauna), even though they are both essentially "Nature" Classed.\n\nSo... yeah. All in all, try it. It's free. It only costs you some Bandwidth and Disk Space. If you don't like it, Uninstall for a free "Refund".","March 12, 2015","true","277.2"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","50","56","7","0"

The world is really cool, especially if your a DC Comics fan, and the pre-30 bosses are some of the better MMO bosses I've seen. Also it features a really cool appearance system that lets you customize character looks without sacrificing stats.\n\nHowever, post 30 you will encounter extremely boring and generic raid bosses, a restrictive balance system that thwarts creative builds and a long grind for gear with little fun to redeem it.

Lex Luthor, who saw Brainiac invading, left the rest behind to be destroyed and travelled to the past, warning the present heroes of the upcoming threat. Using Exobytes, technology stolen from Brainiac that was stolen from the heroes and villains of the future, he allowed the entire of Metropolis and Gotham to have superpowers to defeat Brainiac.\n\nAside from the story, the gameplay is very diverse and gives you plenty of opportunities to display yourself. In character creation, you choose from plenty of powers (some requiring DLCs), weapons (one currently requiring DLC), and three movement modes (Flying, Super Speed, and Acrobatics). You can also choose side, personality, and mentor. Choosing a side means you're either a hero or a villain. Your personality reflects how your presence affects other players (how they think of you), and mentor (which kind of hero/villain you are). Depending on mentor, you can be a magic, meta, or tech character, and you will do two mentor quests in the entirety of the story (which is not much, but it's better than listening to Oracle or the Calculator all the time) and fight the nemesis of your mentor (Lex Luthor, Circe, or Joker). The story in this game is pretty much known to the community as the tutorial. It shows you around, has you geared up, and ready for the main part of the game: Increasing combat rating or PvP combat rating.\n\nOn the topic of PvP, there are five kinds of ways to PvP: Worldwide PK (PvP phase), Ring War/Diamond Heist, Arena PvP, Legends PvP, and duels. Dueling, at this point, only helps with a few feats, the most you'll get feat-wise would be Arena or Legends PvP. Legends PvP is different to the others as you use a character from the Legends roster. You can be Doctor Fate, Kyle Rayner...heck, even Classic Batman in Legends PvP (note that gear and traits won't make you better in this kind of PvP).\n\nNow on to feats. Feats are like achievements, but they actually account for something. Feats come with feat points: the harder the feat, the more points you earn. Every 100 feat points will earn you a Skill Point (so you don't feel like you're stuck with 15 SP the entire game). The more feats you do, the more skill points you earn, and the easier for you to increase combat effectiveness.\n\nThe next point to note is alerts/raids/duos/solos. These are pretty much dungeons/instances where you go and do missions related to the instance to earn Marks of Triumph (later tiers will have something different). The higher the tier, the more Marks of Triumph you will earn, and an added bonus if you complete ones with a star beside them. Duos and solos can be fairly easy, as you can do them seperately from your peers, but alerts/raids require you to engage in strategic fights with your allies. If you're not able to engage in conversation and strategize, you won't make it far.\n\nThe only issue I have with this game, for personal reasons, are the DLCs. Understandably, they do need a way to earn a profit, however to make a game Pay 2 Win (P2W), is a fairly bad way of making a profit. To engage in anything from tier 4 and up will require legendary membership or the purchase of certain DLCs to be involved. Other than that, if you do get a DLC, you're treated to it's benefits.\n\nPros:\n• Original story\n• Nostalgic characters\n• Legendary voice-acting (especially Mark Hamill's Joker voice)\n• Immersive and enjoyable gameplay\n• Engaging and strategic boss battles\n• Near-infinite customization possibilities\n\nCons:\n• Pay 2 Win\n• Spawn killing can be abused in PvP\n• Friendly mobs involved in a mission can be killed by enemy players (which leads to delays in progress)\n• Spawn killing while in PvP phase\n• PvP isn't exactly balanced\n• A few bugs here and there (like Cape Carmine Lighthouse lvl 9 mission on solo, being very hard to complete)\n\nConclusion: I would recommend this game for the fans of the DC comics and for those who just love to enjoy a taste of being a superhero or supervillain. If any of you read this and require assistance in-game, do feel free to message me if you're on USPC. ~Permafrost Imp","October 10, 2014","true","697.6"," 65 of 87 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","65","87","3","4"

The game was at its prime when I started (Which was a few years ago); I remember seeing a lot of Heros and Villians doing their own thing whether its missions, at the main hub or doing raids and instances. You could totally get in any of these instances in around 1-7 mins.\n\nNow.....\n\nThe game is a dead wasteland. The only way you're going to get into an instance is by either your friends or some high tier player trying to help another person. Me and my friends have had a lot of time in this game but everyone quit, even the well known players. The only people who remain is the high teirs and unfortunate beginners who have no idea but wasting time.\n\nI would have recommended this game a year ago. I just hope they can pull of something good to bring a large part of the population back so I can once again enjoy this game.

They would still make money but the game would be a lot more accessible to a larger audience. Other games have shown that this is still an affective  way to make a profit, for example Path of Exile< There is a reason the game is dead you basically can't play it for free which is what puts off a lot of players, considering it is advertised to be a f2p game.","November 10, 2014","false","684.7"," 166 of 263 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","166","263","9","2"

There is even a bug in which you won’t be able to collect a certain mission while levelling your character that has never been fixed…& that was 2 years ago, with no fix in sight. ‘Free To Play’? HA!! This game is STRICKLY ‘Pay To Win’.\nIf you don’t have the power ‘flavour of the month’, or aren’t willing to pay real dollars to change to the power ‘flavour of the month’ ($10 US a pop btw), don’t bother going DPS (damage role). You won’t be able to get up, or get anywhere near the power ‘flavour of the month’s’ damage (not even if you have more skill points than them) which makes for an EXTREMELY toxic community, totally unbalanced game and a huge cash cow for Baybreak, who as far as I can tell, only want your money & don’t care at all about you or the game. The game is all about ‘skill points’. Skill points are used to give your character permanent stat increases which you can obtain by completing feats. So the more feats you complete, the more skill points you get which should make your character stronger right? Wrong. Like I said before, unless you have the power ‘flavour of the month’, don’t bother.\nPvp was good, until they changed it to accommodate for lag. Basically you have 1.3 seconds (not sure of exact times) to block or counter your opponent. It used to be if you were blocking, you were blocking, if you weren’t blocking, you weren’t blocking. Pretty simple rock, paper, scissors combat system, that is now completely broken. It is that broken that I don’t even bother with PVP anymore.\nI’d recommend playing this game for a bit to check it out, and then go to something else. Don’t EVER pay ANYTHING for this game, it’s not worth it.\n","May 28","false","777.6"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","21","23","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/recommended/24200/","VultureBike","Ernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/","240 products in account","Basically, if you want to get into MMOs from having never really played one, this is the one to do it with. It's incredibly simple and that's the appeal it has to everyone. It tries its best to get you to be a subscription member, though, with most of the content inaccessible without DLC (which is given to you provided you have a subscription). Even if you buy all the DLC, you're capped at a measly 2000 Currency, a meager 500 more than a Free-To-Play user. That's frustrating. I mean, sure, I did have Subscription status for the 3 months I played this game, but I can imagine, considering I had significantly more money earned than a Premium user can hold with one mission, the game wouldn't be fun without a subscription. I should also mention I made sure to grind out those three months because I didn't want to feel like I wasted the money. That was the only real motivation to keep playing after three weeks.\n\nThe game has a level cap of 30 which takes less than a week to get to with casual play and rewards you for doing quests rather than grinding out monsters for 308104123131 hours. So, hitting level 30 is very easy.\n\nThe caveat to this, as there always is, is that being level 30 doesn't mean you're capable of being the objectively strongest character in the game. Regardless of power set imbalance (of which there is a lot), hitting level 30 means you can get your Combat Rating (actual literal level) up to as high as 103 as of the time of this posting. This won't come overnight, though, and likely you won't pass even 80 without buying some sort of DLC. And that's fine. I get it. Sony gotta get paid, son.\n\nThat said, though, there is a lot of possible customization in the game. Each time you pick up a piece of armor, you save the style it has. You can then go back and equip any set of armor and change the styles as you see fit. That tends to work out because most of the sets look disgusting fully equipped. That is the game's main feature. It can appeal to anyone wanting to pretend to be a super hero. All of the Role-Players would love this game.\n\nUnfortunately, outside of this being your first MMO ever, this game isn't fun. Once you get a rotation down, that's it. You're using that for life. Kind of. Maybe you'll have two rotations, one for ranged and one for Melee. But that's about it. You're limited to 6 possible powers, 1 consumable* and 1 trinket*. There's not much room for customization and there are ideal loadouts to use. Using the same loadout from CR 25 or so (Fresh level 30) all the way to CR 90 (where I stopped) got boring real fast. Sure, I made different characters, but the game really has a way of punishing you for having alts through Feat Points.\n\nOh my god Feat Points.\n\nBasically, they work as achievements in other games, except, they're character bound and they allow you to unlock another point to spend in your movement tree or your weapon specialization trees. You need tons of them to be useful in higher CR content. Tons.\n\nYeah, so like I was saying, if this is your first MMO ever, feel free to try this one out. It'll reward you really quickly in the beginning for just playing. If you're a seasoned veteran of MMOs, however, don't even bother with this game.\n\n\n\n\n* if you buy a certain DLC, you can have any combination of 1 consumable + (0-4) Consumables + (0-4) Trinkets where the two (0-4) sums must add up to at most 4","December 24, 2013","false","851.8"," 70 of 110 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","70","110","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fruitsoup/recommended/24200/","fruitsoup","FlyingSpaghettiWhip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fruitsoup/","5 products in account","I bought almost all dlc in this game and i played enough to say that this game is pay to win and here are the reasons:\n1. There are 5 tiers of pvp gear. Free players can get only tier 1 gear(and some parts of tier 2) cause there is a 1500 money cap. If you pay you will unlock the other tiers(you still have to farm the marks to buy them but the free players can't making the competition have no choise).\n\n2.If you Buy DLC you will have the chance to unlock more feats(=skill points). A free player can get up to 130 skill points max and  a paying player can get over 185 skill points(probably 190). Skill points increase your damage, critical chance and many other stats. Some people will say that 1 or 2 skill points doesn't make any difference. That's wrong cause at some point you will unlock the masteries of the weapons and if you put just 1 point in the masteries tab you'll get a huge boost in the stats. Ex: 3 points in the precision slot= 75 might and 90 precision. That's a huge number and there are over 10 weapon masteries.\n\n3.There is a dlc(home turf) that let you use Orbital strikes that does 25k damage to the minions and a huge amount to a group of players(it's an aoe attack). It also gives you a supply drop that recovers almost all of your hp and full mana if you are in pvp gear. The same dlc gives you a sidekick and 3 henchman that will attack your enemies and knock them down(sometimes even kill people without you doing anything if they are low geared). Again this dlc also gives you white mods that are kinda over powered in pvp. There are so many mods I can't list you everything.\n\n4.You can't create higher level socket mods if you are free. Those things are also very strong stuff.\n\n5.You can't create high level soder colas. This soder colas give you most of your hp and always full mana un like regular colas.\n\n6.There is a dlc that let's you buy an utility belt that let you carry more gadgets and consumables while a free player can't. You would think this is just a space/time saving thing but it's not. If you pay another dlc you will get a dlc that let you transform into flash and increase your stats by a lot->and at higher combat rating you will drop another trinket that boosts your stats more than the other trinket I talked about(you can't get this one either as a free player).\n\n7.Now we've come to the funniest thing about this game. Even if you get all the dlc(around $100 or more) you don't get the full game. You will be treated like ♥♥♥♥ by the developers and by the people who got a monthly membership. Your money cap will go up to 2000 from 1500 when you will become a premium member. Monthly subscribers will get unlimited money. There are things that cost as much as 1.5 milions or over in the broker market.\n\nOne last thing that doesn't have to do much with p2w is the cash shop. A dlc cost $10 and changing movement type, power or something else cost the same. A non-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ person would be like " Are you for real?" on that. There are many over priced stuff in the cash shop. The most usefull item is probably the Armory which let's you switch build with 1 button(this is not pay to win). Here's the funny thing, it cost 600 station cash. You can only purchase 500sc for $5 or 1000sc for $10. You will have to spend $10 instead of  $6 to buy that. That's a cheap market trick that leaves a bad reputation on the company(SONY).\n\nI also want to point out that the game without dlc is almost empty compared to other games I've played.  The DLCs are quite small on content cause you don't get many things from them. You'll get a new raid and maybe a new power and that's it.\n\nGood things about the game:\n1.Movement modes->you can have flight, acrobatics and super speed. Strange thing is that super speed is not the fastest movement mode, acrobatic is. Some people that played the game for years say that super speed has the fastest acceleration but it's not true. Flight has the fastest acceleration cause it can go to top speed in less than a second unlike the other 2 movements but it has the lowest top speed. Acrobatics is twice as fast as super speed(tested in metropolis).\n2.Everything is voice dubbed including Raids and other stuff and it loooks like they spent some effort into that. Many times it feels cinematic which is nice.\n3.The story is nice and original but you'll have to get the dlc to explore it.\n\nDo I recomend this game? No I don't if you want fair fights and more competition in online games. I would say try it for fun but that's about it. If I were you I wouldn't support developers that encourage a pay to win system. I spent money on the game thinking it was awsome and it wasn't pay to win. I wanted to support the developers. Now I understand how things work in this game and i'm getting my last dlc today just cause I want to get more skill points and more currency from new raids. Not gonna buy anymore dlcs after this.","September 16, 2014","false","14.7"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","34","48","2","1"

I learned a lot about characters and locales that I've only ever given a passing glance. The graphics are pretty nice in a optimized sort of way. There is quite a bit of varability to your character, though extremely simplified from more traditional RPG's. The F2P aspect really doesn't hurt you too much until you've reached end game levels and are finding yourself bored. At this point, you either decide to move on to something else or start plunking down for DLC, which will include additional character options, maps/arenas and storylines. Unless you jump, head first, into the end game content, the community really doesn't do much with you. You can join a league, but from beginning to entry level raiding, you aren't really worth the time for anything helpful. The 1-30 run can be handled solo, with the occassional interaction with the community, so if you're there, just to see the sights, it's well worth the venture.\n\nPros:\nLots of DC history.\nEasy to learn gameplay.\nGraphics work well from medium to higher end systems.\nLots of DLC, if interested.\n\nCons:\nThe community snubs it's nose at F2P'ers.\nYou only have Gotham and Metropolis as open world content.

I'm currently Premium.\n\nOverall: This MMO has the best PvP mechanics of any other game on the market, disregard the superhero theme, it's not a kid's game, nor is there a bunch of kids playing.

I was also a member of the PS3 beta and I've done my best to love this game since the start.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great action combat. I find it as, if not more, intuitive than Tera (personal preference, let's not have a flame-war).\n- Great performance. Can play in 4K/ 60 with all sorts of additional razzle-dazzle forced through Nvidia control panel.\n- Lots of instanced content.\n\nCons:\n- Almost no over-world content aside from races and collection hunting. Once those activities are done, you sit in your base or League Hall and wait on ques/ LFG spam.\n- Hideously toxic community. I don't think that "console kids" can be blamed soelely for this. In a DPS-centric game (support roles are essentially on the brink of extinction and all content is to be burned as quick as possible), people have simply lost the patience to try, talk tactics, or do anything that slows down their nuking of bosses.\n- Replay ponzi scheme coupled with DOUBLE RNG=Worst loot system since Alloids maybe? So, here's the deal, you beat normal content to access Elite content, which ***can drop epic loot that when paired up with other pieces of a set can give you special bonuses. Sounds great, right? You kill a boss and get two rolls, exclusive to your character from a table of 20ish things, each with varying degrees of rarity. Perhaps an "elite" piece is on there, sometimes two. It's never the one you want, and you need to collect FOUR, from an instance that SHARES THE SAME LOOT LOCK AS THE NORMAL VERSION OF THE RAID (Here, we've arrived at the replay scheme). It costs 87 replays to unlock a raid and you get about 4 raid unlocks for every $10 you spend. Oh, and there's no other means to aquire top end gear other than to raid/ elite raid. Vendor gear is welfare-ware.\n- It's prohibitive at this point to play without a sub, there's too many instances and you need them all to level since your rewards are capped between tiers: you can't skip tiers by gearing up, since you need a basic, rising ilvl--"CR" in this game--to move up a tier. I always sub, so that's not a problem, but don't think you can roll a new toon as a "premium". It will take forever.\n- Nothing but the gear treadmill. So after all that, and with a myriad of complex combat systems, bases, base-mods, henchmen and all the other crap you can do for your toon, it's nothing but a gear race, which is done ad nauseam for ONE new 4 or 8 man piece of content EACH month, for a 3 month cycle. With loot locks and all the other stuff. Even if you try and exploit the RNG system through replays, there's still RNG in play so you have no chance of getting anything over James the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who dies in every boss fight then ends up with a legendary belt and other rare loot on every boss for his troubles (well, the group's troubles).\n- The developers have no clear roadmap that doesn't revolve around dps-tweaking. Loot systems are a mess. They introduced an R&D system that no one uses because the costs are so prohibitive. You get 1-2 new pieces of content that are both the only thing relevant, as well as mind-numbingly boring after a week since you are locked out of any other insteresting content by your--at this point inflated--CR.\n- The Toxicity. This deserves two mentions, since the stuff you see in chat is ENTIRELY unmodded. Imagine Barren's chat, only with the venom and hatred of today. You actually don't have to imaine that if you play DCUO. All GMs are offline that I've seen, except for when one of the developers pops on a toon, feeling lonely, and wanders into the Watchtower from adulation from their dwindling fanbase.\n\n5 years of playing and the game has only gone incrimentally and now precipitously downhill. The entire thing is based on replays and on squeezing and already starved, tired playerbase for every replay-dollar they can. In my wildest dreams, I'd like to see them turn this Titanic around, although--and continuing with that analogy--they've already hit the iceberg and the Captain and crew are too full of champagne and delerious to think the impact was anything more than the flip of their drunken stomachs. They'll be singing and dancing all the way under the waves.\n\nDon't touch this game with someone else's computer--even if you hate that person. It's too cruel.","February 13","false","833.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","15","17","4","0"

It has loads of content(for PvP & PvE), lots of dungeons, raids and the PvP is balanced and has a few maps as well - which are quite cool. The character creation is so detailed and awesome as well. Overall this game is the BEST free-to-play MMORPG - if it weren't for the game's restrictions. If you are a free-to-play player you might not like these restrictions, but I'm okay with them. Such as a maximum of 1500(or 2000 if you buy smth. from the cash shop for at least 500 SC(that's 5€) credits for every character - and that's not much, also you have a lot less Broker, Banker and Inventory slots(again if you have spend at least 500 SC in the cash shop, you will receive a lot of Banker and Inventory slots for FREE, just because you have spent 500 SC - overall in the shop). If it weren't for that and many other restrictions I would give this game a 10/10, but since the developers hardly listen to their player base and there are some restrictions in the game(for end-game content) - I would rate this game 8/10.\nP.S. Restriction to the end-game content aren't all that much(they are CONCERNING PvE PLAYERS ONLY):\n- PvE: You can do 3/4 out of all the episodes per type of dungeons/raids(1/2/4/8 man), which means you can go up to Tier 3/4 if you are a free-to-play player, if you are a member OR have bought some/all of the DLCs then you progress to the most powerful Tier(currently 7 - May, 2015).\n- PvP: While in Arenas/Legends there are absolutely no restrictions! Even if you are a free-to-play player you can earn the BEST gear in-game for PvP(you can't buy it from the Cash Shop)!\n\nI am sure this may not appeal to all people, but just give the game a try! Believe me, as both a PvP and PvE addicted player I can tell you - this game is worth your time! Even if you are a hardcore PvE player just try the game and I am certain that you will most likely enjoy it!","May 1, 2015","true","66.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It won't be less than 8000+ hours for sure.\n\nAnyway, DCUO used to be good before back in 2011 and 2012 when all gear and powers used to be somewhat balanced. There was grinding to be done and weekly raids that reset every Thursday.  Late 2012 they introduced replay badges which allowed players to reset instances anytime they wanted, due to this a lot of players spent replays and got gear fast then left the game because there was not enough content left.  They had this checkmate gear which for first few months was only available for DLC users and was grindable through replay badges.\n\nDCUO has a very small development team and used to be a part of Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) which got sold this year to Daybreak Games. The company who bought SOE is an investment company and does not really care about the game crowd I think. Even during the SOE era the game started going downhill because 1) The Devs are too short sighted 2) They don't have enough budget. They constantly release updates and break things that aren't broken and in the process break even more things.\n\nConstant nerfing and buffing of powers so people will pay 10$ and switch to the Flavour of the Month power and do high Damage. Weapon mastery and Advanced mechanics ruined the fun gameplay aspect of everything in PvP and PvE. Instead of creating your own rotations its just do a certain rotation (some just created macros for this and spam in raids) and you will blow the scoreboards, reusing old maps for new DLCs. Now the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update of them all "You won't get marks for an instance that's lower Tier than your current Tier." So if you are Tier 7 you won't get marks for helping out or doing Tier 5 or 6 raids. This game tries every cheap tactic in the book to get that penny from your pocket and not give the crowd what they want. They cater to noobs or casual players or maybe thats just an excuse to pull out those shiny things from your pocket. After 4 years of gameplay not only did this game manage to get its playerbase into Half but released 47 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates that broke things rather than fix anything.\n\nI will be a DCUO fan which was released in 2011 not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ money grabbing waste of space with no quality it is now. Its not a game where players create a decent Comic based character with own concept now, its about whats the hot stuff in town and make a character with that power. I'm not sure why DC would allow such ♥♥♥♥ bags to run a DC licensed game for them.","May 28, 2015","false","317.9"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","33","52","0","14"

Endgame is seriously limited after you hit max level, specially as you can progress very quickly on that point. Conversely, subscribers might enjoy the game a lot, unless they allow very little to bother them.\n2 - Do not queue publicly after Tier 4. Teams are horrible and, to add to that, refuse to acknowledge their own fault. I don't even bother trying to tell them that (I don't like pointing fingers at others), I play as a Healer (Hi, world, it's Combat Doctor here!) and I just stand there keeping my team alive and trying to keep myself out of trouble.\n3 - Keep your voice chat off. Your ears will be very thankful.\n4 - Play with friends.\n5 - Don't bother about power customization if you want to play a damage role or any role whatsoever. Thanks to Advanced Mechanics, pratically all power customization has been thrown down the toilet. You can make custom builds, but they won't be nearly as effective as the cookie cutters.\n\nPotential 10/10, currently 5/10 from me.","May 20","true","349.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

With a stable like DC and the Justice League behind it, this should have been the end-all of comic MMOs.  But, sadly, the super-ball was dropped.\n\nSetup is easy, character creation is easy- about the only difficult thing is leaving the game to patch overnight and then trying to find a character name that isn't sitting unused on someone's account.  That, however, is where the feeling of making your own hero ends.\n\nThe story starts up- Lex Luthor has come from the future, spinning a tale of a universe subjugated by Brainiac, and he's brought gifts for everyone- exobytes that end up infecting hundreds of thousands of people with superpowers (the PCs).  The Justice League is asked to train the heroes, and the Legion of Evil is tapped to train new supervillains.\n\nWhat that essentially means is you get tagged to handle everything that they feel is beneath them- you never really get to feel like a hero or villain- instead of Batman, you'll get to be one of the Robins, but in a different costume.  You get told to go here and help someone- it just doesn't feel like you get to be the hero or the villain- instead, you're a piece on a board that both sides are playing off against each other.  Think of it like three-sided chess- the heroes and villains battle each other, but both know that if Brainiac wins, everyone's out of luck.\n\nHonestly, there's a solid game in here, but the presentation needs a lot of work- if I want to be a hero, I don't want to be treated like the sidekick- I want to get out there and save the day from villains, not clean up their mooks and wait for some other hero or villain to swoop in and finish the job.\n\nIf the DC thing is important, grab this.  If not, grab Champions Online.  Simple as that.","October 5, 2014","false","49.2"," 48 of 85 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","48","85","0","4"

However this game has its strong points.\n\nPros: - DC fans will love it, its very faithful to the DC Comics, great stories attached to instances/dungeons, awesome atmosphere, great voice acting. (that alone made me play this game for hundreds of hours)\n- Singleplayer (Real-time) game combat system applied to an MMO for the first time (about damn time).\n- Biggest freedom sensantion ever in an MMO.\n- Synergy between abilities and skills are INSANE, makes you think what and when to combo/crowd-control, if you're a Brainiac (see what i did there?), you can be almost invencible at PvP, cuz 90% of players are morons at those synergies...\n- Very intuitive, almost impossible to get lost.\n- HUGE amount of customizations for your character, not only in the creation, but ingame.\n\nCons: - Terrible interface, awful.\n- Steep learning curve, specially at PvP, makes people quit very often, since PvP is open world present almost all the time.\n- Queue system for Alerts/Raids/PvP are broken, estimated wait time 0% accurate.\n- Matchmaking for Alerts/Raids/PvP are dreadful or non-existent, certain necessary roles aren't present sometimes (lel) and you easily could be matched with a full team of non-experienced players against a full team of experienced players, so amusing. :)\n- Chat system: Bleeeuuurrrggghh!\n- Not that addictive for an MMORPG. (For me it's a con for some ppl it's a pro, haha)\n- I love leveling up my character, it's one crucial thing for me in every MMORPG, and DC Universe Online have the worse level cap i've ever seen, a non-experienced player could cap his character in few days.\n- Pay to win in some way, but at least a cheap one.\n\nI feel like the bottom line here and what makes this game fun or not is how much do you like DC Comics, as of myself i'm a fan, i love DC, but i couldn't make my friends play it cuz they're not familiar with the atmosphere, that being said, i only recommend it, if you're familiar with DC Comics in some way.\n\nI would say this game is a 7/10.\n\nP.S.: I really don't know how accurate my review is considering i don't play this game since SOE became Daybreak (worst company of all time), but i'm assuming it hasn't change that much.","March 23","true","60.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","7","8","3","0"

There arent any twists or turns, and you always seem to be doing something irrelevant to the ultimate goal of stopping Brainiac. I never felt i am my own super hero and that i am more of a side kcick as im always fighting someone elses villain, and be issued commands from the likes of batman and superman. it wouldve been great had you also been able to pick from multiple super powers. It also seems as though that for a game heavily emphasizing free to play, the majority of end game and side content are there in the form of dlc, such as housing modifications, chooosing super powers, and even a movement style. In all honesty, i feel you should play a different MMO.","April 13, 2015","false","72.7"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

In hind-sight it's not worth the membership or spending the money, but leveling up to 30 will surely tempt you to purchase the other available content. DONT DO IT. The later solo dungeons have you playing as other heroes so what's the point in getting so familiar with your own? (not-so-bright game devs) ? At max level (combat rating) there's hardly anything challenging for you to fight - including the daily quests, and the dungeons and raids become more scarce, meaning less to do basically and what there is to do isn't fun anymore. Most of the dungeon bosses have the same queer mannerisms that look totally NOT like a super-villain... Anyway, I enjoyed reaching level 30 far more than I enjoyed the game at 128CR. The community sounds more mature than your usual MMO (plus), and there's lots of side quests to make exploring the world fun... but I don't think I needed to spend the money I did to get the most enjoyment out of the game because after a certain point it just ISNT as fun, and a lot of that has to do with poor design (lack of creativity/common sense) on the part of the developers - which in computer talk = move on they have no idea what they're doing.","August 25, 2015","false","235.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","1"

This game is hard on your mouse buttons and seems more designed for gamepads and console gamers.  If you like DC comics, you might like this game.  You have a fair selection of free archetypes and powers for your own original hero or villian, have decent amount of free costume choices, and later earn more powers and skills.  The graphics style is ok.  Uses an Action style of targeting.  Has PVP or PVE oriented servers.\n\nDC Universe Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) based upon the fictional universe of DC Comics. The game was released in January 2011. Also cross-platform with PS4 consoles.\n\nFree to Play - Started November 2, 2011. F2P players can join the game at no cost and can create up to 2 characters. F2P players have a very limited inventory, are limited to $1500 in-game cash (excess is deposited in escrow), and limited to just the free game content.\n\nPremium - If a F2P player pays at least a $5 with Store Cash, or if a player allows his or her Legendary membership subscription to lapse, they become Premium players. Premium membership allows up to 6 character slots and has similar inventory and in-game cash limitations as F2P.  If you play as a premium player, you will need to buy a lot of DLC to get to see everything.\n\nSubscription -  https://www.dcuniverseonline.com/shop/membership\n\nfor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS0b4yMZPRI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRoSd1L2JBc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD3pTAlSvQc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBEx_25Nnxs\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRXb1Lr4G3c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0ULujy7nME\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQG9WiGkt7M\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOr3H6fRiZE\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dc-universe-online\n\nhttp://www.continue-play.com/2014/02/22/opinion-why-dc-universe-online-is-the-best-f2p-mmo/\n\nhttp://www.ign.com/games/dc-universe-online/pc-754948\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe_Online\n\nhttp://dcuniverseonline.wikia.com/wiki/DC_Universe_Online_Wiki","September 3, 2014","true","28.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It's actually a unique system that is pretty cool, since you can get stronger gear without changing your appearance.\n\nThe combat is well done, basically melee and ranged for each weapon that all have a skill tree, with 6 base powers thrown in where you could build two different power trees. This enables quite a nice variation in fighting that you don't see often in other games, though most of the later games will make you end up choosing a role or going DPS, which all follow a tree some random guys posted on Youtube.\n\nBoss fights and adds are all the same thing, just meatshields until you get the drops you want. There aren't many variations in the  base instances and alerts (dungeons), and most of the time, there will be one player that is like two times the CR of everyone else in the party, slaughtering everything.\n\nAtmosphere\nThe story is meh for both sides of Hero and Villain factions that you can choose. It's essentially the same story, just flipped and woozied for good and evil. The only noticeable stray from the basic plot is that you can choose 3 different mentor superheroes on each side, allowing you to follow Metahuman, Technological, or Magical storylines. It's cool and all, but though you're supposed to play the game as your OWN superhero, you end up acting as a sidekick to your mentor or they become nerfed enough for you to contribute more than jack squat.\n\nGraphics are okay, you could prolly handle them at 60fps if you're a PC nut, but it's still suprisingly playable at 25 fps. Just don't be so nappy about the graphics and try installing ENBs and such, since you could get banned for it.\n\nOn DLC\nDon't be scared to play, it's still free up to a certain point, which is optional. I've played the game for 3 years or so (not Steam version) and it does not require payment until you reach around CR70~ for story continuation DLC, but this is well past level 30. I've managed to play for a looooong time without spending a single cent, and only chose to buy a shield just to try it out. Really, if you want to play, just pay about ~15 USD for membership every month to get all content, or pay 5 bucks for trading access. I recommend, if you really want to get upper-tier, membership is the best way to play and get competitive in both PVE and PVP.\n\nShould ya get it?Yes. Friends are optional, but they add fun if you get really competitive. For some reason, this is the one game I retire to after I find all my other games boring. There's just this little spark about it that I like.","March 9","true","131.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It might have been my favorite MMORPG if it weren't for one VERY fatal flaw.\n\nWhile DC Universe is a good time of the surface, you will quickly find that you are incredibly limited in what you can do with a free account, which is to be expected with a Free to Play game right? Sure. Except that with a free account, DC Universe Online limits the amount of currency your PC can carry. Your money is capped at $1,500, and the rest you earn is sent to your "bank" which is locked unless you pay a "withdrawl fee" or pay for the game. This bars you from obtaining high quality gear, practically forcing you to pay. Maybe I would pay for the full version if the whole game didn't feel like a desperate ploy by DC to make some cash. If you are somehow not put off by these limitations, then by all means, play it. But honestly, this is borderline robbery.\n\nNow then, I'm off to play Star Trek Online.","November 1, 2014","false","8.8"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","22","41","3","1"

Maybe SOE being bought out changed a few things.)\n-TL;DR is at the bottom-\nShort and simple; The gameplay is nice, there's quite a nice customization with the clothing and gear in terms of the appearance (Color schemes are in a 3-color palette, it sucks). The Character Creation itself is moderate. There's a lot of choices to pick, but it's more of a "quantity over quality" type of deal. The faces are almost all similar with some actual unique choices. There's nothing like "face-width/height/depth sliders" to get a truly unique feel.\n\nDialogue in the game has it's moments and is overall good, but rarely anything too memorable. You can have your character use every weapon type (except the shield. You gotta pay for that, why?) in the game if you so desire. The powers are also pretty unique in their own ways, but you basically only have access to HALF of what you could choose without paying. (I mean to say choices, not the skills/abilities in the powers themselves) The PvP feels very... fast-paced? You could end up on your ♥♥♥ before you even realize it even though the Combat is a bit stiff, but fun. I guess it's balanced, I haven't been involved in PvP enough to get a good, true feel for it. In my experiences though, I was able to turn the tables on a superior enemy when I played the tactics game.\n\nThey have open-world PvP in the form of: duels, certain areas in the worlds pertaining to a type of gamemode, and your queue-type arena PvP gamemodes. This game is very wide-open, it has its little info-bits to find scattered throughout the worlds too and some unique things to find, like Batman or Harley Quinn in Gotham City. There's Gotham City and Metropolis for you to explore and go around, there's no level-restrictions in where you can go either. There's certain-level enemies scattered about in the world. A level 10 Hero/Villain can go run into level 1~99 enemies and be completely owned or get pretty much nothing from lower-level enemies.\n\nYes, there's a Hero and Villain faction. Each has their own storylines even though they technically go through the same areas. It's basically like parallel universes. P2W elements? Well... From personal experience, I don't believe I encountered anything that was too overwhelming. ALTHOUGH, PAYWALLS... EVERYWHERE... Do you want to save up your monies to go a shopping spree? Well... ♥♥♥♥ YOU! :D GIVE US MONEY SO YOU CAN HAVE MORE THAN 1,500 of the in-game currency on hand! What about if you end up getting more money than the limit? It goes into a "credit" type of bank that you CANNOT ACCESS unless you pay for the MEMBERSHIP. With the Membership, the credits are accessed as if you had it on hand, that's it. And let me tell you, 1.5k currency IS NOTHING with the prices of items and gears when you get deeper into the game. Buying one item can take up half of that 1.5k.\n\nThere's also a "base/hideout" you get for free whenever you progress through the game, ALTHOUGH... YEP, YOU GUESSED IT... ANOTHER PAYWALL... Assuming you want to get the most out of your home. There's features that are RIGHT THERE, but NOPE... "PAY FOR THE DLC OR ♥♥♥♥ YOU!" *sigh* There's also other worlds that you can go to, but... yeah. More DLC to BUY... Even when the portal to the DLC world is RIGHT THERE in the Watch Tower or the Villain's lair (I honestly forgot the name). You can get "rare" and powerful gears in the respective Hero/Villain HQs if you participate in PvP and other ways, might take a while, but still. Though... They might be meant for PvP... but I do remember some gears that work all-round.\n\n\nTL;DR Gameplay/Combat is nice, Character Creation of appearance/personality is a bit bland overall, but the gears/armors/weapons you can equip make up for it despite the color scheme being rather dumb... PvP seems balanced, though no restrictions on levels for who can play. ♥♥♥♥ Sony for all the damn paywalls everywhere, hopefully the game gets turned around with the change of hands. The game feels a bit gutted with all the DLC in your face. Overall, the game is alright. If the paywalls, outrageous DLC and restrictions get taken out, the game would be a solid 83/100. From my own experience, it's a 71/100. "Play the game for yourself" kind of deal. It's still a "free" game after all.","April 21, 2015","true","60.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have spent a considerable amount of time on it and can proudly say, I loved every minute of it.\n\nWhether you're a DC fan or not, this game has something for you. You can play as a Villain or a Hero, depending on your game play style.\n\nEven though it's a Hero VS Villain concept in-game, you will at times find yourself fighting along side each other in order to complete certain instances. There is open world PVP but not used as much as the PVP match-up system.\n\nThere are several powersets and movement styles that can be used, I would explain them all in here but they are always adding more. The best way to find out is to experience it first hand and in-game. The guys at Daybreak games hold community driven events like "FNL - Friday Night Legends" which they broadcast on Twitch.tv.\n\nYou start up with Brainiac as the ultimate bad guy, but soon come to realize that there is so much more happening!\n\nThe PVP and PVE systems are lots of fun. It's not a case of click-spam or hack&slash, but forces one to use a combination of weapon attacks, power attacks and movement to ensure that you stay alive while protecting your group(s).\n\nThe instances are broken into:\n\nPVE\n------\n\n- Solo events (1 user)\n- Duo events (2 users)\n- Alert eventsd (4 users)\n- Raid events (8 users)\n\nPVP\n------\n\n- Lair battles (1v1 / 2v2)\n- Arena (2v2 / 4v4 / 5v5 / 8v8)\n- Legends (1v1 / 2v2 / 4v4 / 5v5 /8v8)\n\nEven though it uses the Unreal III engine that, as we all know, is fairly pretty but cannot really compete with today's games gfx. Not that it effects the gameplay at all, the game itself is still lots of fun!\n\nIf you're still unsure. download and join us!","December 30, 2011","true","200.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

DCUO was such a good game back in the day, everything about this was perfectly fine, until Daybreak took over SOE. Now Daybreak, being money ♥♥♥♥♥s, releases a new episode (dlc) every month, they insist on buying a subscription, never have dlc on sale (SOE DID have dlc on sale every once in a while), and make the player spend money in every way possible. Now, the devs have gone too far, making far too many tiers (I thought tier 4 and 5 were the perfects tiers), always making new dlc so nobody plays the old ones, and finally screwing the loot system. So in conclusion, don't waste your time with this, and even now, it makes me sad to say: I don't recommend this game.","March 21","false","596.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had assumed that if I still enjoyed the game afterwards, I'd continue to pay for a premium account.\n\nThat was my mistake.\n\nAfter I "forgot" the password to log into my DC Universe Online Account on the website, it spent a good 3-4 months doing nothing but charging and charging my card. The first month, I decide to go to the support forums. You need to have your DC Universe Online Password to Access the Support Forums. Second Month, I decided to Tweet at them. They tell me\n\n"Oh, we can't help you unless you make another account on our website. Sorry."\n\nOkay then, I'll just make another account. That doesn't work out for me. The third month, I attempted to contact some form of live support. I search through the finest parts of the internet for a number I could at least phone to get to Daybreak games. And I find it.\n\nThis number.\nThe key.\nThe ring.\nIt will bring me peace.\n\nI go to phone the number, clicking the numbers in utter satisfaction.\n\nClickity, clickity click.\n\nThe phone rings three times before someone picks up.\n\n"Hello?" I plea, desperate for some form of canceling these charges.\n\n"Yes, Welcome to the Daybreak Phone Support Service."\n\nA smile spreads across my face.\n\n"Unfortunately, we don't have it fully set up yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/w4sppf5/recommended/24200/","w4sppf5","Blue Wasp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/w4sppf5/","6 products in account","Probably the only good free superhero game you'll ever find. There's plenty of free content, but you have to pay to unlock a lot of stuff.\n\nThe graphics are great, and I've only encountered a very minor bug.\n\nThe story line is great, but needs added to. It is super hard to continue get stronger after lvl30, but, even if you don't like the game after lvl30, it takes a long time to get there.\n\nThe bosses are recognizable and fun to beat, and each mission is relatively unique. There is so much customation for your character in the beginning it's crazy.\n\nThere are some extremely minor things that I find wrong:\n- The super heroes/villains that accompany you on missions are extremely weak, except in the beginning, which is when you really need the help. Some missions are really hard to complete as a controller, so if that's the way you choose to go be prepared to have to search for a group.\n- The superspeed glitch that makes you fall through the ground.\n- The falling player base.\n- The locked stuff, and the super high prices. If the game was $20 to unlock everything, then maybe we'd be talking, but it costs $60 to unlock mostly everything (not including all the extra episodes) and then a subscription to get everything else.\n- How the game limits you to 1500 in game money (not a lot, especially at higher levels) and then puts the rest in an inaccessible bank unless you buy the game.\n\nUltimately, this is probably the best game I've ever played. Many people have started leaving because DayBreak, whoever that is, ruined something- I have no idea what it is, I just started playing -- but the game is AMAZING, and I can't even tell what they messed up.\n\nThe thing I hate most about this game is that there hasn't been an update ever since I started playing, and there's no new content. I sincerely hope that daybreak gets working on this and makes it better than it already is.\n\nThank you for reading my review, and get this game- Now.","June 15, 2015","true","86.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The DLC's are inexpensive, at $10 a piece, or you can buy the ultimate pack, and any DLC's not included for about seventy dollars, the price of a normal game. Has a free 2 play format that rather seems more like forced to pay, although thats any game these days. With some new additions this game has pretty decent longevity, although some times the prices for additions (such as armories) are not priced to sell. The game is easy to control especially for veteran PC players used to keyboard and mouse operations. The controls feel rather like Bethesdas Elder Scrolls four Oblivion. My conclusion is that with new DLC releases on the horizon is that this game will be around for a long time, bringing interested gamers a fun experience.","January 17, 2014","true","673.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has some cool character customzations,  various enemies, decent fighting mechanic (as long you do not pick a brute as template)and i have to say not many games can switch from flying to walking so smoothly.  One thing that bothered me is that It looked like something a 12 year old would play, yet their was Red Lantern Guy Gardner, known to be one of the most brutal and gory characters in DC universe(still not as bad as Lobo). I would recommend this game, but if your like me certain minor things might ruin your feel for the game. Eye-sore color scheme costumes like purple and yellow, green and pink, and much more... set you on edge, You might want to skip this. The game is well done for a free to play, an if you like DC universe get it, but again (I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID) the color choices by some of the players in that community made me stop, Because i'm an OCD little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and i cant help it.","September 24, 2014","true","3.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

I hate it when games do this, but I still stick with DCUO anyways. Maybe it is my obsession with DC that keeps bringing me back, however it isn't strong enough for me to pay 120 dollars a year to have a full subsription. My suggestion for DC would be to drop the optional subcription and just charge for really super powered weapons and armor that people can choose to buy if they really want to. Thtat would make DCUO the best action RPGMMO in my opinion. The fighting is a blast, the character creation is amazingly in depth AND you can even play the game on a Playstation if you prefer console over PC. It truly is an amazing game, a blast to play and full of tons of fun missions against recognizable badies throughout the DC Universe (or good guys if you chose to be evil). I would absolutely suggest giving this game a try, but don't pay money for extra stuff. We need to let DC know that we don't like the way they try and take our money through extras that should be available to anyone using money you earn in-game.","November 2, 2014","true","14.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","3"

This game is huge, and keeps growing, but unlike other FTP games out there you will be required to either buy the dlc or get a membership which gives you everything to use; as it should, to get to the front lines or highest levels of the game. This is not Pay to Win though just to open up new lvls and worlds, you will still have to grind to get gear to be the best and unlock feats to unlock skill points to make yourself into the strongest character possible, but its worth it at least for me.\nYou can be a hero or a villian and now with cross faction play you can queue up for events on either side and there is very little wait time. ( a huge inprovement.)\nWithout giving a lot away this is like WOW except with superheroes, in that its addictive, highly customizable, and constantly growing.\nI have been playing for a very long time and will be playing probably until the end of the franchize so I may be biased but as someone who has devoted a lot of time and resource to the game I can recommend it, and DO.\nTry it for free, if you like it great, if not it cost you nothing.\n","December 27, 2015","true","791.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

It has a unique combat system which really sucks you in, and the powers you could choose is endless.. unlike "one game" that borders the power of the game yet this game let you be whoever you want! and the best part is you dont need to pay to be Godly.. all the godly equipments are in game. the one in the store are only styles..so thats like okay for me anyway.\nDownload and play it! you wont be dissapointed.","December 24, 2011","true","155.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each character has a movement style(flying, super speed, etc), a power(utility belt, control fire, etc) and a weapon(fists, swords, dual guns, etc). The main flow of the game is similar to other MMOs but the combat is where this shines. Combat is real time. Think God of War. You have a punch button, a block button, a button to hit the enemy into the air for air juggling. Between the fluid combat and having Mark Hamill as The Joker giving me quest, I'd say this was an MMO to keep an eye on.","January 14, 2013","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pinoyGamer/recommended/24200/","pinoyGamer","Van Rijn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pinoyGamer/","91 products in account","The F2P side does have a lot to offer, though most people don't realize it or lose interest in the grind. The level cap is at 30 yes, but once there, it doesn't really matter. Your combat rating, determined by your gear, is what counts and gives you access to higher tier instances/raids. DLCs vital to gameplay and further advancement would have to be Battle for Earth, Lightning Strikes, and Fight for the Light, in that order. Earth gives you access to higher tier armour after reaching a 45-48 CR as well as a raid... if I recall correctly. Lightning Strikes gives you duos and access to central city, and Light gives you several alerts... though with all the DLCs out now and all future releases, it's hard to keep up with paying for it all, back then I'd say buy the DLCs, seeing as you get to keep them all even without a paid subscription, but becoming a "Legendary" (paid sub) member, is probably the better choice, seeing as your cash flow isn't restricted, nor is your inventory and bank storage space. All that technical stuff aside, DC is great for those who want to jump in on the DC Universe, or are long time fans. Controls really are innovative and I have yet to find another MMO playstyle like it. The combat isn't just a point and click and each class/playstyle is reliant on the other when it comes to PVP. Though it does take some time to get used to the pay off is usually worth the grind, with all the flashy and powerful gear, it'll sate all of your comicbook/gamer needs all in one fell swoop.","June 25, 2014","true","417.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Escrypha/recommended/24200/","Escrypha","Escrypha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Escrypha/","72 products in account","I definitely recommend this game. It's one of the best I have ever played. The thing is, a lot of people like to say it's bad because of the way its marketing is handled, but the way they do things is justified.\n...to a certain extent. The DLC they release has licensed stories that go along with them, along with armors, feats, base items, etc... So, of course, I think it's just to have a limit for Free Players' levels.\n\nHowever, I do think the game is in dire need of some changes. First off, my legs get broken every time I attack or get attacked. What's up with that? I can go to Crysis, and fight aliens with fast-paced combat, while keeping real-time momentum, and being able to keep my speed. Why the *foop* do you want to slow us down? I picked Superspeed as my first power, and as soon as I got to the Hive mission around level 9, I got sick of it.\n\n*Acquires Super-speed*\n*Does NOT use it in combat*\n\nThen, I got the Last Laugh DLC, went into the Safehouses (as a hero) and Night Clubs (as a villain), and saw Superman and other flight-enabled iconics flying so fast in combat? Why weigh us down, Daybreak? Why? I think there's no need for this at all.\n\nAnther thing I want to do is make a request, if you're reading this. I think it would be a good idea to make advanced mechanics for iconic powers and movement powers. See, some people play this game to be as close to their favorite super heroes and villains as they like. They even go around with names inspired by those people. As of now, people who use iconics at level CR 43+ are ridiculed, since this game is heavily reliant on teamwork, which isn't a bad thing, so, I think you should actually allow people who want to use these to be relevant in damage output, rather than having them stick with a loadout that everyone else uses, thereby making them have less of a fun time.\n\nTL;DR:\nThis is an awesome game. Their DLC practices are justified, especially compared to games that sell you DLC that's already on the discs.\n\nPlease don't slow us down in battle, and please make advanced mechanics for Speed, Flight (as well as its re-skin, Skimming), Acrobatics and Iconic Powers. Make people who use iconic powers to actually be "stronger than a locomotive."\n\nAnyway, thank you for this awesome game. As I said, I cannot love it enough, and would defend its DLC practices forever, but I do have my problems with it, 'cause no game is perfect. Thanks again, Daybreak.","February 6, 2015","true","919.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After downloading a few gigs on the initial download from Steam, it patched another 11 GB. So... if you do have a slow connection, this one will be one of those "overnight downloads"\n\nAnyway, what can I say about DCUO? I did start playing about 4 weeks after it was launched, and liked it very much early on. I eventually did stop playing, but came back several times. Unfortunately, due to the switch to and from P7S1-Games and an email-addy I cant access anymore, I lost my original account and another one I made.\n\nIt's not THAT much of a problem though, as leveling a char to the cap level does not take long at all. You do a few "main story" quests plus some bonus side quests, and in no time, you are there. So, leveling is not as much a part of the game as in other MMOs, unless you wanna level a ton of alts. That is totally ok though, I like leveling, but don't need days of leveling in EVERY game I play.\n\nThe game itself is lots of fun, and since I mentioned alts: YOu should try a few, try different builds. The weapon sets (like gadgets, swords, guns, kinetics etc.) are tons of FUN. So is the controller-role IMO... most of the chars I made were controllers.\n\nIf you like to, you can build a new char based on your favorite DC char (I made a Batman-inspired gadget-using controller, and on my old account, I made a Flash- and a Green-Lantern inspired char. The latter was pretty easy regarding outfit and powers, as one of the DLCs will give you very nice Lantern-style powers). Or you can go for a totally unique character regarding powers and outfits\n\nThe game is fast, think "MMO meets arcade beat em up". The races and challenges are fun, and one thing I liked was that several of the quest bosses and special dungeons you do at cap level especially (and I am talking about solo-instances) are pretty challenging the first few times. It DID feel like a nice little achievement to finally beat some of these encounters, so that was nice.\n\nThe game never kept me playing longer than a few weeks, but also, I always keep coming back to it. It's fast, it can be quite tough, but it's tons of fun, whether you are a DC fan or not.","January 31, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The massive amounts of expensive DLC are annoying on principle, but I've been able to have a crapton of fun running around with friends and only hit one really inconvenient paywall so far. My biggest gripe is actually the PvP matchmaking. I've tried arena battles a few times and either I'm curbstomping my opponent or I'm getting curbstomped by someone ten levels above me. The download and installation took forever, but it was worth the wait. I love the customization options and especially love that the game lets me display whatever style of gear I prefer instead of trading a good appearance for good stats when equipping a new item.","December 31, 2014","true","102.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Wow\n\nI will tell you what I like about the game.\n\nFirst thing thats very major to me... CHARACTER CREATION!!! ALL OF MY F%^KING YES!!!\nYou can make your character either Good or Evil, look like you or total randomness, don't even get me started on the movement modes and powers, OH BOY!\n\npowers are what you are going to use as special abilities and your combat role, like if you choose Rage from the War of The Light DLC 1, you are going to have attacks that heal you, and have a Tank combat role\n\nMovement modes are very little, there was only 3 before, but know there are 4, the 4 are...\n\nFlying: Makes you fly around the city of Gotham or Metropolis like Superman with ease, a bit slow at first, but getting super sonic makes it go MUCH quicker, GET THIS ONE!\n\nAcrobatics: Parkouring in a nutshell, choose this if your a Batman fan, but when you try to use it, enemies attack you and make you get out of movement modes, which is why I despise...\n\nSUPERSPEED: OMG THIS ONE SUCKS ANYTHING LONG AND HARD, THIS ONE MAY MAKE YOU GO SUPER FAST LIKE HELL, BUT THATS WHY IT SUCKS, SOMETIMES YOU CAN GO TROUGH THE SKYBOX BECAUSE OF IT, AND DO I NEED TO MENTION THAT YOU GET ATTACKED BY ENEMIES LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, FOWARD AND BACK, MAKING YOU LOSE YOUR SPEED ALL THE F%^KING TIME!\n\nSkimming: Dunno, don't have it yet... it has to do with hovering though.... XP\n\n\nAnd back to customization, you can have mentors, the good mentors and what they do are...\n\n\nBatman: Has the most interesting storyline, and tech-like gear, but has the hardest difficulty.\n\nSuperman: Very easy difficulty, but at the cost of least interesting storyline, also gear looks like bio engineered stuff\n\nWonderwoman: Oh boy, this one has a medium difficulty and a medium interesting meter to its story, also gear you it from this look like roman armor.\n\n\nNow for the villians.\n\n\nJoker: Batman's but evil\n\nLex Luthor: Superman's but evil, and I feel no one understands him.\n\nCirce: Again, copy and paste of Wonderwoman's BUT EVIL!\n\nNow, up to one of my only complaints...\n\nI FRIGGN WISH THAT HAL JORDAN AND SINESTRO WERE MENTORS, THAT WOULD INCREASE MY PLAYTIME BY OVER INFINITY, I F%^KING LOVE THE GREEN LANTERN COMICS TO DEATH, AND I DEMAND THEM TO BE MENTORS, MAKE IT HAPPEN SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT, FOR ME AND MY FELLOW GREEN LANTERN FANS OUT THERE!!\n\n\nAND!\n\nIf you chose good, a helper named "Oracle" helps you on your journey, but if you choose Evil...\n\nYOU GET MY FAVOURITE NPC IN THE GAME; CACULATOR!!! HE IS SO HILARIOUS YOU WILL LAUGH ALL OVER THE FLOOR AND HAVE TEARS OF JOY!\n\nOh yea, forgot about the combat system... oops...\n\nAnyway, you choose your weapon in the  creation, and you click the left mouse button to do melee attacks, while right gives you ranged attacks, don't forget to use your super powers still...\n\nOh, the story to, drat...\n\nThe story is that Brainiac wants to conquer the multiverse, meaning he has to conquer Earth (Again Brainiac? Didn't I whoop you in Scribblenauts Unmasked when you tried doing that?) and he succeeded, UNTIL Lexy went back in time and warned the Justice League, and put Exobytes (The things that give you your powers) in the Atmosphere, giving people powers... Not going to spoil anymore, play it yourself and enjoy!\n\n\nAnd thats my review in a nutshell, hope you enjoyed my rant about superspeed, me ranting about how much I love the GL comics (IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE GET ONE!) and Caculator being frickn hilarious, put your opinion of the review in the comments, I can deal with Positive and Negitive.","May 1, 2013","true","294.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JamieDeeRaw/recommended/24200/","JamieDeeRaw","J-Birdsprings","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JamieDeeRaw/","2 products in account","Well I'm not an OG of this game, but I can say for this being my first MMO and what got me into MMOs this is a GREAT starter game and continuos casual game for a ton of enjoyment. There aren't as many players as there were but that's irrelevent because this game's potential is there, the devs are fair, and the gameplay isn't lacking.\n\nNow, with that said I will begin to explain why I decided to say PLAY this game:\n\nPROS:\n\n1.) I've played alot of MMOs and this is by far the one you'll want if you like the idea of FULL control of your created character, power team runs (just like living the comics whih is a HUGE plus), and crazy fun...and I mean crazy hehe.\n\n2.) Tons of gameplay even after you've finished the tutorial (the real game begins with DLC...and the DLC is very pleasing and vast).\n\n3.) The only MMO I've played in which the combat system isn't stale and easily coexists with your characters abilities.\n\n4.) Great Community, though with the exception of some (like in every other MMO) ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who like to complain when the simplest solution is DO WHAT YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD when it comes to getting more out of this game or staying on the retrospect and doing nothing as others enjoy the fruits of what this game has to offer.\n\n5.) Very social Developers-nuff said\n\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1.) If you're expecting this to have vehicles like its comics well you might be dissapointed (but I assure you there is a reason and a day will come when that reason is resolved).\n\n2.) This game lacks SOME things creatively in the point of ordinary things, but I've learned that compared to other games this game still gives it as much as it gets, so its fine.\n\n3.) Lag is forever present, but don't worry the community as I've said will understand-just giving a heads up in advance. Its not a lag thats deathly but its annoying and appears usually after DLC or updates, but lasts rather short.\n\n4.) OG players ranting the game is dead. I assure you it not-people have jobs, go to school, and do other things. We can't play this ALL DAY all the time, so that being said IGNORE those who say this game is dead or dying-its just fine.\n\n5.) Villains and Heroes cannot associate other than PVP combat or combat in general; however, this might change in the future (perhaps very soon actually).\n\n6.) Free to Play to a point, but if you want more you'll have to put down a few buck-and I do mean a few (its not as bad as you think, its actually quite affordable).\n\n7.) Ridiculous prices made by in-game players in the broker; however, there are ust as many kind souls offering cheaper for things that cost a lot.\n\n8.) Free to Play currency and Premium currency are capped at a low max 1500 to 2k in-game which forces you to either pay subsciption fee or buy daily opening for unlimited revenue. I suggest you just put down a monthly subscription and easly have access to all the funds you'll need.\n\n*Well this is my review and I hope it helps-its not perfect but its what I've come to experience from this game. Its worth every penny with friends or solo! This game has more to be shown so expect great things from this and I promise you wn't regret your choice-Play On!","April 12, 2015","true","456.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have way more hours than what steam suggests. However; I did not enjoy the game anymore a couple years back. Coming back I expected the same old introduction, and tired ♥♥♥ quests, that I had already completed. Instead, they acknowledged the age of the game and told a story of the humans failure. They also made it to where as long as you tag a enemy or objective, you will get it, so first hitting mobs doesn't matter as the quests are completed with area based people. The playerbase does a fairly good job in low levels to prevent people from farming lowbies. A lot of people seem to have an issue with daybreak, but I find them to be great, and very helpful. This is a free to play game, but those who complain are the same people who do not support the game. This is a company and they need funding to continue gaming. Not too mention, I also played Planetside 2 as well. Daybreak has a 5 game pass for the price of one mmo. Now I hate Everquest, EQ 2 and Landmark. However; I suggest you play until level 30, if you do decide prior to that to subscribe great...but once you reach 30 on your main, I would suggest obtaining the benefits of a subscription if you are able to afford it. The story feels fresh again, although the quests are the same until you get to newer content. The graphics have been polished fairly well, and the gameplay is still one of the best out there.\n\nIf you are thinking about playing it for the first time, I would suggest doing so until at least level 30, so you can finish the first storyline. It is ftp afterall and the not having the benefits is not going to cripple you early. You can farm a lot for the gear and items you need and/or want. However; the subscription is a convenience, it is not required, but once you start grinding for gear to PVP or whatever you enjoy, it will take you longer.","June 2","true","290.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's more of a co-operative or competitive multiplayer action game, perfect for short intense visits. And because your character doesn't sport rows of tiny icons for a thousand different skills, DC Universe is also perfect for less frequent visits.\nAn exciting new direction for MMOs that's plenty of fun already and should only get better with a few patches under its utility belt.\nIf you're a fan of action, MMOs, or comic books, and if you're looking to commit a lot of time to a single game, DC Universe Online will not disappoint you.\nThey've pulled off two impressive feats. First off, they've successfully launched a top-shelf superhero MMOG which has been a subgenre that has historically been a weak contender in the overall market. And secondly, they've managed to successfully incorporate action game mechanics into this title in such a way that it will not alienate gamers that are used to a slower pace, but will still deliver pulse-pounding action on par with many single player games.","July 15, 2014","true","146.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I love flying and doing missions, but I got 2 problems that I noticed.\n\n1.  When flying (If you choose that super power) and flying fast threw all the colours and buildings etc, you will notice you start to feel sick.  I did all the time when flying, up down, up down, left right all well colours on your screen.  Very disorientating. (How ever it is spelt)\n\n2.  Every mission has the same thing to do and outcome, go here beat this guy up and his hench men or pose... and report back.  This becomes very very boring soon, and then when you max rank you just spend most of your time helping others with a mission because no more really unlock.\n\nThen you hit the pay wall.  The wall asking you to pay for ALL the DLC because you are extremely limited to your class and what to do, and then it goes all down hill from there.\n\nYou can max rank, you can do quiet a lot of stuff, but if you want to use green lantern or people like that.  It is pay us money and that is a no no.\n\nThe game is worth the time you put into it.  After all, free super hero but it is not worth the money I think, which I am glad I did not pay.\n\nYou are a super hero that can be killed by a basic mob... You never feel powerful or strong like a super hero is.\n\nIt has small other problems, like you get a small bag size, to buy a bigger it is real money, to do certain stats it is real money.\nOtherwise you spend lots of time getting small stuff and just doing the story and quests which I have no problem with :)","February 5, 2014","true","33.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's not f2p.\n\nGot to level 11, grinded for like 2 hours to get the next level, and realized I wasn't getting any exp. It capped at lvl 11. Gotta pay to progress.\n\nSaved up some cash in an attempt to get some of the more valuable armor (which is terribly expensive), only to see that any money I made was being tranferred to an online "bank" that could only be accessed by paying to be premium. Capped at $1,500, which is about enough to get a soda. Literally. Gotta pay to...have money.\n\nWanted to go to battle in a quest only to find out I didn't have a high enough combat rating. You need to have a high enough combat rating to even play quests, so this requires you to buy really expensive armor. At some point, I imagine there will only be a select few armor pieces that will get your CR high enough to play late quests, which very much limits what you will be able to wear. I can envision a team of 4 all wearing the same thing even though they'd rather wear something else. What this all means is that you have no choice but to pay $. You're required to have great armor, and can't afford it cuz of the whole temporary robbery system (online pay-only bank). To get the armor, you need the money, which caps at $1,500, yet what you'll need will cost like $75,000+, so it's impossible. Even if you had the money, you'd need separate "badges" earned from completing quests, and lots of them. Lots of reasons you need $. Gotta pay.\n\nI tried to collect Hearts for the Valentine's Day events. Complete certain quests, get Hearts. However, you can only complete each once, and need to spend Replay Badges to replay them. So, this is achieved through quests as well, but you won't have done enough to have multiple Replay Badges, so you won't be able to aquire enough Hearts to get anything you want. Gotta pay to get Replay Badges.\n\nI was collecting a lot of stuff, and soon ran out of inventory space. Yep, you have limited inventory space, and find things everywhere, all cluttering your inventory. The Bank where you store your excess stuff has its own limitations as well. You'll run out of room quickly, and selling things off only sends money to your online bank, which can't be accessed. Gotta pay to keep your own money?\n\nI went through a lot of work to create an armor mod. Need to collect Exobits to create an Exobyte, which then requires another item to combine with it to make a mod. I realized I couldn't even equip it because the 4 mod slots are Locked. Gotta pay.\n\nEverything in the game gets impeded by paywalls. There's no way to progress in any meaningful way in this game without spending money. Like I said, they should just sell this as a normal game.\n\nYou can create 2 characters. I recommend making a hero and a villain. If you want to make more, you gotta pay. You have different movement and fighting styles. These are limited, though. If you want access to them all, you gotta pay. In fact, I'd say they managed to put a paywall on just about everything in the game.\n\nPay To Play.\nGood:\n\nThe game itself is pretty cool. Cool combos, cool abilities, you can fly, decent character customization, fun city with many enemy types, and a lot of different abilities, which have their own limits, due to the level cap. Decent fanfare, with known enemies being the bosses, and your hero of choice backing you up. It's always cool to get a call from Batman. :)\n\nBad:\n\nPay money or don't bother playing. Everything you need is locked behind paywalls. Voice acting is bad, and you don't really have the freedom to wear what you want into battle, due to the combat rating system. Everything seems too expensive, even with in-game money. You'll need to grind like crazy.\n\nBe ready to get out your credit card, or don't download this game. There's more freedom even in ArcheAge than this game. I've heard Champions Online is actually f2p, so I'd say play that instead, unless you're prepared to pay. I was actually considering buying some stuff, but when I realized how much they locked away and how far they went to mandate cash payments to get anywhere in this game, I decided it wasn't worth giving them money afterall.\n\nFieldRatingGraphics:5/10Controls:8/10Functionality:7/10Fun:6/10Replay value:?/10Overall:6.5/10\nThat rates the game, but I would just love to knock off like 2 points for gouging our wallets so blatantly, and then having the nerve to call this a f2p game. It's a fun game and all, but advertised incorrectly. Just way too many limitations to enjoy without buying all the game's content. This is a demo, nothing more. I recommend it only to those who have come prepared to buy the game. If you were hoping to have a fun adventure, or to go PvP or co-op with friends, you had better get that credit card ready. Nothing free here.","February 23","false","20.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","20"

Yes there can be grinding, and yes you are limited by free to play. Premium is a little better which I am now, owning only a few DLC's  packs, styles etc. Then there is Membership which has its perks, and is nice, but in my opinion not needed for fun. I bounce from premium, to member on and off, depending on how much time i wanna put in that particular month. If you are free to play you only get two character slots, but you can delete, and make new characters if you are into going a different path with a character. Premium you get six slots which is better, and of course membership you get more.

It's free so try it for yourself but don't expect much. I would recommend Champions online instead.\n\nI first played DCUO way back at launch on ps3 and while it wasn't the best mmo ever and definitely wasn't as good as city of heroes. I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Back then I would have recommended it. Now however I definitely will not recommend it. First of all I couldn't even get it to install properly. The launcher would just randomly shut down without any warning while installing. I basically had to keep opening it, it would complete about 5% of the install and shut again but I kept going out of sheer nostalgia for this game.\n\nEventually I got the game installed and created a character it was only then the real troubles started. The game makes all free to play users wait in a queue to join the server. The estimated wait time was 2 and a half minutes however it took 10 minutes to get it only to be instantly booted back to character select. Another 10 minute wait and I was back in the prologue only to find that the controls were absolutely atrocious. My character wouldnt turn properly, instead he'd just kind of run forward and gradually turn round while still playing the forward run animation. Sort of like the tank controls from the old resident evil games. I don't know if its a bug but I certainly don't remember movement being that clunky back on ps3.\n\nTo make matters worse if you didnt move the camera while moving the character it would just flail wildy in random directions. Again I don't know if this is a bug or if they just messed up the controls when they ported it to pc. I tried searching online and found only one thread on steam of someone having this problem and absolutely zero solutions.\n\nThe flying controls seemed a lot more responsive so I tried to push forward only to have the camera completely disconnect from my character while i was flying. I made sure the auto follow setting was on but it didn't seem to help. It honestly felt like I was playing an alpha version of the game.\n\nIf you are a fan of DC then go ahead and try it. Maybe your experience will be a lot less buggy than mine but be smart and don't spend any money on this until you're sure it will work properly for you.","May 5","false","2.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","9","17","2","0"

He liked to be called Joey. He was a nice fellow, with a few close friends. The local ladies who saw him sometimes bowling at the local Bowl-o-Rama Bowling Alley said he was pleasant on the eyes. He was a nice guy to be around, and a very pleasant conversationalist. He knew all the right things to say, and never seemed to be on anyone's bad side. He never had a run in the with local police, and was very straight and narrow. He owned an auto parts store in town. the shop being one of only 2 auto places in town was profitable, leaving Joey to skip the 9 to 5 grind, and have plenty of free time to pursue more leisurly activities. Joey was American as apple pie, and loving life to the fullest. He did have a girlfriend, whom he had even asked to marry him recently. She gladly accepted. Joey's life seemed set.\n\nJoey was a good wholesome average man, with lots to live for. Which is why none of the rest of this makes sense...\n\nOn the night of September 14th, 2012, Joey was last seen sitting outside of his 2 story home, on his steps. A neighbor recalls seeing Joey through her window across the street. Joey appeared to be shaking, wearing only what appeared to be a towel, shorts (possibly boxers), and no shoes on. He looked a mess. The neighbor went downstairs, and when she went out of her door to see if Joey was okay, he was gone. She went to his front door and rang the doorbell, but there was no answer.\n\n2 days later, Joey's body was found outside of town washed up in a riverbed.\n\nPolice say there was no signs of foul play, and it appeared that he had commited suicide by jumping off a bridge located further upstream, breaking his neck on impact. None of this made sense. This man, whom was recently engaged and not in any trouble financially or otherwise, took his own life? This made no sense at all.\n\nPolice searched his home and found no evidence of foul play. When they searched his den, the lights were flickering off and on, with a faint humming coming from a computer fan. The computer had been left on. Maybe there were clues here? One officer walked up to the computer desk, and touched the mouse enough to get the computer out of sleep mode. what he saw haunted him. A few seconds later, the computer monitor sparked, and then it shut off. It had died. As well as the computer with it.\n\nHaunted by what he had seen, officer Henry King mentioned none of this to other officers, and left what he had seen on the screen out of his report.\n\n4 days later, Henry King was found dead in his apartment. He had hung himself the night before.\n\nOn his computer monitor it flickered off and on. DC Universe™ Online Free-To-Play. Your Way®.

He liked to be called Joey. He was a nice fellow, with a few close friends. The local ladies who saw him sometimes bowling at the local Bowl-o-Rama Bowling Alley said he was pleasant on the eyes. He was a nice guy to be around, and a very pleasant conversationalist. He knew all the right things to say, and never seemed to be on anyone's bad side. He never had a run in the with local police, and was very straight and narrow. He owned an auto parts store in town. the shop being one of only 2 auto places in town was profitable, leaving Joey to skip the 9 to 5 grind, and have plenty of free time to pursue more leisurly activities. Joey was American as apple pie, and loving life to the fullest. He did have a girlfriend, whom he had even asked to marry him recently. She gladly accepted. Joey's life seemed set.\n\nJoey was a good wholesome average man, with lots to live for. Which is why none of the rest of this makes sense...\n\nOn the night of September 14th, 2012, Joey was last seen sitting outside of his 2 story home, on his steps. A neighbor recalls seeing Joey through her window across the street. Joey appeared to be shaking, wearing only what appeared to be a towel, shorts (possibly boxers), and no shoes on. He looked a mess. The neighbor went downstairs, and when she went out of her door to see if Joey was okay, he was gone. She went to his front door and rang the doorbell, but there was no answer.\n\n2 days later, Joey's body was found outside of town washed up in a riverbed.\n\nPolice say there was no signs of foul play, and it appeared that he had commited suicide by jumping off a bridge located further upstream, breaking his neck on impact. None of this made sense. This man, whom was recently engaged and not in any trouble financially or otherwise, took his own life? This made no sense at all.\n\nPolice searched his home and found no evidence of foul play. When they searched his den, the lights were flickering off and on, with a faint humming coming from a computer fan. The computer had been left on. Maybe there were clues here? One officer walked up to the computer desk, and touched the mouse enough to get the computer out of sleep mode. what he saw haunted him. A few seconds later, the computer monitor sparked, and then it shut off. It had died. As well as the computer with it.\n\nHaunted by what he had seen, officer Henry King mentioned none of this to other officers, and left what he had seen on the screen out of his report.\n\n4 days later, Henry King was found dead in his apartment. He had hung himself the night before.\n\nOn his computer monitor it flickered off and on. DC Universe™ Online Free-To-Play. Your Way®. Scribbled on a notepad also on his desk, in almost illegible hand writing was a small message: "Abandon all hope ye who enter here"","January 27, 2014","false","5.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","3"

The bad out weighs  the good seeing how the good is slowing being destroyed by a money ran dev team.\nThe Good: Movement options are great since they give you various options to gank/ enter battles. Acro was my got to for everything but tanking since the skills you can learn weren't meant for it unless you want to power single target pulls; to it's credit the super move is good for tanking. Flight is a cheap way to find collectables and beat everyone not experienced in superspeed and superspeed is good for speedruns with experience.\nThe combat is superb, 3rd person perspective getting the chance to admire your nude cowboy Rage Dps while they chain whip things. Controls were meant for a controller considering a port from the PS, If your gonna use keyboard make sure you know it because 1-+ will be used on a norm at fast paces considering your dlc ownership.\nCharacter creation is good, not great because you need dlcs to make your character truely have options. You can Lock your suit in if you like your starter character or change it while your not in combat anywhere in game.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe company wants your money period JENS said it on a stream, since Amazon Fury came out the content is now noticeably reused and called new. Dlc is $10 and can only be used with cash and they made being a member damn near needed since free players have limited broker usage, have a 1.5k spending limit and can't trade (haven't stayed free long enough to get all the info). Premium players 14 extra Inventory slots-12 extra Bank slots-4 extra Character slots-Ability to Trade Items with other players-$2k spending limit-Proximity chat-Vault access every 3 day. This game has the ftp model try before you buy, Soe doesn't want server space being used for non-paying customers, if i was wrong they wouldn't have the ridiculous limitations on this game.\nCommunity: if your lucky you'll find friends to carry you being anything but legendary. Premiums get a pass only if you have participating dlcs. Pvp is a travesty of High lvls/Cr pounding lowbies, being a new player you won't have the experience to tackle the cr/stat challenge. High skilled/ can strip all their gear off and beat a rush to t6 pvp players everyone else is just roaches waiting to be squashed. The amount of MMOOK spam in chat is f*cked up, ignoring them is a option but they're like a Horrible Joke, once you think they're gone; they're back again (MMOOK is a spam site trying to trade ingame cash for real cash).\n\nAsk yourself, is the game worth spending money on? The necessary $5 to spend to avoid FTP could be put somewhere else,something more constructive (buying an animal would be more constructive than DCUO).\nBy next year, they will re-release content for full price with "incentives" because they won't need to create anything new/;the dedicated players/new players will eat it up with all the nerfs and rehashed crap.","August 9, 2014","false","95.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jskode/recommended/24200/","jskode","jskode","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jskode/","192 products in account","A free to play MMO, DC Universe Online is a game that attempts to make MMO combat more exciting and involving, rather than just 'click and wait'; the combat plays out similarly to an action game, with many different weapon and power types, each with their own animations and unlockable combos. This helps keep the game feeling fresh through multiple character playthroughs, although the combat eventually becomes somewhat repetitive, and it doesn't help that most of the quests are 'Kill 30 enemies' or 'Destroy 10 things'; the formula rarely changes.\nNavigating the world is enjoyable due to the fun travel powers (which are unlocked from the beginning), although flying feels boring in comparison to super speed or athletics.\nNeedless to say, DC fans are the ones who will get the most enjoyment out of this game, with many iconic locations to explore in the worlds of Metropolis and Gotham, and countless famous foes to square off against.\n\nTL;DR: If you are a fan of MMO's and a fan of DC superheroes (or supervillains), you should definitely try this game.","November 25, 2013","true","240.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Don't worry about the end game, or best combination of powers. Make the hero or villain you want to be and experience the story. If you really like it, worry about making the 'ideal' character the second time around and look towards end game.\n\nHalf the fun for me is flying around finding the investigations from DC reports like Jack Ryder, Lois Lane and Vicki Vale. Not to mention the story missions that have you fighting the likes of Scarecrow and Bane in Gotham, or the possessed Teen Titans.\n\nWorth a try, you can play 1-30 with a good range of character choices for free. If you enjoy it just a little, investing in 1 DLC pack for a new power set will net you premium membership and 6 character slots. Alternatively a monthly fee of ~$15 will net you all DLC I believe and unlimited access to all areas of the game.","November 26, 2013","true","199.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can tell the developers didn't go the extra mile, but when the job that needs doing is making you feel like a valient hero or a manical villian, it really doesn't NEED to go that extra mile. It's graphics are immpressive for a MMO, and the combat and movement work well. From a purely mechanical standpoint it's probably the best 'free' MMOs out there. Frankly the only downside I see doesn't come from the game at all, but instead the DC universe, what with comics' tendacy to 'over-sexualize' (Power Girl doesn't need show off THAT much, and especially not every loading screen), but I suppose they must work within the given lore *grumblegrumble*womeninrefrigerators*grumblegrumble*\n\nTL;DNR: Good mechanically, only gripe is not they're problem","December 28, 2013","true","22.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The bad out weighs  the good seeing how the good is slowing being destroyed by a money ran dev team.\nThe Good: Movement options are great since they give you various options to gank/ enter battles. Acro was my got to for everything but tanking since the skills you can learn weren't meant for it unless you want to power single target pulls; to it's credit the super move is good for tanking. Flight is a cheap way to find collectables and beat everyone not experienced in superspeed and superspeed is good for speedruns with experience.\nThe combat is superb, 3rd person perspective getting the chance to admire your nude cowboy Rage Dps while they chain whip things. Controls were meant for a controller considering a port from the PS, If your gonna use keyboard make sure you know it because 1-+ will be used on a norm at fast paces considering your dlc ownership.\nCharacter creation is good, not great because you need dlcs to make your character truely have options. You can Lock your suit in if you like your starter character or change it while your not in combat anywhere in game.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe company wants your money period JENS said it on a stream, since Amazon Fury came out the content is now noticeably reused and called new. Dlc is $10 and can only be used with cash and they made being a member damn near needed since free players have limited broker usage, have a 1.5k spending limit and can't trade (haven't stayed free long enough to get all the info). Premium players 14 extra Inventory slots-12 extra Bank slots-4 extra Character slots-Ability to Trade Items with other players-$2k spending limit-Proximity chat-Vault access every 3 day. This game has the ftp model try before you buy, Soe doesn't want server space being used for non-paying customers, if i was wrong they wouldn't have the ridiculous limitations on this game.\nCommunity: if your lucky you'll find friends to carry you being anything but legendary. Premiums get a pass only if you have participating dlcs. Pvp is a travesty of High lvls/Cr pounding lowbies, being a new player you won't have the experience to tackle the cr/stat challenge. High skilled/ can strip all their gear off and beat a rush to t6 pvp players everyone else is just roaches waiting to be squashed. The amount of MMOOK spam in chat is f*cked up, ignoring them is a option but they're like a Horrible Joke, once you think they're gone; they're back again (MMOOK is a spam site trying to trade ingame cash for real cash).\n\nAsk yourself, is the game worth spending money on? The necessary $5 to spend to avoid FTP could be put somewhere else,something more constructive (buying an animal would be more constructive than DCUO).\nBy next year, they will re-release content for full price with "incentives" because they won't need to create anything new/;the dedicated players/new players will eat it up with all the nerfs and rehashed crap.","August 9, 2014","false","95.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can tell the developers didn't go the extra mile, but when the job that needs doing is making you feel like a valient hero or a manical villian, it really doesn't NEED to go that extra mile. It's graphics are immpressive for a MMO, and the combat and movement work well. From a purely mechanical standpoint it's probably the best 'free' MMOs out there. Frankly the only downside I see doesn't come from the game at all, but instead the DC universe, what with comics' tendacy to 'over-sexualize' (Power Girl doesn't need show off THAT much, and especially not every loading screen), but I suppose they must work within the given lore *grumblegrumble*womeninrefrigerators*grumblegrumble*\n\nTL;DNR: Good mechanically, only gripe is not they're problem","December 28, 2013","true","22.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Unlike other f2p mmos, it doesnt restrict playable content you can access. Instead, they have several playable Power classes available for free, along with more you can unlock for a relatively cheap price. And if you subscribe for a month to make your characters with those power classes, you get to keep them when your sub runs out. In short, theres a ton to do even if you only play the free model, but theres still something for you to do if you want to buy a little more.","February 17, 2014","true","93.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The part you can play for free is one of the best single-player open-world superhero games ever made (with lots of optional opportunities for co-op or PvP).  The game is much more action-oriented than most online RPG's, with movement mechanics, power knockback, and throwing environmental stuff all significant parts of the combat.\n\nWith lots of alternate missions depending on your mentor, a bunch of different powersets to try out, and both hero & villain factions, I've enjoyed taking several characters through the Level 1-30 single-player game and even bought some of the DLC to try out a few of the newer powersets.\n\nAlso no game does a better job of making you feel like a superhero when you fly (or glide or grapple or speedrun or surf) around the city.\n\nThe character creator is somewhat limited, but the way gear works is great.  New gear buffs your character stats and gives you new styles for tweaking your superhero look. Most importantly, you can keep whatever style or look you want regardless of which gear you actually have equipped for stat purposes.\n\nIf you enjoy superheroes, just designing a character and flying around  Metropolis or Gotham (which look great) in DCUO is more fun than many entire superhero games.  Even if you don't like MMOs, there a ton of great single-player content here that is completely free.  And maybe you'll enjoy the MMO stuff more than I did.","January 5, 2015","true","974.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimgrimm/recommended/24200/","jimgrimm","JimGrimm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimgrimm/","151 products in account","Revisit\n\nThe game as a concept is quite ambitious allowing you to create your own unique (or loosely inspired by) hero and place them into the DC Universe home to some of the most famous heroes and villains. Having executed that idea it is quite fun... for a while. The main "campaign" or whatever you'd like to call it is everything I could have asked for from a DC mmo experience. It is a surprisingly fufilling experience which I would guess is an 80+ hours depending how many friends you have to help. In that aspect it is one of the best F2P games you can get. The story alone is longer than some P2P games and you have multiple storylines and endgame raids etc.\n\nPersonally I had no desire to play the Superman or Wonder Woman campaigns after spending so much time on one character. It would be a great option to let you play through all of them on one character for more playtime. The endgame wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped. I'm not a big mmorpg player but what I've played is overly "grindy" playing scenarios from levels you beat over and over til you get enough points to do the same thing on a higher difficulty. I have memories of playing Runescape and all the quests you could do on your own before getting into the more involved part of the game.\n\nI don't have friends who play and it's impossible to make any from the broken chat and the lack of easily accessible microphone chat. The chat is flooded by ways to get millions of in game cash for $12 and people looking for groups of players that I'm not a high enough level to join. Whenever I tried to use the chat there isn't a global setting I could find, only a long range local chat.\n\nPerhaps if there was an easier way to get gear without grinding my braincells away I could enjoy it a bit more. As is, there's a solid story mode and some fun gameplay with some very fluid combat. I remember when I used to play runescape or WoW the combat was just a stiff animation. In this game it feels like you really fight the enemy instead of watch a red damage number attack your enemy.","December 29, 2013","true","249.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In my own opinion I liked it because it was a third person view alongside being a hero in the DC. It is also a good start in the MMORPG World. Also I do like to have the chance to be mentored from my favorite characters like Batman and the Joker. I do want ot see that might be good for the game is the chance to be mentor to the more unconventional characters like Harley Quinn, Robin, Poison Ivy, Two-Face, Catwoman, Huntress. Also the storyline is good but the creator did get small wrongs in the storyline. Like how Huntress was in the game while catwoman was in the game at the same time. I a neophyte of the dc universe, but huntress was catwoman's daughtry and catwoman was suppose to be dead.","January 31","true","15.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although my small amout of hours on here makes it look like i shouldnt be saying, but ive payed hundreds of hours of DCUO on PS4. The game is really good, but theres so much DLC to buy, so if you really want to save money, just get premium. Makes life easier.  Buying the DLC separately is a waste of money, but you really cant do anything without them. You can only do a certain amount of things, but other than that youd probably be doing the same things over and over again until you get that bday money so you can buy some DLC.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Promisha/recommended/24200/","Promisha","Promisha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Promisha/","380 products in account","Let me save you some time. It's dull, and you are are severely handicapped not just content wise but power and money wise without a subscription. The combat is meh, most of the abilities don't really have that wow factor or that oomph feeling that everyone in other MMO's have a few of. Combat is largely just left-and right click mouse combos and a few abilities peppered in.\n\nThe character creation is neat but has a lot more room for improvement - half the characters you see will have the same serious personality and stand like they have a stick up their butt. Some powers and weapons are limited by purchasing specific content or having a subscription, which I get, but POWER RINGS LOCKED? REALLY? NO GREEN LANTERN FOR YOU! And I know its game but if you want some degree of immersion in the universe, hope you don't mind all the generic MMO try-too-hard names your comrades will have - superman289, Batlord, XSupermangX sure don't seem to mind.\n\nThe equivalent of dungeons are also extremely boring. While it was nice that they varied in group size, the ones I did needed zero communication at all - people round and punch stuff or hold E for a second.\n\nIf you want to play as a villian hope you have a few friends who want to do it with you - for every 1 villian there seems to be about 5-10 heroes. I can't even recall one time villians won one of the nearby pvp events.\n\nThe mentoring concept (in which what hero or villian you chose to teach you) could have been amazing - but instead it just changes the missions/quests you do while leveling. You could be reporting and fighting with batman, or being taught the tricks of the trade by Lex Luthor but NOOOOOOOPE go out into the city and do random stuff while I occaisonally talk on the radio.\n\nI will give it one high mark though - the styles tab. It keeps track of every style of gear piece you have looted and allows you to display that item instead of the one equipped without having to equip it. The best part is you can do it anytime even if you no longer own the items, and you can even lock the style so it never changes until you tell it to. IT IS GENIUS! I've seen other games do things similar, but usually, you still have to own the item, or if you equip a new piece over it you have to talk to someone to revisiualize it. It's like transmogging from WoW but without the lost bank space and gold cost.\n\nOverall it's dissapointing: The core concept of Thousands of people suddenly being given powers and becoming heroes of villians and why it happened, was good. The idea for a mentor was great. The idea that you get to create your own person and interact with villians and heroes in the DC universe? GOOOOOOOOOOOD.\n\nThe problem is the execution is horrible. They tried to combine Arkham games combat with generic mmo combat, and the end result is neither part works well or feels fun. The character creation is a little too restrictive and having all the players in one region on one server results in crappy named characters (not even happy with my own for once) and missions contained in one small spot trying to be finished by 10-30 people. Fighting often feels slow and floaty. Many concepts such as the mentors and the hideouts/bases largely fall flat, and you may find yourself feeling that the way they implemented them was unnecessary. It took so many negative or meh things other mmo's did, and tried mixing it in with one or two good ideas.\n\nAt the end of the day it's not worth it to me to invest any more time, or any money, into this game. It feels like one long slog where you don't feel any sense of achievement, the combat lacks impact and excitement, and the controls are kinda goofy at times. If you love DC comics or the stuff that comes out of them you might want to at least try it and form your own opinion - after all there is a free play model. But if you're just looking for an online game there are plenty out there better. If you're looking for a good DC game try the Batman Arkham games, or Injustice: Gods Among Us.\n\n","August 20, 2014","false","6.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

And lo and behold, we met the second most painful item to hit mankind.  Originally, the developing company hyped up the game, promising everything from customizable player housing, villian and hero PvP that would be well-balanced and enjoyable, as well as a relentless assault on the typical flavor of the week scenarios and power upgrades.  They promised scenarios and power types that have actually existed in the DC comic genre.  Out of all of their promises, they've fulfilled two.  In a ratio based item, that's 2:45.\n\nIn general, that's bad business.  When they discovered that they were unable to or were expected to keep their promises, they quickly went the route of the current MMO genre; free to play.  Since then, the game has constantly had ill-repairs, downtime, unmet promises, and very, very low expectations.  It is just one step above Champions Online, save for the strange Mortal Combat type figurations for certain attack moves (down, down-right, right anyone?).  DC Universe actually has a storyline, which is impressive given its current state of affairs in-game.  Character customization is lacking.  The developing company (mainly their PR branch) continues to promise amazing new feats, outfits, and customization that will resurrect its game in a manner that would put an unnamed fellow from 2000 some years ago to shame.  Unfortunately, thus far, they've only been able to resurrect a continual decline in player data-base, as well as overall effectiveness.\n\nHowever, they still offer a plate of cookies and a strangely colored kool-aid.","November 30, 2014","false","76.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stefanw1337/recommended/24200/","stefanw1337","stefanw1337","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stefanw1337/","423 products in account","The reason for not recommending this game is simple, the devs and the company behind. Let me elaborate around it.\n\nI originally bought this game on release for a set price and I subbed for a few months liking the game, listening to TotalBiscuits recommendation at the time. The game is a very different approach to the MMO we knew at the time. Brawling, leveling, discovering and exploring the cities and solo dungeons within it. I leveled my character to 50, going nature/rifles. But didn't find the armors at the end-game that appealing and dropped the game cuz there wasn't anything to do.\n\nBut in 2012 the game accounts got migrated to ProSiebenSat, and we all had to migrate our accounts else all be lost, they sent me an email about this and so I did it. Still when I downloaded the game from Steam, it would still try to connect to the old account servers, at least I couldn't get it to work right out of the Steam-box.\n\nBut I still played it from time to time, made some alts and confirmed that the game was still good. I bought a few DLCs, like the base and stuff, saw that the game had done some progress since launch.\n\nSo I got my new computer and downloaded this game once again, through Steam. And when I tried logging on I got a message that said my account was banned. So I sent them a ticket about it, asking for my real account name(as it became differently at the time of ProSiebenSat migrating). But the answer I got was horrifying.\n\nThey told me there was another migration FROM ProSiebenSat and back in 2014. And that the last chance of this migration was 31st of January 2015.\n\nI NEVER GOT AN EMAIL ABOUT THIS!\n\n(TLDR;) The results are,\nI don't have ANY characters, but they unbanned the account, and told me I had to start over.\nI don't have ANY DLCs, that I paid real money for.\nThey didn't alert me for the migration(I have searched and searched for those emails they claim to have sent me).\n\nThey suck as a company, (in b4 they're the next to take the throne after EA for worst company NA?)\n\nI thought I'd still give the game a chance. I logged in, made a Catwoman-like character.\nThe results were STILL HORRIBLE:\n1. She doesn't come with a whip, or any whip attacks(no the taser doesn't count).\n2. She came with non-high heels(I had to choose my own boots to get the right look).\n3. She's standing like she's a monster(beast-like atttitude), even the one in-game doesn't stand like that!).\n\nSo I'm leaving this game for good. UNINSTALLED, I'm over it..\nAnd I'm gonna be sceptical to all games released by Daybreak(old SOE) in the future, as they cannot be trusted, even with the migration they failed badly. First impressions are quite bad!","March 21, 2015","false","32.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

On my steam record I have not played to much, but have completed it on my PS4 system. The game like many mmo's has you make your own charcater, chose a power, etc. The game has nice unique features to make you stand out if you chose. You can chose a superhero mentor, Superman, Batman, or Wonderwoman, who each specify in one unique kind of fighting style. For vilians mentors include, Lex Luthor, The Joker, and Circe. I finished my game as a superhero under the help of Batman. I found myself traviling from Metropilis to Gothem completing missions. Throught 2/3's of the game it is tedious and gets increasingly more difficult. Although ranking up and getting more powers, the game has a very short stop. I probably put a couple of hours, either with my friends assitance or not. Like many mmo's once again, you can of course pay dlc to unlock more missions and or superpowers for your charcter to master! I leval cap'd in this game way to easily. If you wish to stay with your free account, like I did, you can make two charcters! Seems better than only one, until you realize, the storyline is the same, with or without friends or groups, you just switch your roles going through the same jobs! Overall this game only recives a 6/10 for its shortness and paywalls. I'd recommend this if your looking for a nice short game on your computer or Sony Console. Because while it did last, it was a load of fun!","June 10, 2014","true","30.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game offers NOTHING unique, the "twist" that you have heros instead of RPG characters might aswell make it worse because nobody is special in this game. The so called "lore" isn't even of the game but the comics so not much of a thought has been dedicated to this game. You get to choose between the evil and the good, pretty generic for an MMORPG, with the basic classes unlocked which are total horse-♥♥♥♥ and the good ones locked which only proves my point about how much of an abomination this game is. So, let's say you're digging this game and want to unlock a character that costs money. Guess what? ♥♥♥♥ you! You can't get paid items by playing the game, making this game a worse pay to win than the others on the market. Graphics are pretty bad from what I remember and the game is generally just a generic "MMORPG" which features nothing new or innovative. If you like the DC series and heros, sure, you might have a few fun hours of actually seeing new stuff, but theres nothing else than grinding for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items and combat ratings that you do in this game. LITERALLY the only thing you do in this game is grind for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items to level up, you have to be a ♥♥♥♥ing dumb ♥♥♥♥ in order to actually have fun while playing this game, or a 5 year old.\nSo why am I writing this review? Don't I have better stuff to do? Yeah, but this review isn't for me. See, theres this guy I won't mention his name which plays this game for a living, only that he doesn't get any money for it or anything beneficial really, only wasting his time playing this game. A thousand hours? More... Two thousand? A bit more... Between three and four thousand? That a boy! I hope that you can see my concernes regarding his health, if one of the developers reads this, please ban him and me from the game so I won't have to see this for my entire life again.\n2/10 at most.","May 28","false","84.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game offers NOTHING unique, the "twist" that you have heros instead of RPG characters might aswell make it worse because nobody is special in this game. The so called "lore" isn't even of the game but the comics so not much of a thought has been dedicated to this game. You get to choose between the evil and the good, pretty generic for an MMORPG, with the basic classes unlocked which are total horse-♥♥♥♥ and the good ones locked which only proves my point about how much of an abomination this game is. So, let's say you're digging this game and want to unlock a character that costs money. Guess what? ♥♥♥♥ you! You can't get paid items by playing the game, making this game a worse pay to win than the others on the market. Graphics are pretty bad from what I remember and the game is generally just a generic "MMORPG" which features nothing new or innovative. If you like the DC series and heros, sure, you might have a few fun hours of actually seeing new stuff, but theres nothing else than grinding for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items and combat ratings that you do in this game. LITERALLY the only thing you do in this game is grind for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items to level up, you have to be a ♥♥♥♥ing dumb ♥♥♥♥ in order to actually have fun while playing this game, or a 5 year old.\nSo why am I writing this review? Don't I have better stuff to do? Yeah, but this review isn't for me. See, theres this guy I won't mention his name which plays this game for a living, only that he doesn't get any money for it or anything beneficial really, only wasting his time playing this game. A thousand hours? More... Two thousand? A bit more... Between three and four thousand? That a boy! I hope that you can see my concernes regarding his health, if one of the developers reads this, please ban him and me from the game so I won't have to see this for my entire life again.\n2/10 at most.","May 28","false","84.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/malikbishop/recommended/24200/","malikbishop","Malik Bishop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/malikbishop/","137 products in account","For those out of the loop, this probably represents the last of the big old-style MMOs. Even though it was only released in 2011, there’s something about it that feels more tired than Bruce Wayne’s put upon butler. Indeed, there’s a grind to almost every mission, the graphics don’t exactly sparkle (even on new hardware), and how you choose to fight seems to have very little bearing on the outcome of battle. Speedy level progression and focus on all combat, all the time might prove tedious if you're someone who enjoys exploring new worlds for the thrill of mystery and discovery. The largely instanced, repeatable endgame content is fun, but it's not inviting enough to make it worth paying a monthly fee for it. But even if it doesn't provide enough new content to sustain you beyond a couple of weeks, DC Universe Online is generally entertaining, and comic book fans will be happy that the license was handled with care.Perhaps the best gameplay feature of DCUO is the design of its default UI layout and keybinds. Instead of the standard MMOG mechanic of "tab-target, auto-attack, fire-all-your-cooldowns-and-wait-for-refresh" that leaves you a slave to whack-a-mole style hotbuttons and timers, DCUO maps the entirety of your primary weapon set to a single button. Through a series of "clicks" and "holds," your avatar will execute different combinations of superpowered techniques that are the bread and butter of your life as a hero or villain. The additional powers you can use are yours to command at YOUR discretion, not the whim of a global cooldown, and you may find yourself going as long as an hour or two without needing to activate a single one. This combination of simplicity and freedom allow you to do something that has become less common in MMOGs - you can actually watch the action unfold instead of always having your eyes fixed to your hotbars. This also has allowed the DCUO devs to include clever boss fight mechanics that include a reliance on environmental awareness, since it's easier to see what's going on around you.","June 8, 2014","true","334.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That word is thrown around alot in this industry and to be honest this game deserves it. Grinding doesn't feel like it drags on, PVP is exciting and engaging. The game rewards players for being social. It has great graphics, sound, and story, the voice acting engages players in a way that no MMO has before.\nThe Bad: It's difficult finding tight groups you can run with where everyone has a job and they know what they have to do. healers forget to heal, tanks don't tank, controllers think using damage role generates energy, and damage role guys are there to pick up  Investigations.\n\nOther thoughts: Why do so many people badmouth this game over lost accounts?

Thats fine. Moral reasonings, character personas, unite under a common enemy, blah blah blah. Keep in mind that Braniac is the main bad guy and you need to stop him, hero or villain.\n\nSo apparently from what Im seeing, you dont actually get to fight braniac himself. You just do stuff.

That word is thrown around alot in this industry and to be honest this game deserves it. Grinding doesn't feel like it drags on, PVP is exciting and engaging. The game rewards players for being social. It has great graphics, sound, and story, the voice acting engages players in a way that no MMO has before.\nThe Bad: It's difficult finding tight groups you can run with where everyone has a job and they know what they have to do. healers forget to heal, tanks don't tank, controllers think using damage role generates energy, and damage role guys are there to pick up  Investigations.\n\nOther thoughts: Why do so many people badmouth this game over lost accounts?

I USED to be a paying customer back in 2012-2013. I say 'used to be' because the game is straight unstable. Always getting disconnected, doesn't matter if it's a patch, update, or whatever. BUT recently, they cannot keep their servers up and running. They cannot get a good warning across for an upcoming patch. I saw the free for play on steam and thought, "hey I enjoyed this game in the past, I'll give it a shot." I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU RUIN A GAME 3 YEARS LATER. I do not recommend this game unless you love being disconnected and upon reconnection being where you were in game 30 minutes ago. This is sad and not what a company should want to portray to new and renewed users on their first couple days of playing.

O que posso dizer de um jogo como este, onde eu posso criar o meu próprio Super-Herói ou me inspirar nos que eu assistia e lia quando criança? Poxa, encontrei esse jogo tarde de mais eu acho, gostaria de ter o conhecido mais cedo, porque cara, que joguinho pra viciar. Os gráficos para um MMO são lindos, e os poderes que se pode ter também. As quests são em geral fáceis, mas as dungeons são muito ♥♥♥♥! Proporcionando ao jogador uma dificuldade razoável, onde várias vezes você vai morrer, até você achar o ponto fraco do inimigo e bater lá. O jogo tem um sistema de cash e premium member, ou Legendary, mas não muda em nada o gameplay, só da ao jogador vantagens de ter TODAS as DLCs do jogo de graça e a opção de criar uma Liga, e o preço do membro mensal não chega a ser tão caro, R$23,99, sendo que nos EUA são U$14,99, ou seja, estamos saindo com lucro, pois a mensalidade seria quase R$60,00. Mas enfim, não estou dizendo para você pagar mensalmente, você pode simplesmente comprar as DLCs e viver sua vida.\nA busca pelo level 30 é complicada, demora bastante para você upar, tendo que fazer duas ou até mesmo 3 missões para upar metade do level, mas é assim mesmo, se você quer facilidade vai jogar Minecraft.\nEnfim pessoal, jogo 100% recomendado, se você gosta do universo DC, você vai amar esse jogo, os gráficos são lindos, a jogabilidade quase que perfeita, a história é boa, e a dublagem em inglês sensacional.","September 7, 2015","true","103.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073268469/recommended/24200/","76561198073268469","GrandMajora","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073268469/","14 products in account","How did this game survive when City of Heroes died out?\n\nI have played through the game three times now and completed the story as a Tech, Meta, and Magic character. But once you hit level 30 and complete the main story, there is nothing left to do except PVP, which unless you're shilling out the dollars (or whatever currency your country runs on), you're pretty much guaranteed to lose.\n\nThe power selection is also EXTREMELY limited compared to other super hero games like City of Heroes, or Champions Online. Each power set is divided up into two types which as far as I can tell boil down to DPS vs Crowd Control.\n\nTheir website hasn't been updated since War of the Light, so I'm going to tell you which power sets are available in the game as of the time of writing this. The Power Sets for those who aren't paying a subscription are Fire, Ice, Gadgets, Mental, Nature, and Sorcery.\n\nThe powers sets for those who do pay a subscription includes the previons ones, as well as Light (green / yellow rings), Rage (red ring), Earth, Lightning, Quantum (time / space),  Blessed / Cursed (good and evil magic), and Munitions (lots of guns).\n\nThey also plan to include additional paid for powers such as Water and Serums.\n\n\nUnfortunately these new power sets contribute nothing to the game's replay value. The story is the same regardless, and once again, there's nothing to do except PVP once you complete it.\n\nThe game has also begun to die out. When I first starting playing the game, the streets were filled with heroes and villains. When I tried to do a PVP server, I could scarcely go on a mission without being dog piled by the enemy team. Now the game is mostly deserted on both PVP and PVE servers. I think I found maybe 2 or 3 enemies that were still hunting players on PVP servers, but that's it.\n\n\nThe only travel powers that are any fun is Speed Force and Acrobatics. Flight and the hover discs are a joke, nobody seems to like them. Probably because at a certain level, you can get a jet booster with Acrobatics that allows you to get around just as easily as flight, and in a much faster method. That's right, FLIGHT is the slowest travel power in the game!\n\n\nThe game also lacks a character diversity concept such as races. I get that the story is that you were a human that inherited super powers, but they could have at least included a racial template such as Thanagarian, Kryptonian, Martian, Atlantean, Cyborg, Robot, and so on. You can get skins for some of these races, and you can get similar powers, but these are purely cosmetic and don't affect your strengths and weaknesses at all.\n\n\nDC Universe Online is a super hero game that falls short when compared to many other games of its genre. It is not worth the money they want you to pump into it, and is already dying as it is. The game should be allowed to go out with whatever dignity it has left, rather than trying to resuscitate it.\n","June 2","false","69.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
