It definitely feels like one, but it's also very much its own game, and that's what I love most about it.\n\nTL;DR: Enjoy those late 90s / early 00s action adventure platforming games? Buy this. Buy this now.\n\nThe art is beautiful, the music is great, the animation is very well done, and the characters and enemies all feel unique. The combat takes some getting used to as your attacks are pretty slow, but there's a wide variety of weapons to find and use throughout the game (weapons break over time, but you can carry up to 3 at once). The core gameplay a lot of fun, and the puzzles feel organic. There's a lot of platforming to be done, but you have complete control of your jumping - the kind of control where your character can change the direction of their momentum (or even stop it altogether) in mid-air. I'm playing with a controller, but the keyboard and mouse controls felt just as comfortable.\n\nIt could definitely use a little more polish as it feels rough around the edges at times. The audio isn't mixed very well (voices are way too loud), and you'll run into a few bugs/glitches here and there. The biggest frustration for me is the combat. It just feels too slow, and the targeting system isn't as smooth as it could be. But overall I haven't found any game-breaking problems.\n\nIf you're a fan of late 90s / early 00s action adventure or platforming games, this is for you. It's very reminiscent (in a good way) of games like Zelda, Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, and other similar titles. The world and its characters feel very alive, and the tone of the game keeps you very engrossed. There's plenty of exploring to be done, creative puzzles to solve, memorable characters to meet, and lots of collecting to do.","April 8","true","1.7"," 58 of 70 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","58","70","2","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bladecookie/recommended/338310/","bladecookie","Bradstion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bladecookie/","369 products in account","I'm pretty impatient so I'm going to put at least -some- words out so far. That is to say that the general vibe of the game is great. The graphics are nice and the combat is pretty fun! It's fairly heavy and it takes a little to get used to, but it's nice otherwise. The environments are rather immersive and this whole game -really- takes advantage of the unity engine which really does make this a pretty special game.\n\nBut.\n\nIn the 47 minutes I have played of this game before writing this review -- and trust me, it's enough to gripe about it a little -- I have to say that I find the sound design to be so bad that it is -distracting-. I wouldn't put it like that if I didn't think it was true, but I think a big problem that the devs are going to find with this is that the sounds in this game either feel underwhelming, (Example: A cave-in that takes place at the start of the game.) or feel almost non-exisistent. Sometimes, when you hit something, you don't get much of a response at all. In fact, in the very first area, whacking through the underbrush produced no sound at all. I'm not sure if that was a glitch or not but it did bother me. I'd hate to say that this is something worth considering so much, but the sound lacks tactile depth to a point that it does interfere with the gameplay. It has an effect of bringing you out of the experience, and the music is charming on the surface, but quickly grows repetitive and almost obnoxious. (I had to turn it down when I was in town. It got to me.)\n\nFor some people, that whole spiel right there won't be a problem at all since it might not impact how you play the game, but for someone like me, sound's a visceral part of the experience and just as important as the graphics. When I hear something that feels cheap, it does affect the gameworld as a whole, and with a very beautiful game like this, it's a shame. I understand that saying this isn't very much help to the developers either since redoing the sound at this stage in development would be a massive undertaking and take hours and hours more work, but it feels like this is something that should've been evaluated before the game was released.\n\nSO ALL THAT BEING SAID, it's still a pretty gosh-darned good game. I'm going to recommend it with a caution that the audio can be -very- offputting. It's something I hope the developers take the time to address, but again, this isn't an early access game. The glitches are manageable and a little goofy, the gameplay is solid, and the graphics are bewitching. And although the story is rough around the edges, and the game has an awkward start, so far everything is rather great. I'll probably update this later, but I feel like, with a game like this, the more reviews people have to see, the more they'll have to work with when deciding whether or not to purchase a game like this.","April 8","true","2.2"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","33","41","2","0"

The world is open, but there are a fair amount of loading screens when going between areas.\n\nYou start off with one character, and as you play the game, you unlock two more characters, each with their own special ability. I liked being able to change characters, but I had expected a more Trine-like feel to changing between them. In Warden, the transition from one character to the next takes way too long, and it wasn’t always feasible to do when enemies are near.\n\nPros:the nostalgia is great, and the graphics really made me feel like I’d been brought back in time with the vibrant colours, and style of the game\nsoundtrack was really good\nsolid adventuring and platforming that plays similar to older console games of the genre from the late 1990s and early 2000s\nbeing able to fast travel through the spirit realm campfires was a neat addition and came in quite handy\nquite a few optional puzzles, and collectibles to find for those who like to explore more thoroughly\nCons:lacks keyboard/mouse customization, and the default keys feel a bit awkward to use (controller is recommended)\nthe overall story isn't that impressive\nvery short draw distance - the environment looks great up close, but everything else a bit off in the distance is blurry, and there’s no options to change it\nsound effects the characters make when they’re jumping, and fighting are too loud, and very annoying (the third character wasn’t bad, but the first two characters made me cringe every time I heard them)\nmusic when you enter and exit combat would change abruptly, and it was almost jolting at times\ncombat uses a lock on system, and it functions horribly\nMy biggest complaint about the platforming is that the fall damage seems very inconsistent. Sometimes I would jump off a tiny ledge and take damage, but the other times, it would be twice the height and I would take no damage at all. Health is shared across all 3 characters, but death isn’t that punishing, so losing health here and there wasn’t that big of a deal, but it was still a nuisance.\n\nFor the most part, the combat was terrible, and the combat really holds the game back from it’s full potential. I avoided fighting as much as I could, and I would run through mobs and just not attack whenever possible. The combat uses a lock on system, which doesn’t always work properly - there were some times where it would lock on a target in the back, or just not lock on at all to the mob right in front of you, and other times if there was nothing to lock on, it would try to lock on to something else and spin the camera around.\n\nThen if you finally succeed at locking on, there’s sometimes a significant bug, and the weapon would go straight through the mob, dealing no damage… it was very annoying! When you lock on, you can also throw a stun at an enemy and dodge incoming attacks. Being able to stun mobs helped take alleviate some of this combat frustration.\n\nAs you fight mobs, your weapons will lose their durability, and break, but there is usually a sufficient supply of weapons available, so this wasn’t a huge problem. I didn’t mind the weapons breaking, but it was annoying that I couldn’t drop a weapon off one character to pick up on another or trade them between each other.\n\nThe game took me about 11 hours to complete, and I was trying to find as much as a could. I did get stuck on a couple parts that were bugged, but these issues have already been resolved. The developers really seem to care about their game, and I’m glad to see that they are so responsive on the discussion board, and putting out so many bug fixes so quickly. That being said, the game has good potential, and the nostalgia factor is definitely there, but due to the combat issues, and bugs that still need to be worked out, I would suggest waiting more fixes, or for a sale price.","April 11","true","11.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","3"

This is worth mentioning, as more devs should go by that example.\n\nSummary\nWarden: Melody of the Undergrowth is a solid, colourful 3D action/adventure game with puzzles and platforming. It has flaws like commonly found bugs, somewhat weak platforming at times, and not fantastic sound effects, but the core experience is very enjoyable and has charm. If you want a potentially nostalgic 3D action/adventure experience, this may well be for you, and I would advise you to read on.\n\nThe Bad\nThe obvious negative things about Warden are many, but small: Bugs, certain subpar sound effects, invisible walls et cetera. A detailed description of all of these small things would take a whole lot of space and do very little. Essentially, these things detract from the experience, yes, but they do not ruin it. These small issues can be annoying at times, but they will not make you want to turn off the game.\n\nThe So-so\nComplaining about the economy is always trendy, and that's something you can do when it comes to Warden as well. Basically, the game is based around weapons with durability that diminishes as you use them. These weapons can be found by taking them from the dead enemies, finding them in hidden corners or in plain sight or, alternatively, buying them. The reason this is "so-so" and not good or bad is because it is all a bit... pointless. See, at the start of the game, when good weapons are scarse, you don't have a lot to spend, so you will not really be buying them. Then, when you, later in the game, have tonnes to spend, top-tier weapons are everywhere and you will never run out. Overall, the whole deal with weapons breaking only leads to making sure you carry weapons with lots of use left. You will never run out, so it is not like it is something that is hard to manage; the system is just... there.\n\nThe Good\nThe game itself is all solid and good. Warden involves a lot of what you would find in the The Legend of Zelda series: Functional, though simple combat, exploration, puzzles, dungeons et cetera (though this has a lot more platforming than a LOZ-game would). The parts are all good and combine to build an overall pleasant experience. The combat, though simple, as said, does what it is supposed to do; the exploration is excellent with hidden areas and lots of collectibles; the puzzles are fairly simple, but some of them can have you work for the rewards and the dungeons are a nice mix of all of these elements. The 3 different forms you can control are not as different as you would think; they really only have one unique ability each, 2 of which are situational and only used to access specific areas. Nonetheless, they do spice up the gameplay and are a welcome addition.\n\nThe Verdict\nOverall, Warden: Melody of the Undergrowth is a solid, yet flawed 3D action/adventure game. The good definitely does outweigh the bad, which is why I can easily recommend a purchase. However...\n\nI feel that the price is a bit much for what you get. 19,99€ is a bit much considering the rather short length, and the lack of polish (bugs, weak sound effects et cetera). 12,99€ seems more reasonable, and when on sale for around that price or lower, it is a definite yes from me. At full price, I would only recommend it if you are really interested by what you see in gameplay videos/screenshots.","May 8","true","13.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This game is not even remotely close to any Zelda game I've played (in terms of gameplay, not graphics.) Let me explain:\n\nControls - Running around and killing dudes with your sword doesn't make it Zelda. I'd compare it to a few games (particularly Starfox Adventures) before any Zelda game, if ever asked about how it handles. Combat feels far less engaging and MUCH slower. I typically ignore enemies at all costs, unless it is totally necessary to kill them.\n\nLevels - They take damn near forever to complete and they seem huge and empty. To compensate for this they place collectables EVERYWHERE. They're called 'motes', and unfortunately they are essential to progress. Think Banjo-Kazooie but more tedious. They also sprinkle in the enemies that we actively try to avoid throughout the entire level. Admittedly there's been a few neat puzzles so far, but they're far too spread out for my liking. I wouldn't care if this game took 6 hours to complete if it meant everything was a little more compact. Has any area felt like Zelda so far? Apart from the puzzles in-between, no.\n\nProgression - Not exactly captivating -- you're literally given a list of tasks to complete in each level. Once you've done one, it's crossed off the list and a new one appears. And all we ever progress to is more collectibles in a new part of the level. It's insanity. I eventually unlocked other playable characters but they don't seem all that gratifying to use so far - more of a hassle when you have to switch between them. I'll skip the Zelda comparison here for obvious reasons.\n\nStory - I'm four hours in and don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about what's-his-name or his dad or the dragon lady (sorry for spoilers.) The impending demise of the world isn't really perceptible, and it's better compared to global warming than to Zelda. I don't have much else to write regarding the it's story, as I'm totally uninterested in it so far.\n\n--\n\nSo, why would I recommend it? They've made a foundation for a GREAT series. Zelda or not, I definitely want to see a sequel to this game. I know the developers could improve upon so many of the negatives I've mentioned. And with all that said, fun and satisfying parts of the game *do* exist, in case you were wondering:\n\n- Platforming and movement is tight. A speedrunner's wet dream.\n- The visuals are fantastic. I enjoy this game just looking at it.\n- Some of the puzzles are actually really neat.\n- The game runs pretty much perfectly, aside from a few minor bugs. Really impressive coming from an indie team.\n\nThere's probably a lot of people who would love this game in it's current state. I'm on the fence, but the fact is I'll probably continue to play it to completion - which is rare for me, these days.","April 13","true","4.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Those who say it feels like are Zelda game are exactly right, and that's one of the main reasons why it was recommended to me and I decided to buy it.  As of initial impressions, I'd give it 7/10. For $20 it's worth supporting the devs and giving it a try if you're in the mood for something Zelda-like before the next big Zelda game comes out.\n\nGood-\n-The art style and execution in most of what I have seen has been very nice, and plays well to a smaller development team with more limited resources in terms of time, money and project scale. That being said, in many ways it emulates the Wind Waker style very, very well.\n-The sound and music overall is pretty good, the mixing could be a bit more even, but it's minor. I did feel some of the dungeon music to be a bit repetitive and needlessly abrasive for a *mostly* puzzle oriented dungeon. The town music though, very good and really makes it feel like a welcoming area in the game\n-Character dialogue is pretty good, albeit a bit rushed. The WW kokiri-like race is really well done.\n-Combat, after some initial experimentation is a bit rough, but otherwise fun and has a good basis for balancing\n-Use of different mechanics to set it apart from a Zelda game -- this is important and is shown to you pretty much immediately in the constant search and collect mechanic through the spirit motes as well as weapons for your character. The quick travel function/concept also ties in really nicely with their fire motif\n-So far the puzzle variation is pretty good\n\nBad-\n- The game is a bit unpolished in some ways and could benefit from some non-essential gameplay moments to add to the world and help to setup the game and the main character a little bit ( like an opening cut scene, some dialogue choices, some panning shots etc.)\n-I've experienced some texture popping in various areas\n-Combat can be a little frustrating at first, specifically regarding the use of specific weapons, targetting being less useful than it could be and getting used to the speed of movement in the attacks, it doesn't feel as responsive as it could, but it is something you get used to.","April 12","true","2.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Skipping the puzzles/level entirely.\n\nThe game also takes a page from Prince of persia series as you can pick up your enemies weapons and use them, however if you die after your weapon/armor breaks you don't get it back. so be prepared. Also you don't have a main weapon, your torch so far is the only permanent item that you can carry.\n\nAs you progress you gain the ability to change forms, different characters, which have their own abilities to help solve puzzles and to gain access to areas you normally can't, they also have their own inventory for weapons so if you are fighting a boss/ mini boss, your character's weapons break, you can switch out and use the other characters weapons.\n\nThe music in the game at first was O.K. now that the nostalgic goggles wearoff it's becoming more annoying, some of it is just a 15 sec loop, while others you actually tell comes directly from the zelda series.\n\nThe targetting system is somewhat flawed as when your in the middle of the battle you can target the enemy doesn't really mean your facing said enemy, Coming from the zelda series specifically OoT your first instinct is to lock on and attack, you cannot do that in this game. What you must do is lock on, dodge, then attack. if you directly attack at all it leaves you open for attack, as your character animations are slower then the enemies, which means rinse lather repeat.\n\nThe exploration of the game is fairly good, collecting blue symbols which help you unlock new areas, firepits allow for fast travel, different characters help out where needed.\n\nThe story I haven't really followed, There is a lore section in your start menu when you find hidden scrolls, which you can read on your free time.\n\nIt's a good game but i wouldn't buy it at full price, get it when it's on sale.","April 8","true","2.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","2"

Some mechanics are difficult to control to the point of irritation and the game will kill you a number of times because of faults with the physics engine whereby you will maintain your momentum when you jump, so if you start sliding off something the traditional method of jumping to get a better foothold won't work. This can also throw off your jumps if you land somewhere that gives you this momentum and jump before realising that you're flying uncontrollably off course.\n\nHowever, despite those faults, the game IS still playable and I am confident they can be patched and fixed at a later date.\n\nAnother qualm is that despite the narrative woes the main character goes through at the beginning of the game he is quite content to smile like a goof throughout a lot of it, making it difficult to get invested in what is going on.\n\nHOWEVER... having said all of that I still recomend the game. There is some very good art direction going on here, and some of the models really impressed me. The gameplay, though rough, is pretty solid and thus-far is about the same level of challenge you would get from Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask.\n\nThe developers also seem to be rather proud of the lore they have given to this world, as one of the collectibles in the game are lore scrolls that give brief explainations of the world, and the things you will find in it, and they are kept in a dedicated lore tab. It is not a large gesture but it does a lot to reassure me of how much the devs care about the game.\n\nThe game is at its best when nobody is talking and you are let loose to explore an atmospheric area. There is plenty of evocative map design going on here and I will be interested to discover more of it going forwards. I hope the developers keep working on this game post-launch to smooth out the edges (and honestly, those are edges that should have been smoothed before release just fyi, lads).","April 11","true","9.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I've completed the story of this game and it took me between 7/8 hours which I personally think is a good length considering the price (for me) was £14.99. - which probably equates to about $20.\n\nIt was a charming little game, made with unity, (which shows at some points) with graphics that I really enjoyed with several varying environments. Some of which I preferred over others. For the actual game you start off as Tavian, the son of the Meritian Emperor who is more or less trying to defeat a forest guardian. As you progress through the story, you meet Bitt and Merdeira - two forest spirits who will aid you in your quest to basically save the forest. Each of the characters have one unique skill to help you through the game. (although Tavian's skill, to me, felt literally pointless - there was no need for it) There is also a nice variety of weapons for you to use throughout, each with different speeds/damage outputs.\n\n-The combat could definitely use some work, there were points in the game where I physically couldn't beat a regular enemy, that I had to defeat to advance the game, because the only weapon I had swung to slow to actually hit the enemy before they hit me.\n-There is literally no need for some of the riddles. Riddles that you literally get no introduction to.\n-I found a few bugs during my playthrough. (1) One being if you slide (pressing B on the xbox controller) off a ledge sometimes you will land still sliding, but completely still and unable to move for a good 20 seconds. (2) The other main bug I noticed was sometimes if I dropped off a small ledge (or even a table!) I would get stuck in the falling animation and be unable to move so I would have to reboot the game. (3) I don't know whether I would class this as a bug, but during one of the three major dungeons (the one where you end up underground, for no spoilers) the enemies I hit would often end up flying through solid walls and casually just walking back out.\n\nEven with all of this in mind, I did enjoy my time - even if it was a little frustrating at time.","May 9","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Controls feel a bit clunky like you can't quite move as well as the enemies can. You can get accustom to it though. Did I mention this is VERY zelda like? It's like Windwaker in looks and atmosphere. I use a PS4 controller, so I don't know if the game will do it for an XBONE one, but the in game interaction icons are that of a ps4. So if the game recognizes different controllers, props to the devs. I'd still recommend this game anyway. Oh, yeah, you can jump.","April 9","true","0.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

Once you get passed the poor camera angles, impossilble lighting, and bugy enemies this game has a lot to offer. If only in nostalgia onlone this game pays back your money tenfold. If you want a gameplay experience to remind you of the good old days with Banjo Kazooie, LOZ Ocarina of time, or even Windwaker with many fun and modern twists and enhancements this is the game for you. I highly recomend giving it a try especially at the price you will not regret it. Unless you are deathly afraid of poor camera angles. Then stay far, far away.","April 11","true","2.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The storyline is strong and engaging, the world you're immersed into is vast and has been developed in a way to allow players to explore and discover in however way they choose, but it is also beautifully made in terms of presentation and the design of the main characters and the design of the different elements that make up this world. [Unique quite easily describes the layout here]\nThe accompanying soundtrack is fitting and works harmoniously with the game.\nAnother strong point of this game; Puzzles. The puzzles in this game are fun! while not always easy they prove a great additional challenge to the gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are masterfully set up, and the camera angles and focus points are spot on.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game to anyone looking for something new and fun. It won't dissappoint.\n\n-AW","April 10","true","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Shortly after starting up you're ambushed by some impossible to kill bad guys. So of course I had to fight them. I died then after re-spawning I got softlocked in some dialog. Had to kill the game and restart it. Later on I jumped into a corner and was trapped; couldn't get out. Had to restart again.\n\nGame is playable as long as you do what it's expecting you to do, might even have some fun glitchy playthroughs, but it just didn't hold my interest. Combat is very basic and just as linear as TooT or Windwaker; seems to have an even longer recovery after basic attacks to boot. No way to cancel animations that I could find and just lacks any depth.\n\nThere's also an abundance of these curly icons that you're collecting everywhere similar to notes in Banjo Kazooie, but there just seems to be no reason for them to be there other than having stuff to collect. As long as you don't purposefully avoid them you'll always have enough to progress; from my limited play.\n\nJust came to the conclusion that I'd much rather be replaying something like Darksiders; so I did.","April 10","false","0.4"," 11 of 33 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","11","33","0","3"
