Ha-ha, right, that is me!\n\nOriginal idea behind physics amazed me. This is not casual puzzle platformer you all get used to play, this is something new.\nArcade-like hardcore minimalistic world used to be a perfect for an electric sphere and it makes you build your own strategies with more and more approaches to get into new level.\n\nDo not forget that there are also some insane graphics with original music and tons of levels to play! Controller works as well.\n\nIf you're just passing by - do not miss an opportunity to blow your mind off!","June 2","true","1.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

It was metal, that I give credit for. But the game itself is too random, has obvious bugs like ramps not being loaded, making levels impossible, has almost no explanations and too many instant death traps. I could not get past Level A-5 which is a pity as the survival mode only gets unlocked after A-8 which I was looking forward to. I could not get enough stars to even buy one single item. (As a matter of fact I barely managed to find the shop screen at all after I already lost hope and desperately tried to find settings or key bindings which I might have overlooked) The graphics are appealing, though they are not refined enough to qualify the view as a pleasure. The menus are not user friendly.\n\nPlease fix the randomness. Make sure, all blocks and ramps are loaded and the camera does not reset itself. Add some explanations or make the tutorial levels clear enough to learn what is needed to play. Maybe make the map rotating instead of always facing north. Ditch the timer running out. Make it beatable. I could be a nice game, but at the current version 1.0.0, it is just not ready.\n\nJudge for yourself in my Let's Play (5 parts in German):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBh161wQo3M","May 28","false","1.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I would of been happy paying more for this game. there is a lot of levels and customizations for the ball to unlock. this game is HARD! stunning visuals and the adventure levels are really big and confusing giving it that marblemaze feel. the survial levels are just plain fun and a little less stressful.\n\noverall 110% worth the money.","May 31","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Developers have managed to create two absolutely unique modes: third-person Arcade and side-scrolling Survive.\nEven if you’re not a fan of “Marble Madness”, “Ballance” or “Switchball” there are many reasons for taste “GROOVY”. There are huge locations, a lot of levels and it’s really hardcore (for me truly hardcore started with level A-5 :)) But anyway levels are pretty beatable, it’s not too difficult to get 2 stars, for example. However, if you want receive three, you should earnestly try and create own strategy for every level. It’s possible, of course, but very-very difficult. It’s like: “You try, fail, try again, fail again, and then try another one time, but fail again, TRY AND FAIL, TRY AND FAIL, but can’t stop until you get it!” :) Withal game is really addictive and enjoyable.\nNow a few words about game advantages.\n“GROOVY” has got a truly superb graphics (glad that it runs on my far from the most powerful PC). Mechanisms, Groovy, every levels detail, platforms are well-made and look literally amazing.\nPhysics of the ball deserves special compliments. Jumps, inertia, torque – that’s all implemented perfectly.\nMusic should liked by every person who like techno and electronic. It’s dynamic, in game style, doesn’t distracts and isn’t annoying.\nThe system of customization of Groovy skins is remarkable, and I bet you’ll spend a lot of time changing the ball. Because you can change everything! Texture, HUE, saturation, gloss, emissivity etc.\nFinally I’d say that I played with controller and it works fine.\n\nSo, summing up:\n+ Great graphics\n+ Remarkable physics\n+ Two radically different game modes\n+ Large number of levels\n+ Hardcore\n+ Many gameplay hours\n+ Cool music\n+ Deep skin customization\n+ 60 achievements\n+ 12 languages are supported\n+ Reasonable price\n+ Controller support\n\nWithout doubt, “GROOVY” is one of the best platformer I ever met.\n10/10!","May 31","true","2.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I like the interface and menus, But that mouse lag on the menus is pretty bad.\n\nHonestly the game needs one of the forced tutorials, if only for a minute, to at least tell what those things are your getting, and show controls.\n\nOnce I figured them out, The controls of this game were actually a hell of a lot smoother than marble madness, and I actually had fun flashing back to classic marble platforming.\n\nI do with the levels had a little more color to them, as everything is a little bland and all looks similar.\n\nThe 3d environment itself is really nice besides the lack of vibrant coloring.\n\nNot sure what happened on the 2nd level, But I Appear to have glitched inside of a spaceship? No way to pause or exit out of it? Had to quit, Must of been a glitch of some sort, Because when I went back and loaded it again, It beamed me from the ship down like it was supposed to.\n\nEven tho its been used in many games, I like the 3 star system here, It works at rating you pretty well.\n\nOverall if you like Marble Madness, you'll probably dig this at least to some extent.\nI do wish it had sort of a story behind it tho, idk I know its just a marble so its hard, but imagine the marble was a creature rolled in a ball, or a computer with a mind? Just food for thought, makes the "Character" a lot more relatable.\n\nPros:\n+ Its Like Marble Madness\n+ Way Better Mechanics than Marble Madness\n+ Well Designed\n+ Fun Gameplay\n+ Achievements\n+ Trading Cards\n\n\nCons:\n- Menu lag\n- Glitched on 2nd level on my first play, so Probably not all the bugs are out.\n- Not very Colorful\n- Lack of story\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to Steamified for providing the key for review purposes.\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.\nYou're also welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.","June 5","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
