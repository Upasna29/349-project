"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/291370/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFull disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nI'm going to preface this review with what I think Early Access should mean. Then I'm going to tell you what "Undead Overlord" is. Early Access should be a title that, while unpolished and lacking features, is a fun experience that feels... nearly complete. Like a game that can stand on its own with maybe a little asterisk. And throughout its developmental process it should only improve, getting polished and expanded. Good examples of this are "Kerbal Space Program," "Sunless Sea," "Prison Architect..." the list goes on. Then they're released into the full-release wild, like "Betrayer" and "Sir, You are Being Hunted."\n\nThat is the expected and desired life cycle of all things Early Access. And let me add this: I think Early Access is not above criticism - even downright damnation. If a game is bad, it's bad. I'm not giving it leeway because "it isn't done yet." If you're selling a product, finished or not, I'm going to criticize it. People think criticizing Early Access is tantamount to punching a baby. I don't agree with that. Especially when the game is 30 minutes of content with an intended additional 60 minutes of content.\n\nThis game is bad. Objectively. It is a fact, like how old the universe is, how its heat death is inevitable, and how St. Paul, Minnesota is the happiest place on Earth (full disclosure: I've never been to St. Paul, Minnesota). Firstly let's address the graphics, arguably the least important feature (especially for an RTS). I feel that you have three options when developing a game: you can go the technically impressive route, the artistic route, or a wonderful fusion of both. "Undead Overlord" decided on the fourth, controversial option of terrible. This is pretty ugly. There is no artistic merit here. This is not fun to look at. This is like staring at the sun; it will cause inevitable blindness, madness, and is wholly inadvisable. It is jagged, blocky, muted, and utterly painful to look at. The levels are barren (particularly the one skirmish level). The character models look like the tourists in a "RollerCoaster Tycoon" game. I know graphics aren't that important at the end of the day, but you still have to stare at this for hours on end.\n\nGameplay is the real meat of any good game sandwich. Unfortunately for you, "Undead Overlord" features a single, suspicious slice of green bologna. You select your zombie, click on a target, and he runs over to jankily smack him or her around until they collapse into a pool of blood, resurrecting to join your dead ensemble or providing a snack for health and strength. Interesting concept, yes. But it's shallow and not fun. You're just clicking your increasingly unruly horde at dwindling townspeople and first responders until there's nothing left. Then you're on to the next of three levels. You'll blast through these in... five, ten minutes (the levels are small and same-y)? But don't worry, the developers plan on adding six more! That's roughly an hour and a half of entertainment potentially! And if they meet some unspecified monetary goal they're going to add such exciting features as MULTIPLAYER, HUMAN CAMPAIGN, and MAP EDITOR.\n\nThe AI is nonexistent. They react to your presence (sometimes) but don't expect them to seek you out or patrol of their own volition. This is a very one-sided RTS. The aforementioned skirmish level really shines a light on this. The level design on the single skirmish level is also pretty bland, featuring nothing but room after room stuffed with an assortment of humans and/or dog corpses.\n\nSo that's it. That's "Undead Overlord." It feels and plays like an iOS game. The trailer is admittedly cool looking, as is the concept. But I didn't see that game when I played. I'm not picking on this game or the developers. I just don't want you to be burned. This is not worth your hard-earned cash or time. When you can buy complete games for less than this, and when you can purchase Early Access titles more polished than this, what's the incentive? Do you like to gamble? To live dangerously? "Undead Overlord" is about as fun as staring into the sun. Some might disagree, shouting in disbelief while staring till their eyes melt out of their skulls. But you and me? We'll just keep walking, sunglasses on and eyes fixed squarely ahead.","July 18, 2014","false","2.3"," 193 of 346 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","193","346","5","26"

Instead of killing zombies you controll them witch is fun and you don't see many games that do this.\nIts in alpha but shows a lot of potential to become a great game. I'm hoping for new levels to come as soon as possible.\n\nObviously there was some stuff that i didn't like. Such as the way the zombies behave. For example when you tell them to attack someone even tough they are getting their ♥♥♥ kicked they completely ignore the person thats tryng to kill them. So pretty much what you do in this game is to tell them where to go and they handle the rest. The heart beat when your chaos meter gets filled up is really loud and annoying... So on. I am writing these of the top of my head so i probably will froget about some of them.\n\nPlayed all the current levels. First 3 was a blast to play. Skirmish map however is really really hard.\nThe last map is only for alpha players and it basicly lets you spawn any npc you want and just do as you please witch was the best map for me. I dont think there will be anything like a map editor/creator. At least i havent heard of it. If there is and i think there HAS TO BE a map editor. That would give the game so much replay value.\n\nSo AI acts stupid sometimes. Both zombies and humans. Haven't come across any bugs. The existing levels are pretty good but there is room for improvement. Other than that this game is really fun to play and it has an idea that we don't see in games very often. I cant say you will like the game but i certinly love zombie games and this was one of the best i played as far as the gameplay goes...","September 13, 2014","true","4.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

You control the undead, and use them to wipe out the city. You can either eat the humans to regain health, or change them into zombies, to add to your army. You can merge zombies into more powerful undead creatures, and use special abilities with these creatures.\n\nLike I said, it was looking great. I'd have loved to see a completed game.

They have since returned, and are now actively working on the game again, so please either skip the next 3 paragraphs or continue reading until the end. Thanks.\n\nNo updates since december and the ONLY activity on the forums is always just a couple of lines denying this game is dead and a short explanation about how busy they have been with new babies etc...\n\nI believe they have no intentions of developing this game any further and are simply cashing in until it is removed from sale. If this is not the case, then a simple progress update on the forums once a month would go a long way.\n\nSo my recommendation is, DO NOT BUY a game where the developers can't even be bothered to spend a couple of minutes once a month to update their paying customers.\n\n1/10\n\nEDIT: After several months of hearing virtually nothing from the Devs they have finally posted a status report.

They are working on it! If they keep this up, they will get a recommended review from me! Two more missions and some more content, not sure it was worth the wait but still this shows the developers still care about their game to some degree...\n\nOLDER UPDATE ON MY REVIEW:\nInterestingly enough, it does seem as if the developers are working on this. It isn't plainly obvious to everyone, but evidence is there. If you were to veiw the developer's posts, you will find that the developers are commenting on people's comments that question whether they are working on the game. The commenting on these questions are always along the lines of yes, they are working on the game. The developers have notably hinted that they have a community manager, and that this manager seems to have gone. So, this is supposedly the reason why we hear so little coverage on the progression of this game. Also, they hinted other complications such as some sort of problems with jobs and 'life intervening', as they say. They have stated that they are currently working on the next patch/update, but that it will take longer than expected by us, the gamers, and them, the developers. Still, though, I can't really recommend the game until I know for sure that the game is being worked (waiting for an update)...\n\nMY REVIEW:\n\nDo I reccomend this game? Well, in it's current state... it's a no from me and I think you'll find it's a no from- now quite a numerous amount of- other players.\n\nThe game Undead Overlord pleasantly suprised me when I first played it back in 2014; upon first glance of the game I suppose it isn't difficult to mistake this for a really short, unresponsive, ugly, glitchy and really not fun to play game. I bought this game with an open mind, a mind open to the probability that this game is what could have been what I mentioned just before. I played the game and find out that the game ran smootly, apart from only a few apparent glitches and the occasional unresponsive zombie. Most of all, however, it was fun. The game looked, and still is, rough around the edges and has quite a bit of content that is not present yet (I say yet, but some things may never be added). Despite this, it was FUN.\n\nOne thing I enjoyed was commanding the shambling, blood thirsty and brain hungry zombies to attack the puny human meatsacks which attempted to run away in fear or dared to stand in the mighty Overlord's way by trying to eliminate my increasingly growing horde. There were other aspects which I enjoyed also, such as sacrificing a percentage of my horde to create a bigger badass zombie and breaking the lid (doors) of a lunch box (building) to get to the delicious food inside (the tasty human flesh) and upon entering, indulged upon a free all zombies-can-eat buffet and left with a bigger horde and a fuller stomach. In all seriousness, I liked this game.\n\nThough however, this is ruined by the sheer lack of updates and and the fact that the developers seem to have abonded this game. The game is going to fully release and come out of early access in July, this- to me at least- makes me concerned for the wellfare and playability of this game. A update hasn't been released since around Christmas, which is about over four months ago I think. If an update hasn't been released in four months, what honestly is the probability of this game being complete at all? The developers will have to pull some sort of miracle in order to complete this game, let alone repair it's reputation. The only thing I can hope for- that anyone could hope for- is that the game is due an absolutely giant update that will give players something to play for a long duration of time. Either that or the bigger stuff is only coming when the game is complete/released fully. In which case, the game would be more a demo than a game. But shouldn't a demo be free? But then again.. the don't the developers need money for development? Is this game really just a demo, but rendered a Early Access game so the developers can get money? There a few questions which can be asked about this game, but likely will not be answered.\n\nI'm not one to decide wether the developers should be or should not be working on the development of this game, but I think that they should work on this; this game is seemingly unique and seems to be few of a kind. If they aren't working on the game, it would be common decency for them to announce this, rather than just take up and leave without and indication in the slightest. Also, maybe even a price reduction (if they already have enough money to develop this if development is still continuing). Maybe even an apology for quiting on the game, or opposed to this an anouncement that clearly states the game is being worked on. I believe that the game probably is being worked on; community silence doesn't mean they aren't working on the game.\n\nIt kinda makes me angry how players are flaming over the fact that progress is taking too long, people need to realise developers have lives too. They are probably occupied with more important matters, or they could even be doing a really good update and are perfecting it as we speak. Still though, it is kinda likely that the game isn't being worked on.\n\nWith that said, players do still need some sign that the game is being worked on, and some new content needs to arrive eventually. Only then can I and other players properly recommend this game. The game has, or had, a lot of potential, but unfortunately potential alone is not success or a deciding factor to buy a game. I personally think that it would be worth investing time and some money else where, in another Early Access game that you know for sure is being worked on.","April 18, 2015","false","23.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's not finished for one thing. A second key point that is worth mentioning is that it is not a game with femiliar gameplay. Both these 2 things are being said not in a negitive sense, not at all. They are just worth being noted before i go into what the game is.\n\nUndead Overlord, I saw this awhile back on Kickstarter. The concept of being the zombie-leader-commander was a very good hook, and still is. The game never made it to being fully funded. But now its been out for early access, which is cool. Gameplay is unique a bit clunky on a few things, but taking into account the game isn't finished yet should put some minds at ease for the time being. The game plays like a RTS but most of the time I feel like i'm always starting out with a infantry-flood tactic, which I suppose is to be expected (because you're zombies).

At the time of this review there are only three missions which are okay but the human ai isn't too realistic they stand in one spot usually waiting for you, but the actual zombie part feels a lot like infectionator with direct zombie control. The mission map could be bigger for sure, but as a learning tutorial grounds i'd say it fits pretty well in getting you started.\n\nThe skirimish map is the next thing you can do after missions, (or right away like i did) where you have to destroy the human base with the starting zombies you get, where you have to get past mines and seemingly random human placement in general areas ( different people spawn in the same spots sorta) That was only really difficult if you didn't use the mutants, if you're a fan of the normal zombies however using the action skill it has usually can help get that beat. the map isnt super well made but its long and has tons of people and all the mutants unlocked for you to try.\n\nThe last part which i found to be awesome as hell is the alpha mode where you get a large area full of destructables and a building where you can place in mines, civilians, militia/gunmen, goats and zombies and test out scenarios or have a huge person zombie war... I wasted so many zombies on a wall of survivors.... so far 3D infectionator-like game is pretty small a couple of hours long for me but it's alright maybe the zombies could have horde animations rather than just single zombie ones so that in a horde it looks more like an attack rather than single punches","August 16, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Despite the concept here, the execution is rather lacklustre. This is an early access game, however I don't think this should relieve it of any criticism whatsoever and the really unfortunate thing is that this game is bad. the graphics are awful, dull and featureless, which is evident from the loading screen at the start, which isn't just ugly, it also looks incredibly stupid. The gameplay is entirely shallow, all you do is run around chasing civilians who run away (which is pretty frustrating) or run head on at armed forces until they die. There seems to be no strategic depth here at all, all the missions involve just killing everyone on the level, even the skirmish maps, which are slightly larger versions of the campaign map. This game is really disappointing, especially given the intended features are pretty sparse and patches are few and far between. I would not recommend buying this game until you can see it in full release.","November 22, 2014","false","0.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Not really worth buying at this stage, and it might not be worth buying at all. The gameplay is really bland and I couldn't play for more than 15 minutes, but hey, maybe it'll be better in the future. But for now, DO NOT BUY.\n\n\nEDIT -\nWow, a little under a year later and this game is STILL as bland as ever. The devs have not updated this game in a very long time with little to no communication with the players. I want my money back. My only regret is that Steam's new refund system came out after I bought this game, so it was too late to get myself a refund. DO NOT BUY.\n\nEDIT 2 -\nJesus Christ they actually updated it a few months ago. But the update was the SMALLEST PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ TO EVER. Especially because of the amount of time they had us wait (nearly under a year) for the next update, and the fact that it was a very small update just makes it all the more insulting. You'd expect that there'd be a large update after so much time with an apology, but no, it was a very small update. Now they've gone under the radar AGAIN.

I found as I was just getting good at the mechanics the story mode was done.  So, I replayed the last mission just for practice before moving on to the skirmish.  Good thing too because it is where this game's potential is truly shown.   This is just a teaser but it has done its job....want more!  I'll be first in line to get the beta.","July 19, 2014","true","14.7"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Devs almost never talk to the community. You know how long it took them to churn out Alpha 1.16? 10 months, for an abysmal update, and they only ever talked to us once or twice, and that was them trying to give us bulshit reasons as to why they won't make their game. This is nothing but a smash and grab game, made to look cool so they can take your money and never give it back. Great buisiness model guys! You've successfully used the Steam refund system to your own advantage!\n\nOh yeah, I forgot to mention, the devs are starting to act childish. "Don't mind the hate, we don't :)" you better start minding the hate, if you don't fix this sh!t you're going to lose everything. This is to everyone on Steam, stay away from this game!","June 2","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
