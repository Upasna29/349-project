My comments are my own.\n\nThis game gets customizing magic down to a science.  Granted this game does have limitations on what you can make but as long as you can imagine something gameplay-wise chances are there's some combination to make it.  Whether you want a vacuum laser wand to suck up all that delicious loot so you don't have to run around and get it all or a fireball that has ice effects as well.\n\nThe graphics is beautiful.  Visually it's all paper but well made with that design.\n\nI wholeheartedly reccomend this game.\n\nNot convinced?

It's a wonderful little passtime, but to stack it up against the big-name titles, it just doesn't stand a chance. Anyways, Magicmaker is a fun little game that combines platforming and bullet-hell gameplay very well. Most interesting is the ability to customize your own spells in a multitude of ways with a wide variety of combinations and effects such as making a spell that can pass through walls before splitting into multiple shots and explode fire onto everything. Sadly, the game is very short and a bit lacking in the story department, but I found the game to be a fun little distraction on the whole. Worth playing when you just need to kill some time. I'd suggest $5-10 bucks.","September 1, 2014","true","25.8"," 83 of 110 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","83","110","0","0"

TLDR summary at the bottom!\n\nAnyway, Magicmaker is a great game for anyone who ever wanted to custom-build the wizard of their dreams. A lot of games over the years have taken a stab at the idea of a customizable magic system, but so far, I've not seen it done better than Magicmaker.\n\nThe idea is you are a wizard, hired by a temp agency to be a security guard. As you play, you'll collect elements, colors, and other bits that can be combined to make whatever sorts of spell you can imagine. Want to throw fireballs? Easily done. What about black hole beams that suck out someone's life? Easily done. Magic pets (or even turrets) that attack any who challenge your rule? Walk up walls, jump off the air, or just straight-up teleport? Done, done, and done. With approximately 2 MILLION possible combinations, you might be at this awhile, just experimenting with all the neat stuff you can think up!\n\nI can say without a doubt that I've found one of my favorite time-killers in Magicmaker. The art style is charming, the game mechanics are loads of fun, and there's all sorts of humorous nods throughout the game that will brighten your day.\n\nSome people will wonder about the development team, "Tasty Stewdios", since the interaction and passion of game developers is important. It's easy to see how they are by looking around the forum community: they love their fans, and love their game, and want to see the two happy together. Very responsive and passionate about their game, TS is quick to address problems with the game, consider suggestions, and speak to players like people, not numbers.\n\n--------\n\nTLDR:\n\nCreate custom spells, rack up kills, loads of fun. I made a spell that shot a magenta beam at people so hard, it ricocheted between 15 different monsters and blew them all to ash, then sucked out their soul energy to power my horrible rampage through the desert.\n\n10/10 would wizard again.","September 27, 2014","true","13.2"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","85","41","48","22","2"

The magic system is fantastic. There are forty materials to use in spells, each of which applies a different effect like poisoning, lifesteal, faster fire rate, exploding, splitting, gravitation, and LAZORS. The system works very well and it is fun to make lots of interesting spells.\n\nObviously no system is perfect. There are some bugs, like piercing not seemingly enhancing lasers and other things. There are literally millions of combinations, so this is to be expected.\n\nThe area where this game really suffers is actual gameplay. Aside from the ability to create millions of different spells, there is nothing in the game that hasn't been seen in every other side-scrolling dungeon crawler. The enemies are not very varied, and can all be defeated fairly easily with a powerful spell or two. There are five zones, each with four or five missions, so the game does not last very long. You can go back to freeplay previous zones, but the only point is to get more materials.\n\nHowever, the game is still in active development, and the developers comment on most of the threads in the steam discussions, so it can only get better. The spell-building system alone has tons of replay value. Making new spells and asking, "what happens when I put AoE on my turret with lasers?" is enough to play this game for a good 5-10 hours alone.\n\nOverall, if you like customizing and experimenting, this is a great game, but if you are looking for a solid dungeoncrawler platformer, look elsewhere.","September 29, 2014","true","18.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

The problem is, the game is short and relies on the New Game+ mechanic for replay value. However, if you're looking at this game, it's probably for one thing:\n\n-Making your own spells.-\n\nTo this end, the game really does shine. While certain elements are better than others, -most- of them are fairly balanced, such as the three "DoT" elements. Burn spreads (which makes it really good in areas with lots of small enemies (Desert...)), Poison stacks on the same target, and Curse deals damage to nearby enemies when the target dies. Then you have two elements that change the mana cost of the spell (these are, in my opinion, not recommended for the wand, which deals little damage but uses no mana). Blood Contract gives the spell a boost to damage and effect, but causes the spell to consume health instead of mana. The other is the Arrow element, which removes mana cost (or causes the health cost to go down a ton in the case of Blood Contract + Arrow), however the spell now becomes more like a bow, with very limiting ammo that you have to then retrieve to continue firing.\n\nThe game also allows players of various playstyles to play the game. One of the artifacts, for example, increases the damage you deal and take by 1% for each enemy you kill, with it reseting when you finish the dungeon (it stacks multiplicatively, so your damage dealt and taken are doubled after the first 70 stacks.) Combine this with the Blood Contract spell effect (just be careful, as the Blood Contract's health cost increases too... I have gotten to points where I've killed so many enemies that the spells takes more health than I've got) and the Repulsor Energy robe effect (After taking damage, your next spell gets a massive damage boost), and you're looking at dealing huge amounts of damage. Conversely, you could make a shield spec revolving around Harpy Feather spell (pushes enemies back), Evercold Ice robe effect (supplies an absorption barrier after not taking damage for a couple seconds) and Lightning Rod robe effect (after a certain amount of time it creates a barrier that deflects incoming spells.) The options really are staggering.\n\nSo, despite the short playtime, I would definitely recommend this game. It's a lot of fun messing around with the spell mechanic to find something you like. Just be careful with that last boss...","April 24","true","24.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

More spells slots open up later and you get effects for your robes and wands so you can still create a versatile set of attacks, but it would have been nice to be able to build spells in the pause menu.\n\nThat said, when your homing fire spell doesnt work, you can always use your robes to bounce off the walls and generate a seismic event at every point of contact like a SUPER BOUNCY BALL OF AWESOME!\n\nHeed my warning though, make sure your computer's processor is running well. Get the demo to make sure it'll work on your computer. The particle effects on each spell get ridiculous and the graphics can't be adjusted much. This game may look like it'd run on flash, but make no mistake, the number of objects on screen would make a weak processor  fill it's pants with fear. Don't believe me? Use fire on anything. ANYTHING. It spreads from object to object and has an effect displayed on all of them. If you use a fire spell on a closely packed group of enemies, you'll wipe them out and probably crash the game too. There are no small groups of enemies either, its always 20 or so goblins on fire in the same square inch of screen space.

It has far more combinations than Magicka.  Unlike Magicka you cannot change your spells on the fly.  You must design them before attempting each level.  It also allows you to enchant your robe, also by combining elements.\n\nThe Good:\nDesigning spells and robe enchantments works well, and is pretty well balanced.\nCombat and platforming is usually challenging but not frustratingly difficult.\nThe alchemy system allows you to “choose your reward”, rather than it always being random.\nThere is a wide variety of options for customizing your character's and spells' appearance, without changing their effects.\nThe spell visuals are pleasing and varied.\nThe non-player characters have quite a few lines to speak before you see any repeats, making the world more believable and entertaining.\nThe levels are procedurally generated, with a lot of variety.\nThe Bad:\nAzazel, the antagonist, is far more likable and sympathetic than the other characters.  She only wants to be educated without having to hide what she is, and to give other monsters the same right.  The game gives you no option to side with her.\nMany missions require certain spells or robe enchantments to complete, but the game allows you to start the mission without it.  While you can argue that is easy to avoid, it is not easy to avoid the procedural generation creating levels that are impossible to traverse without movement enhancing spells or robes.\nThe alchemy system is underutilized.  Spell elements drop almost constantly, while alchemical reagents drop far less.  It would be better if this situation was reversed.  The spells that do drop should tend to be low level, while alchemical reagents should be higher level.  There should perhaps be a way to convert excess spell elements to alchemical reagents.\nSome areas have levels with winding, invisible platforms that you must traverse by banging your head and grinding against the walls, or grinding the edges with a teleport spell.  The last level is the worst offender, due to the size of the area.  'Solving' these 'puzzles' requires no thought or skill, just an abundance of time and patience.  It would be better if these were removed.\nThe Fairy Queen boss fight, which was apparently already adjusted once due to being overly difficult, is still far too difficult.  I was only able to complete it by wearing a robe that destroys enemy projectiles and pushes enemies away, and pacing constantly.  The queen teleports constantly, and is unaffected by the push effect, so it allows you to hit her without hitting the huge swarm of fairies.  It's still very difficult to survive using this method.  I tried charming the fairies with a harmless spell, but they didn't attack the queen.\nThe poison flasks in the Halloween area are far too numerous, too damaging, and almost impossible to avoid when coupled with the large number of enemies in that area.\nThe Temple Guardian, sandstorms in the Desert Zone, and flying branches in the Forest Zone, aren't much of a threat, but are extremely annoying.  It would be better if they appeared about 1/4th as often, but were actually dangerous.\nThe ending is a slap in the face.  It isn't even funny.\nThe Ugly:\nSeveral areas consist of nothing but white outlines on black.  Some of the enemies are just spark particles.  That's pretty lazy artwork.\nIn the Forest Zone flocks of birds fly up from the ground constantly, obscuring enemies and their projectiles, and making the screen overly busy.","December 21, 2014","true","16.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Back in Oblivion, making and testing spells was one of my most favorite things to do, and now I have an entire game dedicated to the concept. There are plenty of materials to work with, allowing for ridiculous amounts of customization and experimentation. Vampiric swords, explosive lasers, and swarms of homing missiles are just the beginning of your options.\n\nIn addition, the game has one of the most charming graphics styles I've ever seen, with everything looking like craft paper cutouts, and a nice soundtrack, though not much sticks out as truly memorable.\n\nHowever, all is not good for Magicmaker. While it has a quirky sense of humor, the story mode is very short. A few hours is all it takes to beat campaign. And while there are a fair amount of extra levels, it still doesn't extend the game out to a satisfying length. New Game + helps some, but it's not quite enough either. The game also suffers from low performance on lower end machines.\n\nI would recommend the developers give the player a whole new hub area with new worlds, such as a volcanic world, or a crystalline cavern, or maybe a "death valley" level, and have more encounters with Azazel. I'd like to know more about her, give her a bit more background perhaps, or at least just have her show up more. I'm pretty sure she only ever showed up twice, not including the final battle. I would also add some graphics options, especially some kind of particle fade. Random bits of dead enemies tend to clutter the floor and reduce performance.\n\nOverall, despite its glaring flaws, Magicmaker is still a worthwhile play due to its incredible charm and its entertaining spellmaking system.","December 27, 2015","true","85.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Though I would love this idea translated into a RPG setting. That being said, the different materials are not as diverse as they should be. The perfect type of materials are things like walking on walls, and repulsion. In other words, they have to have an effect on how you go about playing the game. If it merely poisons, or burns etc and does damage over time, you are still doing the basic thing, i.e firing a projectile in a straight line. In other words, not game changing effects. The beauty of magic is in the vastness of the manipulation of the natural world that you can do. In other words, the game has a nice spell making mechanic, but because of the dungeon crawling, you end up having spells merely for dps, than to create a wonderous variety of spells. So with 2 million combinations, comes 1.9 million useless spells that get boring very fast.\n\nFrom what I have said, it may sound negative. I actually don't feel that way about the game. The general idea of the game, is precisely what I want in a game, quite literally. I would hundred fold recommend this game, not only because it is a bloody good dungeon crawler but because this idea of a magical systems needs to get out there! Beats magicka hands down. Not to say, this area needs bigger expansions and more imagination. Then again maybe I am the only one that wants to truly rule a world with powerful magic that I created in which the developers never intended because they could never computer all billion spell combinations ;)","December 21, 2014","true","33.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is yet another game that has been overlooked by the critics with DarkStation‘s Ian Soltes being the only Metacritic supercritic to have published a review of the game on their site. They awarded the game four out of five stars and closed by stating that it is a game that is absolutely worth playing.\n\nI agree with Soltes’s bottom line. It absolutely is worth playing and I’m a little disappointed that I waited this long to do so. It’s also disappointing that the critics largely overlooked the game because it deserves greater attention than what it has received. However, the 15,630 – 22,248 owners according to SteamSpy is a great achievement for a debut title from an indie developer that never went the route of bundling their game.\n\nIt’s worth playing because the relatively simplistic concept has been pulled off to perfection. It’s a combination platformer cross dungeon crawler that captures all of the magic that you would hope to have in a game accessible for all ages. The amount of customization in regards to spell and items is unparalleled.  As the end of the Steam Description states there are 2,193,360 potential combinations for you to employ. It’s not just a number either as the amount of variety definitely feels genuine. It’s not a case of having a thousand different combinations where there are only two or three varieties at the end of the day.\n\nHowever, that alone doesn’t make a game a good game. It gives it an increased opportunity to be good but it needs much more. The more is in the game play. The game is super fun to play and with all of the different colors the graphics are truly pleasing on the eye. The game plays like a highly developed 2D platformer. The only downside to the game is that the game is actually very short which sadly makes all of the different combinations a little redundant but replayability is increased with a new game + mode. The game has been Steamified with trading cards and achievements galore.\n\nTasty Stewdios have shown that they have the makings of a purely outstanding game. A sequel with some minor improvements and significantly more content could generate one of the best games on Steam.\n\nFor more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.","May 2","true","12.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This game has the same concept to the Nth degree. I have played a bit and am still finding new spells and combinations of spells to use. Aside from the spell mechanic it is a platformer that gets increasingly hard as the game progresses. Some levels turn into bullet hells with so much going on that my computer lags a bit.\n\nThis game also offers a lot of customization. You can change the way that your wizard looks and the graphics and animations of  your spells and wand. The customization alone will add value to your dollar.\n\nFrom what I have played so far I would definitely recommend this to a gamer on a budget. It is a $10 dollar game and i would expect more than 10 hours of enjoyment out of it.

Some spells I've made of note:\n\n-A spell to summon about 100 minions a cast, without using mana (minions are weak, but you can get a lot)\n-A homing laser turret that goes through walls\n-A "machine gun" spell with a fire rate of 390 RPM\n-A force wall that lasts for a few seconds and damages anything that contacts it\n-A spreadfire of piercing projectiles that travel along walls\n\nAdditionally, for those who like customizing their characters' appearance, there is a character creator with a huge amount of custom-colorable components allowing a great amount of detail in character creation.\n\nHowever, while the spell and character creation is okay, there are a few issues with the game. Levels are procedurally put-together so you'll see pieces repeated, though in general they work well as an arena in which to use the spells you've created. A few glaring bugs still exist (notably a known bug I've encountered with the spell save/load (an OPTIONAL feature) breaking my save file), but the dev team so far appears active in trying to repair them.\n\nSummary:\nPros:\nThe best component-based spell creation since Magicka\nIntricate appearance customization\nSand worms\n\nCons:\nProcedurally-assembled levels can get slightly repetitive;\nFlying books you can't strike down and only dodge\nSome significant bugs present in the game\n\nThis game is a diamond in the rough - emphasis on "rough", but the devs are working on that.

There are mechanics in it allowing you to create spells and imbue enchantments into wands and robes. So let's get to the point. The spell creating system is great, and I really like it, but there are some turds in its punch bowl. First, the spells CAN be a bit bland, and the casting animations are a bit dumb. What I really like though, is the ingredient merging to add ingredients to robes, spells, and wands. You add an ingredient, such as explosive powder, and it gains properties, in this case, Area of Effect. This is a great mechanic, and I really like it.\n\nThe platforming is a little bad, but the bosses are really amazing. The first boss (which is pretty easy) is a plant monster, and it moves "tentacles" around clockwise or counterclockwise, making you have to move around with it, or you get hurt. The boss introduction is awesome though, as in this boss, it says "Gross Plant Monster: (Ican'trememberthename)" Ocarina of Time style, which I really like.\n\nOverall, this is a nice experience that you should enjoy thoroughly, but maybe lower the price, because this shouldn't be so high as Terraria, which has lots of fun and content and is what a bullet hell really is. I'm not saying the isn't a bullet hell, it's really more a bullet heaven. Good game.

I do wish there was more story content, seeing as you reach the final boss before advancing your spells beyond the second level, but there are some side levels you can do after the fact.

If there can only be one meaningful interaction between any two objects, then three objects yield 3 interactions, one for each object pair. Four objects, on the other hand, give 6 potential interactions. Five objects give 10 interactions. As the number of objects goes up, the number of interactions increases at a much faster rate. This is one of the problems with text-based adventure games: there are so many different objects, the programmers couldn't possibly implement enough interactions for everything to make sense.\n\nFor a long time, I've been fascinated by the concept. The idea of being able to combine any two things to get something I've never seen before, no matter how many times the process is repeated, was something I could only dream of.\n\nMagicmaker isn't there yet, but it might just be closer than anything I've seen before.\n\nThe game's primary feature is the ability to customize your spells. At first, the only available options seemed to be the standard, boring customizations easily available in other games. Set targets on fire, faster cast speed, and so on. However, as the game goes on, I started to realize just how well the spell customization was implemented. I could create a turret originating at my mouse cursor that shot laser beams that changed directions randomly. In many games, most of those traits would have been incompatible, but Magicmaker is at its best when combining crazy spell attributes into a beautifully chaotic whole.\n\nHowever, I can't say that it's a particularly well-polished game. The graphics are a mix of flash-game style shapes and a painfully obvious overreliance on particle effects. And for a 2D game with such simplistic graphics, it's horrifically laggy and bug-laden. Entering certain levels caused my game to crash, and the options regarding particle effects don't seem to do anything.\n\nIn short, if you can look past the problems, it's a brilliant customization-based game. I'd certainly reccomend it, but if lag makes you cringe, I might suggest waiting until those problems are fixed.","October 9, 2014","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You then spend your time adventuring, collecting treasure, hoarding ancient artifacts, killing fairies, and basically doing everything except guarding the school you're supposed to be guarding.\n\nGraphics: Everything is made out of paper, but the game really rocks that look. In addition, the 2D graphics make it suitible for lower-end machines as well as gaming beasts.\n\nAnd the ALL IMPORTANT GAMEPLAY: Amazing. The spellcrafting system works wonderfully, and while there are some limits - such as a cap on the materials that can be used to make a spell - chances are, if you can imagine it, you can make it. The platforming controls are a bit odd, mostly with the hold-down jump mechanics and the relatively slow move speed, but you can enchant your robes to take care of that if need be!\n\nOutstanding Feature: I especially enjoyed the multilayered shielding technique I used for my robe: A Lightning Rod to block projectiles, a Magic Boomerang to block melee attacks, and a cube of Evercold Ice to absorb any damage that got through. These all regenerate over time as well, and there are also spells that can regenerate health on a kill, so it's pretty forgiving.\n\nFinal Comments: Magicmaker is a wonderful game that really deserves a place of honor in anyone's game library.","December 18, 2014","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Spellcrafting!  This isn't your average "okay, I can have a bolt, laser or spray of 3 elements... boooring...."  This is REAL spellcrafting.  (If you wanted a fire bolt, you can still make one.)\n\nPros:\n- Huge variety!  I've played for a decent bit and I'm still unlocking more slots and more elements, yielding a ridiculous amount of possible combinations.\n- Great visuals!  The customization extends to the image of your spells, so you can cast in style.  In addition to a modest but effective assortment of costume customizations, the art style of the world of Magicmaker is remeniscient to craft time in kindergarden!  Think Kirby's Epic Yard style but with paper.\n- Great music!  The adorable soundtrack reminds me of the games of my youth, such as Yoshi's Story or Maplestory (I get it, I like stories.) where I would simply sit and listen to the soundtrack because it's so heartwarming.\n- Atmosphere!  The setting is nothing short of adorable.  The NPCs admittedly few lines of dialogue will charm as you walk through the hub testing out your spells.  The tone is both comic and endearing.\n- Did I mention variety?  I meant it.  In addition to spellcrafting, you can also customize the traits of your robe and use varying artifacts.\n- Execution.  The game is just oozing "fun."  I want to collect all the treasure in a level to unlock that next spell slot at all costs!\n\nCons:\n\n- The controls are a bit janky.  The mouse and keyboard works fine, but I wish I had more mouse buttons.  My problem really.  Abandon ye who wish to aim with a controlstick--I found it impossible.\n- Enemy variety.  Though I've only played a little, I've encountered a ton of different enemies.  But at the same time, I feel I've encountered very little variety in the threat--they all pose the same threats.  Either damaging by bumping into you or by shooting at you.  There are a few exceptions to this, such as elite enemies carrying treasure or the boss fights at the end of the level.  They provide enough variety to keep it fresh.\n\nAll in all, if you like magic and crazy abilities determined only by the limits of your imagination, I think this game will appeal to you.\n\nFor the price? 10/10.\nWith real expectations?  8/10.\nIf you like adorable wizards? 10/10 regardless of price!","February 12, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With me so far?\n\nOK, so, SO MANY people have had a problem with the launcher installer that it's currently the #1 most asked question on the FAQ, which is how I learned how to fix my game, but then if this is the #1 most asked question, and the solution is pretty simple, then WHY HAVEN'T the dev's fixed it already?\n\nApart from that, it's yet another instance of the flash-style animations that belong in the 90's or early 00's, games that claim to provide full controller support, but the right stick is so wild as to not provide accuracy like a mouse would, and even then, no mouse sensitivity scaling either. (So it does not in fact provide FULL support)\n\nPros:\nExactly(?) 2 million spells (although I feel like the system was ripped out of Battlemage Lichdom or something previous)\nControls are tight enough that Super Meat Boy is an apt comparison. (At least for movement controls)\nAcheivements and trading cards!\n\nCons:\nGraphics and animation are subpar - but of course it's splashy, and it's hard to tell what the hell is going on most of the time.\nDead ends in the level design are there from the very beginning. I'm sure there are many more to come. (Not even a crappy chest? come on!)\nI got past the first boss and into the hub town within a half hour, skipped boring orienteering messages from NPCs. Learned that upgrades are irrelevant, and/or can be accessed from nearly anywhere within the hub town or some levels.\n\nFinal Verdict: 3/10 - I came for the promise of magical powers, but there are too many flaws to make the game hold my interest. The game's not ugly, but it commits the larger sin of being boring, (and confusing, which is not the same thing as complex.)\n\nJust buy Enter the Gungeon. No wizardry, no platforming, but still somehow it's what this game tried to be.","May 31","false","1.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It looked like fun, and when the price dropped to $5 for a sale, I had to pick it up.\n\nRight from the get-go, the game's performance left much to be desired. Before even completing a single level, I was lagging to the point of having to Alt-F4 out of the game, unable to save and quit properly. I tried playing again the next day, with the same result, despite reducing video settings and such. Naturally, I looked to the game's Steam discussions for troubleshooting help. A common recommendation was to toggle vsync in a settings file, which I did. It worked; the game ran much more smoothly and lag was less noticeable.\n\nGuess what else it accomplished?\nBreaking my computer.\n\nNow, my computer is a few years old, but it can handle the vast majority of 2D games (as well as a lower number of 3D games), no sweat. My computer, despite being in relatively good condition, has hiccups now and then. But now it won't even turn on properly. When I try to turn it on, I get a black screen. Is it this game's fault? It's probably a flaw with my computer, but that doesn't mean I'm inclined to relieve Magicmaker of all blame.\n\nI, having a broken computer whose video card got overloaded or something by a game that performs horribly and isn't even multithreaded, am looking forward to the day when I can invest in a powerful enough computer to handle this poorly-optimized game without any problems. If I have fun with it when I'm actually able to play it, perhaps my opinion will change. Until then, I'm giving a solid thumbs down to the game that broke my computer.","March 31","false","1.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","17","1","6","3","0"

However, The results are hardly unique.  For a game having "literally 2 milliion spells" I thought that there would be more to them than a bunch of effects bound to different sprites.\n\nThere are multiple tiers of runes you can use to craft spells and enchantments.  Each tier up provides a rune with slightly better effects (not by changing the effect of the spell or enchantment, but by increasing the modifiers of the rune).  I think the developers included all five tiers of runes when calculating all the spell combinations.  It is stated that there are 40 different materials.  The triangular number of 40 (Which calculates the combinations of two slots), multiplied by 40 (for the third slot), is 32,800.\n\n32,800 combinations, average gameplay, and sub-par artwork.  I was drawn to this game because of my love of procedurally generated levels, and decided to buy because it promised near infinite spell possibility.  I recommend buying one of the many other games that feature level generation such as Binding of Isaac: Rebirth or Crypt of the Necrodancer.","March 20, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","5"

While it is a great game, here's a couple of stuff to watch out for as this is a package that comes with a bit more than just jumping in and letting your imagination run wild.\n\nFirst, this is a game and not just a sandbox. You go through various levels while prodecurally generated, have reoccuring copy-paste elements so each zone will generally give you a similar gameplay experience. You start off with a very limited palatte of spell effects and a limited number of spell slots which you can add spell effects. This means that your potential for creativity is limited at the start and you can only get so creative towards mid-game as you're playing on a new game+ when you more slots to add more and more spell effects. Eventually, after beating it around three times, you get the max spell effect slots for maximum creativity.\n\nOf course, balancing a game is very difficult and some spells and strategies are clearly stronger than others. As you go through the game, you will most likely stick to just a few strategies that you know will work. Yes, there may be two million possible combinations, but there are not going to be two million GOOD combinations, especially not early in the game\n\nThis is a good game, but this is not quite the sandbox I thought it seems to market itself. Maybe it's my play style that leans towards functionality than roleplay or creativity's sake, but the way I played it, that's kinda how it went for me. Of course, experiment lots as the game gives you a big enough variety of things to try out. I find that my strategy has radically changed every now and then when I decide my current strategy is not good enough, and that's where most of the fun of the game is. Experiment and experiment lots.","February 20, 2015","true","45.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole game revolves around your customisable wand/spell and robe's magic. The one thing I was worried about is the issue with many games with customisation where you get an idea of combining x with y to make a really cool effect, and the game either just doesn't let you or it doesn't work at all while combined.\n\nNot the case! I've only found a handful of the items so far but the combined effects are so much fun to play with, and no matter what effects you combine IT ALWAYS WORKS. A few of my favourites: Homing laser which phases through walls! A multifire, ricocheting shot that spawns slime minions with each hit! Freezing chain lightning which drains HP! The combinations truly feel endless and no matter what crazy spell combination you come up with it WILL work how you think it should. Major applause for the developers for making such an indepth customising system which never seems to break down no matter what you make in it.\n\nBuy the game and find your own magic to make. It is worth every penny for that childish grin on your face when you find a new combination that you love.","February 13","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun to listen to the characters and their rediculous ramblings, look for easter eggs, etc. I even have a save slot I'll occasionally restart just to look at that job chooser spell and all the unbelievable jobss it flips through.

Do it again in a week or two, try to figure out what you were even trying to do with that spell, advance in the story a little while sipping your morning tea. It's truly a casual game.

This aesthetic also matches the light hearted humour thats shown throughout.\n\nThe spell mechanic is great, you can simply put 4 elements(or more in Newgame+) together to make a spell. There are elements that can make your spell stick to walls, spawn a turret that casts your spell, start off slow and gradually get faster and more powerful, home in on enemies and far, far more.\n\nOverall, the game is quite short(newgame+ helps a little with replayability) and it can be completed in about 6 or so hours, although there are challenges and free roam maps so you can mess about with your spells.\n\nAnd lastly I thought the very last boss battle was awesome, although extremely short.\n\nIt's main strength is how much fun it is to try out random things with the spell creator.","April 5","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyModd/recommended/319250/","HeavyModd","NaCl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyModd/","89 products in account","TL;DR: The game is OK. It has its weak points, but is a solid game. The biggest flaws are balancing, game length and story. The spell creation system was pretty fun, but that's pretty much all there is to it. I'd give the game a 5/10.\n\nNot worth the full price, buy when on sale.\n\nPros:\n+ Pretty good controls\n+ All the different spells are creative and fun to try out\n+ I liked the music (reminded me of Maplestory somehow)\n+ Humour in the game is okay\n+ Few grammar mistakes\n+ Non-repetitive! (mainly because of its length, though)\n\nCons:\n- The game is short\n- You'll either be very over-powered or very weak\n- You can hear the music replay (it awkwardly creates a brief sudden silence to the music)\n- Some fps lag?\n- Character editor sucks and the dialogue assumes you're male even if you changed your character female\n\n\nFull review:\n\nWhen I picked up this game, I was expecting something else than what I got. Are there over 2 million possible spell combinations? Yes! Is it fun? To some extent, yes! Is the gameplay diverse? Yes, and no.\n\nCommenting on all of the questions and answers above, the game delivers its purpose quite well: you get what you're promised. However, questions like "Are all the 2 million spells so different from each other?" or "How difficult is the game?" or "Is the game long?" are the downfall of this game (in addition to the horrible story).\n\nFrom the 2 million spells you can have, you'll most probably settle with the one or two easily most overpowered ones. The other 1,999,998 spells are not even worth it to check out when you realise that the game is super boring to play if you don't have your OP laser beam with you. Or maybe you'll feel happy with that weak and useless charming spell that just slows down your gameplay and makes you underpowered.\n\nThe game doesn't get repetitive mainly because it's so short. All the different missions, ultimately, dumb down to the category of "go there and kill stuff" with an addition of "find something", with the random occasion of something a bit different. Most of the time I have in this game are from customizing my character (the character customization sucks pretty much though) and spells as well as AFKing. I'd say the game took me about 3h to beat, the only difficult part being mission where I had to kill a boss without killing 20 Fairies, which are probably the weakest enemies in the game. Never did I feel like the enemies were strong or challenging at all.\n\nNow that the bad sides have been covered, what's left? The game has many good sides to it, too. The grammar is fine, with only few mistakes. The humour got me a few times, which is pretty uncommon. The game plays well with its tight controls, and only once did I end up in a dead end despite the maps being randomly generated. The music reminded me of Maplestory for some reason, which is a game I played a lot in my childhood (also Maplestory 2 is coming soon!), so props for the nostalgia (although the BGM plays a bit awkwardly; you can hear the music replaying itself, which annoyed me a lot)! The game didn't lag for me, although I've read comments of people raging about their fps rate, just thought I'd say this.\n\nThe game is okay, but not worth the 9,99€ it asks for. I'd buy it during a sale. Still recommending it despite its minor flaws (and the major flaw of horrible balancing) 'cause it's a solid game.","June 24, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buddies783/recommended/319250/","buddies783","☆Jasper☆","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buddies783/","99 products in account","Magicmaker is a game that revels in the fun and destructive capability it offers to players and doesn't take itself remotely seriously. This becomes a lot like a double-edged Ninja Sword for Magicmaker, and whether or not that'll turn you off differs from person to person!\n\n\nThe game is a platformer crossed with a shooter in which you fire off spells from your wand to take down enemies as you progress through the (somewhat) randomly generated stages in which you must complete a set of tasks or otherwise just beat the boss at the end. You can use your wand to attack enemies with too, but the wand is lackluster in damage compared to the spells you cast and is intended for utility purposes instead. The plot is relatively simplistic if not outright non-existant for most of the game, but the witty and rather tongue-in-cheek dialogue of most characters usually kept me very entertained regardless. The game is very short if you're only completing the missions required to get to the final areas of the game, which was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nThe game's wand, spell and equipment creation system allows for a lot of creative applications and is probably one of the best features of the game. You can customize both your wizard's appearance and the spells they fire off to a large degree. Want your spell to fire off tons of projectiles that then split into even more projectiles as they bounce around on the walls? You can do that. Want your spell to be a laser that leeches HP and MP off your enemies? You can do that too! With the right materials, you can make a lot of varied and vicious attacks as well as grant your character multiple different attributes by putting them on their robe instead, such as multiple jumps, converting HP damage to MP damage and the like. This can get ridiculous as you approach end game, as by this point you'll have access to 7 slots to put high-quality materials in that can make spells that can cause ten thousand points of damage at ludicrous speeds.\n\nThis is where Magicmaker will start to fall apart for most people; as you complete the game and start your New Game+ adventures, your character will grow exponentially out of proportion to the point where it will be impossible for you to die unless you're intentionally playing bad or otherwise perform self-restricted challenges unto yourself. It's sort of like a reverse difficulty curve where the game was much more difficult if you were trying the hardest missions with your limited slots and materials in your first playthrough as opposed to annihilating everything in New Game+++ with your spell that restores all your HP and MP on one single kill. I found the difficulty early on to be really enjoyable, since with the limitations imposed unto your character you have to use your spells creatively as to not lose too much MP while still managing enough HP to stay alive, an aspect I lamented when the game turned into a whirlwind of dead enemy corpses.\n\nHowever, as I said, Magicmaker thrives in the purest element of destructive fun and creation. If you want to play a game where you feel like an omnipotent god where you're teleporting around and firing countless fireballs that radiate damage like there's no tomorrow and just generally relieve stress, Magicmaker has you covered. The amount of satisfaction you get from making a spell that tears that one annoying boss to shreds in a few seconds is immense; watching the damage numbers remain stretched from the consistant damage going from 0 to 15000 is just beautiful. If you want a harder, challenging, while still very creative game, Magicmaker has a hard time filling the bill.\n\n\nMagicmaker is the kind of game I feel like really deserves a sequel. It nails down a lot of key aspects well and can be ridiculously fun and enjoyable to the right people, but it flops rather heavily in other crutial areas that might turn others away. I would definitely try out the demo and make a decision based on whether or not you enjoyed the spell creation and destructive potential it offers. I also purchased the OST bundled with the game, which while I enjoy it quite a bit is something I'd also encourage you to listen to beforehand on the creator's bandcamp before buying, since it might not be your cup of tea.[npaavo.bandcamp.com] If you're also savvy enough, you can find the .ogg files in the game files themselves so you could also loop them yourself.\n\n\n...did I also mention that there's also a level editor?[magicmaker.boards.net]","June 4","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is relatively short, but it has the bonus that you can make more complex spells each time you rerun the game up till 3 times. The game involves a lot of puzzling together the best spell to mow down everything before you, which sometimes turns out the most unlikely of combinations. A huge negative of this game is that the best spells often are very very heavy on your computer. While mine is not the strongest i can play just about any of the current gen games on a higher setting, this game however slows down to a crawl whenever i launch my killer spell.","June 6","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
