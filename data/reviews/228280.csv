"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nupraptor1/recommended/228280/","nupraptor1","Azimuth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nupraptor1/","375 products in account","The original Baldur's Gate is one of my favourite games, second only to its successor and is a game any rpg fan must play. Due to its art style for a game that came out in 1998 it still holds up well today. Graphically this game still looks beautiful due to 2d painting-esque backdrops and thirdperson isometric viewpoint.\n\nThe gameplay also has an incredible amount of depth to it and the combat is very tactical and varied depending on the class you play and the party setup you choose. The game is also from an era when games were unforgiving and actually provided the player with a challenge. The combat is similar to Dragon Age: Origins where it can be free-flowing and action oriented but it is highly recommended that players take it slowly and utilise pausing to setup properly between rounds during combat.\n\nThe game being built upon the ruleset of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons has a lot of depth to classes and the classes will all playout and feel very different which offers a lot of replayability ontop of just choosing and adhering to different alignments.\n\nAlso due to the game being built upon AD&D and being set in a D&D realm the game has an incredible amount of history and backstory in there that the world feels real and is incredibly dark and gritty which ties in great with the dark tones of the main story.\n\nWithout spoiling too much of the story it starts with very humble beginning and quickly thrusts the player into a world descending into turmoil with bandits and bad guys wanting to kill you at every turn you must uncover the sinister plot that is unfolding and discover your own dark heritage in the process.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this game although I will warn that there is a lot of reading involved and that the combat is designed to played slowly (unlike diablo and games of its ilk) and very tactically but for those that love a game with a great story this game is undoubtedly one you should play.","November 26, 2013","true","54.5"," 291 of 336 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","291","336","0","0"

I loved the combat, the UI was tight, everything was well-polished when Beamdog re-released the game. I was actually in the middle of a run through the entire game on the hardest difficulty with only the main character...\n\nBefore IT happened.\n\nThe update to Siege of Dragonspear affected both games, and it's been nothing but negative for me so far. I can no longer access the Command Console (used for fixing the many glitches that can happen here and there), the UI is buggy and, when it does work, is clunky and, frankly, ugly as sin itself. My saves have all disappeared into the wind, and my character's data has become ridiculously bugged (Level 34 at the tail end of Throne of Bhaal suddenly turning into a level 17 with all of the items from her run through BG1 and 2? What?) and more.\n\nBefore now, I would have recommended this series in a heartbeat. This game, nearly two decades ago, defined and revived a dying RPG era. But now? Now it's nearly impossible to play. And, unfortunately, it was the fault of the people who brought it back in the first place.\n\n--HOW BEAMDOG CAN FIX THIS--\n\n-Implementation of the old character and save game formatting\n-Option to use the old UI\n-Option to turn the Console Command on and off IN GAME. The steps to do this in the first place were a nightmare in and of itself.\n\n--Things that COULD help--\n- Scale the difficulty levels back down a little. Insane difficulty jumped from enemies doing 50% more damage to 100%, and Legacy of Bhaal makes the game nearly unplayable.\n\n\nAs it stands right now? DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. It pains me to say that (as you can no doubt see from my time in this game), but as it is right now, it's not worth any money.","March 31","false","422.8"," 589 of 739 people (80%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","80","589","739","15","37"

The game was originally released in 1998. I played it while I was in high school my senior year. It introduced a LOT of new people to Dungeons & Dragons. It's a 3rd person isometric RPG in which you control all members of your party. It's paused based(instead of turn based), which means that when combat starts, you pause, issue commands, unpause, wait for something to happen, pause again, issue commands, etc, etc. There are lots of games with that type of system now, but as far as I know, BG was the first.\n\nSo the way you're -supposed- to play it solo is to create one character and go along recruiting AI NPCs to join your party of up to six. Well you can get around all that by playing in multiplayer mode by yourself. Multiplayer mode lets you create all six party members and tweak them to your desire. You can also export/import different characters at any time. You can easily get away with this from an RP(roleplaying) perspective by saving your game in an inn and swapping party members in and out saying "Oh I met this guy at this inn". So to start with, I created my own party of 3: Human Fighter(me), Paladin, and Cleric, then I pick up NPCs along the way. Not completely satisfied with the NPCs in game, I finished the game with 5/6 party members self generated, and only one in-game NPC(Yeslick the Dwarven Fighter/Cleric). If you enjoy character creation and tweaking things and micromanaging party members, gear, stats, and other RPG elements, this game is definately for you.\n\nLets talk about the story. This is where the game really drew a lot of people in. For those of you that have already played, you know what I'm talking about. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone that may play the game in the future(even if it IS 16 years old), but it's a great, great story that lets you choose your own path. Of course my path is that of the good soldier fighting for... well... good. But if you enjoy the darker side of things, it's always allowed, which a lot of games give you trouble doing. You can lie, cheat, steal, and murder and still complete the game.\n\nOftentimes now that I'm in my 3rd decade of life, I've gone back and tried to play games from my childhood that I remember really enjoying, and graphically none of them have stood up to the test of time(X-Com, Doom, etc). Since all of the assets in BG are more or less hand drawn and the enhanced edition lets you play at your native resolution, the game still looks pretty damn good, especially amidst the recent indy dev 8 bit gaming boom. So graphically, it passes the test. The environments are pretty freakin cool too. A whole lot of unique, hand drawn areas that I had forgotten about since I first played a long time ago that made me say "huh, cool" when I came across them recently.\n\nAnd now let's talk difficulty. Holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game hard. It's been so long since I've played a game that didn't just blatantly hold my hand and coddle me the whole way through I'd forgotten what it's like to play a game that punishes you. AD&D 2.0 core rules are a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ and completely unforgiving. There are 5 difficulty levels in the game:\n\n-Easy - Everything does half damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.\n\n- Normal - Everything does 75% damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.\n\n- Core Rules - Everything does 100% damage, hit point gains are randomized(so you can get as little as 1 hp/level on your badass front-line fighter that needs ~10 hp/level), and characters can permanently die.\n\n- Hard - Everything does 150% damage\n\n- Insane - Everything does 200% damage and you are a satan worshipping masochist\n\nI may have added that last little part on the insane bit.\n\nSo being the badass gaming veteran I am, I of course choose Core Rules. I understand what THAC0 is, I know what the different classes are, I know how to D&D. I'm good.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nI'm actually not as good as I had thought. I had to do a LOT of fights multiple times because Jesus Christ, this game can be hard. Mostly with the crowd control abilities the enemies get(note - If you fight against a group that has a mage, KEEP YOUR PARTY SPREAD OUT just like in ArmA). A lot of times I'd get hit with an AoE fear or confuse or stun, etc, etc, etc. It could be infuriating, but I kept re-loading and going at the fights in different manners from different angles, and analyzing my party and their abilities and switching things around until finally, at the end of the game, I had SOME sort of idea of what I was doing... I thought... until the final battle.\n\nLet's just say that the final battle in Baldur's Gate had me curled up in a fetal position in the corner of my room praying to Torm asking him what I had done so poorly to have been punished so badly.\n\nSo somewhere between 20 and 50 attempts later, I managed to defeat the final boss and win the game. I even had to google strategies for the final boss. I actually felt a sense of accomplishment like I haven't felt in a game in a long, long time. The funny part is, 17 year old me beat the game in 1998 without the internet for guidance. I have NO CLUE how I managed that feat.\n\nSo I immediately went to steam and bought Baldur's Gate 2 enhanced edition, even though it's not on sale, and started a new game. This time, however, I'm playing on normal mode. It seems to be a much better balance of playability vs difficulty. I've still lost some fights, but I've learned a whole damn lot and built my party around the strengths needed.\n\nI have a Cavalier paladin because he: 1. Can't be feared, charmed, mind controller, or poisoned; and 2. He can make the entire party immune to fear pretty much all the time. He's also a badass tank alongside my main character which is a frontline fully maximized fighter with sword and shield. I also have a pure Dwarven Cleric, Fighter/Thief, Fighter/Mage, and Dragon Disciple Sorcerer. I dual classed the Thief and Mage with Fighter bases so they could use longbows for good DPS instead of being relegated to a shortbow and a sling. The nice side to that is that they get fighter HP for their first 7 levels so they're pretty beefy on top of it all.\n\nI just pretend(roleplay) that my entire group is a squad of trained military soldiers that have been sent on a mission, so they almost all have that base fighter class from their military training.\n\nSo I have 2 tanks(FIghter/Cavalier Paladin), a pure healing Cleric, and 3 pure DPS(Thief/Mage/Sorcerer). But don't be fooled, that fighter and paladin can put out some melee hurt too. The cleric is really the only non-dps class. Oh... Make sure you -always- have a thief in your party with the script that makes him passively detect traps. Trust me on this. You don't necessarily need a thief/rogue that can stealth, but you damn sure need one that can detect/disarm traps and pick locks.\n\nAnd on that note, there are pre-set scripts that you can use for each character. There are about 20 for all the different classes in the game to mess around with. I pretty much have my whole group on the standard "I see an enemy and attack with my equipped weapon", except for my rogue, who is set to always passively detect traps when not in combat, and my cleric who is set to dynamically run around and heal. I micromanage everything else(mage spells mostly).\n\nRead the rest of this review here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Jester814/discussions/0/648817377413793428/","July 8, 2014","true","62.1"," 197 of 232 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","197","232","0","5"

They have also decided to not include their own version of a detailed, colored map seen here from the TuTu mod https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B174_ETClo Instead, they used the original bland, tan parchment paper map with the added feature of immersion-breaking font!\n\nFeels much more like a fan-mod with mediocre (and sometimes anti-intellectual sjw) writing (or removal of writing *cough* Safana's dialogue has been erased in favor of vacuous, humdrum scribbling *cough*) instead of work on the same level of greatness that was the original Baldur's Gate.\n\nI'm still going to play it so I can transfer my character to Siege of Dragonspear and play through the rest of the series, but if this is the team that will be making Baldur's Gate 3 if they get enough funding for it, my expectations will definitely not be high. I wish there was a one thumb up and one thumb down mixed option for steam games. If there was I'd choose that instead of a thumb down.

I currently have 24 hours "played" and of that 24, approximately 5-7 are actually playing the game with a friend.\n\nIt's currently a mess when trying to play co-op, which is the only reason I purchased the enhanced edition.  2+ hours attempting to get ONE GAME working.  This isn't a one off either, each time we try to play it takes 30+ minutes just to get the game functioning for both of us.  Either one of us crash or he's kicked out of the game ("multiplayer session terminated") for no apparent reason.  We both left the game paused when not playing just to avoid having to go through this again, and guess what happened?  Yup, we left the area and the game tried to autosave...he got kicked right out of the game with the beloved "multiplayer session terminated" message.\n\nWe tried again, leaving the game open after it worked (our longest play-session so far has been 2 or 3 hours before a problem), and it crashed when auto-saving.  This is over a LAN network as well...\n\nIf/When these multiplayers problems are fixed, I will definitely change my review to positive.  Until then, I can't recommend this game, especially if you're looking to play with friends.\n\nEdit: Been playing some more. Encountered a bug that prevented my co-op partner from moving. Seems to have occurred after I interacted with an npc. His screen goes gray and he can't move until I talk to an npc.  Occurs (e.g. his screen goes gray and he can't move even after unpausing etc.) when transitioning to a new area, pausing for battle, and saving the game.\n\nWe had to exit out of the Baldur's Gate and start the reconnect game again to fix it.\n\nEdit 4/16/16:\n\nGame was patched and now connecting and staying connected is no longer a problem.  Looks like they broke something else though.  Can't play co-op AT ALL without the save game being corrupted.  This is with cloud saves off.  I tried hosting and my game now crashes when entering a new area after the update...no matter what save I use.  I tried joining a co-op game with my friend and we were able to play up until beregost, then every time he tried to save the game crashed ME, not the host.  Started a new game.  Played until Beregost.  Game randomly corrupted all the save files (quick saves, manual saves, etc.)... except the save at the very beginning.  I'm done with this broken game.  Wish I could request a refund, but unfortunately I'm stubborn and tried to actually have fun and play the game...of the approximately 40 hours on record now, I believe 15-20 were actually playing the game.

Here are just a few of the problems I have noticed.\n\n- Game Crashes more times than I can throw a stick at it.\n- Characters are cartoonish\n-  Beta version Fighters cannot use any weopons\n-  I Get achievements for things I have not even done in Lands I have not even been to. And my old Achievements are all gone being replaced by things I have not done.\n-  Map scroll is all messed up\n- Multiplayer games on steam cloud network are unable to access for all the hours worked on.\n- Multiplayer join does not work\n- Many more issues, too many to remember\n- It appears that the updates were more for people using handheld devices than real pc gamers like myself according to Beamdog's website.   Quote from their site on update: “Enjoy text and dialogue selection features optimized for smaller screens, as well as numerous other improvements.”\n\nI really wish there was an option to roll back my game to the original without this update until they get the bugs worked out so I would have lost all my hard work and over 300 hours of game play.  I understand there is a need to fix the bugs and update at times, but this one caused me more problems than I can count.  I want my Loved Game Back. Please hurry with the fixes so I can get back to playing my game.","April 3","false","315.3"," 123 of 153 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","123","153","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/six_shooter/recommended/228280/","six_shooter","Koen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/six_shooter/","66 products in account","Baldur's Gate is truly a masterpiece. Despite it's beauty, tactical depth and great story, the game does not take itself too seriously. This cannot be said of many other leading RPG titles, which I soon begin to find rather corny. If you like RPGs and have not played Baldur's Gate, then this is an absolute must, you do not even need to waste your time reading this review but of course you are welcome to. If you have played the original BG and are curious about Beamdog's boob job, I share with you my opinion.\n\n\nThe original game's two main lackings are native widescreen support and Linux support (I use Ubuntu/Mint). Interestingly, the Steam store lists BGEE as a Windows/Mac title, while BG2EE is listed as Windows/Mac/Linux. Both titles run perfectly on Linux since the latest patches.\n\nThe reason for me to buy Beamdog's re-release was simply curiosity. Where would anyone find the guts to mess with this classic work of art? What would they change about it?\n\n\nFirst looks and User Interface\nMy first impression of BGEE was honestly not that great. It was still before Linux support was added. The aesthetics just turned me off. The changed logo, the sword with the text "Enhanced Edition", the user interface which had it's old-skool goldish buttons replaced with red "open-missile-silo-doors"-buttons. It all just took away some of the original game's magic. Perhaps mostly nostalgic feelings on my part.\n\nOnce hours inside the game the UI didn't really bother me anymore. Since recent updates, I was pleasantly surprised by the "Quick loot"-button that was added to the bottom panel. This made looting a whole lot easier, since it is no longer necessary to check all the corpses individually for good loot, potions, scrolls, etc.\n\n\nMore aesthetics\nNot only the UI has had a makeover. The movies are also replaced. The new ones are not 3d-animated like the old ones. The new movies are built from nice artistic drawings. The drawings look really good and are accompanied by the trusty old sounds of the original game.\n\nThe character models have also been updated, though they are still not 'HD'. The pre-rendered environments are still the same as in the original BG. These were already stunningly beautiful anyway, no need to make changes there.\n\n\nGameplay\nThere are some major changes to the gameplay. Characters are now created in the same fashion as in BG2. This means that not only can one choose from various classes, but many classes have kits to choose from, with each its own abilities and restrictions. Also, the Half-Orc is now a playable race as in BG2.\n\nWeapon proficiencies are also updated to the BG2 standard, which means that the points are no longer put into groups of weapons (for example there used to be one group of large swords, containing two-handed, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and long swords and another group of blunt weapons, containing staves, maces, clubs and hammers). The new system forces you to choose specific weapons, thus making switching between various weapons in the same group impossible if you have not spent any points on the other weapon.\n\nBecause of the relatively low level cap in BG1, you will find each character using one or two types of weapons throughout the whole game. This is not a problem, but it is a significant deviation from the original. The weapon styles from BG2 have also been added. This new proficiency system works really well at the higher character levels achieved in BG2, but has minor shortcomings in a game where characters reach level 8-10 and thus do not have too many points to spend.\n\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\nAs mentioned before, the weapon styles from BG2 have been imported. Two-Weapon Fighting is now also possible, which adds lots of fun to the game. You are now able to shred your opponents in seconds, sacrificing the protection of a shield. While shields in BG are not too powerful and one can easily manage without, dual-wielding is somewhat (if not more) overpowered. My Half-Orc berserker has 3 attacks per round wielding dual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords. With 19 strenght, 3 points in two-weapon fighting, 3 in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword and berserker rage (granting protection against hold, fear and other hazards, plus combat bonuses) he is an insanely strong melee fighter, one you would never encounter in the original game.\n\nSpecial abilities\nI mentioned the berserker rage, but many of the class kit abilities are very powerful. Some good examples are the priest of Helm's Seeking Sword (3 attacks per round with huge THAC0 bonus) and True Sight. The newly added "Shadowdancer" kit with its hide-in-plain-sight ability is also quite powerful, being able to backstab, hide and backstab again. There are many more new abilities that will aid you in your fight against (or for your own) evil.\n\n\nBalance\nThe battles in BG1 often used to be insanely difficult, but they were not designed for all these newly added features. This makes the enhanced edition somewhat less challenging than the original, but still very challenging. Only the greatest tactical geniuses would complain that the game has become easy. You should consider putting the difficulty slider one notch to the right compared to what you were used to in the original. Because of all the new additions, you will be well equipped for some tougher beasties.\n\n\nNew adventures\nFor me, not too interesting. They are not of the same quality as the original storyline. Then again, that quality is extremely rare. If you do not like the new quests then you can always just skip them.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe enhanced edition is a welcome re-release of a brilliant game. It offers some great improvements while leaving just minor scars.\n\n+Native support for widescreen and higher resolutions\n+Native support for Mac and Linux (no more messing around with Wine)\n+Zoom function (though when zoomed in the game looks a bit crude)\n+Quick loot function eliminates the hassle of searching every corpse individually\n+New kits and abilities add fun\n+Bug fixes\n+Beamdog still provides updates, they have shown their love for this game and do not seem to have done all this for some easy cash (unlike some others).\n\n-Aesthetics (mainly logo and user interface) could have been better/more faithful to the original\n-The balance and difficulty of the game are slightly compromised by addition of the new kits, abilities and two-weapon fighting.","January 19, 2015","true","155.0"," 110 of 145 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","110","145","2","2"

The Enhanced Edition is still the same great game but with a few new companions and quality of life improvements, such as loot/item, chest/container, and character name highlighting when pressing tab, as well as a zoom function. The new companions are pretty nice. I played a lot with Dorn Il-Khan, the Half-Orc Blackguard, which is an evil and twisted reflection of the lawful good paladin, and I really like him a lot. He is an interesting character with a cool personality, and has an awesome class kit. He really adds a lot to an Evil party. The improvements and companions are not essential by any means, but they are nice. A lot of people complained about bugs when the EE was first released, but I'm happy to say that with the 1.3 patch, this has been eliminated. I played through the whole game and did not encounter any noticeable bugs. If you have never played Baldur's Gate, this is definitely the definitive version of the game, and the one to get. It's a 150+ hour game, so even at the full price of $20 you get your moneys worth for sure.

To free his friend from the vile scourge of a gnoll encampment.\n\nI was more than willing to assist Minsc to achieve his goal, but I was currently on my way to vanquish the foes that were tormenting the Nanshekel mines, but I assured Minsc I would help after.\n\nAs soon as I breathed my first breath of air from the godforsaken mines of Nanshekel I gave Minsc one of those sexy side winks, but all he could reply with was, "Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, watch it! I'm huge!"\n\nI could tell Minsc was growing impatient, so I pushed on towards to the gnoll encampment without any delay. We were unfortunately walaid by many the highwayman and foe. I thought Minsc was enjoying the adventure with his enthusiastc war yaps, "The squeeky wheel gets the kick", I was wrong, however, so very wrong.\n\nI was precisely one load zone away from the gnoll encampment (one ****ing loadzone!), filled with glee to help my friend Minsc, but when we got there I then understood true disapointment.\n\nWe loaded in and I looked to Minsc hoping to see gaiety and pride. Instead I saw hate and utter disapointment, "hey  Minsc, heh, so we got to the gnolls like you wanted, heh, ready to save your friend?"\n\nUnfortunately there was no love left to be felt by Minsc' eyes. His eyes were black and full of rage like a shark that smells blood.\n\n"Heh, hey Minsc, heh, ready to go save your friend?"\n\nIn one fell swoop Minsc drew his +1 two-handed sword and dropped the negative-nancy wizard, Xan, like a dirty sack of potatoes.\n\n"Minsc! What are you doing?!"\n\n"You say you help save friend, but You not help at all!!!" Then Minsc began hacking the not so politically correct and naive rogue, Imoen, but I didn't care.

Not because it's a bad game within itself, but because at it's current state it is unplayable. The multiplayer aspect of it at least. Singleplayer still has plenty of bugs, but nothing that prohibits you from playing the game.\n\nThis is a classic. Baldur's Gate set the standard for western RPGs and introduced a lot of people to the world of Forgotten Realms and Dungeons and Dragons. I didn't have the pleasure of playing the game when it was first released but I saw a couple of friends play it and become sort of obsessed with it. They would praise the game, it's characters, it's story, it's dialogue, get sort of frustrated with its mechanics, not because they were inherently bad but because they were angry at a party wipe or character death which would force them to reload a save.\nThey were frustrated but they wanted to play more. They wanted to finish that hard fight, they want to get the best possible outcome, they wanted to do everything.\n\nSeveral years later I decided to get this game for myself. Wanted to try it and see what it really was. Truth be told it hasn't aged well but the new patch 2.0 did slightly improved it (more on the patch later). It's still feels old and outdated, you'll find almost no QoL gameplay mechanics, it will feel very slow paced for someone used to a subgenre of RPG games, but the game has qualities which make it a classic.\n\nThe story is pretty good (albeit I think BG:II is a lot better but this one is still nice), the characters are rich and interact with the world, you and between themselves, the dialogue is superb, serious when it needs to be, funny when it needs to be and even when it shouldn't. An important part when judging the storyline of the game is not only the story itself but how is represented to the player and how the player chooses to progress through it and BG:EE does that pretty well (again BG:EE II has dramatically improved on said aspect).\n\nThe combat might feel slow and sluggish at times, since it is technically a turn based RPG without actually waiting for the NPCs to finish their turn. This pseudo-turnbased combat works well at times and feels awkward at others but I believe it's not something to take away from the fun of the experience.\n\nSometime ago, beamdog (developing company) announce an expansion for the game called Siege of Dragonspear, 17 years after the original was released (contender for longest time for expansion release along with AoE2). Naturally we were excited to await a continuation of the story and an extra chapter into this game which would also bridge the gap between BG:EE and BG:EE II.\nNonetheless in order to accomodate for the release of the patch, they released a patch 2.0 for the game and the sequel.\nThe patch did a lot of thing which I will not mention here but it significantly altered the game. There was an outcry but many people who considered this a pointless and detrimental patch for the "old-school" players.\nI didn't really mind the ui changes, the game felt more responsive in our multiplayer sessions however it did the one thing that forced to not recommend this game.\n\nIt broke multiplayer. As in it really made multiplayer unplayable. Constant crashes, save files gone (tooks a while but we fixed that), grey-scale pauses, difficulty settings which are always reduced to the previous tier whenever you start your client, you name it.\nBG:EE has a lot of bugs. I mean a lot. In multiplayer those bugs are enhanced since they will translate to frustration for multiple people. However me and my friends were so enamored with the rest of the game that we managed to power through the buggy/unresponsive mess that the multiplayer was and we managed to finish the game just in time for the release of the expansion.\n\nHowever at this moment we cannot play the game. It is literally unplayable and you're at the mercy of Tymora if you want to get it working. Most of the times it doesn't. Which is a damn shame. Did nobody playtest this in multiplayer? Did nobody else got the game-breaking bugs which many a people report of forums/reviews/discussions about the game.\n\nMost important of all, we were seriously planning to get the Siege of Dragonspear expansion, but we decided not to. Because we want to play the game together as friends but the game won't let us.\nUntil the multiplayer game get fixed, until the bugs are fixed, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game and it's expansion to anyone. Seriously, it's a damn shame cause the game itself is a classic. But if you cannot play it, then it's not really a game now is it.\n\nI won't even discuss the "rage" about trans clerics who have offended some people. This is irrelevant. The multiplayer is unplayable. Fix it and then we can discuss everything else that might be wrong within the game. For shame beamdog, for shame.","April 4","false","65.7"," 60 of 73 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","60","73","0","0"

Now you can read the complete assessment here instead of venturing to the comments.\n\nUnlike many of the individuals who have purchased this title, I had not previously been exposed to Baldur’s Gate before this variance made its way onto the Steam store; I can, however, say that I anxiously awaited its rerelease on Steam, and even purchased it at a much higher price-point than I ever had and would with any other title. Baldur’s Gate is a game that deserves its praise as a classic open-world roleplaying adventure game based on the Second Edition (2e) of the Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) tabletop d20 game developed by the late Gary Gygax; Baldur’s Gate, followed by the Neverwinter and Dragon Age series, supports the DnD 2e core roleplaying game mechanics. As an avid player of DnD 3.5 and 3.75e (the Pathfinder system), I had not experienced much prior exposure to 2e other than that which I researched online and from my older Dungeon Mastering books, and, therefore, was able to view Baldur’s Gate as an original concept instead of ‘just another DnD adventure path.'\nHere are some things that I found particularly enjoyable about Baldur’s Gate:\n\nConnectivity to Dungeons & Dragons  - Right down to the equipment, combat tactics, roleplaying capabilities, and intriguing characters, Baldur’s Gate provides the sheer thrill of roleplaying that is offered by the tabletop renditions of the Dungeons & Dragons games. The game utilizes a simultaneous real-time and turn-based approach to combat, which will be described under the Gameplay portion of this review. Included in this title are six playable core races, a multitude of classes that influence each character’s style of play, the ability to multiclass, and the capability to interact with party members, which further enhances (no pun intended) the roleplaying experience. Since it utilizes the same mechanics as those in the tabletop roleplaying system, concepts such as THACO scores, Initiative modifiers, and alignments make an appearance; to those that are not familiar with the concepts, they are very simple to grasp and there are online guides dedicate to both Baldur’s Gate and Dungeons & Dragons that aide newer players in learning the roleplaying system.\n\nGameplay - As stated previously, Baldur’s Gate utilizes a combat system that is both turn-based and real-time in that actions rotate between characters within a confrontation as a sequence depending on each character’s Initiative score; basically, whoever’s quicker will end up going first in the rotation. The game also employs a simulated d20-or 20-sided die-roll to resolve the degree of success pertaining to given actions such as lockpicking and attack actions. Outside of combat, players can speak with other characters, both in and out of their own party, which may alter a given character’s alignment status. Some characters also have the ability to perform certain actions such as picking locks as a Rogue archetype (pressing V while out of combat), or casting passive Charm spells on non-player characters for specific gains. In all, the system is so intricate and open that you can practically do whatever you want, within the game’s limitations, of course. There is also a multiplayer component to Baldur’s Gate in which you can import characters you have created and play with friends throughout the game.\n\nTruly Open World - At the beginning of Baldur’s Gate , you are given a background story, a sufficient reason to proceed through the main campaign’s questline, and the chance of receiving your first companion character. That’s it. From there, you are free to explore the massive map however you wish while obtaining side quests, battling formidable foes, and gaining companionship with other notable non-playable characters. There are also game modifications (mods) to expand the map and the game’s story. How much more ‘open’ can you get?\n\nThe Black Pits - If you are searching for a different pacing outside of the massive world within the main campaign, then the Black Pits game mode is for you. This story is primarily driven by combat, in which your created party of six must fend off waves of enemies who utilize various tactics and themes in order to liberate your team from the Black Pits fighting arena. As straightforward as this may seem, it is extremely fun in a tactical manner, and permits the player to enjoy the core combat mechanics of the game without having to worry about the text and speech components; of course, there are secretes to be found within the Black Pits proving grounds.\n\nTL:DR - Like the person I would like to dedicate this review to, this game is an ‘original’ soul with intricate mechanics that will either make or break you. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world, roleplaying, or strategy titles, and would highly urge Baldur’s Gate to those who play tabletop roleplaying games, especially Dungeons & Dragons .

TERRIBLE.\nWhile I have an exstensive experience with Neverwinter Nights, This game is completely confusing. I never even made it all the way through the Tutorial. It started getting confusing when the first npc you talk to kept interupting me while I was trying to do what he said. "open the map" he would say, so I did and in the middle of opening the map he would interupt me and keep telling me to open the map, This was constant with every new thing the npc wanted you to do. The next headache is when the the combat trainer wanted you to cast a spell and constantly told me I hadnt cast a spell yet even though I had emptied my spells. It appears he wanted me to cast his spells, now why would I cast someone elses spells? Then the jerk wanted me to rest so I could memorize my new spells... For the life of me I couldnt find the rest button in any of the screens (inventory etc...) he told me the rest button was in... I gave up after that. While I commend the devs for making this game available on Linux, I also curse them for that because if it hadnt been made available for Linux I wouldnt have wasted an hour finding out this game SUCKS....","April 3","false","0.9"," 93 of 126 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","93","126","0","1"

I shall focus on the differences between this and original version.\nPros:\n+ Improved graphics with the possibility of zoom\n+ Additional 6 specialized classes\n+ New NPCs - I really felt that there should be monk and half-orc NPC recruitable. BG:EE adds them both\n+ A few new quests and locations\n+ Much clearer character/inventory screen. I found it extremely handy.\nCons:\n- The new content doesn't add much of a gameplay. Two-three hours tops - which is very different from the description of the game.\n- The Black Pits are completely separate from the main game. Which caused that I didn't even care to play them - if I can't use the new experience earned and items found in the main quest then what's the purpose? Just some random battle simulator in the BG rules.\n\n","February 15, 2014","true","101.7"," 86 of 115 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","86","115","0","1"

All the rich elements of dungeons and dragons are there, but none of it is at reach because of all those restrictions. all those spells don't matter when  you can only memorize 3 at a time, and all those weapons mean nothing when anything kills in one blow but everyone keeps missing their attacks. I played with the core rules and I regret it, permadeath is stupid, and even a little kobold can kill you in one shot.\n\nIt takes an eternity to level up and fights have no need of input from the player: you just wait and pray nobody dies. A mage could do spells, so there are decisions to make; but they die too easily, or their spells are used, so they are out of the picture. it doesn't feel rewarding at all. I didn't have fun.\n\nIt's at this point that I realise that I just don't like D&D, the philosophy behind all the characters is very thin and doesn't fit reality. I hated that two party members left me because they thought I was too evil... after killing a bounty hunter that attacked me first. I hated the bard that made fart jokes; the guy literally says ''PFFFT, hooh, that was a sharp one'' when you click on him. There's also the necromancer that says creppy things, but whines like a baby 50% of the time; what's up with that? It's wierd, juvenile and unappealing to the point of disgust. There is no way, absolutely no way, to think that the characters are interesting or developed.\n\nBut, I do appreciate the fact that there is close to no hand-holding. I really did.

Just not really the Enhanced Edition.\n\nAlbeit EE doesn't differ from the original much, it does in some significant ways. First of all, it allows running the game in high resolution. You can do it with the old BG too, but that requires a mod, and it's a nice thing to have it without doing anything. EE adds some magical weapons and other items to the game too. Not too many, which is very good, and they are balanced and fit in the game. Moreover, unlike vanilla BG, EE is not limited to Windows only, and can be run on other operating systems. A great thing is also the fact that BG EE has many languages to choose from (albeit no dubbings) so it might be a good way to practice one's language skills. Unfortunately these are the only positive things I can say about EE.\n\nWhen EE was released it was full of bugs, even gamebreaking ones, but they were fixed by now. Most of them at least, because some things remain broken. For example I couldn't join Alora to my team, because her encounter was broken. Moreover, the quality of the writing when it comes to the new dialogues (and NPCs) is low, and it stands out from the rest of the game, definitely not in a positive way. Hence, it's better to play vanilla game without it. Moreover, for replayability there are many interesting modifications for Baldur's Gate, but they do not work with EE.\n\nPlay Baldur's Gate if you haven't already. To decide whether to choose BG:EE or BG you should consider quite a few things.\n\nWhy choose BG over BG:EE?\n- no bugs\n- quality of the game is the same all-through\n- modifications\n\nWhy choose BG:EE over BG?\n- multiple language versions (but no dubbings)\n- multiple operating systems supported (albeit Wine runs BG just fine)","March 24","false","28.5"," 89 of 126 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","89","126","0","3"

If you are too, then you will be pleased to know that Beamdog have left alone eveything that made BG great, while making small subtle improvements to things like the User Interface and the graphics (resolution, zoom feature). Trent said it well himself, to paraphrase "BG has not aged well, so they've make improvements to make the game to match what we all see through our rose tintend glasses".\n\nExtra content and NPCs are all good too. The NPC's all fit very well with the lore and don't tread on the toes of the existing characters, who all still have their place.

BG is in my top 5 favourite games of all time, I actually prefer it to the sequel. This review however is of the "enhanced" edition. What does this version bring to the table and is it worth the money?\n\n\EDIT\n\n\nThe good, bad and ugly of this game can mostly be attributed to Bioware, who originally developed the game. At its core this game will appeal to those that like a hardcore, deep and challenging RPG. That being said I think this game might appeal more to the power gamer rather than a role player as the dialogue responses the player can make are often extremely limiting and totally out of character for the type of alignment or class you are attempting to play. In this regard BG2 is far superior but this game still has a strong focus on character/party attribute building, skill distribution and gathering powerful items, that for me anyway still makes it very interesting. What the "enhanced" edition essentially boils down to is native support for higher resolutions, a few more class kits, three new companions and what I assume is a dungeon (Black Pits). Although I must admit to not having played it due to time constraints so can't comment on it.\n\nI would recommend this game for fans of the series if the "enhanced" editions are on sale at a heavy discount but you should seriously curb your expectations. For those who have never experienced the game however, I would imagine they will have a very hard time trying to get into it as not only is the learning curve almost vertical but the game play has not aged well and the interface does a poor job of explaining the intricacies of the underlying rule set and the enhanced edition does little or nothing to alleviate these problems.\n\nI have a laundry list of issues with this "enhanced" game, which are based upon my thoughts of the game post the 1.3 patch. For time's sake I'm only going to point out the most aggravating problems for me personally:\n\n***********************\nPath Finding\n***********************\n\nFirstly and in my opinion most importantly is the path finding (or lack thereof), which as far as I'm concerned is NOT fit for purpose and borderline broken. There are a multitude of dungeons in this game that are essentially labyrinths with tight corridors and cramped conditions with deadly floor traps and enemies around every corner. In such conditions it is essential to maintain strict control of your party members as the game tends to group debilitating traps and clusters of powerful enemies together all but assuring a quick death for the unwary. The game allows you to form a team of six but even a team of four is burdensome in these dungeons. When the group is given orders to move they will start at different times and some classes or those with special items will walk faster than others, causing party members to be bump into each other resulting in one of two things occurring; they will either pause for a second, causing those behind them to get stuck also, or alternatively they might decide to turn around and go in the completely opposite direction and go God only knows where. Woe betide you if you are not constantly watching them like a hawk and perpetually re-issuing the exact same movement command to force them back on their original path. I've only just started in Durlag's Tower (a major optional high level dungeon in the game) on my second full play through and am already on the verge of just giving up because the path finding makes it so mind numbingly tedious and infuriating to progress.\n\nIdeally I wanted to see the ability to walk my party forward in formation. This would require them to all walk at the same speed as the slowest member of the team and require those at the "back" of the formation to wait in place for those who should be at the front to catch up with them should they get separated (such as after combat). Only when an individual is given an attack or move order should they then move at their full speed. The waypathing needed to be vastly improved to recognise when there is only one way into the target area and have a method of slowing down or redirecting around someone in front when there is a blockage rather than simply stopping in place causing yet more jams behind them. Also when a group of individuals are given a move order it is imperative that they prioritize sticking together rather than backtracking and going off in some random direction on their own.\n\n***********************\nUser Interface\n***********************\n\nSecondly you have the user interface, which still has a multitude of problems carried over from the original game.\n\n* If your character is currently using a sword and shield then you cannot have a two handed weapon in one of your weapon quick slots; meaning that in combat you have to go into your inventory and manually switch everything around.\n* The hotbar at the bottom cannot be customized, re-organized or resized, you still have to put up with nonsense like cleric/thieves who have the thief ability button placed under a sub-menu and every time you use it the ability is deselected so you have to go back into the same sub-menu and keep re-clicking it for multiple re-uses.\n* It is not possible to customize the chat window and generic dialogue along with combat data is all dumped into the same window. There are no options to create separate tabs with different filters on what messages you see in which tabs.\n* The to-hit dice rolls in the combat messages are still just as abstract. It does not tell you what you need to be rolling in order to hit the enemy and there are seemingly random modifiers being applied such as +7 or -5 but I have no idea what they are.\n* In character creation when assigning your attributes the game does not tell you specifically what affect they have. For example, when modifying your constitution it does not tell you about how total hit points are calculated or how your class or race can affect both hit dice and saving throws based upon your constitution. It also does not update and show you the effects of your modifications in real time. If I am having to alt-tab out to a wiki to find out what effects these abilities have then you have failed at user interface design.\n\n*****************************\nMiscellaneous Ranting\n*****************************\n\nWe got a handful of new kits, which for the most part are just boring. Nothing that is really game changing or adding new functionality for modders to then expand upon. Would have been nice to see a Shadow Druid that could change into a panther or spider and use stealth/backstab like a thief. A cleric that acted like a Sorcerer in so much that they don't have to memorize divine spells but instead can cast a set amount per level of those in their spell book.\n\nWould have been nice to see battle axes or poleaxes.\n\nI would have liked more difficulty options or the ability to create custom difficulty sets, such as having the ability to remove floor traps!\n\nThe kits that are ported from BG2, don't really make any sense within the context of the main characters very sheltered upbringing. Also some of the kits are totally overpowered for the content found in the lower levels of the game. Would have made more sense that at a certain level the player could choose to specialize in a kit.\n\nI get stuttering and performance issues at random times, not always in combat. Also on some maps, most notably those with water I get weird sound echoing/stuttering. Neither of these two problems occur with the originals.","November 29, 2014","false","96.8"," 126 of 189 people (67%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","67","126","189","8","23"

Adding widescreen support, new characters and locations, it still remains the classic adventure as it ever was.\n\nIf you haven't noticed yet, this game, it's old, don't expect any shiny graphics or groundbreaking gameplay. Give it a chance though, it has tons of content, it retains its charm and the challenge that a lot of mainstream games nowadays simply do not provide. Many characters with their own alignments can be found to form wildly different parties, giving it replayability, and the multitude of sidequests and locations pretty much make it guaranteed that you won't get to see it all in one go.\n\nThe plot itself is alright, but maybe that's because I played the sequel first so I was already aware of the plot twists. I strongly recommend you start with this game before moving on to BG2, if you've never touched them, you're in for a treat. Especially since you can import your BG1 character into BG2, giving it a sense of continuity. You don't get to experience the sequel differently like the Mass Effect series kind of does if you do import your character, but the stats, name, etc, do carry over.\n\nIt's amongst my favorites due to the link it shares with BG2. I like BG1, but BG2 just blows it out of the water, making the original a mandatory playthrough.

And play the game before the update.\nHowever it appears to be just as broken - Not everything but, very specific things.

The closest thing you'd probably ever play next to this would be something like NWN or maybe other games using the same engine like Icewind Dale or Planescape. The game is handled through dice rolls, just like D&D so if it seems like you just keep losing fights and chances because of luck, well, that might just be the factor. The controls that weren't improved and the AI-pathing issues etc. don't ultimately kill the game, it handles as well as the first versions did.\n\nThis is a game for those who want to test their mettle in almost every way, and if you ever do beat the game, you can probably consider yourself to be one of the most baller people out there. Many would say NOT to get this version of the game compared to getting the older ones, but I personally don't see any fault in it.

However XP gained is also lowered with the difficulty so while you can make it easier, it gives you a good reason not to lower it.\n\nIt's long, but can be SO much longer. By following the main story you can miss a huge portion of the game but it'd still take a lot longer to complete than just about any other game out today. If you decide to do everything then you have got a friend for life, it's very simaliar to The Elder Scrolls / Fallout series in the sense that if you want to max' it out, you REALLY have to put the work into it, but in a FAR more varied way. (Black Isle were involed with the production of Fallout 1 and 2 and to this day Fallout and The Elder Scrolls still share similarities with  The Forgotten Realms, but that's another story......)\n\nIt has a very good story that unfolds based on your choices. There are so many ways to do everything, if you need a certain item try convincing the owner to part with it. With a high enough charisma you can make him think it's cursed, you could have a thief try to pick pocket him, you could buy it from him, maybe he wants to give it to you because of all the good things you have done, maybe he won't EVER give it to you because of all of the bad things you have done, you could earn it from him or just flat out kill him and take it. The story is the world itself, what is happening in it and what you will chose to do when you are given the chance.\n\nIt's very well written and acted. The people who came up with the dialog covered everything, you would think trying to talk a guy out of committing sucide would have easy choices and results right? Wrong. Every option you chose could rely on many different factors, some of which can be random. You can never be sure of what will happen as a result of what you do, regardless of your intentions. You'll find yourself saving and loading everytime you are given a choice, simply succeding in a task doesn't mean you couldn't have done better. Voice acting is what they ment it to be, if you are talking to someone who is trying to be serious, you're not laughing at them. (Like you did during the intro' to Resident Evil 1 "Stop...... Don't open.... That door!")\n\nIt treats you like an adult. It won't give you a gray marker that is on-screen 100% of the time telling you were to go, if you don't know, open your journel and find the entry that refers to your current objective (or maybe pay attention next time).\nIt won't let you retry something that you messed up, you messed it up, next time pay attention (or just load.... It's easier).\nIt has a lot of in-game mechanics that you are expected to learn and understand, this isn't CoD you don't just run around untill you see someone and then jam both triggers. 1 Small enemy can be infintly more deadly that 10 large ones, why? Maybe he's attacking a mage in a much lower armor class than a fighter, why isn't the fighter intervening? Maybe he got stunned by the small enemy, maybe the small enemy has a high magic resistance and can't be put down with magic so you need your fighter and you can't heal him because your healer is healing your ranger who is holding another front. It won't hold your hand and tell you you're pretty (even if you are), if you get beat it's your own fault for not prepairing properly.\n\nIt's class / ability vareity is huge, you could have 4 mages all with different spells, one for summoning, one for buffing, one for AoE and one for direct attacks. 2 Rangers can work differently from each other, one could be a make-shift fighter holding a choke point while another attacks from range or sneaks past. You can change party formations, give individual orders to you party members and pause / unpause at any time (apart from during cut-scenes) so if you find yourself up against some tough enemies (I'm thinking of the Yuan-Ti invasion of Kuldahar in IWD 2) you can pause and look closely at your options.\nWill you take out the archers raining heavy damage on your mage(s) from range? Will you focus on the infantry crashing into your tank(s)? What about thier mage behind the front lines casting AoE on you? Can you healer(s) keep your tank(s) alive? Should you retreat? You'll spend more time looking at paused battlefields than fighting on them, I know that might not sound like a good thing but when 1 bad guy can kill you and you kill 30+ because you assesed the complex situation properly....... That makes you feel pretty cool..... /Epic Face.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, they have updated it on Steam! Now with new charecters, including the expansion, a new "adventure" presummable meaning a new area that (like all other areas) has many "inner-areas". Improved multiplayer support for cross-platform connectivity, over (and I quote) "400 improvements to the original game". It now has a tutorial mode, support for high resolution widescreen displays and even new charecter voice options.\n\nThere is simply too much to say and all of it is good. If you are going to buy it I will say this, graphics don't make a game, gameplay does. If you need good graphics to enjoy a game this is (your loss) not the game for you.","August 24, 2014","true","1.3"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","41","53","0","0"

You're open to make any sort of character you want to go on your adventure. From an honest noble Paladin, to a deceitful Assassin. What is great about this is how it meshes perfectly with the storytelling. Most of Baldur's Gate is spent wandering and doing quests, and there isn't really an overarching "save the world" plot to keep you grounded. There's a very colorful cast of characters who can join your party too. From a cleric frozen in stone, to an evil greedy mage, to an overly enthusiastic Ranger who talks to a hamster. More than any other game, Baldur's Gate really captures the feeling of playing D&D near perfectly. I have never played an RPG that captures the essance of being "sublime" more than this game.\n\nThis would be all well and good on it's own, but Baldur's Gate's gameplay was done very well too. Combat is very brutal and punishing, especially at the start of the game. It runs on a very finely adapted variant of the AD&D system, so a lot of very old RPG conventions are present. Stuff like races are restricted to specific classes and mages are restricted to a single spell per day at level 1. What's more is that the classes aren't balanced against each other like in a modern day RPG, so the strategy to the game comes from building a balanced party of adventures. This is all great stuff and it makes the game extremely replayable.\n\nAdding to that Baldur's Gate is essentially a trilogy of games. Starting with Baldur's Gate, continuing with Baldur's Gate 2 and ending with it's expansion Throne of Bhaal. All featuring much of the same cast of characters. So you get the most out of the experience by playing through all three.\n\nNow whether you get this version of the game is totally up to you. You can alternatively get the original version from GOG for things like mods. I heavily recommend for this version to pick up a mod called BG1 NPC project since it adds things like party banter and romances.","November 23, 2015","true","3.1"," 123 of 194 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","123","194","5","0"

But then the update v2.0 came out and it was practically forced down through our throats. Steam doesn’t have any option to turn off auto update. The resulting state of the game is awful. I will just mention some new characteristics I think are very bad decisions.\n\n1 – There is no dedicated local map page anymore. When you click on the map button, the area you are in will be zoomed out such that it will be full visible. Plus, they’ve added some large black borders to all the sides. These annoying borders also appear when you are next to the edge of an area and move the cursor in that direction.\n\n2 – That characteristically lovable “scroll opening effect” that happens when you hover the mouse over some element was replaced by an ugly and unfitting modern-like box that pops up. If you click on the help button, you will see lots of these horrible boxes polluting the screen. They are also present on the zoomed view of the area and the worst part is that you cannot turn these boxes off without removing the map markers in the process.\n\n3 – In the previous versions of the game, you could go from one menu page to whatever other you wish. Now if you are, for instance, on the inventory page you cannot go to the journal page directly anymore. The button of the journal page will even be displayed in a dark color. So you will have to close the page you are on, returning to the game screen, and only then it will be allowed to you to open the journal. Strangely enough it will be allowed to go directly to the journal only if you are in the new zoomed view that replaces the local map. And the journal page will be displayed over the zoomed view.\n\n4 – The journal page now occupies only half of the screen. But why? If a change does not improve the gameplay, why would the developers implement it? Do they have so many time to throw away? Also all the quests (finished and not finished) are displayed together.\n\n5 – The new record page looks like a web browser with all those tabs. In the previous version there was only one tab called “Information” and it was good enough. Now there is a “class” tab, a “stats” tab and so on.  Now we know what kind of information is in a tab labeled as “class” because it is very descriptive by itself. However, what kind of information a tab labeled as “information” holds? The only purpose of a label is to indicate the type of content it refers to.\n\n6 - Now if you are on the world map page and click to drag, the cursor does not change from a open hand to a "grabbing hand" as it did before. It doesn't even change from the standard pointing finger to the open hand! I know this is just a little detail removed, but it was part of a masterpiece once called Baldur's Gate. Say, if someone changes the color of the Mona Lisa's eyes, for instance, would you call the result "Mona Lisa" anymore?\n\nNOTE: FOR THOSE WHO ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE V2.0 UPDATE. YOU CAN RIGHT CLICK ON THE BALDUR'S GATE EE IN STEAM LIBRARY, THEN GO TO PROPERTIES AND TO THE TAB CALLED "BETAS". CLICK ON THE DROP DOWN BOX AND SELECT bgee_1.3. IT'S DONE, YOU NOW HAVE THE PREVIOUS VERSION AGAIN!","April 7","false","46.8"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","30","37","0","3"

After speaking with Daeros you learn of Hephernaan's plan to use your Bhaalspawn blood to open a gate to hell for nepharious purposes all the while manipulating Caelar.\nCaelar calls for a parley and demands you surrender yourself and instead of telling your ally's the truth of their ploy, all you can do as options for dialogue is "duhhhh I have no clue what they could POSSIBLY want with me".

With EE I can play the game the way it was meant to exist if technology was more advanced in 1998 and if the team had a few more hours to polish it.\n\nEven though the improvements are small the game feels very different in my experience (for the better). Transparent UI makes it so much less intrusive. The ability to zoom makes it possible for me to run the game in a widescreen resolution without everything being too small. Plus, I quite like to reduce zoom outdoors and increase it in dungeons. I never knew how much I missed this before I had the chance to try it.\n\nBecause they implemented several convenience changes I am able to play this game without installing any convenience tweaks. For example, the standard 40 ammo stack was a bit of an annoyance for me, so I always installed tweaks just to increase stacking if nothing else. Because EE stacks up to 80 that's enough for me and I can just play the game as it is.\n\nMy biggest gripe with BG was always that I had to spend what seemed like forever just installing and configuring it (TuTu this, TuTu that, mod, tweak, blah blah). Finally I can just install it, increase FPS in options to 40 (to speed up walking) and PLAY. I'm sure that fundamentalists will argue that EE is the devil because you can get the same or better experience by taking BG1 and run it using BG2's engine with widescreen mods etc. But in my opinion the result is not as polished as EE and there is just SO much painful hassle that way.\n\nI approve of this release!\n\nP.S. (spoilers below!)\nI am also very happy that they included new NPC's - even though the original had a lot of them to begin with. I am one of those individuals who think that the 'canon' party sucks (i.e. that they are incredibly annoying). I love Imoen, but I cannot stand Minsc (calling him a degenerate idiot would be a compliment), Jaheira (Look! It's Miss Personality herself!) or Khalid (he's just a dog without testicles that Jaheira keeps on a leash). Dynaheir I could care less about. The problem is that these people come in pairs, so there go 4 of your 5 slots.

What we received was hack writing and forced SJW themes that I do not want in my video games. Are there no longer game publishers who offer what their fans want or do they all have to cater to PC thinking?

The first claims to have over 300 "improvements" to the game such as: you now have to confirm you want to travel somewhere instead of just clicking the zone, you have to confirm you want to memorize a spell, rather than just clicking on the spell. The inventory flashes an obnoxious stat change box with EVERYTHING a character can use, even potions.  The graphics got a hit of cartoonishness as they added a way to smooth the outlines (luckily you can turn it off and it looks more like the original format.) There is a "journal updated" box that now appears when you do a quest objective. This can be especially annoying when you're turning in a lot of items in. A good example: I just killed the Tanar'ri up near Baldur's Gate itself, I went back down to Nashkell because I had around a dozen winter wolf pelts to turn in to the merchant there; the journal updated for every single turn in.\n\nI came back to the game after a while because I had given up on the demon fight originally, but after some time I was ready for it again. Coming back to all this frivilous BS is rather angering. I don't mind bug fixes, as long as they improve the game, but breaking the wheel while its functioning just fine is a waste of the programmers' time and talent. Honestly, until they enable a way to revert back to the original format, I refuse to play this game anymore. Good job Beamdog, you screwed up a perfectly good game, I imagine in the name of hubris.","April 21","false","105.8"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","31","44","2","2"

Even after working with tech support, the best I could do was to get the game to turn on, at which point it would be so slow and glitchy I couldn't even move past the first screen. Tech support has been unable to fix this for me yet, and their only advice was to wait for a revised patch.

It's Baldur's Gate 1 without the annoying UI and with some extra content.  If you like Baldur's Gate and aren't familiar with modding then this game is for you. But if you never played Baldur's Gate then allow me to go over some of the details.\n\nStory- It's is rather interesting if you do not mind reading a lot. Altough the start is rather slow, once you get midway into the game it begins to pick up a lot.\n\nGameplay- Difficult, but once you understand the basics then it can be rather fun. However the combat is not for everyone, it's very tactical and can be slow in the start.\n\nCharcters- Other than the extra characters added in by Beamdog, the orginal charcters have little personality. The extras have conversations with you and offer extra areas and items. They serve their purpose as party members.\n\nOverall, if you are willing to surive the lower levels and keep going forward then this game is for you. If you lack patience and dislike older games then just forget about it. There is a huge learning curve and unless you are willing to learn then I would advise against purchasing this game.\n\nI personally love this game and love Baldur's Gate 2 even more. If I had to give the game a numerical value it would be 85/100. Beamdog did a good job with optimization and a lot more accessable to the public than it used to be.","November 22, 2014","true","49.5"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","27","38","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neogunhero/recommended/228280/","neogunhero","kuri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neogunhero/","311 products in account","I'll be writing this review mainly directed to people who don't really know much about Dungeons & Dragons or old-school cRPG's.\n\nOne of the first games to have branching story paths that actually worked and meant something. Lots of consequence, lots of choices, lots of endings.\n\nThe story of the game is very well written and also interesting. If you're willing to read up on the background information a little to get a grasp of what the D&D world is like, particuarly this one, then you'll understand the games story better. Even if you don't read any background information you'll still pick up on it as you play, and you'll still be able to enjoy it.\n\nThe first few hours of the game are a little slow and sort of random. During these few hours (about 2-3 hours or so), lots of random things will be thrown at you just to let you practice on how the game works. You'll meet random companions, random attacks, and have some pretty pointless but rewarding side quests. Like I said, these are just to warm you up on the rest of the game.\n\nOne of the main points of the game is maintaining a party. You'll meet many companions along your adventure which you can either allow into your party or not. You must watch each players health, weapons, stats, and so on. It sounds complicated when you first read about it, but it's pretty easy once you get used to it. Your companions will get tired, get wounded or their weapons will break. You have to watch out for all of these things and help them out as much as you can. Fortunately for people who have a hard time making characters, you will only have to make your own character (which is the leader of the party) as all other companions will have their own stats and abilities. With that being said, you must know how to use and level up their stats and abilities.\n\nThe combat can be a bit tricky at first, especially once your party gets pretty large. You are able to pause the game, point out each individual party member who to attack, then unpause. Having your whole party attack the same enemy at once works on lower level enemies, but as you start to face larger groups of monster and/or more challenging enemies, you have to use strategy to determine how not to get your party instantly killed.\n\nThe character creation is quite big for this game. You can chose between a few races, pick between many classes which have their own sub-classes (Such has Cleric/Ranger or Cleric/Thief, etc.) and have quite a bit of stats to level up. You won't be leveling up as easily or quickly as many of todays RPGs. I didn't upgrade my main character until about 2 hours into the game while doing a bunch of side-quests and killing lots of enemies. Leveling up is meant to feel rewarding and having an actual impact when adding points to stats and gaining new abilites.\n\nThe world is nicely drawn in this game too. The graphics on the Enhanced Version doesn't look much better than when I played this game years ago, but at least it's in widescreen.\n\nExploring the world is also a huge point in this game. The world isn't all one seamless level, but instead it's broken up into large sections which usually have other sections within them, such as caves and castles. Most of the places you're allowed to freely enter, but others are restricted.\n\nI guess there's also multiplayer, but I guess i'm the only one in my friends list that owns this game haha.\n\nOverall, I think this game is very good, and the Enchanced Edition brings some changes that will ease in newcomers to the classing cRPG genre. This is considered by many to be one of the best RPG games to date, as well as the other D&D cRPG's that came out around the same time. I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RPGs and are willing to overcome a slight learning curve if they haven't played a classic cRPG such as this before.","March 12, 2015","true","13.9"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","26","37","0","1"

Do not support this kind of thing, don't even buy the base game and, if you already did, ask for a refund if you still can.\n\nOn their words:\n\n“If there was something for the original Baldur’s Gate that just doesn’t mesh for modern day gamers like the sexism, [we tried to address that],” said writer Amber Scott. “In the original there’s a lot of jokes at women’s expense. Or if not a lot, there’s a couple, like Safana was just a sex object in BG 1, and Jaheira was the nagging wife and that was played for comedy. We were able to say, ‘No, that’s not really the kind of story we want to make.’ In Siege of Dragonspear, Safana gets her own little storyline, she got a way better personality upgrade.

Originally released in 1998, BioWare struck gold with this great D&D-licensed RPG. Now, over a decade later, Overhaul Games/Beamdog have appropriately overhauled the game in this Enhanced Edition, but is it worth getting?\n\nDefinitely! The massive scale of the game, the sheer amount of quests with excellent dialogue and the huge sense of freedom makes this a fantastic RPG experience to this very day. The Enhanced Edition comes with the original, the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion and offers even more content with the addition of three new companions, each of which offer an excellent experience, in addition to the new "The Black Pits" campaign which focused on arena-style combat. The Enhanced Edition additionally contains all the improvements that Baldur's Gate 2 had, meaning you can now play every single race/kit that BG2 contained plus the Enhanced Edition adds a bunch of new options and possibilities.\n\nBut the game is old and the Enhanced Edition does little to change this fact. Although there have been visual improvements, most notably a better user interface, it still looks like an incredibly old game and as the Enhanced Edition comes with a shocking lack of options this becomes a problem. Furthermore, the game does no effort or attempt to guide you. Especially fans of modern RPGs will run into this quickly, as the game is not even remotely user friendly. You will find no quest waypoints and very little in the way of statistic or spell explanations, meaning you will have to have patience learning and understanding the obviously outdated mechanics.\n\nIf however you can deal with these issues, then Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is definitely worth getting. If you've played these games to death in the past, and have dabbled in the numerous mods at the time, then this may not be for you though the new content might just offer you enough. It is a much more convenient game with some great additions that makes playing this fantastic classic an amazing experience any RPG fan should play.\n\nFull review (Includes BG2: Enhanced Edition): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5qqfOXRRaA","December 17, 2013","true","42.6"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

Because this is a mixed bag. The game used to be perfect. I say *used* to be perfect until the 2.0 update rolled around which dinged it up a bit. The actions of the beamdog team didn't help it either.\n\nOkay so here's the good: the graphics have been updated for new machines and three new companions have been added. A mage named Neera who accidentally blows stuff up, a monk named Rassaad, and Dorn Il-khan an orc blackguard (and certified motherf***er) on a mission of revenge. Class kits and high level spells are also in this game adding a ton of flexibility to it.\n\nThe bad: As of 4/14/2016 there are random CTDs and this one rage inducing bug that literally changes the game's difficulty slider (randomly turning on story mode when you want hard difficulty) a handful of graphical bugs.\n\nEdit: They released a patch recently to fix these bugs. To the best of my knowledge, the difficulty sliding bug is no more.\n\nNow this part is just me, and also a few others, but I feel this should be brought up: The people that "enhanced" this game have no respect what so ever for the original game or it's fanbase (calling the original sexist, calling critics misogynists and transphobes) When they were called out on it, they made a backhanded statement, anyone who called out their bad writing, or the writers themselves for their lack of repsect, were labelled "Gamergaters" and just hand waved the complaints.\n\nSo here's what I think... MAYBE buy this. DON'T buy at full price if you do (wait until it goes to, like, %75 of on a sale or something.) MAYBE pick up the original off amazon just in case they break it more.\n\nAnd whatever you do, STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THE DLC!

The 2.0 release is trouble.  Beamdog has taken upon themselves to modify a classic game to their liking, in a hodgepodge, buggy and non-canonical sort of way, rather than make their own game.\n\nIf I could go back to the 1.x enhanced edition I would, since it's approach was more conservative, but now, since there is no "classic mode" of BG enhanced, there is no way to play simply a modernized version of BG without Beamdog's new take on how the game should be.  Instead, I'll have to install the old version from GOG.\n\nBeamdog should really consider offering a vanilla BG enhanced.  I have to rate their additions as not recommended because new fans will think the new chars and new interface they've added is BG and simply not play the original.  The enhanced edition started as a celebration of the classic, and now is a frankenstein based on beamdog's bottom line and inability to make their own retro rpg.","April 12","false","476.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

Although the story starts out slow, it greatly picks up the pace later on.  Pretty much any special enchanted item has an interesting back story behind it. The amount of classes, items, and spells in this game is gigantic. Another thing, some of the dialog choices are pretty funny.\n\nHowever, there are problems with this game.\n\n1) It's a game that focuses on strategic combat. So some fights can be ridiculously hard. This might even be harder if you're someone who isn't familiar with knights of the old republic style of combat. It can also become tedious and tiresome.\n\n2) Yes, the graphics are dated. If you're the type of person that can't play older style of rpg's, it might be hard to get into.\n\n3) Because they put baldur's gate into the baldur's gate 2 engine, there are some nasty bugs which may have to do with the scripting. Examples being->everlasting battle music, certain quest items becoming unusable, and some bosses just despawning.\n\n4) They didn't fix the pathfinding in this enhanced edition. So you have to baby sit your characters to make sure they go to the right place.\n\n5) Most of the time you have a choice on what happens, but not in some instances.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zelmor/recommended/228280/","zelmor","Zelmor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zelmor/","72 products in account","At first, I was happy I could finish this game, after some 13 years of stopping at Nashkel Mines and never going through with it. The graphical update is well-made, and I appreciate Linux-compatibility, even though AI path-finding is still a mess. With all that said, I did not miss much since 1998, I'm afraid.\n\nMechanically, this game didn't age well. Might not have been that good at the time either, but such was the zeitgeist. Design had come a long way since then, and has improved upon much of the formulae of these rpgs.\n\nThe breaking steel weapons, while integral to the main story, are quite irritating early on, as they represent no challenge besides managing the inventory of several party members. All of whom are limited in carry-capacity by their strength. While it does make sense that your wizard would not be able to carry four sets of metal armour on their back, neither does it for Minsc, nor my Dwarven defender main character. Money is all around the place, and after some time, you only look potions and arrows. Magic items available in shops are not all that good, and I have only spent money on purchasing the party's first +1 weapons, which are magical and do not break. I was sitting on over 50 thousand gold by the end, not even bothering with selling things after some time.\n\nOutside of these early purchases, the way of progression is generally looting and pillaging, which made me feel like we were a party of murder-hobos masquerading as heroes (renown maxed with good deeds and not killing town guards). The game world feels static, many models are standing around the town of Baldur's Gate, yet people are pushing their own unconnected agendas with you playing the henchmen or merry matchmaker. Boring. I did go into length to do as many side-quests as possible, but it made little difference. The world did not come more alive for all my troubles.\n\nThe story was bland if anything, and conversational choices mostly boiled down to 1, being nice, 2, wanting money for being nice and 3, acting rude, stabbing people and generally not being very nice. There was no opportunity in changing the flow of conversations or saving face once you lost it, which is not fun. Many of the characters feel out of place, thrown into the setting as “that dude in front of a house who gives you a quest that takes you to the next location”. Companion characters not connected strictly to the main story come at you seemingly random, many in the middle of the wilderness or a road, and you most probably already have a full party of capable individuals and cannot be bothered to dismiss someone just to check out what this new random bloke could bring to the party. I simply went with an early-game group of lawful neutral and good individuals, as boring that might sound. I did get Khalid killed early on though, as he was not bringing anything to the party, however, Jaheira, our druid would have left if the fighter got dismissed.\n\nGame-play wise, AD&D is really bad, and I wish they had gone with a better system. Then again, such was the time. In this game it is perfectly justifiable to make a bard character who then sits out all fights, singing and thus bringing +2 attack value to the rest of the party, because bonuses could mean that much. Then again, I made a steel wall made out of dwarf, a true craftsmanship of his kind I must say, who walked up to people and hit them for damage beyond the baseline health of most spell-casters. Exploding corpses were a triviality during our adventures. That said, fights are challenging and can be frustrating at times due to the nature of saving throws in the d20 system.\n\nMemorizing spells was a bother, and I never liked it in D&D and its variants. It's not good design, and I am glad video game creators put these kind of player-limiting stupidity behind us.\n\nAs for the content added by Beamdog, the creators of this Enhanced Edition, well, I wish they didn't force so much their impossibly irritating, edgy female character, Neera. The encounter triggers a fight whether you like it or not, and ends in an offer to recruit the mage, whether you like it or not. Well, I just slit her throat. Good riddance! Her voice-acting was worse than that of Imoen's, and that is compliment I never thought I would give that character. All in all, Beamdog failed to improve on the mediocre writing already present in the game.\n\nAs a closing thought, I think I would have enjoyed Baldur's Gate more if the system was based on GURPS.","April 8","false","57.3"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","18","28","2","0"

I expected this version to be polished and running without any problems (no need to install mods etc.). Yes, it is extremely easy to install and start this version. But it's also extremely annoying to play it because it can freeze (crash) 30times in one hour... And even if it runs, it lags when you move something in the inventory - it's not doing this all the time, sometimes everything is fine, but in like 2/3 of the time each move of an item requires you to wait for 2 seconds.\n\nI searched the internet for days, found multiple fixes (turn off antivir, start as admin, use compatibility with XP/Vista/Whatever, run windowed/fullscreen, increase/decrease framerate, countless number of workarounds), some of them seemed to be working, but all the problems were back in few minutes. I even copied the game files to a different folder (simpler path) and played it without Steam, which also didn't help. But I have more hours in the game than Steam shows for me.\nI was leveling Imoen 10times before I finaly could distribute all thief skill points without the game crashing (freezing, forcing me to restart it). I was trying to get an item identified at a shop 15times before I gave up and dropped the item. I have been trying to sell my loot from the Durlag's Tower at a shop so many times now that I stopped playing the game. I'm not having fun anymore.\n\nFrom the new features I noticed only the quick loot dialog, which is quite fine. And of course the fact the the game looks and works like BGII now, which is really great (no sarcasm).\nNew content is tied to new characters and if you don't want them in your party (I didn't), you get nothing new.\nAs far as the game itself (BG) is concerned, I recommend it absolutely. But this Enhanced Edition is not worth it, you should rather get some other version, especially if you can get it cheaper.","January 1","false","25.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","12","18","3","0"

I played DOS which led to Wasteland which was based on fallout1-2 and I enjoyed  Wasteland.\n\nSo I tried Fallout 2 and I didn't get it for the first 4 hours(at least) and I quit once and started over. But after the initial fail I  really really enjoyed the game. I can't say I ever played a better one. It's an epic story of honor and revenge. Skyrim, witcher2 , ME12, DAO ... it was as good as any of them.\n\nSo I couldn't play yet another post apocalypse rpg so i decided to try BG2 which everyone seems to agree is one of the top rpgs of all time.\nI struggled again at the beginning. 6 hours of not liking the game and I also quit once.  And then I started to get into it. It had better party building than Fallout2 and the world  was starting to get interesting   So I stopped because I knew I needed to play BG in order to fully appreciate BG2 because they reference BG in the dialogue.\n\nOK, so now I'm playing BG and again the first 4 hours sucked. I was even bored. Even though I knew the UI and play style already from BG2. Again I quit (went back) once and changed some decisions. I didn't pick up Minsc (yet) because I hated the time limit on the quest. It made me nervous.\n\nSo, anyway, I finally acclimated to the pace and game style and it is a great game so far. Since it's my first run through it's a challenge. I've already lost 2 men (who I didn't mind losing or else I would have loaded the last save).  The combat is fun.\n\nReally though the balance is incredible.  The action happens in well spaced intervals. So far the side quests are fun. I'm in no rush to push the game along.  Level progress is nice and slow. I feel very underdeveloped now and I'm happy to have this gang I've put together. Some of them are selfish. One is evil. All are quirky.  Money is scarce.  And I'm not sure what's going on and why I'm being hunted. We are heading down to Neshkel because that's where the actions at. I was there and a bit further t on my first runthrough but I rage quit. This time it's  nicer.\n\nI'm sure this game is going to be great. I guess the point of this "review" is that you might need to take some time to get into these older games. Once you acclimate to the graphics and the pace you no longer miss anythig about the new games and you get all this great game programing and story telling by  people who REALLY loved their product . Not the "this is a game made with love" BS tag line the reviewers say about EVERY game now. This one was obviously made by people who loved  games and fantasy.\nThe action is fun once you learn the rules.\nThe text , which is a main fake complaint about old school rpgs is fine. "the wall of text" stuff is a myth. It's the opposite. The writing reflects the "efficiency" of text based adventures from the era. Zork (the first text adventure?) never gives you more than a few lines to read. It's the same with BG. Those writers were more skilled than todays. I loved Skyrim but the writing in BG is superior. Skyrim gets long winded and repetitive.","January 19, 2015","true","170.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"

Each of these classes has kits that modify certain abilities or restrictions, allowing for quite a bit of experimenting.\n\n+ Large game with many areas to explore\nYou'll end up spending about two hours making your first character if you're googling for help at the same time. I actually enjoy the process of designing a new character so this is fine by me. After all that, you get a bit of story with not too much text, and you're off into the world. There are a lot of things to do, and the game does direct you to certain places, though very few places are restricted.\n\n+ They let you be evil or good to people\nI'm not into the whole being a jerk to people thing, but if you like that stuff then you'll at least appreciate all the murderous options given to you. As a bad boy/girl, you'll get into trouble with the nicer people in the world.\n\n= Okayish story, not overwhelmingly so\nI already know the plot, and it's kind of cool. Essentially you can explain the plot in two sentences but the game takes its time to introduce it to you. If you're attentive enough, you'll probably figure it all out before the great reveal.\n\n= Multiplayer\nMultiplayer is fun with a friend if it doesn't disconnect too much. There isn't much else to say about this, though. Some people might prefer to be alone because they'd have full control over all party members.\n\n- The way stats work in this version of d&d\nYou don't get combat benefits from having 10-16 strength, but you do get it from having 17 or 18. Dexterity should always be 18 to get better armor (..which you'll need), constitution is a big deal, intelligence does absolutely nothing unless you're a wizard, wisdom is similar. They also force classes to have stats that they don't exactly benefit from! This version of d&d is just a bit too primitive in certain aspects, and I recommend Neverwinter Nights because all stats do something to benefit your character, and not having max stats is perfectly fine.\n\n- Difficulty spikes, often killed instantly by attackers\nThe amount of times you get talked to by a mage and then get charmed/feared, after which you are killed because you lost control of your character .. is staggering. There aren't many ways to counter this, and I remember one quest that instantly kills your character during dialog with no warning or means to escape it. This means you'll end up saving and loading a lot, and possibly avoiding conversation just so you can get the first attack off on your enemy (ie: you fireball them before they can even see you). Sometimes the game becomes too easy as well.\n\n- Not enough customization options\nENHANCED EDITION, it says. So let me play a redhead. It wouldn't have killed the developer to add some extra coloring options in the game, but at least they did improve things graphically a bit!\n\nTL:DR: imbalanced difficulty, unfair deaths, save and load constantly, dated mechanics. Neverwinter Nights is better, but if you enjoyed Neverwinter Nights and want some more RP things, this might do if the price is cheap :) Heard that Baldur's Gate 2 is far better than this one, so working your way to it with the first game might not be a bad idea.","June 19, 2015","false","37.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It is a turn based role playing game that emulates 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.  It is based in the Forgotten Realms in the Sword Coast region.  The story line is fun and engaging.  The level up process is interesting and rewarding and the Non Player Characters are fleshed out well.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition has only made it better.  Besides ironing out some bugs from the original game, they also added some new NPC players complete with side quests.  I also like that they have enabled all of the extra classes from Baldur's Gate II.\n\nI have always like BG1 over BG2 because it doesn't feel as "rail roady".

The enhanced edition isn't really that different from the original for someone that only played it out of the box, like me.

It was terrible for SO LONG. They seemed not to care. For the longest time their solutions to certain problems (the sidebar buttons that remove the sidebar, but don't bring it back) were actually work-arounds that the community had discovered. The tone of their responses to people leaned toward defensive, and it is off-putting.\n\nFrom reading these customer reviews, it only further reassures me that I didn't make a mistake by being wary of Beamdog's newest venture. They should just make mods. It seems like that's what they'd rather do, than deal with any mistakes that they make, or the unhappy customers who feel duped when they buy a broken product, or have a less than positive opinion of said product.\n\nI really wanted to be happy about Beamdog's latest venture.

It's one of the best things about this game in my opinion(dont wanna say much here because i dont wanna spoil anything)\n\nGraphics:\nMay not look much compared to Modern games like the Dragon Age Series but(then again it is nearly 20 years old) back then i thought this game looked great dispite the awful resolution in the original version.\nThankfully the Enhanced Edition puts the BG2 engine into the game and makes the resolution extremely nice.\n\n-\n\nThe AI in both BG1 and 2 is really derpy at times, there have been plenty of times when i'm in a narrow dungeon and some of my characters go somewhere completely diffrent than what i told them(or even worse goes the wrong way right into a trap or an ambush).\nBut thats a nitpick for me honestly.\n\nAnd then of course the thing everyone talks about the Siege of Dragonspear update, oh boy oh boy.\nWhile i don't like the new cartoonish sprites, they look really out of place in the game but i can tolerate that because at least you can disable them.\n\nThere might be a couple of bugs here and there but i can even tolerate that.\n\nThe thing that destroys this game in its current state is the UI, the new UI in both BG1 and 2 is Ugly as ♥♥♥♥ and i have no idea why someone would even think of changing it when the old one was just fine.\n\nBEAMDOG CHANGE THE USER INTERFACE TO THE OLD ONE RIGHT NOW!!!\n\nAfter the Siege of Dragonspear update i would recommend this game without a doubt and give it a 10/10.\nI really wanna give this game a thumps up this game i really do, even after all these years Baldur's Gate still holds up as one of my Top 10 favorite games of all time.\nThis game is basiclly one of the reasons why games like the Dragon Age series exists today.\n\nIn its current state avoid it and the expansion pack(and BGEE2) until it gets fixed.","July 16, 2015","false","69.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the "Enhanced Edition"moniker, the game is still filled from top to bottom with bugs and frustrations. The storyline is decent (though those of the sidequests and companions aren't) and in the higher levels the tactical, semi-turn-based D&D combat still is a big draw, but it's not nearly enough to make up for all the problems.\n\nBalancing for example simply doesn't exist. The early levels are especially horrible since dying or not constantly hinges on a single dice roll (you have less total hp than most enemies can dish out in damage with one hit). The later levels are mostly okay, except for the new content from the expansion, that is simply frustrating and no fun at all. Still, throughout the entire game it all boils down to quicksaving after every fight and then reloading whenever something goes wrong, over and over until the dice fall into the place you need them to.\n\nI'm sorry, but don't buy this.","December 26, 2013","false","30.7"," 29 of 55 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","29","55","0","1"

Even nowdays it outshines most of the titles of the same genre, for its memorable characters (Boo is still my hero) and the storyline, which is still one of the best around after 20 years. A masterpiece and personally one of my all time favorites, avoid it only if you hate the genre or games with an isometric worldview.\n\nWhat's good:\n-Tactical DnD combat, at higher difficulties it becomes prioritary to prepare for the toughest fights, besides choosing your companions wisely.\n-Charismatic characters to choose from as your companions throughout the game, each one with its own personality and will. A practical example: you're the usual lawful good paladin, saving maidens right and left, feeding ophans and so on? Do not expect that chaotic evil semi-pedophile dwarven mercenary to stay long in your party.\n-The game is full of side-quests, most of them rewarding and satisfying.\n-Characters interact with one another (mostly with you of course).\n-Romance system available for some characters, further developed in the sequel. You want to play something more like Dawson's Gate rather than Baldur's? Here you have it.\n-Entertaining storyline and decision making power. You can kill almost everyone in this game, but beware to face the consequences (I myself messed the game up once.)\n-Even without all of the side-quests, this game is pretty long. Without the expansion and all the side quests included in this enhanced edition, it will take you from 20 to 30 hours to beat the game, if you're not rushing it like mad.\n\nWhat's bad/ possibly not enjoyable for others:\n-If your a fan of 3D graphics this is not the game for you.\n-A little dated audio packs in some cases, not a big deal considering the epic soundtrack but still...\n-By contrast with what i wrote before, some may not appreciate the DnD dice based fighting system. If you're a fan of pure action oriented combat games you'll probably be disappointed in this one.\n-Objectively dumb racial restrictions in some cases. Why in the world can't I be a monk if I'm an half-elf? Or an elven paladin? Nothing fun-breaking yet still unsettling.\n\nTo conclude, if you're a fan of traditional RPG or an open minded ACTION-RPG lover, this might be the game for you.\n\nPS. Nevermind the hours of gameplay Steam shows, I've beaten this game thrice or more in a non-Steam version, besides the countless hours I spent on the original one.","May 20, 2015","true","24.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","14"

They updated the resolution and probably removed the (now useless) performance-vs-quality options as well as a few visuals. Other than that it's just a few tweaks and features, but the whole engine (!) seems to have stayed the same - especially the netcode.\n\nHow is that a problem? Well, the game crashes frequently, multiplayer is unreliable and lags, and the game freezes on various occasions (saving/connecting/transferring items/etc) that should not let a modern game freeze. Well, I thought that at least, regarding the "Enhanced Edition" suffix.\n\nI played BG2 in multiplayer before, and the UI is almost exactly like it - a good thing. But to my disappointment, all the bugs haven't been fixed, instead this game actually crashes more often than BG2 original.\n\nIf it is reduced, you like RPGs, and you plan on playing singleplayer only, get this. Otherwise, better not support this attempt on getting money with a slightly updated old game (their only work was to fix/enhance the game - and they failed the first part).\n\n\nI feel like I should add that you get the "DLC" for the game (2 new chars, sound and icon packs) for free on the Steam edition.\n\n\nSeriously, did you even test the multiplayer before shipping?","March 16, 2014","false","9.6"," 80 of 157 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","80","157","2","0"

If you want more in depth, read past this. I've played Baldur's Gate since 2003 or so finished the game twice total. Only five years after it originally released in 1998. This game is basically my childhood. Over all, this game is much like the original with additions of a new class and the half-orc race of Baldur's Gate 2 and now, there's even more customization in the stats. Over all, the story is the same and enhanced on with new characters. If you're into hard-core RPGs that will last you days, buy this game. It's well worth it. But if you want something that has less time investment, don't go for this.\n\nNow for in-depth\n\nCharacter Customization: Now, this is an old game, this isn't Skyrim. Your character customization won't be ranging from weight to dirt color. The customization is in the stats: Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Willpower, Intellect, and Constitution as well as what weapon proficiency you have from one handed sword to katanas, from two handed swords to halberds and from bow to sling. Then if you chose a caster class what spells you have from the beginning. You can chose your class from the traditional: Fighter, mage, thief to things like cleric, specialized mage, multi-classing, ranger, ect. Then race (which has different stats for each) from human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, halfling, half-orc, ect. The only physical customization of the character is in the portrait, gender, hair color, skin color and clothing major and minor colors. That's it.\n\nGameplay: Now, the gameplay is DnD combined with RTS. You control your party of 6 max, including your character (who, if dies, is game over). You can pause whenever to cast spells, which is turn based. I.E. It could take two turns to cast a Heal Minor Wounds spell or a turn to cast a magic missiles or even five to cast a lightning storm or summoning spell. You can loot items from weapons (which CAN and WILL break by the way. So ALWAYS have a spare!) to armor, to enchanted items which you'll need a mage or the money to identify what they are (don't auto-equip these assuming they're better. They might be cursed items!) If you're a fan of DnD you'll love the gameplay.\n\nStory: Without spoilers, the story is amazing and in depth. On disk it spanned over 5 disks and a sixth for the expansion, so the game itself, for the day, was MASSIVE. Games now are 8-12 hrs, possibly a tad more to finish the game, maybe even more than that.. If you want 100% and to actually finish this game successfully, you'll need about a week or two. So prepare for time investment.\n\nGraphics: This game was made in 1998, don't expect beautiful sights like in Assassin's Creed or Mass Effect (I know, two different genres entirely, but best comparisons I can thing of). The graphics are decent enough and good for the time it was made, but the story makes up for the graphics. If you want eye candy, this is the WRONG game for you.\n\nSize: The game spanned over five, even six disks if you had Tales of Sword Coast. So the game is long. The size of the world is rather decent, numerous side zones, towns and cities from where you start in Candlekeep to Baldur's Gate itself, the world is almost all open to exploration. every building with a door, every mine shaft and tent. As long as the cursor changes to a wheel for travel or a door, you can enter. Might not get a good welcome, but you can enter.\n\nDifficulty: The game's difficulty CAN be set, but even on easy it's fairly challenging. Not much more I can say on this factor.\n\nOver all, this game is well worth it and a great buy.","October 29, 2014","true","20.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It takes classes and skills from ADnD and plays out just like that kind of game you get quest, epic loot and enjoy a wide cast of characters and places to see.

The only downside I can see is the Multiplayer you need to set the characters yourself and have a friend in the game to join, If you do want to do this I suggest you and a friend play together and set a time to play (just like a tabletop DnD game yay!) other wises this may confuses you and seem useless to you.\n\nIn short a good old fastion RPG set in a DnD style with plenty of replay value with how many classes and moral option you can  be and the cast of characters is big enough you will not hear the same diolog so many times on each play though.","March 30, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is probably the quintessential definition of a C-RPG. This game handles like a C-RPG would; you can play the game in real-time(not recommended) or you can pause after each turn, each character takes their turn at the same time, mind you. This game's story is excellent and the writing is top-notch; no complaints. The graphics are nice and are easy on the eyes, nothing that requires a gtx Titian or anything; you could run the game on a toaster. When you start up the game, the game tells you to play the tutorial(I think?). The game itself has a steep learning curve, however if you stick to it and get at least a small grasp of the game; much fun is to be had. I can't really say anything bad about the game.

Playing now & I'm happy to say it's still one of the best even compared to more modern heavyweights like Dragon Age or even Skyrim. This game game is played as a 2d topdown view so the graphics are not as good as more modern games but the scope & depth of the gameplay outshines Dragon Age & rivals anything in the Elder Scrolls series (my current favorites).Before getting this game, keep in mind you will have to pay attention to things like encumberance, fatigue, spell memorization and tracking quests yourself (you get an automated journal but there is no auto quest tracking feature like a lot of newer games, such as The Witcher or Skyrim have) but that's part of the fun. This game can be hard, especially at low levels, but the satisfaction you feel when you complete a quest or gain a level is magnified because of that. All in all Baldur's Gate is still one of the best out there & is definately worth getting.","January 17, 2014","true","222.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Though the playstyle is a LITTLE dated, it's not so dated as to prevent me from having fun. As far as D&D games go, the storyline so far is pretty immersive, and much better than NWN 1 (which, honestly, isn't that big of an achievement). That being said, so far BG:EE's biggest feature for me is that it -feels like you're playing a D&D campaign-. The pacing, the general structure of the whole thing, and the sense of freedom give you the feeling that you're as close as you're going to get to playing a tabletop adventure with real people. Having played other D&D games (NWN1, NWN2, DDO), this one so far blows them out of the water in terms of making you feel like you're actually playing D&D. And that's worth something.\n\nLooking forward to sinking a couple dozen hours into this game, and it feels like I'm not going to regret it.","January 18, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While the original '98 release can be played, the Enchanced Edition adds quite a few needed fixes, additions and a little pick-me-up to function on modern computers and with modern players. Stats, tables and desperately needed explanations on what stat increases what function of your spell or swordslinging with a layout that is much more comfortable to your eyes than the original stone-carved stat screen.\n\nStarting out as a snot-nosed adventurer and rising up to be the would-be savior of the Sword Coast, your main character is what you want him to be: From Fighters to clerics, thieves and spellcasters, BG:EE adds all the proficiencies, weapon styles, spells and kits from Baldur's Gate 2 to the original and then some. No more spending that one Cloudkill scroll on a single battle, as it can be written and memorized by a Level 9 Wizard. It also comes with the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion, giving you a much more tolerable level cap, if you happen to be a perfectionist when it comes to clearing quest logs.\n\nAs curious extras, BG:EE adds *gasp* ORIGINAL CONTENT in the form of three New NPCS, new gear and a battle arena mini-campaign. These extras by no means overshadow the original saga one might have come to love, but add a few needed pinches of charm here and there for parties of all alignments. As a bonus, most of these additions continue their tale in BG2:EE, but that's a completely different story.\n\nTL;DR, Go for the eyes, Boo, GO FOR THE EYES, RAAAAaaAAaaAarrrRgGgghhhhhhHH!! even after 15 years..","December 14, 2013","true","62.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now we've just been given Baldurs Gate Enhanced Edition.  This is a combination of the ultimate, arcade, and turbo editions of the game, as well as all of the DLC Characters unlocked.  Other new content includes an endless assault mode, and a time attack mode.  However, as with other 'upgrades' to Baldur's Gate, E. Honda is nowhere to be found.  I believe this is because capcom wants to promote a positive body image, that Mr.Honda doesn't fall into, proving that capcom hates fat people.

Not in the least. It is still very much the same old school Baldur's Gate I first fell in love with. If I were to issue any complaint, it's that the AI is still incredibly dumb and it took only 10 minutes of having NPCs to realize, "Oh yeah... that. They didn't fix that at all."\n\nBut you do notice all the little tweaks they added and despite its age, the gameplay is relatively smooth, once you et the hang of the controls.\n\nI remember the first time I played the original, I took a Half-Elven Magic User and let fighter NPCs take point. This time, I decided to be a bit more adventuerous and took a Gnomish Fighter/Illusionist. I was a bit disappointed to learn that it wouldn't be the classic AD&D Illusionist, but a modified Magic User, but in terms of game play for Baldur's Gate, that actually works out quite well.\n\nI'm looking forward to a bit of a game break, but my next one will definitely be the enhanced Baldur's Gate 2.","October 28, 2014","true","73.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

For instance, the quest log--after I got to Chapter 5, it went away, impossible to know what the quests are, what to do, where to go. Just one of the many bugs. The people who give this glowing reviews did not finish the game. And, as you can see, I invested many hours into it. There are areas where if you talk to an NPC before doing something else, the game just about blows up--from talking to an NPC! Your party is stuck, unable to leave the zone. I mean, it's just one thing like that after another with this broken mess. Sure, it is nostalgic, it's FUN, but only if you dabble for a few minutes and then quit, as I suspect 99% of the reviewers out there have done. Play it to win it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. I played through most of the game's content but am not able to finish it to see how it ends.\n\n[addendum] Beamdog fixed a lot of bugs during 2014, and I quit playing at one point toward the end without actually finishing. As someone here and on forums has suggested, the game did have corrupted savegame file problems that made a HUGE mess out of the game if you happen to be unlucky enough to have run into it, where the only solution is to reload from an earlier save. My best guess is, I ran into one of those problems, continued playing, and the game was messed up forever after that. Very possible starting a new game with the final patch would clear it all up.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that the game was unplayable for me.

The story is good, the characters excellent and the graphics were beutiful when the game was new. Although the graphics isn't particularly impressive now it is not as anoying as some other old games are when you revisit them 15+ years after release, visually the game manages to be rather pleasing despite it's original release data in the mid-90s.\n\nPersonally I don't feel that the "Enhanced Edition" adds that much to the game, but there was no need to do that either. The new NPCs are alright and the additional quests are fine, though. Beamdog have also corrected some bugs that existed in the original game. It's nice to play this game without having to dig out my five old scratched discs...\n\nDefinitely recommended for old ad&d nerds, but the clunky system will probably terrify most of the WoW-generation. Overall I think that many younger players may find the game difficult to get to past the first level (and being level 1 in ad&d is horrible), you need to reach at least level 3 before the game gets manageable.","June 24, 2014","true","60.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While not as flexible as the original when it comes to the modding community, this game still has a lot to offer.  From beginning to end, you are treated to a detailed story with tons of sub-stories that never (or almost never) detract from the story or overarching plot in any way.  The companion characters you encounter along the way each have their own personalities and interesting agendas, so take heed of who you keep with you!\n\nAmong new additions to the game are 3 (or rather 4, because "secret") NPCs, each with a distinct playstyle and alignment, new quests, new items, an arena combat mini-game, and all the goodies from the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion pack for the original.  While this doesn't seem like much, it's still enough to add a couple of hours (at least) to the game itself.  Plus, the BGEE community has worked to bring some of the old mods back into this day and age in hopes of making them Enhanced Edition compatible...  So, time will tell with how that goes.\n\nDifficulty can be ruthlessly hard due to its classic no-training-wheels approach.  At times, dungeons can feel clunky because of this and outright frustrating, this is also due to the AD&D mechanics that the game is based on.  Also, the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (which this game is set in) is not for everyone.  Besides being a 'vanilla fantasy setting' on all accounts, the Bethesda-esque essential-NPCs can sometimes distract from the environment in certain cases.  If you can overlook these things, BGEE will be a fantastic adventure for you!","June 23, 2014","true","222.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I went into this old game with the mindset of a current-gen game player. This is what I found.\n\nThey don't make games like this anymore. Baldur's gate, despite being over 15 years old as I write this, can genuinly be described as unique because you simply will not find other games quite like it in modern game design. Its a huge, sprawling RPG with fantastic writing, a brilliant sense of humour, an engaging plot and an openess to approaching each situation the way you see fit. The game rarely shackles rules onto you, and your free to use all the mechanics the game gives you in most situations, unlike most modern games which are designed to have a set way of each event playing out. The only criticism is its very wordy, and you will spend a lot of time just reading text, however, the script and writing of the game is actually one of its finest highlights, making this criticism a slim one. If you want an RPG that makes you feel like your really playing a role, and not being guided down a path like most modern games, give this a go. If you get lost in it you'll easily spend hours wrapped up in its enthralling world.","April 16, 2014","true","34.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So of course the question is how does this enhanced edition work out?\n\nPerfectly. The new companions are interesting with their own back stories that really expand the rather modest repertoire of companion stories This is of course compared to today's standards with games like Mass Effect, Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age, and Fallout: New Vegas. Keep in mind that the original Baldur's Gate was released in 1998 and it still makes me onanate and ♥♥♥♥ me britches from the awesomeness of it. They are prevalently assigned classes that were not in the original, but were in Baldur's Gate 2. The old one. This edition also provides some new locations to explore and have fun with (though they are mostly tied to the new companions).\n\nSome might be dissapointed because the original was, with all the mods, a far superior game, in many ways exceeding this newer version. But, and I say this with tears of joy dripping down my red colored baby chins, the modding community and the community as a whole are strong with this one and the mods are already coming out in numbers. My favourite is the NPC Banter mod, which gives just so much to the game that it's a must. Companions get these thinking and emotional dimensions that just must be experienced. It's still in development, but it already does wonders.\n\nI'd write more, but I must go feast on the flesh of kobolds now and help an infernal looking kid find his dog.

Like EE, Tutu offers better resolution and fixes bugs (in fact, more of them than EE does). While I still prefer Tutu over EE, I think EE is well done and likely better for players who are not willing to spend hours/days picking the right set of mods. Moreover, EE has extra content - The Black Pits arena and 4 new NPCs.\n\nI was surprised myself that I mostly liked the new NPCs. Since all four of them are of different class than the original potential party members, EE offers new strategies, which is something both new and veteran players can enjoy. Baeloth (who is a bit hard to obtain, since he's an easter egg) was even a key member in my party and I can recommend EE just for the perk of having him around. Who wouldn't want to give orders to a brash drow sorcerer?\n\nThe Black Pits is, frankly, an add-on for powergamers and nothing else. If you are in the game mainly for the combat, you'll enjoy it; if not, don't bother trying the arena at all. It's not related to the main story in any way (unless you count Baeloth). Nonetheless, the fights can be fun and challenging, so there's that.\n\nOverall, I'd say that EE is a good way of keeping Baldur's Gate alive and adjusted to 21st century. It adds new content that fits in nicely with the original game and spares players the need to poke around game files themselves. But if you're someone who's been playing Baldur's Gate for a few years, you probably know BG Tutu and have modded the game yourself by now. In that case, EE is redundant.","June 29, 2014","true","52.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the story, all of my NPC characters dialogue, and encountering sidequests and enemies in the world.  In my opinion it does all of these things better if not aswell as modern games that promise the same things.  Without jumping on the retro-game-hype-train, in fact, without even considering the age of this game I'd give it a solid 8/10 if I knew absolutely nothing about it.

I went into this old game with the mindset of a current-gen game player. This is what I found.\n\nThey don't make games like this anymore. Baldur's gate, despite being over 15 years old as I write this, can genuinly be described as unique because you simply will not find other games quite like it in modern game design. Its a huge, sprawling RPG with fantastic writing, a brilliant sense of humour, an engaging plot and an openess to approaching each situation the way you see fit. The game rarely shackles rules onto you, and your free to use all the mechanics the game gives you in most situations, unlike most modern games which are designed to have a set way of each event playing out. The only criticism is its very wordy, and you will spend a lot of time just reading text, however, the script and writing of the game is actually one of its finest highlights, making this criticism a slim one. If you want an RPG that makes you feel like your really playing a role, and not being guided down a path like most modern games, give this a go. If you get lost in it you'll easily spend hours wrapped up in its enthralling world.","April 16, 2014","true","34.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I like the improvements they have made to this version - you can play all the specialized classes (kensai, priest of lathander, blackguard... etc) most of which were available in the old BG II.  They increased the resolution, and added in some of the new characters as well.  While I still enjoy BGII more (the story is a bit better), this is still very much worth your 10 bucks if you like the series.  Some have said you can buy the original and get mods that are better, but I dont have the patience for all of that.   This version suited me quite well.  If you have not played these games, they are old school and the enhancements increased the resolution from the old VGA to new widescreen standards, but the game is still pretty much the same as it was.

To a certain extent this is true, as Baldur's Gate has a reasonally well developed plot, a plethora of cut and dry standard fantasy characters and well constructed dialogue, that utilizes a quite advanced vocabulary by today's standards. Is it as great as the rose-tinted lenses of nostalgia make it out to be? The answer unfortunately is no, Baldur's Gate is advanced for its time but compared to some of the more modern RPG's is lacking in awareness of broader issues and ideologies. It's a simpler game from a simpler era, that layed the groundwork for the more advanced exploration achieved by later games.\nAs for Beamdog's Enhanced Edition, it adapts the graphics to run on modern resolutions however it still suffers from pixelation due to the nature of the original graphics themselves. The sound runs perfectly, and crystal clear with little to no distortion and the inclusion of the new content is welcome for those who want to experience the old mechanics, yet explore a slightly new adventure.","July 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

To a certain extent this is true, as Baldur's Gate has a reasonally well developed plot, a plethora of cut and dry standard fantasy characters and well constructed dialogue, that utilizes a quite advanced vocabulary by today's standards. Is it as great as the rose-tinted lenses of nostalgia make it out to be? The answer unfortunately is no, Baldur's Gate is advanced for its time but compared to some of the more modern RPG's is lacking in awareness of broader issues and ideologies. It's a simpler game from a simpler era, that layed the groundwork for the more advanced exploration achieved by later games.\nAs for Beamdog's Enhanced Edition, it adapts the graphics to run on modern resolutions however it still suffers from pixelation due to the nature of the original graphics themselves. The sound runs perfectly, and crystal clear with little to no distortion and the inclusion of the new content is welcome for those who want to experience the old mechanics, yet explore a slightly new adventure.","July 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

While not as flexible as the original when it comes to the modding community, this game still has a lot to offer.  From beginning to end, you are treated to a detailed story with tons of sub-stories that never (or almost never) detract from the story or overarching plot in any way.  The companion characters you encounter along the way each have their own personalities and interesting agendas, so take heed of who you keep with you!\n\nAmong new additions to the game are 3 (or rather 4, because "secret") NPCs, each with a distinct playstyle and alignment, new quests, new items, an arena combat mini-game, and all the goodies from the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion pack for the original.  While this doesn't seem like much, it's still enough to add a couple of hours (at least) to the game itself.  Plus, the BGEE community has worked to bring some of the old mods back into this day and age in hopes of making them Enhanced Edition compatible...  So, time will tell with how that goes.\n\nDifficulty can be ruthlessly hard due to its classic no-training-wheels approach.  At times, dungeons can feel clunky because of this and outright frustrating, this is also due to the AD&D mechanics that the game is based on.  Also, the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (which this game is set in) is not for everyone.  Besides being a 'vanilla fantasy setting' on all accounts, the Bethesda-esque essential-NPCs can sometimes distract from the environment in certain cases.  If you can overlook these things, BGEE will be a fantastic adventure for you!","June 23, 2014","true","222.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Like EE, Tutu offers better resolution and fixes bugs (in fact, more of them than EE does). While I still prefer Tutu over EE, I think EE is well done and likely better for players who are not willing to spend hours/days picking the right set of mods. Moreover, EE has extra content - The Black Pits arena and 4 new NPCs.\n\nI was surprised myself that I mostly liked the new NPCs. Since all four of them are of different class than the original potential party members, EE offers new strategies, which is something both new and veteran players can enjoy. Baeloth (who is a bit hard to obtain, since he's an easter egg) was even a key member in my party and I can recommend EE just for the perk of having him around. Who wouldn't want to give orders to a brash drow sorcerer?\n\nThe Black Pits is, frankly, an add-on for powergamers and nothing else. If you are in the game mainly for the combat, you'll enjoy it; if not, don't bother trying the arena at all. It's not related to the main story in any way (unless you count Baeloth). Nonetheless, the fights can be fun and challenging, so there's that.\n\nOverall, I'd say that EE is a good way of keeping Baldur's Gate alive and adjusted to 21st century. It adds new content that fits in nicely with the original game and spares players the need to poke around game files themselves. But if you're someone who's been playing Baldur's Gate for a few years, you probably know BG Tutu and have modded the game yourself by now. In that case, EE is redundant.","June 29, 2014","true","52.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Based on the ruleset of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. If you are more worried about graphics and twitch gameplay, this game is not for you. However, if you enjoy an extremely thoughtful and massive storyline, in an immense environment, with almost no limits to character creation and advancement, not many do it better. It can be played like a Diablo style hack'n'slash, but it is more beneficial to use pausing to give orders to your party. Although it can be hard and frusterating at times, once you get used to it, it becomes easier to prepare for major battles so you don't end up having to restart from too far behind.

The story is amazing, the character progression and interaction was ahead of the curve back in the day.\n\nAn absolute essential for any lover of the RPG genre, still packs quite a difficulty punch compared to most modern RPG's especially if you plan to take on the DLC bosses. That is of course unless you are power gaming and know what you are doing :).\n\nIt has a vast array of race/class choices to make, each class having their own specific sub classes, these characters can be taken across to Baldur's Gate 2 upon completion. You are also given your 9 alignment's to choose from, be it Lawful Good, Chaotic Neutral or True Evil. These will have an effect on any NPC's you wish to take along with you on your quest to save the lands, or destroy them?\n\nThe loot is great, there is a vast source of loot within the game especially towards the end game content when you get to say Durlag's Tower. You think you hit God Mode but perhaps the lack of petrification protection will make your Beserker get one shotted by a Bassilisk.\n\nThe voice acting, whilst small, is passable with a few exceptions being fantastic. Perhaps not enough customisation options. I personally love the isometric top down graphics, but they aren't for everyone.\n\nTHE ONLY downside to this game is the multiplayer, If you are buying this to play with friends, please research the problems you may encounter first. They have patched the issues now to some degree of success but I have had issue when playing with more than 2 people with it booting one of us out. I know a lot of people who have played the entire game with no problem at all as well though. Just be careful if you plan on Multiplayering.\n\nAll in all, one of my favourite games of all time. 10/10.","May 2, 2014","true","98.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I recommend this game especially if you haven't played or if you don't have any of the older versions of the game. The looks and gameplay are very old-school, and the game might be difficult for the beginners, but it's also very rewarding, having lots of side-quests and companion NPCs. If you have already this game with TuTu, this version adds only few new things such as new NPCs etc.","June 20, 2014","true","116.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

With an amazing story, and interesting characters, this game has lots of replay value. Trying to do it all will cap out your exp long before you finish the final quest.\n\nWith the Enhanced Edition, some fun new characters are introduced, and it's nice to be able to pick a Kit right from the start.\n\nMy two biggest complaints are not really all that bad. First, while you can create and role-play as an evil hero, there isn't really a benefit to doing this. All the good rewards are for the good quest endings. Being bad just doesn't pay. Second, with dozens of party members to choose from, there are really only a select few who are worth it. Most are either created with stats that are too weak, or are available too late in the game to be a real consideration. Of course, having one or two weaker companions wont break the game, still kind of sucks knowing you are not as strong as you could be if you brought along another member.\n\nI've purchased this game 3x over the years. Once as a special pre release at a video game convention when I was in high school on a whim with out knowing what it was. A second time years later after college, when I had lost the original while moving. And now a 3rd time, as the Enhanced Edition. Worth every penny.","June 21, 2014","true","731.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

They increased the resolution, and added in some of the new characters as well.

Some have said you can buy the original and get mods that are better, but I dont have the patience for all of that.   This version suited me quite well.  If you have not played these games, they are old school and the enhancements increased the resolution from the old VGA to new widescreen standards, but the game is still pretty much the same as it was.

Did you never get to play Baldurs Gate, or do you want to give it another spin? Then you should definitely get this. The only thing enhanced edition does worse than the original classic, is that the cut-scenes are actually arguably worse now. Except for that, though, it makes the game easily available for you on a modern PC, and it uses the BG2 engine, allowing easy exporting of your character to the second game. It also lets you use many mechanics and features from the second game in the first one.\n\nFor those of you who haven't played the Baldurs Gate series, I will try to keep this relatively spoiler free, and warn you otherwise: The game is looked on as one of the great classics for a reason. It puts you into the shoes of an orphan, who (semi spoiler for the first half hour of the game) is forced to leave the town he lives in with his foster father, who is murdered shortly after leaving by a mysterius figure in a fully plated spiked armor. Initially alone in the world, except for your sister Imoen, you must find friends, overcome the dangers of the world, discover your heritage and face your destiny. Over the course of this and the second game you will come across and interact with dangerous and fantastical creatures of all kinds. Everything from goblins and orcs, to dark elves and dragons, and even demigods.\n\nBaldurs gate is based on Dungeons and Dragons, and has you picking a gender, race, stats, class, and appearance. There are dozens of options here. You can be a fighter, a wizard, a rogue, a ranger, a druid, a monk (the smash stuff with your fists kind), a berserker... the list goes on. Similarly there are dozens of races to pick from.\n\nAs you play you will rack up experience and level up your characters. Along with yourself, you also have to control the leveling up of your friends, and kit them out in the gear you come across (which there is *plenty* of). If you put in the same amount of efforts in the side characters as your own, the game will let you fully experience more classes than just the one you pick for your main character.\n\nUnlike other RPG's that just have enemies improving in strength to follow the pace of the game, the progression here actually makes sense (you won't find a last boss that is ten times as strong as the first boss, even though they should thematically be at the same strength). The first game will not see you face creatures like dragons, but there will still be plenty of challenge. If you come across an encounter which rings alarm bells and makes you think "this looks bad" - it probably does. The game is open for free exploration, and if you rush a location with powerful enemies, you will die (unless you cheat, or know exactly what you're doing for a speed-run, obviously).\n\nTalking about free exploration - there is so much more to do than the main quest. In the spirit of old classics (well, it is one, but regardless), it has a plethora of side quests. You will never have a shortage of things to do. Almost every single location in the game (and there are a *lot* of them) will be involved in a quest in some way. The game is obviously limited somewhat by it's age, but it truly feels alive. The one exception is that you will probably find yourself robbing almost every house you come across unless you are role playing *really* strictly. If someone spots you going for what they consider "private", though (usually stuff that is locked), they *will* call the guards.\n\nGive it a spin. If you enjoyed it, get the second game (enhanced edition) as well. It will have you pick up where the first game left (well, shortly after), and you can import your character to it to continue your journey. The second game is *considerably* longer than the first game, and is generally considered a better game. I highly recommend playing this one first, though, as it's definitely a good game in its own.","September 25, 2014","true","134.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Since the OG in 1998 to the ones on PS2 its been my favorite RPG.  Mainly because it takes place in the D&D world. And I am glad someone is trying to bring the old game back to life.\n\nThere are a lot of bugs still in this game. Not as much as the OG. As there is a lot of them fixed, and you don't need to download a ton of mods to fix it. I think what ever the last patch added however, messed the save games up. It just deleted them. Then I notice the picture was missing for those save games and you can CLICK on an invisible picture. SOMETIMES it lets you load it, most the time(like 95% of the time) it doesn't. I tried starting a new character. Saved. Went to load it. It was not there.\n\nWhat I think would make this game better, is more items to choose from. Seriously beamdog, pick up a D&D players handbook, and just make more weapons. IE: Rapier, Hand Cross bow, Blow gun(useless, but still) Great Axe, Maul, just more basic stuff. More visual, hell, why not just update the rules a bit more as well, and add in more of the Lore that is in the Sword Coast(seens how they just made another expanison for D&D 5.0 based in the Sword Coast) than just the little bit that you have done and then want to charge $20.00 for.\n\nI would still recommend this Game however. But I doubt most people want to pay 20 for a game from 98 with just some paint added to it.","May 26","true","24.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I genuinely believe this game is not worth purchasing on its own.\n\nIf you enjoy ADND combat rules, you might like Baldur's Gate. There is a lot of that stuff. However, if you are a fan of intriguing story, compelling characters, having a general idea of your goal and purpose, or understanding what's going on, I don't think this game is the game for you.\n\nAlmost nothing happens. The majority of the content seems to be running errands for people. Very few characters, with even less character interaction. Combat is unnecessarily complicated (ADND combat rules are obscure and annoying). First fight in the game was just me and a dude missing 10 times in a row before I finally landed a hit for like 3 damage and instakilled him. Generally very hard to tell what's going on in combat. Movement is unbelievably slow -- first dungeon I spent more time walking than doing anything.

Yes.\nSo why do I still recommend it?\n\nBecause, if you go to the beta opting for the game, you can set the game to an older patch, 1.3 to be exact, which is before any of the unnecessary changes took place. So while yes, the update made the game far...far worse. I say EE is still the more stable version of the game as it stands for newer hardware and I'm happy to say that yes, you can infact, avoid that atrocious and unneeded update. If you still want to give them money or not is up to you, I honestly say they don't deserve it but the game itself is still worth it.\n\nJust so people stop freaking out as if there is no way to change everything back, I hope this helps some of you that planned on buying the game and were put off or people who already bought the game and were pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nAlthough I will say the Multiplayer side of the game is pretty buggy, for both this and the second game. Not really sure why, but the connecting players tend to crash when loading new zones.

Including both the base game and the TotSC expansion pack, it also added some new super cool NPC-s and over 812963529 fixes blah blah blah...\nDo yourself a favor, fellow RPG fan, and disregard Beamdog's self praises. This game offers NOTHING over the original game. 3 new companions - 2 completely unneeded and one hilaiously overpowered but just as unneeded, who the fk needs a monk in a lowlevel adventure, same for a wildmage when you have a specialist mage anyway - all with their own questlines which are so excit.... sorry fell asleep from the excitement. As for the 400 improvements/fixes/whatevers, I couldn't point out one, with the exception of adding higher resolution to the game (which you could achieve with a mod in 30 secs anyway).\nCharacters still bump into each other the turn back.\nCharacters still get stuck in each other/chairs/any imaginable obstacle that could be circumvented in 0.5 seconds.\nCharacters still pause momentarity EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TIME you issue a new order.\nCharacters still get lost and confused carrying out complex orders like: go down a hallway, go around a corner, go down the cliff and not just stand in the cliffside, etc. Pathfinding's as awful as ever.\nCharacters still rather just rush into battle with fists instead of switching to another batch of projectiles in their quiver...\nDice rolls are still hilaiously rigged (don't get me wrong, the game's fun and all but having my characters roll 2-1-1-3-6-2 without end while enemies roll 20-16-20-17-19 literally all game can be annoying, not to mention HP rolls).\nAnd add to this list any other minor/major inconvenience the original had... Enhanced right? Nope. But at least there's a potion bag now, and some (totally irrelevant) BG2 spells.\n\nIN SHORT: if you're an RPG enhusiast, but never played Baldur's Gate before, go for it. If you have hundreds of hours in other editions of BG like myself (originals on disks, GoG edition whatever) just pass, unless you want to play BG2 with a friend.\n\nBecause let's be honest here: why would anyone play BG1 for itself... It's just the ability point grab/xp farm for BG2, a game wastly superior in every aspect. And hopefully a game that has actually been enhanced, not like this.\n\nYou disappoint me Beamdong.\n","November 12, 2015","false","47.3"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","15","31","2","2"

The game still to this day holds up pretty well and the EE version do add on more content. I myself do not hold it in the highest regard but the monk they added is probably the best written out of them all while the Black Pits is fun to test builds or parties in but nothing extremely "must be played" since it is only an arena campaign not tied to the storyline of the Bhaalspawn.\n\nWhat you get it what you buy, an enchanced version of the original game with a bit more content and some mod fixes glued on to it.\n\nThe writing can be a bit "Ham" at times, cheesy and such but people praise it for being very "funny" and "realistic" since it is the kind of thing you would hear around a table in pen and paper. I would prefer a more dark and "real" tone myself but I can see why it is found funny by old wolves who enjoyed pen and paper campaigns in and around the Sword Coast. The main story is not bad either. Sarevok is a iconic villian much like Jon Irenicus in game two. The game also lack a lot of "CnC", choices and consequences and it do not really give much of options for you beside being a goody good guy, a "I don't care but I do it anyway" neutral person and an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the part , where all three lead to the same D turnabout no matter if you pick option A, B or C before hand. But it do not effect much in the end, but I think atleast it could given us more options. Mostly you are portrayed to be the good side countering the evil side. Not to spoil anything but you are more or less bound to be the good person and playing evil will render you not getting all rewards or losing reputation like mad. Which is a pretty bad thing to lose.\n\nBut the big big big but now is Siege of Dragonspear. It is tucked in a bit like someones fan fiction mod inbetween the two Baldurs Gate games and the ending chapter expansio nof Throne of Bhaal. Pretty much out of nowhere and it do not really fit. Some hate it for the writing, some hate it for being a cash cow, others find it to filled with shoe horned social justice things and other political agends, which I partially agree with. On the other hand I did not find the writing in retrospect to be so bombastic and excellent as people said it been before and I think I seen one or two well hidden, but non the less social justicy comentaries in the main game but so sublte and small they are barely noticeable. But beside that cocky commentary from some writers, the forced and poorly written SJW I found it atleast some what appealing to play, it was intriguing enough to pull me through it in about a weeks time.\n\nBut what I did not like was the similar event of no consequences or even worse, not really any options and the forced ending was not that good. Beside that, it is really hard to consider this canon and then look at BG2 where no one even mentions the Shining Lady ever or her crusade. Caelar Argent as the villian, a GOOD villian or anti-hero antagonist was to me very interesting but could been developed much more. I won't spoil it but I hope to hear more about her. A villian not hell bent on destroying the world, conquering it for doing bad or simply put being a lunatic chaotic evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was refreshing.\n\nSo some things been hits in the  Dragonspear expansion and Baldurs Gate at the core is still a cheesy at times but good RPG game. But there also been some misses in Dragonspear and people complain of the bugs. I had NPCs disappear so I could not recruit them. I might have managed to kill them by mistake, by pulling trolls to the camp but I did not notice that either way until I was looking for them in camp and they where nowhere. A bit more freedom and options, perhaps if they had made Dragonspear into a spin off, another branch in the Saga, a what if Irenicus never happended, it would been nice. But such is life.\n\n6.5-7 I think is a decent grade if we do not inflate it like most gaming medias do today, maybe even 7,5 considering that Baldurs Gate was a great game on release, and one of few good RPGs in its time beside Fallout as far as I know. Atleast one of those games who push the genre on for a while longer. A proper 9 out of 10 back then. But a 7 is still well above average and that is not bad, beside that Beamdog is not perfect and done some weird things so 6.5-7 is fiting.","April 20","true","73.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

There are many Quests that I wish that would be deeper, the story behind them is kind of flat. But, the story of the city of Baldur's Gate, the main pltoline and how it develops is really amazing. There's a huge variety of characters that can join your party, from the Devil to God himself, and even the new ones that were added are very interesting, along with the new quests that involve them. The gameplay itself is very different from modern RPGs, but it is completely playable nowadays. The strategic aspect of the combat is very good and when you manage to master a combat situation it is a very satisfying feeling. It also has a few minor additions as new character portraits, revisited cutscenes and some tweaks to the overall looks of the game.","March 22, 2014","true","62.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","3"

There's not a lot ot say about this franchise that hasn't already been said. Simply put, this series is one of the best examples of when western rpgs finally started to truly compete and surpass jrpgs. If you are under the age of 30, love rpgs, and are interested in seeing the history of video games preserved you simply MUST give this game a chance. It's not perfect, but it does so many things right for the genre it's a crime that there are people going into game design who have never played it.\n\nPros:\n\n-Minsc, you'll understand when you play the game\n-Fun story to play through with voice talent ranging from fantastic to meh\n-New content, classes, party members, etc. over the original game add TONS of replayability\n-If people support projects like this more and more developers might be willing to go back and restore their old games to make them available for the modern audience\n\nCons:\n\n-Graphical barrier to entry might be a little high for some but the art design is good enough you can overcome that (You whipper snappers and your photo realistic graphics! In my day you had to make due with only one pixel and you liked it!)\n-Combat is a little dated and it's not always obvious what decisions you make are really changing things (a lot of stuff goes on under the hood as it were for better or worse)\n-Minsc can die forever if you aren't careful","September 7, 2015","true","27.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","3","7","3","0"

The enhanced edition implements numerous additional elements to the game, the most notable being higher resolution, class kits from Baldur's Gate II as well as a few new ones, three new characters, and a few new areas and quests. The fine-tuning effectively improves aspects of the game while still retaining the authenticity and nostalgia of the original. With that said, I do not believe this is a "must-have" for all the Baldur's Gate fans out there. If you still possess and are capable of playing on the original discs, I would say you are perfectly well-off. The enhanced edition is nice but not exactly neccesary. Get it only if your curiousity is insatiable. On the other hand, if you no longer have access to your old discs and possess an inkling to indulge your nostalgia as the case was with me, then I HIGHLY recommend acquiring this game.\n\nAs for those who have never played Baldur's Gate, I strongly encourage you to add it to your arsenal and give it a shot. The gameplay is naturally dated, but it is a classic and still critically acclaimed role-playing game that can offer a truly enjoyable challenge and its own charming humor.

It is a nice worldly balance of good and evil, allowing for many different players of many different styles to play this game and be left satisfied with the end results. Having the ability to choose your path and your moral stance seems to do well in this game; since the world in itself tends to be as I said: balanced. The range of quests offer decent reward and the game's challenge is nice. The game plot wise is interesting and starts to develop and grow more as you play, which I must say is a great way for a game's plot to go.\n\nWhile I am not particularly a big fan of the E2's THAC0 system, if you set up your character and companions with the right skills and are resourceful in using them, this game won't be a constant "miss, miss, miss, critical miss." If people don't like THAC0 or DND's sometimes unpredictable conclusions (in terms of fighting, etc); then you might not like it.

Now correct me on this if I am wrong, but I was unable to find a way to maintain my party's formation, thus when I tell them to move it seems like they don't stick together, and whoever makes it first will likely be the first target from a enemy encounter.

The sound effects are as old as the game, but they are not bad to begin with. The only issues I have with audio is that some magical spells are particularly too loud; such as the spider web trap or the thorn spells; they make lots of noise at a higher volume than you are used to. The inventory management is still the way it was  from the first release in 1998, where you can't have other members pick up gear if your current member is full.

Some reading is still recommended as advanced features such as dual- and multiclassing (and how they are related, their pros and cons) is still poorly explained which is actually kind of dangerous as the game is over when the main character dies, and how easy you die depend on hitpoints and other values which are increased as you level... you see where this is going.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fablewynd/recommended/228280/","Fablewynd","Fablewynd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fablewynd/","117 products in account","The first instalment of the Baldur’s Gate series is the perfect introduction to what would become one of the most beloved benchmarks in RPGs; combining a compelling story, ample exploration opportunity, and tactical combat, all blended together in a well-established setting.\n\nBaldur’s Gate is the beginning of a journey that will consume countless hours of your time. You begin, as any good fantasy story begins, as a hapless youth who must journey out alone, thrust into a world they’ve never before seen. Along the way you’ll gather your fellowship of companions who’ll support you and provide commentary and banter on your actions and choices (though, this is more prevalent in the game’s sequel, Baldur’s Gate II). Whilst there is a storyline to play out, you’re never truly forced down a linear path towards it; there’s plenty of opportunity to go off the beaten track and explore the verdant countryside, or dreary dungeons. Cap it off with menacing villain and you’ve got an idea of what makes Baldur’s Gate special.\n\nBaldur’s Gate isn’t for everyone, however, and that’s a given. In a world where you have your photo-realistic, fast paced Skyrim, and Witcher 2, Baldur’s Gate may feel like a step back, and that’s understandable – when you look at Baldur’s Gate it does look slightly dated in terms of graphics, and not everything is voice acted (as everything tends to be these days,) but those shouldn’t be reasons to turn away from what is, in my opinion, a very special RPG experience. The graphics may be slightly dated, but they do hold up well even today. Their very particular aesthetic ensures that it is still a very playable game, and the Enhanced Edition’s UI overhaul allows for best navigation for the player. When you compare it to games like Dungeon Siege, or Neverwinter Nights, who opted for a 3D graphical engine, the game looks beautiful and timeless.\n\nIf you’re playing an RPG for its graphics you’re not doing it right, though. What will draw you in is the dialogue and storytelling. The game really set the precedent for what a good RPG should include in terms of story. Admittedly it does use a tried and tested narrative structure (inexperienced adventurer sets off from the homely home, whilst being pursued by an unknown enemy, gathering friends along the way to help take down this evil), but it doesn’t feel overly cliché. The well written dialogue feels like a novel some times, in terms of the quality and sheer amount, which will strike a chord with some players, but understandable put others off; there is a hefty amount of reading to do, when compared to the minimalist approach of modern RPGs. Personally, I find a great chunk of dialogue compelling, but I can see why it would be off-putting.\n\nIn terms of what the Enhanced Edition actually adds, there are quite a few new features and many more fixes for old bugs that will never get officially patched out in the original games. Firstly, three new NPCs are added in to the mix, each giving a new personality and set of skills to help you in your adventure. The NPCs are fairly well written, and voiced, but I do think that they don’t blend seamlessly in to the catalogue of NPCs for Baldur’s Gate. They aren’t terrible, by any means, but they are noticeable. One of the more important changes is the UI, which really helps to modernise the title as best it can. It is possible to mod the original game in order to make it widescreen, and give it Baldur’s Gate II’s UI, but if you’re not familiar with the way modding working in the Infinity Engine it can be a little daunting and a little tricky. Overhaul did a good job making a working UI that feels like it belongs in the game. The seldom praised aspect that the Enhanced Edition brings is numerous bug fixes. Baldur’s Gate is over a decade old, and is no longer maintained by its developers, and as such it has built up a number of bugs on modern hardware. What the EE aimed to do was squash as many bugs as possible, and make it compatible with as many computers as possible. It has succeeded in that respect, however it has introduced a few new bugs of its own in the process, so be aware of that. The developers are still working on patches for the game, so don’t fret too much, but do be aware of this fact. Other than this, there’s a fairly decent arena style campaign to play through, for those who enjoy the tactical combat Baldur’s Gate employs.\n\nA few final things to note in terms of what the game offers are the rule system and general gameplay. Baldur’s Gate uses 2nd Edition rules of Dungeons and Dragons, which for all its praise can be overly complicated at times. Those unfamiliar with D&D rules may find themselves totally bewildered by terms like ‘THAC0’, and ‘saving throws’ but if you do a little research it can be understood. The rule system is one of the main components that puts people off the game initially, but with a little perseverance you’ll be able to play the game without needing to know every little rule mechanic. The pathfinding in the game will also have players feeling the age of the game, as it is very basic and very frustrating. You’ll find characters taking the sub-optimal route when issuing them to move through a corridor, or a street, which can get pretty tiresome after a few hours of babysitting your party; be warned.\n\nAll in all, Baldur’s Gate is one of those games that I feel should be given a try, even if you’re apprehensive. Of all the series, Baldur’s Gate II is (in my opinion, and many others’) the superior game, and so don’t let Baldur’s Gate put you over getting the sequel, as BG2 improves upon many of the first game’s shortcomings.

Lots of fun characters and NPC's with odd things to say or have you do. Graphics aren't bad for such an old game either, it even changes armor pieces when you switch gear, more then I can say for other newer rpg games than this. For me save and reload alot is though crucial to maintain my enjoyment to the game since one or more of my characters always wants to die in one way or another.\n\nGreat story\nFun world and lots to explore, lots of houses\nClassic that I should've given a real chance back in the days.\nWorth every penny! now I need a rest from heavy RPG before purchasing BG2: EE","December 9, 2013","true","45.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Baldurs Gate is the entry drug for Dungeons & Dragons. It has a somewhat steep learning curve which has been somewhat flattened in this edition as tutorials has been added and the interface as seen significant improvements - now you can actually infer stuff from the information you are presented instead of just being able to find information you know 'ought to be here somewhere...'. Some reading is still recommended as advanced features such as dual- and multiclassing (and how they are related, their pros and cons) is still poorly explained which is actually kind of dangerous as the game is over when the main character dies, and how easy you die depend on hitpoints and other values which are increased as you level... you see where this is going. But once you get past the character creation you will be treated to one of the best low-level D&D campaigns in a computer game.\n\nAn extra plus for this being one of the few games where archers are neither incredibly bad or a manifestation of micromanagement hell.","November 26, 2013","true","35.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

(when played with TuTu mod and BG2 with extended ending and Edwin romance) However, the achievements kind of ruined it for me...  WAAAY WAAAY too many achievements, they're OVER 9,000!!!  (129)\nSeriously... WHY DO I GET AN ACHIEVEMENT FOR KILLING THIS GAME'S VERSION OF JAR JAR BINKS!?!? (Noober in Dragonspear)\nAlso, at least 3 achievements are still glitched and unobtainable...\n\nI do recommend this game, but only barely... it is a pale, sickly shadow of what it once was!  Maybe some of that is nostalgia talking, but not all of it!  Not by a long shot...\n\nHere's the list of pros and cons as I see it currently (6 pros, 8 cons):\n\nPros:\n1. game 1 of possibly the best D&D-style videogame series of all time!\n2. Explore the Forgotten Realms, and discover if you have the skills to beat Drizzt Do'Urden!\n3. Achievements (sort of, at least they exist)\n4. Plenty of mods everywhere on the web with more content! (best content is for Baldur's Gate 2 tho)\n5. EE Keeper exists, to help speed up otherwise useless achievement runs and generally help you to not have to replay the whole game if you forgot to grab the pantaloons waaaay back in BG 1...   T_T\n6. Siege of Dragonspear DLC, finally an answer to what happened between BG 1 and BG 2!\n\nCons:\n1. It lacks trading cards...\n2. it's 2e D&D, or rather their own version of 2e D&D... bleh\n3. Achievements:  WAAAY too many... an achievement to kill that annoyance, Noober?  REALLY?\n4. Achievements: They lumped Siege of Dragonspear's cheevo's in with BG1's cheevos... which is why there's 129 of them... only 61 in vanilla BG1!  (only, ya right...)\n5. Achievements:  Currently, 3 achievements are bugged and unachievable (as of 2.2):\nIn The Name of the Father (tell priestess of bhaal to murder and whatnot after freeing her),\nYou Chose Poorly (bet a party member's soul on a riddle match and lose), and\nGrim Deeds to Come (get ambushed outside of Baldur's Gate after sneaking out [pretty much the "beating Dragonspear" achievement])\nYep, have fun with an imcomplete 126/129 on the game, until Beamdog eventually gets around to fixing it!\n6. This game is old... like really old!  Seriously, this game is ancient!  It was released in 1998! (not really a con, but throwing it in there, some people might care... not really that old either, but it is compared to what's out now.)\n7. EE Keeper exists (yes, I know it's also in the pros, but cheaters will abuse this, making it hard to feel accomplished when bragging about beating Insane Difficulty)\n8. In the same vein as #7, the Command Console comes automatically fully enabled, and is ridiculously simple and easy to use... legit players of this game will cry tears as the cheaters abuse these 2 things thoroughly!","June 4","true","62.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

These two RPGs are simply the pillar of western production of this genre, and when the two are combined in a single game they definitively are among the top 10 of the must-play for every PC gamer out there, no matter the age.\n\nBG:EE and BG2:EE are simply THE definitive Dungeons & Dragons experience, including almost all the possible 2.5 Edition Core and several optional rulebooks of the Forgotten Realms setting and translating them into a marvellous duo of 3rd person games.\n\nAlthough both games are very old (they were developed and published between 1998 and 2001 by Bioware / Black Isle Studios), they have been “enhanced” and made available on modern systems (including Windows 7/8/10 PCs, OSx, Android and IOS) by the guys at Overhaul Games / Beamdog, who not only re-tooled the original Infinity Engine to make it run on modern platforms, but also added several other goodies that were not present in the original release, in addition to bug fixes and standard “curator” jobs.\nI could go on for pages and pages describing in detail the marvels of the Baldur’s Gate Series, but I’ll try to cut it short and stick to a much shorter format.\n\nPROs\n- Ever dreamed of taking your typical AD&D session with your friends out of the pen & paper setting to a PC screen? This game is for you!\n- Charismatic characters and companions: Minsc the Ranger (and Boo!), Jaheira, Viconia, Xzar, Sarevok… what else can I say?\n- Longevity: both games combined are well over 100 hours of gameplay\n- Replayability: seriously, there are hundreds of possible combinations of classes / races / kits / alignments / companions / choices to completely change your experience at every playthrough\n- Every action you make affects the game world, like it is expected from a proper Western RPG. Apart from some scripted events to progress with the main story, the rest is up to you\n- Multiplayer: join with 5 friends to create a fully custom party!\n- The (new) developers are supporting the game with patches and fixes, and they actually listen to the community\n- Compatible with most of the original BG / BG2 community mods\n- Runs on every system, even your mobile phone / tablet (NOTE: the Android / IOs versions are separate purchases). HW requirements are very low\n\nCONs\n- After more than 16 years from my first BG playthrough I still cannot find a single flaw in any of these games. They are simply a masterpiece.\n\nIn a nutshell, these games set THE standard all the following RPGs on the market were measured against, and none of them was able to surpass Baldur’s Gate until now.\n\nBuy them, play them, enjoy them. 12/10, would pickpocket Drizzt again","January 5, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you've never played it, it's worth whatever the price is. The only thing I didn't see mentioned in other helpful reviews is the fact that you are given complete freedom upon leaving the starting area. This game was truly 'Open World' long before that was ever a thing.\n\nAny quality issues you might have because of the age of this title, such as graphics, are easily overshadowed by the brilliant writing, open-ended gameplay, and the level of completeness and care that was originally put into this game.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition is a welcome improvement. It launched for me first try with no issues on Win7x64/AMD 8-Core. If all it did was run the game and provide modern display resolutions, it would be a great success.\n\nVisual enhancements and more options to tweak gameplay are also included. These are icing on the above-descibed cake. Documentation on some of these features is lacking, but it looks like Beamdog is in it for the long haul.\n\nOther enhancements make the game more like BG2, adding subclasses, dual wield, extra weapon types, mechanics tweaks, NPCs, etc. By any measure these things are an improvement, BUT I have mixed feelings about it since I love the original, with all its limitations. In a way, BG2 is less good now.\n\nIn summary a great rerelease of an epic game. Bugs (new ones) are barely worth mentioning & since this was clearly a project by someone who loves the game I have no doubt that they will be eradicated.\n\nNo good reason not to buy this game. :)\n\nThanks and congrats to Beamdog.

One of the most ultimate Roleplaying experiences of all times.\n\nWell, if you allready own and played the original Baldur's Gate and the Tales of the Sword Cost Add-On, there is not much to tell.

There isn't much enhanced graphics-wise, but there are new items brought in from Baldur's Gate 2, which makes this game more playable and slightly easier. The addition of four new team members was nice, all of them are equally well written and fun to get to know, especially Neera ^^. Somehow, not sure if it was because of this Enhanced Edition, but there were some glitches here and there, blocking me from certain areas or quests. The final fight glitched up too, where the main boss just died when I came in to the room (scaredy cat :P)\nCertainly recommended if only for the cast of characters, great graphical overworld and well-arranged music tracks.

Seeing old friends I grew up with in a new light is a very fun experience. I will say for a playthrough it's okay. The story is like a classic adventure. A bad guy killed someone close to you and you need to stop him. End of story. Most of the screens are just forest with a few bad guys here and there getting into senseless fights. The main parts of the game come from a few sections on the map. For the game itself, in single player, it's fine.\n\nEnhanced Edition: There are tons of problems/glitches found throughout the game that EE offers to the table. The most dissapointing part of Enhanced Edition is the lack of being able to export the golden pantaloons into BG2:SoA:EE, WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE.

That was a long time ago, when there was no enhanced edition and it only ran in ridiculously low resoloutions (what do you expect, it was an early 90's game).\n\nAfter the Enhanced Edition came out, I loved it! I suppose I always enjoyed the fundamental elements of it, but now that it's un-glitched, and with better resoloutions I can't get enough of it.\n\nBG is set in the forgotten Realms, but it does a good job of appealing to people who aren't fimiliar with FR. You play as an orphan who must set out to figure out why you father was murdered, who did it, what connection it has to an iron shortage, and why assassins are after you as well. Its a top-down isometric RPG where you can control your own custom character and up to 5 other characters. This all done in a Dungeons and Dragons style with 2nd edition rules.\n\nThere are compelling characters that feel real, a lush and vibrant world full of lore, and a plot that is as complex as it is interesting. I would find it hard to believe that someone would be unable to fell immersed and intrigued by this game.\n\nMy one criticism is that combat is brutal, even on lower difficulties. This is because you start from first level and can only get as high as ninth level during the course of the game. It is somewhat frustrating, but it evens out a quarter of the way through or so. Slogging through it is definately worth it for the later payoff, though. And if you're skilled enough, it isn't even that bad. Some would argue that the difficulty is a good thing. This isn't a game that hold you by the hand, or expects you to be stupid. No, it is intelligent and mature.\n\nI only played the vanilla version of BG once, so I'm not an expert on the differences between regular and Enhanced. I think that with 3 extra companions, each with their own personal missions, and the Black Pits game mode, the price is worth it. As far as I know, nothing was deleted or changed that might make fans of the classic version angry. In fact, I think the 3 new companions are even MORE interesting and well-written than the vanilla ones. It's also hard to argue when hundreds of lines of dialouge that were previously silent are now voice acted.\n\nBG1 is a classic. It easily fits into my list of top 10 best games ever. If you never played BG, this is your chance. If you did play it, but aren't sure if EE is worth it, let me tell you that it is.","May 29, 2014","true","176.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its the type of nostalgia where I'm like "Why was I was so stupid and why did I give up so easily and didn't pay attention to game mechanics and why did I  just brute force this" I wanted this to be my cup of tea when I was a kid because it looked like a really good game, anyway that aside what do I think?\n\nI think this game has aged really well, if you like RPGs or D&D and you want to try this, its a classic, but its a classic that requires a lot of patience. It brings  realism to the table, you wouldn't just go into a dungeon and throw your life away like nothing and just charge like a berserker at any danger you saw, you need to take a lot of things into consideration and this game does that, it makes you think, constantly, its definetly not an easy game, and it definetly does not hold your hand. You learn a lot as you play, if and only if you are observant of the mechanics, I didn't do the tutorial though cause I didn't think I needed it, but I could see how it would be very helpfull\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nThis game has aged well and the remasterring did a few touch ups, made a few things look more modern and pleasing to the eye, the only reason I am not giving this a 10 is because dat pixelation when you zoom in, the resolution could have been touched up a bit\n\nSound: 7/10\nI like the soundtrack of this game a lot and it like almost everything else in this game(key word almost) has aged quite well.... except for the hillariously bad playable character voiceovers that get old in 5 minutes tops, some of them are good though, NPCs are pretty good and have also aged well\nand they also added some new stuff\n\nMultiplayer: haven't tried yet cause I want to learn the game and play the main story first/10\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nLike I said this game has aged very well it just requires a lot of patience, pausing, planning and good ol' trial and error, its not everyones cup of tea but it can grow on you if you give it a chance\n\nFinal verdict\nIf you want a game that will give you hours and hours of gameplay  and have the patience of a saint   I say give it a go\nbut if you want something easy then this is not the game for you","February 2, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Far ahead of it's time, extremely complex and deep, great combat, and a lot of interesting 'history' to their world. In 2013, it feels eclipsed by more polished, faster paced, and better graphics games. The unforgiving difficulty forces you to replay a lot for seemingly random reasons. Also, it's size makes exploring a bit of a chore at times, and the number of quests with no real clue as to where to find them makes questing almost tedious. I actually completely forget I have quests sometimes and sometimes spend so much time on side quests I forget what was happening in the main story. Overhaul Games has done a great job of porting and upgrading the game. All the changes are subtle but valuable. I would just suggest waiting for it to be on sale. $20 feels a little steep for a 15 year old game.","December 9, 2013","true","46.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The Baldur's Gate franchise hinges on the story being based on the specific era where Nobles, peasants, commoners, elves, drow, orcs, ogres and all other manner of creatures of varying strengths and abilities existed. Brilliant story and brilliant gameplay indeed.\n\nYou start off in a place known as Candlekeep (your hometown) raised by your foster father Gorian and at some point he becomes increasingly concerned that you're in danger, so he urges you to leave candlekeep with him in the hopes that you'll be safer and shortly after leaving Candlekeep, Gorian and you are ambushed by a gang of thugs and Gorian fends them off himself so you can escape, sacrificing himself in the process. From then on, the story can unfold in quite a few ways depending on what you decide to do next after that.\n\nKnow that you not only have the option to complete this game solo, but you also have the option of completing it with friends and/or other party members which you can also choose to have come on your journey with you.\nIf you're feeling super hardcore and are also brave enough to meet any challenge with your super over-levelled protagonist character/ created party members, you can also try to complete this game on its hardest and newest difficulty "Legacy of Bhaal", but know that you will not be able to change your preferred difficulty if you chose LoB difficulty at the start of your session.\n\nI personally enjoy the thrill of being able to enter into battle wondering if I have enough weapons and armour attributes to survive the encounter. Having certain characters (or possibly other friends involved) as party members are also a great help.\nWhen I do end up surviving said battle, my created character gains varying amounts of experience and sometimes upgrades, but when I don't, I either attempt to find other avenues of defeating that which had defeated me the first time or if I've exhausted all options, then I attempt to avoid having to fight it if I can.\n\nAnother thing I enjoy about this game also, are the varying "relationship" dialogues that can happen between a created character and a certain opposite gender party member.\n\nOnly thing that has frustrated me about this game series off-hand, is that whenever a party member wants to go on a specific quest and you chose to let him/her into the party, but after a while when he/she realizes that your party is either "too good/bad" for him/her, he/she abruptly leaves the party and never returns, thus that quest that you originally accepted regarding that party member that abruptly left, remains permenantly unfinished for the rest of the game.\n\nOther than that, this is quite a great game and a great introduction into the epic baldur's gate franchise.

The Baldur's Gate experience now 'enhanced' with added companions and quests, classes, weapons/weapon specialisations and too many other knick knacks to mention.\n\nFor some people this is a welcome thing, for purists though maybe not so much.\n\nI first played Baldur's Gate a year or so after it's original release (1998) and was overwhelmed by the freedom of exploration and depth that was on offer.  Thats not to say the original was an overly complex game but it certainly requires an attention span to understand the second edition D&D rules and how the stats play with your character and companions you may acquire on the way.\n\nThis edition takes the original and augments it with some of the features I mentioned above but also changes some things which I feel are for the worse such as the cutscenes and some useless companions, but these are minor quibbles.  The combat is just as satisfying, the story just as good (yes I liked it, despite criticism from others) and Minsc's dialogue will never get old.\n\nFor purists I recommend NOT purchasing this.  Heading over to a certain site that specialises in games that are old and good to purchase the original and then installing the various mods that improve the base game and having a blast that way is the way to go.\n\nFor everyone else who wants the new and (arguably) improved Baldur's Gate experience then this is the purchase for you.\n\nIn short - the good:\n\n*Compelling story\n*Interesting companions\n*Satisfying gameplay and dialogue\n*Sense of wonder and exploration is still there\n*Now playable across different operating systems\n\nThe bad:\n*Some new additions lacking and not so fun\n*New cutscenes aren’t so great\n\nThe ugly:\n*NO CLOUD SAVE - WHY CAN’T YOU DO THIS.  This can be bypassed with dropbox but if you’re going to allow the saves to work across several devices and operating systems then this should really be there.  Beamdog have stated that save games for EE are compatible across OSX/Windows so it makes no sense not to enable it at least for steam users.","January 4","true","104.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This will raise the bar for storytelling you may not like newer games or find them boring or simple after playing Baldur's Gate.\n\nBaldur's Gate has aged graphics and uses the ancient 2nd Edition Dungeons&Dragons rule system so beware, you may get killed in your first hours easily. If you are new to computer games (or  less then 5 years in RPG ) this is not your typical diffuculty setting here.\n\nWell if you take heed on the warning and prepared yourself , you may start one of the most epic stories ever told in a cRPG ever, so excellent story here. When you finished the game , it will be like reading 2-3 books of good RPG novels what's more, thats your story as you had chosen.\n\nAlthough main quest is linear there are many paths you can choose. Every different character you created and every different party you set up changes the way you play. Item and spell diversity is nice. There are no game breaking bugs. Game is still mod capable if you want more content. Keep in mind story continues to new upcoming Siege of Dragonspear and onto Baldur's Gate II. You can import your saves to them which will affect many quests depending on your choices here.\n\nA must buy for any RPG player.\n","December 28, 2015","true","142.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So, we tried to play the multiplayer, which was ridiculously broken. it took us 2 hours to finally get into the game, having to spent 20 minutes rerolling stats because we would get kicked from the session, or the game would crash. So, if you were looking forward or wanting to play this game with your friends, don't bother getting it. It was, however, awesome the one time we got it to work, I just wish they would patch the game and fix the bug riddled multiplayer. However, the single player campaign and the Black Pits worked well, and I was glad I could play my old game without swapping discs in between every fast travel. The game really ins't that different, and we found ourselves and I found out personally, that the new characters weren't anything special, and the environments looked good, but not that big of a change. I would recomend this game to any fans of the series, but stay away from the multiplayer. 5/9 hours I've played was sitting in lobbies and character creation arbitration sceens, waiting for the game to work.","November 20, 2015","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Party members will die or leave you, assassins lurk around every tavern waiting for your arrival. I finally made it to Baldur's Gate and I still don't know fully what I'm even doing, but my followers and I stopped dying and started killing. You can spend an hour alone in character customization...and it has nothing to do with appearance there's just sooo many classes and choices. 10/10 Looking forward to the expansion that bridges the gap between 1&2 before I proceed with the series, also excited to play Icewind Dale, as I hear that's more dungeon crawling and looting than expansive story. The combat, once you get past the ummmm....lack of visual excitement...is actually really ♥♥♥♥ing exciting. Can't stress this enough, again 10/10 if you haven't played it, there's a reason it's still highly regarded as "The RPG"","October 3, 2015","true","18.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/legendary725/recommended/228280/","legendary725","ny_giants45","http://steamcommunity.com/id/legendary725/","11 products in account","No nostalgia here, my first playthrough was in 2015. While the DnD mechanics and interface take a bit getting used to; the game holds up very well. Deep character builds, interesting quests, even the graphics manage to hold up considering the games age. The combat takes some time getting used to but after getting a few levels some of the fights are really deep and entertaining. The black pits addon was really nice in letting you create your own party and really experiment with different builds, combinations, and participating in different fights.\n\nMy only complaint is that now I'm 10 hours into Baldurs Gate 2 and I see some problems with BG1. BG1 just feels like a setup for Baldurs Gate 2 and it lacks the deep character interaction that Baldurs Gate 2 has. In BG1 you meet many companions that seem like they could be interesting, but they are mute for the entire game. Luckily the Enhanced Edition characters have quests and dialogue that adds some flavor to the game. I found Dorn and Neera to be much more endearing than any of the vanilla NPCs.\n\nThe mainplot in BG1 feels a bit barebones and just serving as laying the groundwork for the sequel.  The game began to drag on a bit towards the end but that could be just my eagerness to start the second game. The late game dungeons like Durlags tower were not too enjoyable for me. Hundreds of traps everywhere with really obscure puzzles to solve. It seemed every lategame area was just traps everywhere with tougher mobs. I didn't find them too interesting. I actually enjoyed the earlier dungeons much more.\n\nOverall though I can see how this game was a milestone for it's time and it still holds up today as an amazing RPG. Playing through the saga right now is a great experience in 2015 even with no nostalgia. While I am finding Baldurs Gate 2 to be far superior in every way, I think for a new player playing the first one and getting a feel for the game/the background story is a great idea. It was hard enough managing my level 3 mages as a BG noob, I couldn't imagine diving right into Baldurs Gate 2 and being bombarded with 20 spells to memorize.\n\n8.5/10","October 7, 2015","true","81.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The flexibility found in this game even surpasses some of it's succesors in many ways (For example, the ability to run into a city and kill everyone and take their stuff). Also, the usage of the AD&D 2 ruleset, a simple (but yet really effective for video games) makes the game easy to manage so that one does not have to spend 10-20 minutes going through the level up process. Better yet, this is an expanded edition of the base game, adding the amazing classes from the second game (And some new classes) as well as improvng the UI and graphics enough to make it look better yet not ruin the nostalgia involved in this game, made Beamdog's attempt to improve a classic succesful.

One that's so influential and genre defining, that it still stands the test of time. Although not nearly as well as it's successor. This game shows it's age not just visually, but in design in some very annoying areas. Mostly the difficulty. This game is hard, like hazardous to your mental health hard. I nearly had a mental breakdown a couple times in this game. While the story is still (mostly) excellent the gameplay can get seriously tedious and irritating at times. This game carries over some of the  "hard for the sake of hard" retro difficulty that used to characterize games of this era.\n\nYou'll walk into a room and have your entire party neutralized by a confusion spell before you even realized what happened. You'll walk into a trap you had no reason to believe was there after hours of play without even seeing one at all. You'll constantly loose a party member in seconds. You'll die over and over again because of incredibly awful pathing issues. You'll cast a spell only to have your party member get hit by an arrow from across the screen and loose that spell from your pool. You'll walk into fights over and over and over again that can only be conquered from careful preparation and near perfect formation, that irritatingly can only be figured out after experiencing the fight once.\n\nDragon Age Origins had a problem with huge difficulty spikes, but this? This is completely absurd. There is far too many fights in this game that feel like horribly unbalanced crapshoots. One of the ways this game adds difficulty is to put most of the hardest fights in the game in tiny, cramped rooms and just fill them to the brim with mages. Trying to stop multiple mages at once from casting confusion spells that will wipe out half of your party if it gets off is irritating, and it's even worse in tiny rooms. The pathing issues are amplified to maddening levels here as your entire party bumps and slams into each other while mages are busy roasting your party in seconds. Baldur's Gate 2 added confusion protection spells which was a godsend. Here? You have to just take it, and it's incredibly annoying.\n\nThere is A LOT of stuff you are going to have to put up with to enjoy this game. Save often, and be prepared to load saves often. This game will kill you repeatedly with no warning, you have to be willing to deal with that to enjoy this game at all.\n\nSo with that out of the way let's talk about how this is one of the best RPG's I've ever played (It actually is.) When things go right in this game, my god is it satisfying. Buffing up your entire party with stat boosts and conquering enormous bosses with tactics that only you could come up with, feels... it's just amazing.\n\nThe RPG mechanics and gameplay are just near perfect here, building a proper character and party is easy and fun to do.  The loot is incredibly rewarding to equip and is numerous and interesting. Exploration is very rewarding here, make sure to check every inch of every area, (especially in the beginning.) The interface is one of the best I've ever seen, 17 years later and it's still a joy to use. It's one of those games that achieves a near perfect synthesis of RPG mechanics, story and exploration that provide an experience that's impossibly immersive.\n\nAfter the 66 hours of infuriating and rewarding gameplay I can't help but say that I loved this game. I wanted to quit, multiple times during this playthrough. Especially in the middle section with the never ending Cloakwood Forest, but I stuck it out and really learned this game even when it killed me repeatedly with no warning. If you are willing to accept brutal and unforgiving challenge in reward for a wonderful story and immensely deep gameplay then this is the game for you. Not for the light of heart or the intellectually lazy, but absolutely worth the struggle if you can look past the retro difficulty.","July 14, 2015","true","65.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love Baldur's gate.\nThe enhanced edition is better graphically and mechanically, and it would be a lot easier for a newcomer to get into it and it's certainly worth giving it a try if you're a veteran of the series. Many of the 'fixes' are welcome, and the varied classes and spells make it much more playable.\nHOWEVER there are some horrible, horrible bugs. For example there is a limit on game speed (which makes combat feel fustratingly slow if you're used to setting it to 60 updates per second in the original) and the incomprehensible path search nodes (which mean your character cannot negotiate narrow corridors, and often defaults to taking 'the long way round').\nThe latter has caused me to prerpetrate a 'ragequit' when it repeatedly interfered with combat.","July 7, 2015","true","51.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

During the tutorial, I killed one of my companions..in the tutorial! Well that doesn't turn me off at all, in fact I like it. You have to proceed thoughtfully in this game. Just the kind of experience I was looking for. It plays similarly to knights of the old republic. You have to pause the action and decide how your party members are going to engage the enemy. This game seems to me to be one that can suck you in the more you play it. As your understanding grows, so does your interest.

This is where it all began. The very name is famous to gamers and non-gamers alike. It is known by people that never even played the game. And for those of us among its fan-base, it will forever be the beginning of a franchise that holds our hearts and imaginations. It is the apex of role-playing games. Its game mechanics are firmly set within the D&D rule book. The monsters, the races, the deities, and the world itself are all created from D&D. But I digress, on to the game itself!\n\nBaldur's Gate is NOT an easy game to play and it won't be for everyone. And depending on which class you choose, the game can be even more difficult and slow to start. You'll start out weak. A mere bear can kill you in 1 or 2 hits. You will be challenged at every turn. You will be frustrated and spit curses at your screen, possibly even throw your mouse at it in rage. There are dangers of invisible enemies, powerful monsters immune to magics or physical damage, traps, and curses that can and WILL kill you in the blink of an eye. You'll find yourself questioning every action you make. You'll press the "quick save" button so many times you'll worry that it might break from wear. Almost every game session will cause you to question why you started playing this damn game in the first place. But just when you're about to give up and delete the game files from your computer forever, something magical happens.\n\nYou become powerful. Your fellow party members become assets instead of burdens. Instead of finding ways to avoid danger, you start sprinting towards dungeons with gleams of glory in your eyes. Your fame begins to spread across the land like wildfire. NPCs that once mocked you now quake with fear in your presence. Bandits that once harassed you become little more than cannon fodder. And that's when you realize you've become a GOD among mortal men! You smile with each foe dispatched, wondering why they ever caused you such frustration in the first place. You will start missing the game as soon as you hit the "quit" button and long to begin your adventure again while you're away. That, my friends, is the glory that awaits you should you choose to brave the journey through Baldur's Gate.","June 26, 2015","true","74.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Set in the Forgotten Realms, Baldur's Gate uses the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. Despite the age of this game and the dated nature of the graphics it remains very playable with plenty of locations to expore and treasures to find. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPG games who is willing to forgive the rather dated graphics. I bought the game when it was on sale, given its age I don't think it is really worth the full RRP, more modern games like Dragon Age Origins and the Witcher 2 offer better value for money.","February 22, 2014","true","152.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really like how you can zoom in and out and I like how you can play kits without mods in this version.  I played as a Kensai in my playthrough which is a fighter kit that is focused on raw damage and it was really fun and seemed like a totally different game sometimes.\n\nPros:\n-More quests\n-More characters\n-Native support for HD resolutions\n-Zoom\n-BG2 kits and classes along with new ones\n-Many cutscenes are better\n-Removed or shortened pointless cutscenes (I think)/allows you to skip them too\n\nCons:\n-Costs more than original game\n-I didn't like the multicoloured character circles\n-Some cutscenes that were Important were shortened or worsened, more on this later\n-Some of the menu graphics were odd\n-The chat box would keep enlarging itself without going back\n-New voices mostly are unfitting, more on this\n\n\nOverall this was worth the money to me but for many it wont be because they dont mind dealing with the mods and lowere resolution.  The cutscenes experience is weird, for the most part I like it but some of them like the intro and end cutscenes left much to be desired.  The intro on the old game was already good enough, if they wanted it with better graphics they could have atleast did a better job on it especially if its supposed to tell part of the main story.  The end cutscene was even worse, without spoiling it basically even though I know how the end goes I could definatly imagine people getting even more confused than the original because the animation is so bad in the new one. About the voices, they are high quality and have poor voice acting so when you hear your new party member talk immediately before talking to an old NPC you can hear the obvious quality differences.  Also that new wild mage annoys me.\n","December 2, 2014","true","28.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Easily one of the top 3 RPG's I've ever played.  If you are into RPGs D&D you probably have already played it.\n\nHowever, for those that are unfamiliar, there is immense detail put into the story and world in this game--the Baldur's Gate series has one of the best stories. The enemies and fights can be challenging--mind racking sometimes--while you figure out what works and what doesn't. Who to deal with right away, and who is less threatening to your party. Save often.\n\nTest things out, what do spells do. Sometimes, I'd come across a spell that would have been really beneficial had I known about it earlier--or potions for the matter. I hoard mostly in these games, but learning how to effectively use what you're finding or buying can really sway a battle in your favor. Some battles become very easy, once you have a good strategy, appropriate gear and spells to cast.\n\nAlso, pre-read some tips about the new features, because they make the game a lot easier to play--quick loot. I played the 2nd in the series first, and I still had much enjoyment coming to the first 10+ years after. If you play them in order, you can import your character across games.\n\nSome may find it slow--your characters move slow. There can be a lot of reading, equipment management, exploring, adventuring, etc. This game is about planning and executing strategies through a well written world. Deciding who to help--quests--and what to skip. Warning a party mixed with evil and good aligned party members lead to disagreements. So it may be difficult to see the entire game, or every quest, first play through.\n\nIf you enjoy the game you've easily 50-100+ hours of gameplay to immerse yourself into, though there is a level cap--to keep you from power leveling and steam rolling the near end. The Black Pits expansion seems interesting, an arena challenge, 15 or so fights to test your skills in battle. Played it briefly, though honestly, I bought this for the main story and game.\n\nGreat game!","December 2, 2014","true","60.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's intimidating at first but the game will eventually grow on you. Beware action heroes this is a real-time point and click RPG, not a sword swinging, spell slinging killing game. Take this review from the perspective of a non DND player.\n\nGeneral information-\n\nStrong association to character, class and story (Alignments, Class restrictive to alignments, Characters take note of story events and alignments)\n\nCombat takes place with unseen dice rolls for hitting and damaging targets. Magic once used has charges (depending on the type of mage/wizard)\n\nEvery class seems to be resourceful and well thought out with a serious amount of balance for the first time player. (Thieves are extremely useful, as are mages/wizards. Detecting traps and uncovering magical items are what these classes can be used for)\n\n5 NPCs can be used in a party. (It's recommeded to actually have a party, this game isn't a cake walk without one. Alternatively 5 players can also be used if you can ever get a game going)\n\nItems and spells are locked to class restrictions so planning is a character is a useful way to succeed in your adventures!\n\nCareful planning before encounters are advised when going into unknown territory (Unlike some games where running through the front door would be the norm)\n\nSleeping in game is a option for recovery of spells and healing.\n\nBanter between player character/other characters is a welcome breeze for character delevopment and story telling. (I know it's a bioware game, shut up lol. This is normal I get it.)\n\nIMMERSION. Try to become the character if you will :3.\n\nAuto-saving frequently will save your keyboard from a Dark Souls/Skyrim wrath-like reaction.\n\nWhen characters in your party die they can be resurrected but will drop all items on the floor where they died.\n\nPositives and Negatives-\n\n+Some voiced lines but mostly text.\n+Played with the pause feature actually being a critical part of play.\n+The class system is what you would expect from a DND experience, maybe lack luster (Unmodded/hasn't played DND)\n+A strong focus on story telling. Although the second is where it get's beefy.\n+Extremely strong character roster, much better in the sequel but still worth a buy.\n+Not too flashy. Most games have extremely flashy fights and what not to make the game appear more dramatic than it is. This game just hits it right in the dot for me. It's more of a + than a negative really.\n\n-Poor multiplayer, what else needs to be said? I had a bad time connecting to people and keeping it stable. Probably just me but who knows.\n-While it has strong story telling the story is lacking in this edition, buy the second one and with mods you can play this version on the second BG2.\n-Old style graphics. Think like Rune Scape/Helbreath/Diablo 2/ Etc\n-Ran on my PC but might not for others, friends have told me concerns of the game being unable to run correctly, their spec's vary.\n\nTL:DR - DND simulator with a top down perspective and real time combat (With pause feature). Interesting story and characters. 7/10 a good buy if its your first game in the series, wait for a sale don't buy the game for $20, see GIF http://i.imgur.com/uBqtwws.gif","January 27, 2015","true","98.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For example, actual weather effects, along with persistent day night cycles. To the little easter eggs, you find just clicking on random grave stones.\nThe art style fits the game well. The gameplay is rock solid.\nThe story elements are very well done, and are fairly deep. There's everything from drama to comedic relief.\n\nFor any fan of RPGs, this game is highly recommended.\n\nFor anyone new to RPGs I doubly recommend it.\nFor any D&D player who still some how hasn't played it? What are you doing? GET IT NOW.\nFor anyone that enjoys great story telling get this game.\n\nThe game is based rougly on Second Edition D&D. It still holds up well today. Far better than games like Cryptic's sorry attempt at Neverwinter.\n\nSystem side note:\nHumans can Dual Class, which is essentially multiclassing but you can never pick up your old class to continue leveling in it once you start a new one. So keep that in mind when you're making your character. make sure you get everything you want or need out of your first class before moving on.\n\nAlso you might want to spend a while rolling up your stats. That way you will have a functional character. Ideally you should have at least 1 18, and your lowest otherwise should be a 10.","January 15, 2015","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you squint real hard, you can sort of see the similarity between this game and more recent fantasy RPGs like Dragon Age.  The idea of pausing the game to issue orders to your squad, then resuming action to see those orders carried out sort of started with Baldur's Gate.","November 27, 2013","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Enhanced Edition is mostly a costmetic facelist; for better or worse, the corse gameplay and all of its quirks are still in place.\nEven compared to modern RPGs however, Baldur's Gate still excels in incredible ways. The story, characters, and voice acting are still top notch. When reviewers say "in the spirit of Baldur's Gate" these are the things that come to mind- a dynamic party of 3-D characters and a world teeming with unique individuals. Many modern RPGs suffer from generic NPCs who only exist to keep the player trodding along the story; Baldur's Gate proves that wasn't a rule a decade ago, and it sure as hell isn't today.\n\nThe 2nd Edition D&D rules are...tricky at best. As with many older games, you'll need to sit down and read the manual and learn the system before you do anything else, or you'll have a lot of trouble determining which armors are better and why certain items don't work the right way all the time. That's easily the roughest learning curve of the game.\n\nBaldur's Gate defined a generation and set a standard that games are still measured by to this day...and its sequel is even /better/. So I suggest starting here, at simple level 1, work your way through a kick-♥♥♥ game, then graduate to the king of RPGs.","November 27, 2013","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It took many years and quite a few people to get me hooked on the dnd system so that I could eventually get to the point of being able to appreciate games such as this. Even in 2015, Baldur's Gate plays surprisingly well. I've never tried the original version to compare it to, but the enhanced edition has no issues whatsoever, and doesn't feel too dated in any way other than the 2nd edition dnd system in place.\n\nArguably the best part about the game is the new character additions. Neera, the Wild Mage, in particular makes the game a lot more enjoyable to play, especially for those who are hooked on the excellent Dragon Age but want to revisit the past. If she weren't written so well she might have seemed like a superfluous add-on, yet she is a delightful character and until I was made aware that she was a new addition to the enhanced version I simply thought she was one of the original cast and was just more developed than the others. Therein lies the enhanced edition's one potential problem. Neera does have a lot more dialogue with the main character than the others seem to, thus she stands out in comparison and makes the original characters seem wooden.\n\nIf you've been toying with the idea of playing Baldur's Gate for years, as I have, then now is the time to play it, and the enhanced edition is absolutely the way to go.","January 5, 2015","true","23.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is challenging, but it doesn't feel like the game cheats when you lose.\n\nCertain things aren't explained for the uninitiated, for instance, if you take your newly created wizard right to the front of the battle, they will probably die in seconds. Strategy in combat boils down to protecting your group members by placement and defensive spells, and carefully using the pause button to assess or adjust the situation.\n\nBaldur's Gate was based on an older rules version of D&D but this won't matter if you have played some newer version or none at all.

I was sceptical about the re-release enhanced edition but decided that since it was on sale I would give it a shot.\nI was not dissapointed.\nThe new interface, while more technical adds a bit more depth to decision making on equipment.\nThe steam-matchmaking system is incredible compared to the old multi-player, and the higher resolution helps with seeing combat without having the move the screen.\nLastly and most importantly it works. Without having to alter windows resolution, bit-colors, or not working simply because it was made for such and older system.\n10/10 for an amazing rog with a space hamster.","December 1, 2013","true","44.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This makes the game playable on modern displays without any hassle. AFAIK, even though there are mods that add widescreen support to the original, zoom is a feature unique to the Enhanced Edition.\n++ The other great feature in EE is the inclusion of all of the Baldur's Gate II class kits to the original BG. (It should be mentioned that here have been mods that do that for years.) Those kits are extremely unbalanced and extremely fun (though many blossom only in BG2).\n+ There are a few new NPCs to spice things up. They are all right.\n+ There is some arena-like feature called "the Black Pit" that I didn't bother to try.\n+ BG1 was and remains a great game.\n\n- The original BG was the first Inifinity Engine game, and Bioware had still not achieved their full potential. One can see this clearly while playing. A lot of the areas you explore are a half-empty; a lot of the quests are pedestrian; the pacing of the main plot is erratic; the story is bland; the dialogues are silly; the NPCs are not fully fleshed out; the items are weak; and so on.

The team at Beamdog has done a fantastic job at rounding a lot of the rough edges that this game had and releasing it again to us with some additional content. I'll get to the additional content later.\n\nI had a really fun time playing this game, I had grown up on it when I was a kid, but I had never finished it. So, before this edition was released, I picked up GoG version and played it through to the end with a mixed party, it was a sweet ride, sweet enough that I wanted to go again. So I picked up this version when it game out (I think on the same day or maybe a few after I finished it the first time) and played it again. I finished it up and did just about everything that I could do in the game, trying to find all the hidden tomes, quests, locations, areas, etc. I had a blast. Then I did again! lol. I played it again through for the 3rd time, this time doing a solo speedrun of the game with a ftr/thf/mage (awsome combo), and had an absolute blast doing it again. I can't tell you how impressed I am with this game.\n\nBut anyways, on to the review.\n\nThe game is fun, challenging, and has a neat storyline. The graphics... it's a love hate situation; The digitally rendered backgrounds are all really amazing. They are beautiful and stunning to look at, especially after you have completely explored a place. The characters on the otherhand, they are so poorly rendered and animated that you can't even tell that they are actually 3D models and not crapily painted pieces. There are loads of places to go in the game, and a hell of a lot of quests in the game to complete (which is really nice that Beamdog added automatic journal noting so you can actually tell what's a quest and what's not). There are a lot of different monsters to face which eventually require a lot of tactical thinking and spell placement. The classes in the game (AD&D 2nd edition) are unique and are fun to play, especially with the new class kits introduced by Beamdog. The game is fairly straightforward though with it's primary quest chain. Sometimes there's multiple ways to complete a quest (either from alignment, or just dialogue options or approaches), but the game ends the same way no matter what you do.\n\nNow for the content that Beamdog has added. There's not much meat here to be honest. The three additional voice acted characters and their quests are cool, but that's about it.\n\nI'd reccommend this game to any rpg fan. I wouldn't reccommend this to everyone though, being that the AD&D ruleset is rather archaic hard to understand and comprehend for newbies.\n\n9/10\nWould speedrun again.","April 29, 2015","true","94.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's definitely been dated as time has passed. The D&D rules are old and require a bit of a learning curve. Still, it's a great homage to one of the titles in Gaming canon.\n\nIf you haven't played this when it was originally released, you might not enjoy it, but I think it's still worth a go.

One that's so influential and genre defining, that it still stands the test of time. Although not nearly as well as it's successor. This game shows it's age not just visually, but in design in some very annoying areas. Mostly the difficulty. This game is hard, like hazardous to your mental health hard. I nearly had a mental breakdown a couple times in this game. While the story is still (mostly) excellent the gameplay can get seriously tedious and irritating at times. This game carries over some of the  "hard for the sake of hard" retro difficulty that used to characterize games of this era.\n\nYou'll walk into a room and have your entire party neutralized by a confusion spell before you even realized what happened. You'll walk into a trap you had no reason to believe was there after hours of play without even seeing one at all. You'll constantly loose a party member in seconds. You'll die over and over again because of incredibly awful pathing issues. You'll cast a spell only to have your party member get hit by an arrow from across the screen and loose that spell from your pool. You'll walk into fights over and over and over again that can only be conquered from careful preparation and near perfect formation, that irritatingly can only be figured out after experiencing the fight once.\n\nDragon Age Origins had a problem with huge difficulty spikes, but this? This is completely absurd. There is far too many fights in this game that feel like horribly unbalanced crapshoots. One of the ways this game adds difficulty is to put most of the hardest fights in the game in tiny, cramped rooms and just fill them to the brim with mages. Trying to stop multiple mages at once from casting confusion spells that will wipe out half of your party if it gets off is irritating, and it's even worse in tiny rooms. The pathing issues are amplified to maddening levels here as your entire party bumps and slams into each other while mages are busy roasting your party in seconds. Baldur's Gate 2 added confusion protection spells which was a godsend. Here? You have to just take it, and it's incredibly annoying.\n\nThere is A LOT of stuff you are going to have to put up with to enjoy this game. Save often, and be prepared to load saves often. This game will kill you repeatedly with no warning, you have to be willing to deal with that to enjoy this game at all.\n\nSo with that out of the way let's talk about how this is one of the best RPG's I've ever played (It actually is.) When things go right in this game, my god is it satisfying. Buffing up your entire party with stat boosts and conquering enormous bosses with tactics that only you could come up with, feels... it's just amazing.\n\nThe RPG mechanics and gameplay are just near perfect here, building a proper character and party is easy and fun to do.  The loot is incredibly rewarding to equip and is numerous and interesting. Exploration is very rewarding here, make sure to check every inch of every area, (especially in the beginning.) The interface is one of the best I've ever seen, 17 years later and it's still a joy to use. It's one of those games that achieves a near perfect synthesis of RPG mechanics, story and exploration that provide an experience that's impossibly immersive.\n\nAfter the 66 hours of infuriating and rewarding gameplay I can't help but say that I loved this game. I wanted to quit, multiple times during this playthrough. Especially in the middle section with the never ending Cloakwood Forest, but I stuck it out and really learned this game even when it killed me repeatedly with no warning. If you are willing to accept brutal and unforgiving challenge in reward for a wonderful story and immensely deep gameplay then this is the game for you. Not for the light of heart or the intellectually lazy, but absolutely worth the struggle if you can look past the retro difficulty.","July 14, 2015","true","65.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Great RPG, cool world to explore, little humor here and there and the story is interesting. Though I must say that the story in BG2 is bigger and darker and BG1 scratches only the surface of the back story of your character.\n\nBut in any case, if you like RPG's and you can see past the dated graphics, you'll have hours and hours of RPG goodness.","July 15, 2014","true","75.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Have you never even heard of Baldur's Gate until right now?\n\nThen this is the game for you. Or more accurately it's the story for you. The game is an entirely secondary experience to this brilliant fantasy story set in the dungeons & dragons Sword Coast realm. And despite my opinion of the gameplay being secondary the gameplay is still brilliant and challenging enough that even if you're an experienced RPG gamer you'll find yourself gritting your teeth in agony of suspense as you wait for the last few combat rounds to resolve themselves knowing you've given it your all and done your best and now you just have to hope it was enough.\n\nAnyway.

Do you oft fondly recall the days of yore, when video gaming didn't hold your hand, and gaming worlds were as brutal as real life?  Do you know what THAC0 means?\n\nIf you've been answering yes, by golly this game is for you!\n\nBaldurs Gate was a game I fondly remembered from my younger years of gaming.  I had never beaten it, and my discs (all 5, yes 5 for an isometric top down RPG) got so scratched from removing them from the stupid cardboard sleeve that I thought I was never going to play again.  But lo and behold, the Enhanced Edition came along to remind me that games used to be hard.  The quicksave button will be your friend, as you should be using it roughly every 2-3 minutes.  Going to enter that house?  Quicksave.  Finish a fight?  Quicksave.  Going to talk to some guy?  Damn right you better quicksave.\n\nIf you ever played Dungeons and Dragons with the second edition ruleset, you already know what you're getting into, and I shouldn't have to convince you to play this.\n\nBottom line:  This is one of the best PC RPGs ever made, and if you enjoy a good RPG not created to the Japanese style, you owe it to yourself to play this game.  It is difficult, stat heavy, humerous, long, and rewarding.  Combat is a turn based system, with a "pause to issue commands" structure.  On screen combat looks real time, because everything happens in the background.  I highly suggest turning on combat rolls, and other combat messages in the options so you know what's actually happening.\n\nOh, and the quicksave button is "Q".

The one negative thing I must mention is that they have redone all of the cinematics. They all are very simple and remind of a drawn comic rather then the fantastic cinematics that they once were. It was a little depressing when I entered the Friendly Arm Inn and the drawbridge lowering and epic music turned into the music playing over a simple picture. Nevertheless if you and some friends are looking for entertaining evenings with comedy and role-playing then this is the game for you.

I was too young to understand what it even was, but it still enraptured me. Now that the Enhanced Edition has been released, i'm able to go back and experience the game.\n\n\nBaldurs Gate is tough and expect to die ALOT. The idea is that your character is just a kid in a quiet town known for their books. Your character is exactly that, a kid. When you start the game up your character is level 1, weak and brittle. You'll probably restart the game with a fresh character multiple times until you understand what class kits and good, and which are bad. You'll have to know what to do right off the bat and that's okay. The trial and error isn't monotonous, and can be completly avoided by looking up a walkthrough.\n\nWhen I first started I just walked around with my dimpy little quarterstaff, doing the menial tasks that the game presents you with. These tasks are only menial because it sets the tone of how humble your characters start really is. On my playthrough where I beat the game, right off the fly I walked into Winthrop's taven bought a hammer on my dwarven defender walked around the town clockwise doing quests and getting stuff done. For the majority of the game I didn't know what was coming next but the first part I had done a million times. Because I restarted over and over and until I was happy with a character that was good and I knew I wanted to keep and import for baldurs gate 2. I was incredibly picky on my followers and only got the best.\n\nNone of that is neccesary.\nYou can play the game how you want to and not worry about whats good and whats bad, and that fine,\nbut it will be a lot harder.\nI researched online on what was the absolute best until I eneded up with a party consisting of this:\nMe\nImoen (Best thief in the game)\nKhalid (Best tank)\nKivan ( Best archer)\nNeera (Ok mage)\nBranwen (Awesome Cleric)\n\nBy the time we reached level 4 (and leveling is very slow) we were tough customers.\nYou may start weak, but you become tough as nails. That's why in BG2, the game is even more fun.\nGrinding out the early struggle is worth it because it just makes being strong twice as awesome.\n\nTL;DR Version:\nFun game\nYou're very weak in the begining\nYou get really tough later on\nslow leveling up\nYou will die a lot\nYou will probably restart the game a lot until you know what you are doing\nBG2 is even more fun because you start at a high level and can wreck\n\nCategory:CRPG\n\nGraphics:7/10\nStory:8.5/10\nSounds:7.8/10\nMusic:7/10\nGameplay:9/10\n\nOverall 8.8/10","November 12, 2015","true","161.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

I loved this game, and still have the 6 discs the original game needed. I was siked when I found out it was on Steam. So, we tried to play the multiplayer, which was ridiculously broken. it took us 2 hours to finally get into the game, having to spent 20 minutes rerolling stats because we would get kicked from the session, or the game would crash. So, if you were looking forward or wanting to play this game with your friends, don't bother getting it. It was, however, awesome the one time we got it to work, I just wish they would patch the game and fix the bug riddled multiplayer. However, the single player campaign and the Black Pits worked well, and I was glad I could play my old game without swapping discs in between every fast travel. The game really ins't that different, and we found ourselves and I found out personally, that the new characters weren't anything special, and the environments looked good, but not that big of a change. I would recomend this game to any fans of the series, but stay away from the multiplayer. 5/9 hours I've played was sitting in lobbies and character creation arbitration sceens, waiting for the game to work.","November 20, 2015","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
