My half hour spent on the game has been spent working out game mechanics, flying, buying, missions and all of that.\n\nThe graphics are real pretty for an indie game by a small dev team. Flying up into the atmosphere and seeing all of nothing around you, seeing planets, suns, space stations and cities from a distance. Ive only seen Earth and the moon from the Sol solar system, and seen countless random other planets and stations in other random systems, but so far I am impressed with the depth, size and look of the game.\n\nFlying is a little weird - you use the mouse to do most movement, but you also need to use the A and D buttons for the roll function. Switching out of the mouse movement mode to go to autopilot, manuever and transit modes.\nIt may take a little while to get used to still.\nEdit: So it would appear that there is the option to change your key bindings and mouse usage, also being able to us the directional keys to control the ship. Apparently there is partial controller support at this stage too, though I am yet to try it.\n\nSo far I have worked out how to get off the planet, learnt how to get around to others, learnt how to dock at cities and space stations, learnt all the interfaces.. but getting a mission that requires me to leave the starting area? As of What this needs is a more comprehensive tutorial, I think, but as its only build 7 of Alpha, and super early, all in good time :)\nEdit: Finally worked out how to get out of the starting system to explore the universe in its glory. Hydrogen and jump drives. Who knew.\n\nRemember, its only in alpha, and really early alpha at that. Its playable, but the learning curve at this stage is steep. There's a few killer bugs as well (my autopilot into a space station killed me for example) but nothing too game breaking.\nI have high hopes for this, and it already looks really promising.\nDefinitely worth the money I paid to support it - but don't expect a totally finished game because you'll be disappointed.\nI will update this once I learn more features and the game is updated :)\nThe devs are pretty cool too, and are really active on the paragon forums and are really interested in what the community has to say. They are really intent on making this game the best it can be!\n\n\ntl;dr\n- Im loving this game.\n- Its pretty\n- No comprehensive tutorial as of yet\n- Control scheme may be a bit difficult to handle at first\n- Steep learning curve\n- Bugs. Its in alpha. Expect bugs.\n- Pretty sweet devs\n- Its pretty.\n\nThis is the first early access game i fully support and actually want to help find bugs to help make it a better experience once finished!\n\nOn a less serious note, flew about 5km into a gas giant and exploded. 10/10 for realism.\n\nNote: I have now made a comprehensive early game tutorial in the guides section explaining certain mechanics for new players. Lots of pictures and numbers. Hope it helps.","May 13, 2014","true","8.7"," 132 of 141 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","132","141","0","5"

As it stands this is as close as you are going to get right now to having Elite itself on steam, which is no bad thing ......\nWell worth the purchase price for that little convenience alone.\n\nSo the 80s style (done perfectly) comes as no surprise, and the artwork (cockpits etc) are good quality.\nMusic is top notch as well, hinting at radiophonic and kraftwerk, it goes to make a perfect background to this space sim.  Runs like a dream and you can max the graphics on a modest PC.\nIt really does have the spirit and feel of Elite.\n\nSo my recommendation is a thumbs up with crossed fingers, trusting that the development of Paragon will continue along its own lines and not fall down like so many other early access titles have been doing on steam over the last few months.","May 13, 2014","true","11.8"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","57","62","0","0"

The game has a great look, and even with some clearly WIP UI screens, it presents information neatly and accessibly. Plus, the music is really quite nice. (Though I've silenced it to play Nujaubes, which also happens to complement the game very well...)\n\nSo far, most complaints are simply symptomatic of the game's alpha status. Early-game balance is very lacking, with early delivery missions (the only ones you'll be able to take) paying anywhere between $400-700, while ships bigger than the miniscule starting ship costing upwards of $50000. This will presumably be changed in future revisions, but in the mean time, all ship info is stored in convenient little .lua files within the game's folders, so manually changing ship prices is a good way to circumvent the early grind.\n\nAlso, another minor complaint: currently there just aren't enough keyboard shortcuts. Clicking through the (again, very attractive and thoughtfully designed) menus would be a more painless process if there were shortcut keys to flip between your ship's views, comms, maps, etc. I assume this is on the to-do list somewhere, because it's such a simple thing.\n\nOh, and the autopilot can be downright homicidal. This seems to be true of most space games, but the moral of the story is save frequently and try to keep an eye out for passing freighters when you're docking or taking off from a station.\n\nBottom line, though, Paragon is a compelling and promising space sim. It definitely leans more towards approachability and simplicity than the impregnable X series, or the finnicky Evochron Mercenary (both of which are also good), though it seems that Paragon is aiming towards a fair amount of depth eventually. In the mean time, it's an attractive little Elite-clone and easily worth the $15.","May 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","1"

I would prefer a "perhaps" button for it.\n\nIt's an Elite-like game (a Frontier Elite remake to be more accurate) and it is based on the free and open source game "Pioneer". Some people say this game is Pioneer sold for 14.99 $ ; they are completly wrong. This game isn't Pioneer anymore : the gameplay is more arcade oriented than Pioneer (flight mechanisms are easier, simplified). At first this simplicity seems to be a good thing, but itsn't. The devs seem to miss a very important aspect : objective. If you have a simulation oriented game, learn how to do stuff, how to flight, how to land etc. is already a good challenge. But in the other hand, arcade oriented games need more objective-centric gameplay. Because for now, Paragon is just autopilot someone or something from a point x to a point y. You can do manuel flight, but it's too simple (with w you go faster, with "s" you slow down, with the mouse your turn, and that's about all the complexity of the flight mechanism - oh, you can also roll with the "a" and "d" button). So the question here isn't "how can I flight this ship" - like in Pioneer - but "why should I manuel control this ship?". You can just hit the autopilot and relax - even if it isn't working really well for now (I'm having a lot of crashes with it), unless you're in a orbital station, autopilot can manage almost every flight course). On Pioneer you can control all the lateral, top and bottom thrusters, and the ship doesn't stop when you hit the reverse botton, it just stop accelerating, you have to invert ships direction to be able to stop, and it can take a while if you're too fast. That's a challenge.\n\n\nSo why I give this game a "yes"? Because it's prettier than Pioneer (I like this 60ties atmosphere with the blue buildings and very sharp space ships), because it's on steam and easier to install and update than Pioneer, because combats are most intersting (the complex flight mechanism of Pioneer turns combats into a nightmare), and because I believe it's easier to finish a game with a budget (I'm still waiting, after years of development, for the final release of some open-source games like Unknown Horizons,  Glest,  UFO Alien Invasion, or FreeOrien and many others). I love open-source, but a game is like a book or a movie, you have to finish it some day or it's useless...\n\n\nI won't even comment the potential this game has, it can be really incredible, but with the monstruous Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous coming out soon, what'll be the place of Paragon, Pioneer, Oolite and many other open-source space-sim games?","November 7, 2014","true","9.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

If you're undecided about Paragon, dip your toe in Pioneer then come back and show these guys some money.\n\nEssentially this is a remake of Frontier Development's "Frontier" games, the sequel to Elite.  If you want to play Elite, check out Oolite, which is a free project as well.\n\nIf you're a player of Elite Dangerous, you might consider picking up Paragon as well, because while not multiplayer enabled (someday please?) this is a spiritually similar experience, albeit with much more "space trucking" and less of an action component.  It's a pretty chill, relaxing game, and autopilot handles the majority of navigation tasks for you.\n\n","May 12, 2015","true","10.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

It's really immersive. Unfortunately at the current state the game is unplayable because of serious bugs (mainly suicidal autopilot, buggy docking bays and crashing). You must constantly save and even when you reach your destination, it's uncertain whether you'll dock (or take off). Buy it only if you want support developers. Paragon has potential, but give it some time yet.\n\nI'll edit my review (and change recommendation eventualy) after updates which will fix these bugs.\n\nTips: If you want tutorial go to http://pioneerwiki.com/wiki/Manual (Paragon is an opensource fork of Pioneer). You have no guns at the beginning. For hyperjump you need Jump module and hydrogen and you must be at least 15km above the surface. Docking is possible only via autopilot (A) and you must first ask for permission. Trading is useless at the beginning, so earn cash trough delivery between sectors (~1000 $).","September 15, 2014","false","10.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Not much this observer thinks but then what if you add space stations and cities or spaceports into the mix? It's not illusion in paragon, it's all there and that concept alone is the basis of a game with plenty of depth. But of course i'm not just reviewing one side but all and so far the plot, as an avid sci-fi fan myself, is very interesting but still has much development. It is curently based in the not so distant future, around the 22nd century if i'm not mistaken, in a world where the Cold War doesnt end!\n\nSo far however, this plot has yet to be implemented fully and more technical issues have to be solved around how such a massive procedurally generated galaxy can be kept stable and in working order. I take my hat off to the devs who are attempting this task because from what i've seen already if these technical issues, minor and major, can be handled I honestly believe this could be one hell of an adventure.\n\nWith regards to the depth of the game, this is also something that is wanting but from the hammer and sickle on the space stations to maps of various aligned and non-aligned planets it seems the basis is there to create a universe of mixed politics and motives. Its one thing to play an rpg or free roaming games based in some distant land or with compulsory missions to weigh you down, but to have free reign to go about your business and make a name for yourself? That doesnt sound too bad and the potential is there.\n\nAs it is you can fly around, see the sights, get a feel for how the game would work and with enough imagination have some idea of the end product but it is a long way off and despite my enthusiasm it has to be said that getting involved with an early access program with massive scope is not for the faint of heart and so only those of patience (and a definite love for sci-fi) should apply now, otherwise give it time!","July 24, 2014","true","27.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I am one of those people who love adventure and doing what you want in an immersive free play world, and in this game( just not yet ) you can travel to 3 sections of the GALAXY! and then go to THOUSANDS of populated moon and planets. you can also be a pioneer and visit unpopulated worlds. The graphics are in the theme of an old 3Dspace game also it has amazing models of space station colonies and ship along with stars, anomalies, moons and planets. this game  has LOTS of potential but it still has some bugs that can be sorted out, for instance the autopilot is like a crapshute because it can either get you somewhere really quickly or it will catapult you into a ship or a space station or warp ypu through Moons, stars, and planets. I love this game, dont get me wrong and I  know that maybe they are going for realism buor I am just too lazy but the ships are way too expensive bordering the seven hundred thousands when normal mission that pay well require transporting a small group which your begening ship is not suted for and dosnt have any room for any extra things. any way this game is a 10/10 and I definetly going too recommrnd it!","June 14, 2014","true","69.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Virtually everything is identical to Pioneer expect for slightly higher quality graphics with a bit of post processing. Though I was keenly aware of the similarities before I bought this game the promotional videos and info I had read about the game on their site beforehand made it seem that  -even at this early alpha state- they had improved  on some of the base features of Pioneer. Sadly that is not the case at all (at least not as of now).\n\nIn fact they managed to screw up some basic mundane things that were already working well in Pioneer. For instance, simple things like word wrapping in menus and UI. A large part of Pioneer's and subsequently Paragon's gameplay has you pouring through resource lists, menus and just general text. At HD resolution (1920x1080) the font is oversived, janky, somewhat fuzzy and in certain areas words or phases overlap making it a puzzle to decipher if you aren't already familar with what it is supposed to say. That's a big part of the game and if that's not formatted properly well that certainly degrades the experience.\n\nAnother simple thing - In Pioneer when you visit various stations and or cities on planets throughout the universe the station personnel is represented by dynamically generated character pictures, made from snippets of male and female facial features of varying ethnicities and...silly mismatched sci-fi type gear. There are like 10 distinct facial features that are aslo mismatched to make somewhat unique (if not sometimes terrifying and creepy O.O) variations of characters to "interact" (they are just photos with text underneath them but use your imagination) with. Did Paragon improve upon this aspect at all? No, in fact they replaced that quirky dynamic character generating system with a very boring single, all encompassing male or female faceless avatar. I mean really? Maybe that's something that will be changed in the future but who knows.\n\nThese may seem like little things but if they can't get these things right, well you get the picture.\n\nI personally regret the purchase and would rather just support Pioneer which is free and open-source. It's kind of shameful in my opinion that the Paragon devs are even making money off essentially a straight forward clone of a free game. Maybe in the future they will be able to develop enough unique content as to separate their game from Pioneer but as of now it is a mirror image of Pioneer with just an extra bit of visual polish.\n\nIf I am somehow woefully misinformed and Paragon was intended to be a visual upgrade mod of Pioneer then my question is how did it get Greenlit on Steam? I seriously would like to know what is happening here.","May 14, 2014","false","2.2"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","25","46","0","5"

With TrackIR support, hotas support, etc and maybe some tweaks to how the craft is controlled, interfacing with on-board gauges and spotting ability, it could and probably will become a very enjoyable game.

Twelve in a row has got to be some sort of record ;)\n\nIt was nice to actually get some traction in game for grinding to better ships.\n\nHere is what I've now found that I can do 8 missions in a row...\n\n1)  Found a game-ender:  Farley Station.  For some reason, the ship will not "geo-lock" above the dock.  The autopilot stops about 1m from the surface.  I turn off autopilot and I'm zooming backwards.  When I try to manually pilot to the dock, when my speed is 0, the planet is moving beneath me.\n\n2)  Almost always now my starter ship will not dock.  I have to turn off autopilot and hit "o", then the dock's tractor beam complete's my ships lateral rotation so that I land.  This has worked every time until I attempted to land at the above (point 1) dock.\n\n3)  After docking and coming back from the dock info screen, the HUD mileage flickers.\n\nMUCH IMPROVED...  Enough so to recommend.\n\n\n===========================\n7 HF2\n===========================\nI have about 4 hours in this game.  I'm experiencing an ever escalating number of deal breakers:\n\n1)  Auto-pilot mostly works.  That, however, is not the problem.  When it DOESN'T work is the issue.  Expect to crash into docks and die.  One work-around would be too...\n\n2) Save often.  Except I'm experiencing a crash on save about 1 every 3 or 4 attempts.  So that leg of the journey (since the last successful save) needs to be repeated.  However upon landing (presumably due to the type of station) I again auto-pilot crash.\n\n3)  So instead of grinding these nickel-and-dime missions, why not play around a bit?  I modified a ship price so that I could at least make more than a couple grand.  So I fitted up the Starling transport, found some folks wanting to go three jumps for $5000 and we set off.  Landed in the system and auto-piloted to the dock.  Requested clearance and told this impressive space taxi to land.  No auto-pilot crash... time to cash in!  Wait, it didn't land... It's just floating above the pad.  I manually bring the ship back out of position and tell the autopilot to land again.  ...Still not on the pad.\n\nAlright.  4 hours in, and I'll be watching for the next patch notes to decide whether it's time to give it another shot.\n\nUpdate:  There was an announcement a week ago that the specific save crash I'm experiencing was fixed.  I'm running their current Hotfix (Alpha 7 HF2)...  Save issue still exists.\n\nSo much for watching patch notes for fixes to these two (three, maybe more) issues...","May 28, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Try Pioneer for free and then of you enjoy it, buy this, as it looks and sounds a lot better.\n\nThe graphics have been massively improved as has the soundtrack. The game goes for a retro 80's feel (right down to the Cold War In Space scenario) and the optional filters that make it look like a 80's sci fi film or its being played on a cathode monitor!\n\nThe universe and the individual planets look wonderful and there is a plethora of stuff to do. As with the original elite, the intial progress in the game is extremely slow, but once you gain traction there is a fantastic and absorbing range of activities, you can be a pirate, an interstellar taxi driver, a trader or fight for one of the factions. There's no overarching plot as such, but your imagination can build your own as you play.\n\nFor the price, this represents better value for money than E:D by a long chalk (and you can land on fantastically rendered planets NOW).\n\nThe only problem is that it is still a little bit buggy. I cannot load a saved game from the start page, I have to begin a new game, play for 10-15 minutes and then load my older saved game which is a bit of a pain. There's the occasional CTD to, and the graphics can lag a bit when you don't expect them to (and likewise be extramely smooth when there's a lot going on)\n\nThe game is soon to be updated, hopefully to iron out the glitches and push it closer to beta. If you like space trading games, this is definitely one of the better ones that I have tried.\n\n\n\n","August 25, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now I thought the idea of this fork of Pioneer with it's 80's theme was a great idea, however after I bought it and installed it I was immediately turned off. The aesthetic is barely 80's, the ships all look as if they were constructed from lego and the cartoon style texturing and shading just doesn't reflect what they were going for. Plus the music is much too modern sounding, they completely missed the mark on the whole 80's vibe. The sound design as of yet is lacklustre as well. (To be clear while I couldn't get it to even start on Fedora Linux it does run on Windows 7)\n\nRight now the game is pretty empty and there is not a whole lot to do, keep that in mind as you prepare to buy this fork of a much more complete FREE game for FIFTEEN US DOLLARS. I understand it's still in early access and I probably wouldn't have posted this, but when I told them the game would not properly initialize in Fedora Linux by opening a thread in the discussion area they said it would be fixed in the next update, but when it turned out to still not start they deleted the thread.

It is impossible for me to load a save game 90% of the time and the same goes for hitting jump space without the game crashing. On top of that certian space stations will have me shoot past the docking process on auto pilot, bump into the back of the station taking hull damage, then reverse me to where it should have dock and then it finally works. Needless to say I can't get better equipment or ships because I'm constantly restarting. I really hope the devs can fix these problems. This is could be by far the best space sim I've played to date.

I would say so, yes, based on this update and the way the game seems to be heading now. This update isn't a revolution but it's a good step in the right direction for this game, the guys developing this have made quite a lot of progress in the space of a month. New ships, new cockpits, new space graphical effects with nebulas, a better autopilot, a better GUI for the autopilot, and just generally better polish and even slightly better frame rate.\n\nThis game is making sure and steady progress but you have to remember that this game is ALPHA which means a lot of the features that you want to see here are not finished yet.\n\nWhat you have got is a Space simulation where you can pretty much go and do whatever you want, it is a sandbox, it is just that not all of the gameplay content and sandbox flavours are in their yet as the developers are adding to the games content as it develops.\n\nWhat you do get is a MASSIVELY improved and MASSIVELY polished up version of Pioneer with lots of things which Pioneer will never have. This game features a complete graphical overhaul, a complete audio overhaul and also a complete ship and assets overhaul. The game feels polished, it has a more simplistic but refined UI and it is making progress in the right ways which makes development for this game actually feel exciting now.\n\nIs the game worth £10? I would agree. Yes. If you liked Frontier you pretty much have the same game here as Frontier although the combat as of yet is not as developed as say other areas like trading and such. Though the devs have said they are going to be working on the combat area of the game.\n\nJumpdrive is a work in progress but it is developing, and if the updates develop at the rate which this one has, and the way in which Adel and co are doing then basically this game is going to develop pretty quickly.\n\nLooking forward to Alpha 12.","October 26, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Quite a bit easier to jump into and get going.  Love the new graphics.  Has great potential but is definitely EARLY alpha.  If you don't like buggy games that are in development, don't buy this and leave negative reviews.  We need all the space sims we can get!  We need the option to control the ship manually, maybe an advanced control mode that gives us full control.  The autopilot is as others have put it, suicidal.

Actually I had no idea what to do. I travelled around for a while in a shuttle. Wow. Definitely alpha.\n\nA simple couple of pre-set missions or a coms channel with hints would help that. A basic education about the concepts beyond the text blurb provided. I might go so far as to suggest rescue or recovery missions to avoid violence (and the inherent ratings/classification problems in various meat jurisdictions)\n\nThe physics seems to ignore newton, although at the scale set it's hard to tell... Newton was wrong but his ideas make for fun games (see Angry Birds), especially if you have all thrusters manually controllable. Imagine the awesome epicness of winning a battle with a limping ship using a gravitational slingshot.\n\nThe quickish mode of transit ( forgot what it's called ) seems to only accelerate. My keys are default - W and S - and S doesn't slow me down. It would be nice if it behaved like the latest idea I was reading about from NASA - creating a space/time vacuum in front of the ship. That would give some more control over speed. Not sure how it translates to code in the game engine, but it shouldn't be hard given that it's kind of newtonian.\n\nAlso, the joystick config sucks. Happy to offer my input as a joystick tester. I have a 3 axis, 4 button joystick, but the 3rd axis is physically set up as a throttle and this does not work well for this game given the current options.\n\n\n","September 12, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To buy a new ship, you have to go through a LOT of missions, and you have to remember to save often because the game lacks an autosave feature and has the tendency to crash when you haven't saved in a while. All in all, Paragon is full of potential. I have played few games like it.","August 18, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I find an appalling lack of gameplay information about what presently DOES exist. The tutorial seems like an afterthought at best. It doesn't even guide you through your beginning at your first port. No help with knowing what you could do with your ship or crew or cargo or anything. Once you get out of port, you have no guidance towards any possible goals, including any missions you take. Apparently you need Hydrogen in your cargo bay to make a hyperspace jump. And you need to be away from the planet. And if your hyperspace button won't activate even then, if the map will let you click on your distant target but nothing else is functioning, well, that's just too bad, there's no in-game information and no out of game guides or tips or anything. Just make sure you have that hydrogen and the auto-pilot is buggy.\nAt present I can't recommend the game. It looks nice and is probably fun to play, if you already knew what you were doing before you ever started playing. And if bugs didn't catch you. If you have already played plenty of Elite and/or Pioneer, then maybe you'll have lots more good times.","July 20, 2014","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quite a bit easier to jump into and get going.  Love the new graphics.  Has great potential but is definitely EARLY alpha.  If you don't like buggy games that are in development, don't buy this and leave negative reviews.  We need all the space sims we can get!  We need the option to control the ship manually, maybe an advanced control mode that gives us full control.  The autopilot is as others have put it, suicidal.  Quite frankly it's the worst thing in the game at the moment, don't trust it to land your ship, or you'll be staring at a game over screen more often than not.\n\nThis game has a long way to go, but if it gets there, it's going to be amazing.","July 5, 2014","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was before it was on steam, and really before the space sim genre had begun to come back into fashion. Back then, this was one of the only hopes for an open world space trading simulator. It was buggy, unoptimised, unpleasant to play and to look at, but it was still one of the best things on offer. Today, it has too many competitors which are getting it right for these problems to be overlooked.\nUnfortunately, I don't think this game can survive the rebirth of the space sim genre.","November 29, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
