I literally only bought it so that I could play with my friend who is, in his own words, a "die-hard fan who loves RWBY more than anything else in the world."\n\nNow that all that is out of the way, I would like to say that, even as a person who's never watched the show, it seems like this has A LOT of potential. I really and truly hope that the developers at Rooster Teeth are able to help this game fulfill all of its potential.\nEdit: It seems like they are well on their way to fullfilling it.\n\nSo, on to the actual review.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Really beautiful environments\n\n-Animations and textures are very well done.\n\n-Great voice acting (IMO)\n\n-Fun to play with Friends\n\n-In combat, the controls feel rather satisfying.\n\nEdit #3: Thanks to the last two or three updates, the game feels a lot better in general.\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-Hard to get into the story as a person who has never watched the show\n(I do understand this was made technically made for fans of the show, so I can kind of excuse this one, although it would be nice to have a short bio of the character in the main menu's selection screen.)\n\n-No way to save your character information for a future playthrough. It would also be nice to be able to select the level or section you wished to play, so you could immediately jump to the point you wanted to be. (i.e. Half-Life 1+2 Level Selection type thing)\n(I now understand this is intentional, as the game is meant to be played this way.)\n\n-Invisible Walls are EVERYWHERE. And although it exists everywhere, it is especially noticeable in the 'Mountain Glenn' Area. It is impossible to jump across gaps that should be easily crossed, as well as certain areas in the map where it looks like you should be able to walk through.\n(For example: In the first level of the game, there is a section where the ground goes up and you pass an overlook with a fence on it looking out on the area you were just in. You can't jump over the fence, despite being able to jump higher than it.)\nEdit #3: This is unfortunately still an issue.\n\n-Some enemies seem to be missing attack animations. By which I mean, in the beginning of the game, you have to defend Control Points, and the Grimm that are 'Attacking' them will get close and then just... stop moving.\n(This has been fixed.)\n\n-When a player moves their character, there doesn't seem to be any acceleration. The player will be sliding across the ground at full speed while the animation for the running is just slowly starting. (I feel like I should mention that, once you're moving around, it's not so bad and becomes unnoticeable)\n(This has been fixed.)\n\n-Combos. Although combat controls are really great, one complaint that I do have is that combos are currently the only way to refill the special meter. There should really be a timer or something of the sort on it to regain in between battles.\n(This was fixed with the combat revision update.)\n\nIn conclusion, while I do not regret buying this game, I cannot recommend it in its current state as it still needs a bit of work. I hope that, in time, I will be able to change this review to a 'Recommend'.\n\nFrom edit #3: I can still say I don't regret buying the game, and Rooster Teeth has been doing a great job on turning this great concept into a great game! If their work continues to be as good as it has been, I can safely say I will be changing the review to "Recommended" in the near future.\n\nEdit: Updated some points and fixed some grammar.\nEdit #2: Volume Controls were fixed.\nEdit #3: "Combat Revision" update was released, as well as another I didn't see at first. This has fixed several problems and I've updated accordingly.","December 1, 2015","false","1.9"," 1,489 of 1,863 people (80%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","80","489","1","50","108"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TempusArc/recommended/418340/","TempusArc","Temp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TempusArc/","54 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst off,  I personally love this game. It has given me many opportunities to make many friends with similar interests as my own and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nFor those reading this before purchasing allow me to explain the game for you at the current date of Dec 15th 2015.\n\nRWBY: Grimm Eclipse at the current date is a hack and slash game with one campaign and four characters to play. Team RWBY. It is a very simple game with simple hack and slash combat. The game is not a very complicated game to play but that is what makes it a lot of fun with friends. It has a very quirky style just like the anime and its a nice refresher from some of the other games I play.\n\nI have mastered all four characters skill trees and I will share my personal opinion on each character.\n\nCharacters\nRuby Rose - I feel as if Ruby is the most polished character in the game. With a very fluent movement style and a very flashy but controlled combo, she is easily my favorite to play. Her dodges and movements are designed very well where she disappears with rose petals into a roll just like enemy. Her three abilities are Crescendo, Reap and Dust Blast.\n\nI feel as if Reap is a more useless skill compared the raw power coming from the Crescendo and Dust Blast skills.\n\nCrescendo is a 360 covering move and can be used to massively wipe just about everything. The mastered version of Crescendo is good but in my opinion not worth the points it asks for. Ruby has a glitch that makes her 360 cover the strongest cover in the game in my opinion. After she uses it once, using it again allows her to move while charging.\n\nReap is, in my personal opinion, Ruby's useless move. Cleaving Reap is a very good mastery move. It does what I'd expect from a mastered move. It takes its weakness and capitalizes on it. It greatly increases the range of the move with the rocks that get thrown out as she crashes into the ground.\n\nDust Blast is a shot of dust power. It's kinda like shooting an explosion, you have the normal dust blast, electric, ice and fire. My personal favorite is the Electric due to the massive amount of range you get with it due to the chain lightning. It can kill up to 3 people in what shot and if you hit one, two enemies will get shocked with chain lightning. A very neat and unique effect.\n\nRuby's two passive abilities are Armor Piercing and Hyperballistic. Armor Piercing allows your ranged attacks to hit armored enemies like the pigs. Hyperballistic decreases how much of a combo you need to achieve a block of special towards using your abilities.\n\n\nWeiss Schnee - Weiss is a very solid and powerful character. I personally like her movement the most because she has a very graceful and smooth movement style. Her dodge is a quick transition that you barely see and it's just overall a very smooth experience when playing as Snow Angel. Her three skills are Nova, Pierce and Barrage.\n\nNova is my favorite move with Weiss. Its a very powerful move that, when mastered, is a lot of fun to use. Supernova is the mastery of Nova and it draws in opponents as you charge the move. Unlike Ruby, you cannot move after using it, still giving Ruby the edge in this category of move.\n\nPierce is a pretty powerful move with a bit more viability than Ruby's Reap. It has more range and can one shot Beowolves at level 2. The negative draw back is what i call the universal range. You can only kill opponents if they are all right next to each other making the move not very viable in a lot of situations.\n\nBarrage. Yeah.. I didn't really like this move until the mastered Ice Bolt. Ice Bolt is immensely powerful and has a very long straight AoE path. It's a really good move fitting for Weiss along with Supernova.\n\nWeiss' passive abilities are Ice Queen and Perfect Form. Ice Queen makes her blast attacks freeze opponents. Perfect Form makes her combo meter fill 2 special bars instead of one. A very useful ability.\n\n\nBlake Belladonna - A very clumsy and my least favorite character to play. Her combo is good but the air combo that she jumps into doesn't hit ground enemies like Ruby's does. She does a really really good ranged attack just by the simple shot she does. Her three abilities are Shadow Clone, Shadow Strike and Blade Beam.\n\nShadow Clone is Blake's first skill and is more a quick trap than an attacking skill. You usually have to wait to be surround to just quickly throw one out that doesn't kill unless two are hit. It's a pretty awkward move with less benefits compared to the next move. The Mastered forms are an ice and fire clone.\n\nShadow Strike is Blake's strongest monster clearing move. The second level is three clones and the mastered level is 5 clones. It can clear monsters faster than any other ability in the game. I really enjoy watching it as well, very quickly cast and very smooth will all 5 blake's coming out.\n\nBlade Beam is Blake's strongest single target move. Granted, it can hit multiple enemies but I find it better as a single hit move. Not much else to say about it besides it is chargable and the mastered for are horizantal slashes that go through enemies.\n\nHer two passive abilities are Frenzy and Fortunate Faunus. Frenzy makes her final combo hit do more damage and add 2 combo points instead of just one on the final hit. Fortunate Faunus gives her a random chance to get a special after an enemy dies.\n\nYang Xiao Long - The last playable character in the game and an all around good character. A very smooth combat style when you are dash dancing, as I call it. Dash dancing is when you are attacking and dodging at the same time, kinda looks like you are dashing so I call it dash dancing. Her three abilities are Quake, Sunbreaker and Blast Wave.\n\nQuake is a simple 360 ability. Yang hops into the air and slams her fist causing an explosion around her. Super Quake is her mastered form cause much more damage than before. It's a typical "Yang" ability.\n\nSunbreaker is her next ability and with a really cool name. It is really fun to use and is an uppercut into the sky. This causes yang to get a firey hair affect, which I'm not quite sure what it does but it does look pretty cool. The mastered form hits 3 times on her way up into the air.\n\nBlast Wave.. sucks. It's just slow and requires perfect spacing to land. Mastering this move sucks and the mastered form extends the range a bit but still not worth it in my eyes.\n\nYangs passive abilities are Second Wind and Brawler. Second Wing is the best ability in the game. When Yang loses all her aura she instantly refills all special points on a 30 second cooldown. Brawler makes it so she can take one hit before losing her combo, a pretty nice passive but nothing compared to Second Wind.\n\n\nGlitches I have ran across:\nRuby's Crescendo Movement. As stated above in her skill list.\nRevival Glitch. When you are downed next to a teammate you can still revive each other.\n\nAdditions I want to see:\nA large cast of characters to play as. The more the merrier. I love this game and I think having a large variety of characters to play as would make it amazing.\n\nA couple of ideas:\n\nPartnership Buffs: Some games have this, where you pick two characters and depending on your team depends on your buffs.\nEx. Nora and Ren - Flower Power +10% Aura Regeneration\n\nA stat menu of some sorts in the menu before a game starts.\n\nJust a few ideas for you; I can't wait to see what you guys do with this game!","December 15, 2015","true","38.9"," 187 of 207 people (90%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","90","187","207","20","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zeno2750/recommended/418340/","Zeno2750","Zeno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zeno2750/","99 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nJust played through the entire campaign with all four characters and here's my thoughts. I'll breakdown each character's gameplay further down.\n\nFIRST THOUGHTS:\nStarting off, it's aesthetically very much like the anime. The voice acting is very good, as expected, but can easily be drowned out by the chaos of battle. The controls are easy enough to pick up to start bashing away at things. Though, in order to survive, you'll need to learn how to time your dodges effectively [Shift]; otherwise you'll be on the ground very quickly. Sounds can be a little repetitive and overbearing at times (I'm looking at you, Blake), but it's still early access.\n\nPROGRESSION:\nYes, there is a progression system. Well, more like an in-game achievement system with in-game rewards. As for those claiming there is no progression system, that's half true. Your character LEVEL does not save. You'll be starting the campaign over again at level one. However, your talent unlocking progress DOES save. For example, 0/100 kills needed with a specific ability with a character can be built up through multiple playthroughs.\n\nAchieving the level cap of 10 in a single playthrough to unlock their 'master' talent can be tough, and may require multiple playthroughs after unlocking some talents to help secure kills. That's where the urge to keep playing comes into play. Once talents are unlocked, they are unlocked for good, and can be purchased with attribute points without needing to unlock them again. Not a bad system, but may not be for everyone. I was only able to finally get to level 10 as Yang due to my allies dying while I cleaned up the battlefield, on multiple occasions.\n\nMECHANICS:\nIt's very much a hack and slash, and does a very good job at it. Aside from there being only one button to attack with, the combat can get dull rather quickly. That is, unless you tie it together with dodges in-between, which resets the combo, or pressing right mouse-click during the combo to interrupt it with some sort of knock-back or finisher. There is no visual 'lock-on' as of yet, so its hard to stick to one target unless your pointing your camera directly at them and/or using your WASD towards them. But, it's very easy to "get the hang of it" so it's not much of a negative once you understand how it works.\n\nYour Aura meter is your health pool. You can take damage until its depleted and a little bit more until you collapse completely. Stop taking damage for awhile and you'll regen it automatically. Easy enough, just run like a coward while watching dem booties. Some character abilities grant invulerability, so it is possible to remain in comat and still regen. I.E. Ability -> Dodge -> Ability -> Dodge, etc. Seemed a little more exploitable on Yang than the others. Sometimes a little too exploitable to be called broken.\n\nThe experience is my biggest pet peeve about the game. Whoever last hits, gets the experience. Doesn't matter if I've been bashing away at very tough monster - another player can swoop in with an ability to swipe the experience. This leads to a bit of a sour and competitive experience if you're trying to achieve level 10.\n\nREPLAYABILITY:\nSo far, the only campaign is pretty short. About 45 minutes to an hour long. I did feel the desire to play with everyone, so there is some replayability there. If you're a 100%er, and want to unlock every talent for every character while enjoying the hack and slash RWBY style, there's quite a bit of time to be spent here.\n\nI sure hope to see more characters from the other teams, more campaigns, more monster types (only about 8 so far, and they look very similar), and perhaps some more modes. But for what there is so far, it's a toss-up. If you're looking for a quick hack and slash while playing with your favorite RWBY character and don't mind the price point - pick it up. If you'd rather wait for more content than just a single campaign that lasts an hour at most - hold off.\n\n\nIn this next section, this is a purly SUBJECTIVE opinion of my experience playing through the campaign with each character. Edits to the review after multiple playthroughs are below the initial impression.\nPossible SPOILER ALERT: Don't continue to read if you want to find out how these characters work for yourself.\nCHARACTER MECHANICS:\n\nRUBY\nShe's very fun, and one of the more polished characters to start playing around with. Her ability kit out-shines everyone else's in my opinion. Extremely powerful AoE, single-target, and ranged AoE abilities gives her an edge over everyone else. Her damage is above average, and flows very well without losing a lock-on. There's no need to dodge-cancel a combo to stick to a target. Her ranged attack is a long-ranged rifle shot that has huge kickback. Great for first starting out in your first campaign to get rolling on how the game works.\n\nFurther Playthrough Edit: Her kit is still solid, and has the hardest hitting melee AoE ability from what I've seen so far, especially when talented. Her linear melee ability is frustrating at times when you finally charge it up only to have the the enemy go invulnerable. Not as reliable as other characters' "big-hitting" abilities. Dodge-cancelling her ranged attack after two clicks reduces the delay significantly.\n________\nDIFFICULTY: Novice\nSKILL CEILING: 5/10\n\nWEISS\nHer quick rapier attacks force you to play a little different than the others, here. I had to dodge-cancel her combo to repetitively use the first half of her combo to stick to a target effectively. Her abilities can be game-changing. She's the only one with a [talented] heal, and the only one with an AoE that [talented] freezes the enemies which helps immensely on tough targets. Her other two abilities, however, are mediocre at best. The dash is nice for tying into combos, but the ranged ability has absolutly atrocious targetting. Don't expect to hit anything with it unless you're in point blank range. Not to mention her ranged auto-attack will only hit about half of the time with this same targetting - or lack of targetting.\n\nFurther Playthrough Edit: Once talented, her dash attack is the hardest hitting ability in the game, from what I've seen so far - and can be used in quick succession. So there's that.\n________\nDIFFICULTY: Intermediate\nSKILL CEILING: 6/10\n\nBLAKE\nQuick and nimble, you'll find yourself all over the enemy - quite literally. Simply put, she needs work. In my opinion the least polished of the four with her current playstyle. The second half of her auto-attack combo puts you over the top of enemies, making it miss every enemy shorter than herself. I had to dodge-cancel her combo every... single... time against short enemies. Granted those aerial autos are extremely powerful, they're only reliable against the taller enemies. Her ranged attack is a light-hitting pistol with little-to-no kickback. As for the abilities, only two of the three are reliable, in the sense of maximizing your damage. Most of her kit seems bent on maneuverability rather than damage (although her ranged ability does massive damage if used at point blank) - but prepare your ears if you're going to play Blake with headphones. You have been warned.\n________\nDIFFICULTY: Advanced\nSKILL CEILING: 10/10\n\nYANG\nFeels the most polished of the four, and feels great playing her. Her auto-attack lock-on mechanic is the best out of all of them. She hits hard, and hits fast - especially if you dodge-cancel and utilize the first 3/4 of her full auto-attack. She can remain invulnerable for a long time if you time her abilities and dodging correctly. All of her abilities have their uses. Powerful AoE ability, powerful single-target ability, and a hard-hitting "dash-in" ability. Her ranged attack is a short-ranged light-hitting shotgun spray - great for cleaning up enemies that aren't worth another combo. Solid choice for bashing skulls in.\n________\nDIFFICULTY: Intermediate\nSKILL CEILING: 8/10","December 1, 2015","true","10.1"," 179 of 204 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","179","204","6","2"

If it continues at that growth, I believe it will be an excellent game in about a year's time.\n\nThat said, I understand that my love of the show can potentially blind me to features and things I don't see, but as such, I am being as fair as I can with that said in my critique of the game. I do not need the comments pointing such things out. I understand that it goes against the "Fair review" idea, but being an adamant fan of the show, it can be difficult to be 100% unbiased.\n\n-End edit-\n\nOn Day 1, I'm writing my first impressions for this game, as I'm a huge RWBY fanboy and love the series and what it's all about. That in mind, please read this review knowing that despite my fandom, I will criticize where necessary with regards to what I see. This is early access, and this is still day 1 only.\n\nGameplay revolves around a specific character (Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and Yang Xiao Long) and their specific movesets. Each controls a little differently, but it boils down to this: You have one button that is your melee based attack, one button that is a ranged based attack, and you can string combos by spamming the primary button over and over until satisfied. Or you can feel frisky and push your secondary button while in the middle of a combo to "Finish" the combo with a ranged attack and drop out of it. You have a "Dodge" button with your shift key.  Finally, as far as movesets go, you have 3 special moves, unique to each character that defines them. Some have ranged projectiles, some have area of effect wave clear sets. You have to try them to see what they do, and once you do, you'll find out that your melee basic attack ends up doing better than the specials in 95% of circumstances.\n\nYou gain experience from killing monsters, collecting items, and completing objectives. As you level, you'll unlock very basic things like extra special attacks, improved specials, and the like. The specials can be improved by either gaining the ability to charge them to do more damage, getting a new effect, or other traits. Other unlocks can be your aura (Health) recharging faster or... That's about it right now. And since we're on that topic - You have health. You won't realize this because you'll stun-lock all enemies you come across with melee or ranged attacks, but if there's more than 5-6 of them on you, you'll go from full to death in a matter of seconds. The balance of health is already an issue, as your characters (All four of them) are nimble enough to dodge a little bit to get out of harm's way, but if you get surrounded, you might as well kiss your butt goodbye.\n\nBalance issues aside with health, the game play is fun for a few minutes - The characters all have unique personalities and voice lines, and from what I can tell, are all the original voice actors. You also have Peter Port (A teacher from the academy in the show) guiding your steps through the levels to help you out and aid you. However, the game play is extremely basic. There's only three buttons you'll care about while in combat - Melee about 90% of the time, ranged attack about 5% of the time, and your dodge about 5% of the time. Beyond that, specials are only when you feel frisky or are trying to solo things and want to speed it up (I've played solo on every character and felt no worry of getting overrun until the end of the first chapter at the wave clear section).\n\nIs this game good? Honestly, not yet. Yet being that key word. There's a lot of room for improvement, as this is still day one of an early access title. Should you get it now? Ehhhh, questionable. Someone has to be a lab rat. Which lab rats should it be? Hardcore RWBY fans will adore the voice actors and the visuals, which look like they were made for the show and put into a game. Every character sounds and feels like they would in a real combat fight, and the animations are absolutely stunning. The game play is severely lacking currently, and the story is... Non-existent to be fair.\n\nI won't give you a rating yet, but I would say if you're a RWBY fan, this is a game to pick up, if only for the sheer amounts of fanboy that will happen. If you're not a fan, I would stray away for now - The game is very unfinished, but in the future may be much better. Anything can happen.\n\nAs a RWBY fan, I recommend this, but don't for anyone that isn't (At the time of this review).\n\nTL:DR\n\nPros:\n+ RWBY cast voice actors.\n+ Awesome sound and animations that look like they should.\n+ Visuals are spot-on for the world of Remnant.\n\nCons:\n- Extremely basic combat and no complexity\n- Grows boring quickly due to low mechanical necessity.\n- Unfinished (Early access)\n- No customization\n\nSound 9.5/10, Graphics 9/10, Gameplay 2/10, recommended to (hardcore) fans *only* in current state.","December 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 459 of 581 people (79%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","79","459","581","23","15"

Of course, the game development isn't complete so there is only one chapter to play, and you may encounter a few glitches here and there. Do I recommend it in this stage of development? Yes, not just because I am a RWBY fan, but because the game is not broken like many other early access titles out there, and because the developpers will add more content in the future. Besides, they said the price would go up as more features are added, so get it now and pay less than if you wait!","December 18, 2015","true","9.1"," 96 of 101 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","96","101","4","0"

Be that as it may, this is a very GOOD Early Access title. Rooster Teeth has done an excellent job bringing the RWBY girls to the game world. If you like the show, get in on this at the ground level and show your support. For Monty!\n\nWhat I liked:\n>Combat is fluid and easy to pick up on\n>Animation and voices all match the source material\n>Each character has their own feel and abilities\n\nWhat I'd like to see done:\n>More combo attacks and finishers.

So if you´re a fan of the show, buy this game, is an order. Highly recommend it, and I´m expecting to see more characters in the future.\n\nPD:\n- Oobleck: "According to my map, you should be able to take a detour through the city´s old waterway system"\n- Yang: "Well, water we waiting for?!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ikey/recommended/418340/","ikey","Keychain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ikey/","861 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReally good base for what could eventually be one of my favorite games ever.  While I also would've really liked a turn-based RPG approach, a hack n slash is definitely the best way to transition RWBY into a video game.\n\nCharacters -\n\nThe characters themselves need to be worked on a lot more. They have a bit of a samey feel from one another, and it's not like you don't have a lot of things you could do for each of them to make them unique from one another. The upgrade tree could definitely go more in-depth and allow you to truly customize the way you play. Ranging from max aura, aura recharge, movement speed, attack speed, max special meter, increased special meter gain, and more. I really like what they're currently doing with upgrading your special abilities, they just need to branch out a bit. I also think they should add more special abilities per character, and allow you to pick 3 of them at any time.\n\nAlso, they really need to add more dialogue. The story is pretty much nonexistent in this game, as it is currently, it just seems like its nothing but random training assignments from various mentors from Beacon with very minimal communication between the actual team members.\n\nOnce they've gotten team RWBY down, all nice and polished, they should definitely add more teams! We all know people want to see JNPR. Not really sure how they would exactly handle this. Perhaps allow the host of a lobby to select what team will be used for the current map? But that's looking a bit too far right now, let's focus on getting RWBY completely done, in my opinion.\n\nLevels -\n\nThe game so far is really, really barebones and doesn't justify the 15$ price tag. There's just not much here. If you're buying your way into this at its current state, you should be doing it solely to provide feedback. There's a handful of levels to play through, most in which consist of defense sections with the exception of the last one, which is a modified payload mode. It definitely needs more variety from that standpoint. Having to defend every 5 minutes in each level is pretty tedious, and there's so many things you could do in exchange. Don't get me wrong, a few defense sections are okay. But they should be among a bunch of other gamemodes in order to mix things up to keep the player interested. Don't be afraid to become inspired by other games such as Warframe and TF2 in order to come up with new possible ways to make levels vary. It would be really cool to just have a level where your goal is to collect hidden artifacts, much like the beginning of Volume 1, and you have to fight the Crow and Scorpion Grimms.\n\nIt would be absolutely insane if they allowed us to do 8 player co-op, where two teams of 4 have to complete objectives in different parts of the map. Much like what went on during the first training session in RWBY Volume 1.\n\nAt the end, it is a really good base for what could become a great game. It is very, very far from it right now. I recommend it solely to people who want to provide feedback and help the game grow. But if you want your totally epic RWBY game that's finished, you'll have to wait a while for this game to make more progress.\n\n","December 12, 2015","true","3.0"," 83 of 90 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","83","90","0","0"

This makes it worth playing through several times in order to complete everyones trees. there are, however, some drawback. the game is small right now, and theres not much to do, some combo chains for two of the characters do not fully work, but that is the purpose of an early access, so you can help fix these bugs by reporting them. overall, this game is fun, replayable, and has ALOT of potential for the future, and i look forward to every update thats to come.","December 23, 2015","true","7.5"," 75 of 82 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","75","82","5","0"

Since purchase I have played this game every day and still I'm learning more from it. The graphics in this game are amazing. The game also is very balanced. For example if one out of four people leaves, the game lowers the difficulty.\n\nGraphics are really high in this game and it's suprising for an indie game. If you're laptop or other low end PC user, don't worry. You can still play this game on ''potato quality'' and it still looks really nice.\n\nVoice acting in this game is really good. It's really great to here your idols to give you tips or comment on your actions. Blake's voice acting though is really dull and quiet. I would like to hear her to say longer sentences and be louder. Otherwise the voice acting is pure gold.\n\nGameplay in this game is really good. The camera isn't annoying like in most of these kinda games and open areas gives more time to react on enemys' attacks. Exploring in this game is really fun and collectibles are really cool idea. Exp:s in crates are little annoying though. Only one player can get them and it breaks the coop gameplay. In my opinion they sholud be shared with a whole team.\n\nSo far there are only 4 playable characters. Don't worry if your favourite character is already taken. You can pick the same character as someone else has already taken. For example I always pick  Weiss and it would be pretty annoying if I couldn't be her.\n\nSo, if you're big fan of RWBY or Rooster Teeth itself, I would recommend giving it a try!","February 21","true","22.3"," 68 of 73 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","68","73","4","7"

Removed negative point about lack of single player and tutorial. All in all nothing has improved that much and they've made bad choices about the new character models.\n\nSo, main immediate issues of the game:\n* No player progression system, no customization, etc. Characters do level up in self-contained games, but you retain nothing once the game is done.\n* Despite being a cooperative game, in-game experience isn't shared by the team, encouraging players to screw each other over to level faster.\n* Dreadful lack of different enemy types.\n* Can't remap controls.\n* Can't customize graphics options thoroughly.\n* Hacking through hordes of enemies doesn't feel satisfying. There's not enough enemies, and enemies have a bit too much health, and tear you to shreds too fast. Feels nothing like the trailer!\n* Fair amount of bugs, especially graphical.\n* The models of the game, originally faithful to the show, now look ugly as sin, generic anime doll models that are actually freaky to look at. This game no longer looks like a RWBY game, it looks like a generic anime action game with a low budget.\n\nBut, hey, upsides:\n* Is early access, so one can expect huge additions to the game.\n* The base skeleton of the game is pretty solid.\n* Very responsive controls, although undocumented.\n\nFor the moment! Probably not worth its full price tag. It's fun for what it is, but not 15$ fun. It's a fun 4-player hack and slash, and you should look forward to what it will look like in a few months if they actually start adding stuff, fixing issues, etc., but at the moment it's a bit lackluster. This game more than most Early Access titles really IS Early Access quality.\n\nThis review will be updated when and if the game shapes up!\n\nJust to make it clear: I don't regret the purchase. I really do look forward to this being a full game. In the meantime though I can't recommend buying it without first acknowledging its downfalls and being sure you want it.\n\nAnd sorry, but no, I don't think "it's Early Access, you can't judge the game yet!" really flies. People are being asked to pay for it right now, not in one year, so it's important that people know what they're paying for right now.","December 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 795 of 1,180 people (67%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","67","795","1","55","31"

It's a hack-and-slash game, so if you have any experience playing a Dynasty Warriors type game, you'll feel right at home here. The game is as competitive as it is co-operative, and attacks feel satisfying to produce. The game has no difficulty levels. Youre difficulty varies from easy / medium by yourself, and medium / hard with other people.\nWhat got fixed\nThey added a chapter select option, something which was needed for a long time.\nSome graphics options such as SSAO and bloom have been added.\nWhat's not so good\nTL;DR for this bullet point: The models / textures could use some work. The models / shaders as of the current update are not representative of what the characters in the show look like. They seemed to have deteriorated from the show's quality for the purpose of optimization, but the design choice alienates higher end users that can render the show's models.\nThe main issue is the faces, but also extends to a reduced level of detail on the character models since the April Combat Revision patch.\n\n-     Ruby's skirt before the patch was a meandering, flowing skirt with ruffles underneath it. The new model gives Ruby's skirt a significantly more blocky and triangular appearance. The fluffy undercoat is now a blocky, solid model.\n-     Weiss's bolero's collar is now straight, compared to how it had ruffles before the update.\n-     Blake is missing the ruffles on her vest.\n-     The eye shape as well as the eyelashes of the characters has definitely been changed.\n\nThis is actually a major factor: If you play an anime game, you have some expectation it looks like the show it represents. Naruto games looks like Naruto anime. JoJo games looks like the JoJo anime. You get rid of that, you lose a lot of the appeal.\nThe sound design could use some work. This also has deteriorated since the April Combat Revision patch.\nLittle in the way of graphic options besides SSAO and bloom. You can control the overall level of detail, but the game always renders shadows and you have little control tweaking certain aspects of rendering feature-by-feature.\nProgression is limited; level is capped at 10. While not a big deal if you use the chapter select, a full playthrough will allow you to reach the level cap pretty easily, which isn't a good thing.\nContent is a little short for the current price point. A playthrough will take anywhere from only 90 minutes to 2 hours.\nI won't say I hate this game. I really want this game to be better. But for now, I have to give this game a negative review until the devs improve the quality of the game so its in line with what fans would want out of a game about the show they love.","May 6","false","12.8"," 100 of 134 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","100","134","7","0"

While some people gave valid points to issues in it, I think there are several things that people complain about that aren't really all that valid, and have decided to make my own review because of it. Lets get to the bad stuff first.\n\nCons:\n- Subtitles need some work\n- No difficulty adjustment for replaying levels\n- A few graphical and audio glitches here and there\n- Some work needed on blocking off areas you aren't supposed to be in\n\nThese were the main things that come to mind for me. Some people have listed other things that I quite frankly don't think need to be on the list. First one is the price tag. Is the game in it's currents state worth $15? No, but it's early access. I feel like people see early access and think of something like Day Z. That game in it's current state is worth what is charged to most people. Problem is that game has been in early access for years. There are other games like it that are at the end of the early access games, and some that just stay there but are pretty much done but use it to say that they periodically add large content patches like Minecraft does. This game, as of the time of this review, has just hit early access, and RT is fully taking advantage of the title. This game is far from a finished product and you slapping down the $15 is kinda like a donation with benefits really. You give them money so they can keep making the game, they give you access to it while it's in developement and can give feedback. If you want a polished, complete game worth $15, don't get it. If you want to support the concept and idea of the game, or RT in general, pick it up. There are also complaints about combat being too repetative, but I feel like unlocking the challange perks and remebering the blast attacks adds more than people give it credit for. More variation is not something I would be opposed to, but at this point I don't think the combat deserves such a bad rap from people. Also, people don't seem to like levels not carrying over. The thing is, with this type of game that just wouldn't work. If I hit level ten then rerun from the beginning, I'm gonna be destroying everything no problem. Add that to the fact that I wouldn't be able to get anymore perks since I'm at the level cap and couldn't expiriment with new skills, and you see that it just doesn't work. As long as they find a good way to keep levels going when they add more levels and content, this system works just fine. Lastly, I've seen complaints that swarms of enemies keep you from combing too easily with attacks that can't be intterupted. Personally, I havn't had a problem with this after my first playthrough. I won't go into details as this is long enough already, but teamates are there for a reason and so are evades. Use them right and you should be fine.\n\nNow to the good things.\nPros:\n- Well voice acted\n- Great art design and character models\n- Interesting abilities and a nice leveling system\n- Characters keep their personalities from the show\n- Alternate paths and challanges give some level of replayability.\n- Interesting enemies with variation\n\nI can't say much to the plot since it isn't very developed so far, but I think it looks good for now. We won't realy know until more comes out. Hopefully this sheds some light on the game for everyone, along with why some of the cons really aren't cons.\n\nFinal verdict, get it if you like the idea of the game and want to support it or RT, as it is fun so far and has great groundwork, but don't expect a huge amount of content until later in development. Happy hunting!","December 12, 2015","true","7.3"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","39","42","0","0"

BUT there are still alot of issues that need to be fixed, and alot of features that need to be added (like a proper singleplayer mode, and the ability to change your controls). Also there's one more thing great about this game, the community, this is the first time i've experienced game with a GOOD community that isn't toxic and actually enjoy playing the game. So if your RWBY fan this is an instant purchase, if you're not I would wait until more content is added.\n\nRWBY Grim Eclipse is pretty YANGtastic.

I know it's in early access for a reason but thats what we're here for, criticism to make a better game.\nPros:\n- Fun as hell gameplay\n- Amazing enviroments and player models\n- The small little qwerks and jokes (such as the lowest setting to play on is Potato)\n\nCons:\n- It's got that Destiny level design. Kill, dialogue, defend, kill, dialogue, repeat\n- The optimizations a little lacking (I know they just added it in the recent update)\n-  Story is a lacking\n\nWhat they need to add:\n- More optimization for shorter end PC's (like the potato i run on)\n- More story. That way it doesn't get bland and repetitive fast\n- More Customization. (Characters, skills, costumes, etc..)\n\nI reccomend at least picking up this game to support the developers and it's fun enough to ignore its flaws.

UPDATE 1 AND 2 REVIEW !!!\n\nThis game is great. If you are a fan of RWBY I highly reccomend you pick this up, if not, maybe take a pass. Even in early access it is quite good. The sights and sounds match the show and it really feels like the world of remnant. For those wondering there is about 12 hours of gameplay. It's about 3 hours per character to unlock all challenges. There are a few issues with the game such as animation errors,  being able to go outside the map in a few places, and Weiss being able to get her third level upgrade for her ranged attack without getting the second prior but those will probably be ironed out when the full game is released. There's also a few glitches I hope they don't patch such as the burning Yang glitch. In the end it is a really fun game and experience.\n\n!!! UPDATE 3 REVIEW !!!\nThe new update makes a lot of changes, some good and some meh. The graphics look amazing as every and the new combat feel so much smoother. I like how they added a offline mode as well. I do have some issues though. This new camera is really strange to me, it keeps rotating when I try to attack and that isn't something I like. Also I got used to the new ultimate system but I much prefer the old special system. Two of the old specials have been moved into combo moves which is okay but I still prefer special. They also patched some glitches but I miss going outside the map :P (also rip the burning Yang glitch....you will always be my fave ;_;)","January 5","true","31.4"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","0"

I have followed this game since its inception and it has not let me down yet. GE (Grimm Eclipse) is a hack and slash game which can be played with upto four people. The basis of GE, RWBY, is an animated show released by RoosterTeeth, and this game shows how amazing that company can be.\n\nThe story is still pretty bare bones, but is constantly being added to as the updates roll out. However, the story in GE is seperate from RWBY, from Volume 2 of the show on. This is great as it allows the devs to have fun with the IP they got.\n\nThe gameplay, where do i begin, is freaking awesome. Think Metal Gear Rising: Revengance with 4 highschool girls in a world where the normal rules of physics are thrown out of the window. Each character has their own play style, and moves to complement said style. Personally I play as Weiss Schnee. She is more of the mage character, as she is more support and area based with her moves than the rest of her team. While i do mainly play as Weiss, i have unlocked all the special skills for every character. While it can take some time if you do it on your own, playing with others, whether its friends or random people, is much more enjoyable and will net you more kills.\n\nGraphically it looks breath taking. This game is built in unity, so be prepared for bright colours and amazing models. There are a few different graphical settings: Potato, for if you dont have the best PC/Laptop, Normal, and Ultra, which is what i run. There is no V-Sync, however with the right settings it will run at a buttery smooth 60FPS.\n\nAll in all this game is really enjoyable and if you have the money, give it a go, you will not regret it!\n\nI rate this game a 9.5/10, but keep in mind this is still an early access game.","March 18","true","37.8"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","34","39","2","6"

I'll start with the cons since they're the most urgent\n\nCONS:\n-Performing an action right before moving (jumping, attacking etc) causes a small graphical glitch where your charcter will freeze and sorta slide across the map\n- The game has a system where it adjusts the difficulty level based on the number of people in the lobby. It doesn't work very well. My entire team just disconnected all at once, and it was impossible to beat the waves. Especially annoying since I was only a couple hundred exp away from my first level 10.\n-You can't move while you're allocating your points and there's no designated "power up your character" places, which leads you to getting left behind while your teammates run on ahead of you\n-No voice commands. It's not really a complaint, more like something that would be interesting to implement. Source games have the option to press either Z,X, or C to open up a menu of voice commands and numbers 1-9 to have your character say something specific\n-Maps are a bit linear, which discourages exploration. There are however, little things (like artifacts) you can find for extra xp. An open world feature would probably be an eyesore seeing the same 4 characters running around, but something more open would be appreciated. I'm not sure if there are side quests in the game, as I haven't came across any.\n-As it is right now, the storymode is very very short. I know additional chapters are on the way as the game's description's already promised more things to come though. However, since this is a review of the current state of GE as it is, I had to include it.\n\n\nPROS:\n-The voice acting is fantastic. The actors in the RWBY anime voice their own characters in the game\n-Something really interesting I've noticed is that when you're fighting in an echoey place, the sounds of the explosions and your weapons echoes too. It's neat. The voices will echo too.\n-The music fits. I'm not sure who did it. It's not great, but it's also not bad\n-Keyboard control works perfectly fine, you don't need a controller\n-Potato quality :D\n-Different playthroughs with different characters cause them to say different things. It adds variety!\n-The characters all feel different. I've beaten the campaign as everyone, hit level 10 (max level) as everyone, and unlocked everything as everyone.\n- The (4?) creators are doing a real bang up job releasing timely updates!\n-Most importantly, it's a RWBY game. Lets be honest, none of us would probably have bought early access if it was another hack-n-slash by Joe-Blo production company\n\nOverall, it's a fun game if you're a fan of the RT show. If you've never heard of RWBY, you probably won't enjoy this. It is still in early access though, so bugs are to be expected. I'm sure Monty would be proud of the completed game if he could see it :)\n\n\nI'll update my review as the game progresses. In the mean time, enjoy this short gameplay clip ^.^\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbyJgf3F1dQ","December 1, 2015","false","31.6"," 214 of 345 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","214","345","8","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaconclay/recommended/418340/","jaconclay","Jacon Clay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaconclay/","238 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR- I am a big fan of the RWBY video series. I find this game is worth what I paid for it as I've throughly enjoyed the hours I've played it. While it does have flaws they're easy to over look as it's fresh release early access and I've spent more money on worse games than this. From what I see there is a solid ground work laid for the Developer to build a great game off of as it comes out of EARLY ACCESS. Worth it IMO.\n\nLong Version- I am a fan of RWBY, while I love the series I'll be as honest as I can about the games short comings. I've spent almost 9 hours so far playing this game, and I'm still enjoying it.\n\nThe game is early access, this is sometimes brutally apparent on some of the graphical/sound glitches  you will come across (there have been far fewer visual/sound glitches since the first patch). It also only has two levels you can currently play. The character customization (skill tree) is very basic but the system is there to be built upon. So far the game has not crashed and I've been running it on max settings. I've had no problems jumping into online games or having other people jumping into my online games. While it's not really a single player option you can play solo by creating your own lobby and setting it to friends only while you're in "offline" mode, but at this point in time it's the same as multiplayer. There are no character saves, so every time you start a new game you have to progress from character Level 1. The good news is kills and unlocked skills DO stay when you make new characters so you don't have to struggle like hell. I would like to think that Rooster Teeth will finish polishing this game until is shines like the show it's based on.\n\n\nPRO list:\n\n•Voice acting has real voice actors.  (go team RWBY!)\n\n•3 days after early release they fixed the sound glitches, no more bleeding ears!\n•Also fixed the bugs where soundFX would cancel out voices.\n•Also fixed many of the terrain level visual glitches. And the uneven surface gravity glitch.\n\n•Character personas are like their series counterparts\n\n•Visually appealing environments even though it is early access.\n\n•Minor (very minor, like I've only seen one on each zone) route changes on maps. You're not always running down the same paths. (I can only hope this might one day have some randomization to locations like Mountain Glen.)\n\n•Super easy controls for mindless smash and bash fun. I've used Keyboard and Xbox controllers happily.\n\n•Quick match is actually quick, I've never spent more than 10 seconds before being connected to a game.\n\n•Skill Challenges and Unlocked Utilities are saved so if you grind it's yours.\n\n•It is fun\n\n\n\nCON list:\n\n•Only 2 maps currently. Each map has two sectors but it's still kinda small feeling.\n\n•Skill tree is kinda basic currently. (I'd like to see more of the characters Semblance powers)\n\n•Ranged attack kinda targets what it wants when it wants unless your enemies are close. And sometimes then also. (I'm talking to you Weiss...)\n\n•Invisible walls, as far as the eye can see. Or can't see, they're invisible after all...\n\n\n\nCharacter classes based off my opinions:\nRuby- Range OP, can also do some decent AoE damage with Crescent Rose if she's in a pinch.\nWeiss- Crowd Control, dat Ice Queen freeze is nice in a pinch. Myrtenaster not that great of damage.\nBlake- Airial assualt, spent most of my time juggling enemies and up in the air. Gambol Shroud gun doesn't cause knock back either\nYang- Bruiser/melee, her Ember Celica seems to hit the hardest of all though it's gun range is super short it still packs a punch.\n\n\nIs it worth it?\nIf you're a fan of Monty Oum's RWBY and you're looking to support his legacy then I highly recomend this game.\nIf you're looking for a 4 player co op hack and slash, I found the game to be a worthwhile investment.\nFrom what I've seen in game I honestly think that this game will go places and be well worth it.","December 2, 2015","true","19.2"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","31","39","2","0"

I can't recommend this anymore.\nThis game used to be fun to play and beautiful to look at, ran really smoothly, and for an early access game was pretty stable.\nBut now, the models that used to be almost 1:1 exact to their models from the show are now replaced these cheap knockoffs. The update runs at some really bad framerates even on the lowest settings. The lighting can get really obnoxious, the biggest offender being at the end Forever Fall part two, where near the end of the level after defeating a wave of grimm you are greeted by THIS GIANT SUN IN YOUR FACE.

Ontop of that, there are parts of some levels that you can now fall through the floor, or cause the stage to CLIP THROUGH ITSELF. None of this was a problem in the previous update.\nThey've also made attacks weaker, making Grimm take longer to kill. What was once a fun gameplay style turns into a chore when waves now take FOREVER to finish.\nThe enjoyment factor for this game has gone down TREMENDOUSLY. If this is the direction this game is going in, then count me out. I'm done. I used to be hyped for a RWBY game was hoping it would eventually come to consoles so I can get some of my friends in on this too. But as it stands now, I can't recommend this.\nI hope the dev team proves me wrong with future updates. I backed up the previous update and now I'm reverting back to it. So I can remember the fun times this game used to be.","May 6","false","7.7"," 62 of 93 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","62","93","6","7"

I totally recommend this game to anyboby who liked games like the dynasty warrior series.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game, is the lack of levels. 4 levels for 1 campagne is just way to short! I know this is an early access build and they will implement 3 different campaigns, but still 4 levels for each one of those 3 campaigns isn't the right ammount to catch the interrests of an gamer. I played 3h now and I'm starting to get bored. This lack of levels is the only downsite I have on this game.\n\nI really hope that RTG will change their concept with 4 levels or at least make the levels bigger.\n","April 18","true","5.7"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","29","37","2","0"

At the time of writing, Team RWBY are the only available characters.\n\nSo, I'll try explain thegameplay.\nYou play as a character, and you have 3 abilities plus a melee and ranged attack.\n\nAs you play, you will unlock upgrades, which will stay unlocked forever, unless you reset your profile (Which i assume is basically locking everything again so you can re-unlock them)\n\nAs you defeat enemies and collect artifacts, you get Exp and level up (Up to 10 in Early Access) and will get points to spend on skills, such as Armour Piercing bullets or stronger Aura.\n\nSo, after reading a very brief description, is it fun?\nShort Answer, Yes.\n\nLong Answer, Yes BUT it can get repetitive. In Early Access, theres 4 levels, in which you run around, Kill Grimm, find a Centre, Kill more Grimm with a boss Grimm of some sort and end of level. Its basically that.\n\nSo... If you like games like Dynsaty Warriors, its kinda like that. One-Four Huntresses against a horde of Grimm.

If you are a fan of the show AND like the game genre, then it is a must have.\n\nThe gameplay feels pretty solid, typical weak/strong attack combos, although a bit simplified and clunky-ish at the moment there is always more room to improve.  Currently there is only one campaign with 4 stages, which takes about 30-45 minutes to complete, so there isn't much in the content department as of now.\n\nAlso, there isn't much variety in enemy types as of now, but will definitely expand for sure.\n\n*edit 1-15-16* I forgot to add, one gripe i have with this game currently is the lack of offline (no internet required) play. you have to be connected to the internet to play any game.\n\nThis may be a turn off to some because not everyone has a good internet connection to play or they live in areas with no service at all (but have to go elsewhere for internet). I would also like to mention that during a game if you disconnect you get kicked from the game and have to start a new game back at level 1 again.\n\nI do hope the devs will implement an offline feature in the future, i do not see any harm in this. This game feels like it should be able to play offline, due to the kind of game it is.\n\nOverall, besides the very minor graphical glitches, my experience has been a very positive one and I feel this game will be one of the best games to own in the future.","December 29, 2015","true","92.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","6"

Its very basic and the 'campaign' can be completed in less than an hour. What keeps it standing so far is the intriguing ways that it divides the skills of Team RWBY into different trees that all manage to feel cohesive and part of the RWBY universe.\n\nThe visuals are actually fairly nice, but the voice acting is flat and disappointing. They have some intersting mechanics that make me feel like there is more this game has to offer in the future. I do, however, have to strictly recommend this game only to die-hard fans. I don't regret the purchase myself, despite the current product being a bit underwhelming. I look forward to seeing what will happen with it in the future.

Its feel more of a mix between a demo to a 5$ game worth, then a 15$ early access to me. I mean when I play games that 15$ like don’t starve, legend of korra and octodad which has more hours you can put into it then this game, I feel it’s a bit unfair atm.\n\nAlso keep in mind, half of the positive reviews are the fandom speaking, not the gamer, if this was a re-skin of a different series and made by different devs, especially they weren't so popular and love by, this game would had the real honest reviews of  a mostly negative or mix reviews(especially since this game is no different from the poorly done hack and slash movie license  games like Thor and Green lantern from 2011) so if you a huge RWBY fan and not much a general gamer this game for you but if you're a general gamer that cares about the work and content it provides, then don't bother with this game until it's out of early access so in its Current state is a 3/10 as of now...But anyway let’s get down to the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\n- Its RWBY, I never watch the anime or have no plan to but I actually respect the community and even for the game it’s not that bad.\n\n-I actually love the leveling system and skill tab system they have, seem pretty balanced and far off great.\n\n- Graphics is really beautiful for an anime game, play on ultra-high settings and the bloom effect in the background is just beautiful.\n\n-voice acting is pretty neat and look like they put forth effort into it.\n\nCons\n\n-Only 4 levels, it took me just an hour to beat, even if it’s in early access, I don’t find this acceptable imo\n\n-No combos in it, just hit left click  as your main attacks and right click as your Alt-Attack and your 123 keys, congratulation, you know how to master all the characters.\n\n-Enemy’s feel like they’re missing attacks animation’s and a bit too easy imo, even if your health bar about to go to zero, you can just run around and in 3 seconds, your health bar is full again, hopefully they can change that or else the game is to easy and un-fit.\n\n-They say is like a dynasty warriors and left 4 dead mix into it, but feels more like  dungeon defenders and Anarchy Reigns cause of the lack of combos and all the mission is just defending machines and areas. I mean imo if it’s to be a mix of left for dead and dynasty warriors, I suspect  more combos, capturing areas and bases and huge waves of enemies to get over thousands of kills and more areas to explore and less invisible walls.\n\n- No save progression and or anything to keep your character stats save, also the level cap is 10, at its state just repeat the game over and over again until they bring more content.\n\n-And finally slow updates and content been coming, been 3 months since the game posted as of the day I edit this review and barely any content and father more  it seem half other RWBY fandom think this is ok, which is not of course.\n\nI kind of saw this coming when the game was 1st on green light and I knew it wasn’t’ going to be all that great, but before you post any negatives comments or give me a thumbs down, I’m actually impress with it so far and think rooster teeth doing great, just at the current state I can’t give it a thumbs up and how the community being "to positive" with this game, maybe when it feels like 15$ or more then it is right now. I’ll give it a thumbs up. I also only brought the game for friend reason and have no interest to seeing the anime.","December 9, 2015","false","1.0"," 107 of 180 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","107","180","5","21"

Whenever you think you've gotten bored, you're truly not!\n\nBefore reading please understand that I am a very hardcore fan of Rooster Teeth's RWBY animated series though my feedback is presented after playing the game's unfinished 1st campaign with two different playthroughs.\n\nYou see a beautiful main menu screen upon opening this game that entails the bright and graphically handsome visuals of Emerald Forest, a slowly/mildly turning camera around the mis-én-scene. You have three options (I believe); PLAY, SETTINGS and EXIT (QUIT).\n\nUnder the settings you will find that you can choose between potato (yes potato), standard (neutral graphical settings, not too high but not too potato either) :-) and lastly ultra, which maxes out everything and gives you a bloom effect. Sadly there is no advanced graphical setting at this current time however it is acceptable seeing that this is at its pre-alpha (or alpha) stage. If you are a user who owns a beast (or even fairly decent) computer, chances are you are very capable of running it at ultra, the game has little recommended requirements, I get a SOLID 60 fps (hell, it even goes to 61 at times!)\n\nYou will very rarely experience the occasional fps spike when appearing in a large crowd of Grimm, though it is expected after all! Additionally, you will also SOMETIMES see your character's running animation freeze for a few miliseconds when advancing along a steep path and/or bumpy path.\n\nI first started this game with no other than Weiss Schnee (Yep, not Ruby! Weiss-o serious?). I got the YANG of this game after a good few minutes of gameplay and if I may say so myself, it is pretty great in comparison to other early access Steam games at a very early alpha stage.\n\nIf you are looking to buy this, please understand that the developers are doing their best so expect faults! They gave this beauty to us at an alpha stage to enjoy as they continue to create more content. I asked a game developer and he said they're hoping to update the game monthly assuming progress is going swell.\n\nFinally, at this present time there is only one campaign and it is incomplete. You will experience around a couple hours worth of gameplay to rack up (average imo).\n\nTL;DR -\n\nIf you want to support Roosterteeth's RWBY Game Team then please buy this game, it is HEAPS of fun with friends! Rate: 9/10 (alpha rating).\n\n+ PROS +\n\n+ It's A FREAKING RWBY GAME!\n+ RWBY cast voice actors\n+ Yang puns\n+ GOOO TEAM RWBY!\n+ Addictive and fun\n+ Great gameplay for early alpha game\n+ No bugs with monsters that I've seen (Grimm)\n+ 4 player coop is well optimized\n+ Performance is a solid 7-8/10\n\n- CONS -\n\n- Occasional momentary FPS spikes (for me it went down from 60 to 38-41 but immediately shot back up to a solid 60)\n- Can't move your camera up higher than average camera height\n- Not enough usage of RWBY music ( + not loud enough)\n- You don't keep your level and skills after leaving your game session and going into another one\n- Yang doesn't make noises when she fights (not that I can hear)\n- Semblances aren't 100% complete for each character\n\nCan't think of any more cons, though the ones I've listed already are easily fixable as the developers release updates as time goes by. :)","December 1, 2015","true","21.6"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","30","43","11","6"

If the programmers stick to It I am sure this will be a success on the lines of Left for Dead.\n\nAs a fan of RWBY I can say that the team synergy is there, your constantly diving into groups of mobs on top of your team mates, when there down you instantly look to revive them. You know what your getting yourself into and that is a hack and slash game that is in the style of the RWBY world that is in its early stages.\n\nThe Game is not all sunshine and rainbows, do not expect to start this and have saved character builds, customisation or even keeping your level.\n\nHowever we need to remember that in its stage we are still TESTING the game, there will be bugs (none that I have seen) there will be features that you want, if you do not support the product we will not get them.\n\nI will recommed this game, I will recommend it not for the future alone, but the state its in now.

Thats my short review of RWBY. now for the longer review..\n\nFirst thing first, since this is a hack and slash action game the combat need to be really good. Soo, how is RWBY: Grimm Eclipse combat ? It got a lot of potential, but right now there isn't anything that you can do when encountering enemies except to press the dodge button when they about to attack and then press the attack button 8 times to do that 8 hit combo. There isn't any combining 2 to 3 of different attack button to combo your attack, just 1 button for attack, one button for dodge, and occasionally use the skill button to do 1 of the 3 skill available, long range skill, AoE skill to hit all the enemies around you, and another AoE skill that hit all the enemies in front of you. I have to admit its pretty awesome  when you keep the combo going by keep hitting the enemies, but the overall combat mechanic at this current state ? Its not really that great.\n\nThe leveling system in this game is per match basis, so you didn't carry your level when you change the map, kinda like DotA 2 as the developer said. But, how is the leveling so far ? There isn't anything interesting in it, you didn't even feel that great when you level up since you didn't earn a new combo or anything, you only can choose what essentially a damage buff to all your existing skill, a health buff, a regeneration buff, and all other sort of other buff. That didn't make you feel more powerful then before. They really need to improve this if they want to make a great game, make it so that you learn new combo or add a new skill that you can use or something.\n\nThe graphics itself its really good, it really capture the series aesthetic even though its natural for them to do that since the company that make the cartoon animation is the same as the company that make the game, they could just pulled the guy/gal that draw and make the cartoon animation to make the game animation. Well i have to point out that i have suffer a one second random freeze during my playthrough, even though my laptop isn't that great but it can run both Fallout 4 and GTA V, i'm sure it should be able to run this without any hiccup.\n\nThe plot and the story of this............. Its kinda been told just from the voice acting of the teacher to tell you to do stuff and tell you whats going on, like "what is the boxes doing here i wonder, ohh ! It was from *this* company ! Why they would do such a thing !" there isn't any cutscene at this current state. The main characters also said something sometimes, like Ruby said "Yay ! More Grimm to kill !" or something like that. Truth to be told, as long as the combat is good, we don't need a story.\n\nIn the end, just like what i was said in the first paragraph of this review, if you are not a desperate hardcore fans that need more RWBY or a really supportive person that likes to support the series that you loved. Wait until they perfected the game before you buy it.\n\nNow i will list all the lack of content and bug that i see in this game:\n-Lack of animation in a lot of thing like going downward from a ramp, or walking reallly slow using a controller.\n-In one of my playthrough, i get stuck in the terrain and cannot get out, game breaking bug.\n-Only have one campaign which took about an hour to complete.\n-Cannot change mouse and analog sensitivity in game.\n-Cannot change the control.\n-You could walk through some of the terrain.\n-The running animation feels a bit, floaty.\n-One second freeze and fps drop which a bit annoying.\n\nBut !!! You might be asking to yourself, why you thumb this up if nearly all that you said in the review are a bad thing ??

The controls are fairly responsive and has a variety of attacks along with great character models and voice acting.  The game looks very good! You can't expect them to make it look realistic, it would ruin the Animeish feel.  There is currently a few bugs, but that is to be expected from an early access game.  The bugs don't even harm the gameplay.  Currently, if you're not too much of a fan of the RWBY series, $15 is a bit steep, but if you really like the Animated series and want to contribute, go ahead! It's a really nice game!\n\nPros:\n-Great animations\n-Voice acting is good\n-Character models\n-Feels like the Anime\n-Fun\n-High Replayability\n-Great if you have friends that also own it\n-Multiplayer is great\n-Monters are good\n-Game Looks good overall\n\nCons:\n-Currently has a short storyline\n-Has some bugs\n-Needs to be optimised a little (You really shouldn't need a gtx 650 ti as a reccomended card)\n-Subtitles need a little work\n-Needs a way to adjust the difficulty\n\n9/10 <- First impression.","December 18, 2015","true","7.3"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

Being early access it's not "perfect" but then again seldom is any pc game even when released. Being limited to 4 playable characters is fin for now, hopefully other teams will be added as they progress (would really love to run around as Nora ^.^). Combat is fast paced, storyline so far is interesting, love that instead of outsourcing like most games based on a franchise do, that they have the cast themselves supplying the VO. All in all for it being an early access game and for the price, it's worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metruzero/recommended/418340/","metruzero","Zero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metruzero/","246 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me start off by saying, I don't recommend this RIGHT NOW. For reasons I'll state below.\n\nFirst off, I understand it's in Early Access and there will be improvements, if the improvements are good then I'll happily change my rating.\n\nCons:\nNo lock on?\nThis game is incredibly inconsistent with what locks on, and what doesn't. I've had attacks from weiss hit monsters at point blank and the next one right after flies right over and hits nothing. And other times,  I've had moves miss someone in front of me, but then that same move a minute later will do a 90 degree turn and hit someone next to me.\n\nThe sound design is atrocious, the voice acting is obviously fine at the moment, but the sound effects, hit sounds, falling, aura recharge(Oh dear lord RIP headphone users) are all terrible, there's so much audible clutter. The characters grunt all the time, the weapon hit sounds all sound the same and lack any real distinction. And the aura recharge will actually blow out your ears if you're not careful with the volume. And also, did I mention there's no SFX slider in options? I checked.\n\nGameplay\nCharacters all play the same, it's left click spam to win. They have minor variation in skills and hitboxes for those skills. But while playing them, I've found there's no real big distinction in gameplay. All monsters are extremely easy and brainless to fight, I feel like I'm playing Dynasty warriors but they just gave the enemies more health, so imagine the fun of mowing down enemies in dynasty warriors, without the fun, you just slowly grind through a giant mob. And the "challenge" is when they all gang up on you, which works I guess if you're bad.\n\nProgression: Progression makes no sense, in a 4 player non competitive co op game. Why have progression be limited to only in each individual game, if you aren't gonna have progression carry over between games, it just feels lame to spend all that time leveling a character only to lose all those levels next game. And xp makes little sense, because it doesn't encourage team work, players that get the most kills, perform the best, revive the most people get the most xp. I've had one person yell at me for reviving someone because if he did, he would've leveled or something. Why should this be a problem in a co op game? You should reward the player for playing the game, period.\n\nThe pros:\nIt's RWBY, if you like the show, you'll probably love the final product. But let me say, I love RWBY, but right now, this feels more like a cheap sell out game than a great addition to the franchise.\n\nWill they add more that improves the game? I hope so, but at the moment, I can't honestly go to my friends and say, "Hey, let's all spend 15 dollars and play this game together." Perhaps in the future. But the way I see this, why should I play this game when I can play a game like vindictus, that has deeper combat for each character, a lot of content and progression and is free?","December 1, 2015","false","1.7"," 81 of 140 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","81","140","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neptrocity/recommended/418340/","Neptrocity","Neptrocity Michael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neptrocity/","188 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nThis game is a very fun experience to play through.  It is still in early development and it shows, but with time this game can really shine and become something amazing.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:  I obtained this game as a gift and the game is in Early-Access at the time of review.  I try to be middle of the ground when reviewing but this still must be noted**\n\nGameplay\nOver View\nGRIMM ECLIPSE is a third person "hack and slash" game (as seen by the tags) that uses the Rooster Teeth RWBY franchise.  Players have the ability to choose who to play as between the four protagonists of the series:  Ruby, Tang, Weiss, and Blake.  In a cooperative (or solo) group the players battle through hordes and waves of enemies.  As somebody kills enemies they obtain experience points that level players up; at each level an ability point is gained.  This point can be spent to improve the abilities of the chosen character or saved for more expensive upgrades (the most costing 2 points).\n\nOne flaw with the gameplay is that it gets repetative after a few hours.  It is a fun, a truely fast paced game, but once the charm of it fades then the game begins to feel the same...\n\nDifficulty\nThe difficulty of RWBY GRIMM ECLIPSE was slightly disappointing.  Traditionally "hack and slash" games are not very difficult so it isn't a huge deal.  Players can utilize the ranged attacks and strong attacks to blow through most enemies that the game throws at the player.  The upgrade system makes it feel like players are significantly stronger then every enemy at times while other times it feels like you are a level 1 again.  The game has a lack of difficulty settings that creates a disconnect for people who have experience with these types of games.  If a difficulty setting could be added then the game would be more appealing for both casual and players looking for a challenge.\n\n\nGame Settings\nThis game as very few adjustable settings for game customization.  The video settings are very lacking in their options, there is a fullscreen button, a resolution option (with 3-4 resolutions), and a single graphical adjuster.  This isn't a big deal as the game isn't terribly resource intensive, but on lower end machines expect to play on "potato" settings on a tiny window (I mean one of the smallest I have ever seen). There is no master volume slider which can be disorienting if you want to lower every sound equally; not a big deal but is a slight inconvenience.\n\n\nPerformance\nThe performance of this game is what is to be expected from an early access game; some spots run perfectly while others produce an intense amount of lag.  During play play I would experience frame drops occasionally but only near certain spots (like near a single wall).  The nature of these lag spikes indicate that small parts of maps are not optimized well or have a lot of things to be rendered near them.  Generally my computer (containing a GTX 745, i7-4790) ran the game at frames above 50fps.\n\nI have tested slightly with a 6 year old Dell Studio 15 laptop on the lowest resolution with potato graphics settings.  The game is playable frame rate wise but the small resolution causes the character to be left off screen at times.  It can still be enjoyable if you really want it to be...\n\nOnline play was pretty smooth with occasional jumps (to be expected from every game).  This was reassuring as it meant the game engine was well optimized for online play, a major piece of this game.\n\n\nOne last test system was a custom built computer with a GTX 980, i7-4790K and the general framerates were good.  There was some bazar shuddering of the camera that wasn't traditional lag on this machine (my first mentioned machine experience the same thing from time to time, but not this severe).  I do not know what caused this skipping.\n\nArt and Sound\nRWBY:  GRIMM ECLIPSE really excels in its art style and sound design.  The game looks like the RWBY web-series, it is nice to see a game that sticks close with the material it is given.  The graphics made me feel like I was enjoying another episode of the hit series, I was hoping for this and Rooster Teeth delivered.  The scenery can look beautiful so don't just blow through the game if you decide to buy!\n\nFrom a sound standpoint the game sounds like it should.  It has a pretty good balance and it sounds like what you would expect.  The only complaint was no master sound slider as mentioned earlier.\n\nRoom To Grow\nThis game has a lot of room to grow but it is still an enjoyable experience.  I got through the current campaign in about an hour of game time.  This wasn't a bad thing as it is still early-access and a big update is scheduled to come out soon.  Unfortunately, this game automatically takes people back to the lobby after they get as far as the game allows and everybody loses their levels.  This was unfortunate as it felt like an hour wasted for progress sake.  I hope the final game supports a save of character feature so players don't lose their level 10 Chitty Chatty Yang Yang.\n\nThe last major complaint is how similar all the characters left.  Each of the four characters had a different cosmetic look to them but the way they feel is very similar.  Some characters might have different roles overall but at this point they all felt the same amount of "featherless".\n\nAdd content, optimize the game more, and make the characters a little bit more distinguished and the game will be improved a ton!  In its current state I do recommend buying RWBY: GRIMM ECLIPSE if you have friends who are also going to play it.  If you are not a big fan of RWBY I still recommend it if you are a fan of hack and slash games and want to try something new.\n\nNOTE:  Over time the price will increase as the game is updated so consider soon if you want to have a lower cost for a potentially higher benefit!\n","May 4","true","3.3"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","17","23","2","0"

However, as it is at the moment, it is simply not worth the asking price of £10.99. It's fun for a while, sure, but the combat is currently very repetitive and dull. You move from area to area killing Grimm that spawn around you and search around for XP drops. Occasionally you'll have to defend a point for X amount of waves... you get the picture. The actual gameplay is very reminescent of something like DMC or Bayonetta, although it is very barebones at the moment. There are promises of extra areas and new characters coming soon, and I'm sure in time we'll have a whole host of content to play around with, different game modes and characters, etc. Don't get me wrong, I like this game and the show it's based off a lot, it just isn't worth it at the moment unless you're a die-hard RWBY fan.

The camera, oh god the camera whenever i attacked it would have a stroke. in combat i was flailing wildly because all i could see was dirt. but here is the worst thing. after the forever fall update happened almost the day after i installed and played it for the first time. it wont even launch! it will not work whatsoever currently. i get the logo and ruby say "Ohh yea" and then it closes the game. and from everything i heard they completely ruined the character models from being like they literally took the models from the show to being about as high resolution as Mappy.

There was a lot of content in this one.  Extended the multiplayer and singleplayer campaign to about an hour total now.  The visuals and animations are a LOT more polished, although I do kind of miss the Borderlands esque shader that gave it that more cartoony edge, for some reason its missing in my game and I don't know if thats intentional or not.  As far as the taunts go, it is great to finally have them, however each character only gets one taunt and it can get kind of repetative and annoying hearing the other teammates doing the same taunt 20 times in a row.  The new map is beautiful by the way.  And I really like the incorperation of the new enemies.  Keep up the great work RT!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (2.1 Hours, 5/5/2016) -- I love this game.  The combat is probably my favorite part... blending aspects of Kingdom Hearts and Dynasty Warriors.  The music is amazing, and the voice acting (though there isn't that much voice acting) is solid and engaging.  It's really cool how the gameplay runs like a Left 4 Dead combined with Kingdom Hearts.  Also, unlike most games nowadays there really aren't any bugs (at least none that I have encountered in my short gameplay so far).\n\nI only have a few criticisms, and I'm assuming they will be fixed with the upcoming updates;  Content wise, at 2.1 hours I have already beaten the "campaign" twice, this is quite short so far, but tomorrows update may extend the campaigns length.  There also is not much of a variety of enemies, but that is generally to be assumed from early access.  It seems they are promising more enemies later on towards the actual launch.\n\nSome things im not quite sure about (positives or negatives, you decide); The developer isn't very clear/open with the community about upcoming content.  This may be a good thing in that they are focusing more on development rather than marketing, however, it could also be bad in that there isn't much forthcoming content.  Im not sure which it is, but we will figure out soon enough.\n\nAll that aside, I have had an insane amount of fun playing this game, and it would be interesting to see where it goes with PvP / Team PvP as well.  As I said I have played through the "campaign" twice and found it very enjoyable so far.  I can see myself spending much more time replaying it with friends.  I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good hack n' slash game that's not overly complex and is willing to support a developer and wait a bit for new content.","May 6","true","7.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

None whatsoever. CLass synergy is afantastic way to make multiplayer more fun for everyone, as it stands there is really no reason to play omline unmless it's with friends. Character/Class sybergy could go a long way towards making this game a bit less repetitive, which brings us nicely into my second complaint with the game: it gets repetitive quickly. You only have two regular attacks and three special attacks, and there are no combos in the game, turning what looks like a fun hack-and-slash into a repetitive button masher, where you spam regular attacks to recharge your special attack meter, rinse and repeat ad nauseum. ANd since all the characters start out with all of their special attacks unlocked, there is never any real sense of player progression, as all of the upgrades you get are either passive modifiers to the attack, or to the player character.\n\nThe game also lacks an offline mode for single player, so if you want to play solo, then you will need to create a private lobby and join the game with just you in in it. And finally, the RWBY stuff almost feels like window dressing. None of the characters handle all that differently, all of them feel the same, and the idea of each character in the show having a unique semblance isnt used AT ALL, which is a collosal missed opportunity to have the characters feel different from each other.\n\nAll that being said, there are a lot of good pinttts about this game as well. RT seems to undeerstand that "Early Access" doesn't mean "♥♥♥♥ out an unfinished, buggy, broken game and charge twenty dollars US for it." The game is very well polished, and very stable, no crashes, no disconnects in the online, and aside from some issues with the character animations when moving over uneven terrain, no real technical issues to be found. And while I may have called the RWBY stuff "Window Dressing" a little bit ago, it is extremely beautiful window dressing. This game looks beautiful, and exactly the way a RWBY game shoulf look, the voice acting (recorded just fior this game) is top-notch, and the combat at least looks like something out of RWBY.\n\n♥♥♥-in-all, we have a very beautfulm but very shallow, game on out hands. It is a fantastic skeleton, a solid foundation to build on, but not much else. If you're a hardcore RWBY fan, then I give it a tentative, all others... give it some time and check it out again later.\n\nThis game has so much potential, and I hope RT impliments some stuff to make it as good as we all know it can be. MAybe have us fight some neemies other than Grimm, maybe White Fang Members, or Roman Torchwick/Cinder's thugs. Maybe a stronger narrative in an offline campaign mode, and if RT is really feeling crazy, some kind of Loot System. That last one might be a bit too much to ask for, but there is an absoluitelty fantastic game here, trapped in a slightly-above-average game. We know that RT has immense talent, and that the original developer has nothing but love for RWBY, so I hopoe that this game gets more depth, because I would love to Power-Punch a Grimm as Yang so that Ruby can send it flying into the ari and sklice it in half. Or freeze and enemy as Weiss so another player can shatter it.","December 4, 2015","true","1.4"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","21","32","0","0"

When making your weapon you can choose 3-5 of what the characters in RWBY have.\n\nEx: If you wanted a sword that turned into gun chucks, you would go to the Pyrrha/Jaune option, choose his/her, the go to Sun and choose his gunchucks.\n\nThen to actually make our character we would have a stat board and everyhing.

I would say Rooster Teeth Games - Nailed it!!!!! ^^\n\nIf you think of buying RWBY Grimm Eclipse keep in mind its an alpha! You get a game that is still in development, so don´t be sad when you right now only can do a part of the campaign! But that small part is fun if you run in a full group. I have played now 10Hrs+ and had only 1 issue so far. And that is pretty good for a alpha, the game runs smoth on my  PC and I don´t have the best Specs:\nCPU i5\nGPU Gainward GTX 320\nRAM 8 MB\n\n\nAfter playing for a while on Ultra-High-Resolution I feeling like I am part of the animation. The Voices are from the original cast and you can play for now only Ruby´s group. The fighting animation feels good and smooth . While fighting you level you character up and each level you can spent points into skill tree. The level design looks good and so does the sound. One thing that I like is that the character is not always talking to after I press a skill. I found that very annoying in other similar games.\n\nYou can enter a game that is already in progress or host your own game. You can play in group with up to 4 people, the more people join the difficulty the game gets. I people leave the game adjusts also. Whats pretty good because people keep leaving . If the Host is  leaving the game , the game continous !! Only thing that will happen is that someone else will be host and game resets to the last fullfield camapaign part. This is a good solution, since you dont have todo the whole game from the start.\n\nIt totally has the RWBY vibe and so far I enjoy it. Even if I do over and over the same part but I can still recommend the game.

I cannot imagine whose computer could be so outdated that the old (better) character models were "taxing" on their machines. If the old models were really making your comp struggle, it's either time to move out of the jungle or get a better ♥♥♥♥ing computer.\nUntil the models are fixed I will leave my review negative. I used to love this game, but now the characters look so dissimilar to the show that it's very immersion-breaking.\n\nThe combat has also seen drastic changes from the original early-access version. TBH I'm a bit undecided on the combat changes. RT claims the animations have been made more fluid, but I only notice that they've been made a tad slower for some combos. It plays very differently than the early-access version, which was very fast and maybe a bit more like the show, IMO, but it's also not un-fun. It is still very fun to play, if you ignore your plastic-faced heroine.\n\nEDIT FOR LATEST PATCH: So the RT guys promised a "fix" to the character models. What we got was a re-shading of the existing ugly models; same ugly faces, but now shaded closer to the original more cartoony models, almost cell-shaded in appearance. All I can say is that it's a good thing you spend most of the game *behind* your chosen character---at least you don't have to see their horrible doll faces all the time.\nWill still leave this review negative due to the unnecessary changes made to team RWBY.","May 21","false","53.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","1"

It has the show's visual style which is unsurprising giving how much the shows looks like a video game cutscene. In fact when my friend and I first watched the show, he got increasingly frustraighted that it WASN'T a game. Well now we have this work in progress, which is fun but very very shallow. In fact if it weren't for the attached fandom this game would be gettng torn apart and the developers would be leaking money. But since we've all wanted a RWBY game for years we're eating it up myself inculded. The gameplay is MOBA style....which literally means nothing to me. It's kinda like a beat em up with our four leading ladies playable ATM.\n\nThings that rock\nNew voice lines\nAdjusts difficulty on the fly as people join/leave\nthe powers look cool and each member of team RWBY has differnt unlockable ones\n\nHowever in the only 40 min I played this game I got so bored of it so quickly. That's cause theres no variety in gameplay. you run through areas as Grim spawn around you or just ahead/behind kill them keep moving....every so often you run up and activate a control thing or a bridge then you defend the area for four waves (really basic gameplay concept)....and that's all there is just more and more of that. Combat is fun at first but you quickly learn theres not really any combos and only two basic attacks right now (the heavy attack button is coming). Theres no saving you just start at the start every time which i guess is good because you can 'Max level' in an hour, but it really bothered me.\n\nThe enemies are of course things we've seen our heros face in the show, and they look and act almost how they should my biggest complaint it the Bore the game says it charges and then is disorianted for a moment. So of course I'm thinking ok I've faced charging enemies you dodge then attack while stunned another very common gameplay element BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET IT RIGHT. It stops charging and is ready to attack again like as soon as it stops. I'm serious like within 2 seconds it gives its little warning at does it again. It's practically impossible to get to it unless more then one person is playing. In fact I found that about alot of enemies there isn't really a way to take on a group of enemies alone but to hit a few get hit, kite them untill you heal then repeat.\n\nIt so strange that a show that seems to come from people so familar with games has made a game that seems unable to offer anything new or take any risks.\n\nRumor has it team JPNR is coming and that'll really add alot so are more levels, enemies and hopefully some  actually engaging gameplay. As it is its a fun game for fans for an hour but nothing else. If this were the days of Blockbuster and Rodgers video stores this game would be a rental at best.","February 15","false","0.8"," 40 of 69 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","40","69","0","2"

So despite enjoying my time with it, why do I not recommend RWBY: Grimm Eclipse as of now? The problem is that it's too shallow in depth to even consider the $15 purchase as of now. If you really think about it, what if it's not a RWBY game?\n\nWell, what's good about the game? I would say its strongest point is how it remains faithful to the series with the overall environment and the voice acting being almost spot on with Blake's performance being a bit... off. The combat feels arcade-like and fast-paced much like the animation style to the show itself, but that's when I'm starting to run out of good things to say about this game.\n\nGoing back the combat, all of the characters feel exactly the same from one another with no distinct playstyle, just blindingly spamming left click until the enemy's health hits zero while occasionally using a special move every now and again. The special moves that each character has is very similar from each other with maybe different damage values and visuals with an upgrade system that feels tacked on because you don't seem to gain anything new aside from statistical buffs. The auto-targeting system is very annoying because of how often I wanted to hit a certain enemy only to have the game force me to hit something else resulting in me fighting against the system in addition to hide what I assume very dodgy hitboxes.\n\nOkay so what about the co-op elements? First off, the Left 4 Dead comparison is completely false. Left 4 Dead has specials that have abilities that can immobilize you until death requiring teammates to rescue you. Grimm Eclipse has enemies that do none of that, so I think it's fairer to compare the enemies to something like Nazi Zombie Army in which every enemy is feasible to kill no matter what weapon you take while playing solo. Aside from getting extra xp for reviving, why even bother reviving your teammates when they can respawn in about 45 seconds and the last person standing can just kite the Grimm around the map? In a nutshell, the biggest sin for the co-op elements is that there is absolutely no team synergy and feels tacked on. Perhaps they'll address this at a later time, but it still has to be noted regardless.\n\nI would have understood why people are going to go on the hate train for complaining so much as to saying "but the game's in early access so of course it's going to be like that", but really, how is the game going to improve if these flaws aren't pointed out? I like the web show, but how can I even say the same thing with the game being as it is now? To me, this game was pushed out way too early to be even worth $15. They should have delayed its early access release for a few more months to add more content and flesh out its gameplay to make it stand out from other beat'em ups on the market other than it being sold on the franchise alone. For now, the game is competent at what it's trying to do, but if this was not a RWBY game, I would have been much more negative than I am now.","December 27, 2015","false","4.3"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","25","41","0","0"

However I'm a pretty big fan of RWBY. the show to me has always seemed perfect for a video game. Thankfully I think the basics are already there and pretty good. Let me start by saying, this is Early Access so whilst I will mention the issues, I expect them to be patched over time and if they are, then they're null and void, obviously.\n\nSo, it's an arena fighting game, sort of. If you're familiar with RWBY, then you know that the universe of the show features some pretty bombastic fights. Acrobatics, juggling, magical stuff. A gun thats also a scythe. These are all represented in the game.\n\nThe combat is however, maybe too simple for those of you expecting combos and specials. One attack key, one "Shoot" key for long range stuff. It makes things somple, but that's maybe too much. I'd have preferredmaybe a Hevy/Light attack model. so I can perform more combos and have direct control over my attacks.\n\nSpecials are activated (at least on a controller) by holding a trigger and pressing a face key. It's simple, but unlike the melee combat it works well and I like it. Each character (4 of them so far, the main RWBY cast) all have distinct aesthetics but the moves are all the same. One special is an AOE, the other is a more direct knocback and the third is a ranged ability. Some can be upgraded to be charged, or given more knockback, etc.\n\nAs Early Access, I expect the collision issues. Hits don't always register. Multiplayer desyncs badly (it's peer to peer) and the UI is simplistic and barebones.\n\nThese can be improved on. If they are, this could be a lot of fun. RWBY as a show has a ton of teams that could be added going onwards. All with unique abilities and attacks.\n\nFor now, I recommend this IF you like RWBY.

The combat's amazing and the characters are lovely. There are some flaws, but you don't really notice them as you play the game. I cannot wait to see the game develop further.\n\nA few things that I would like to see in the future though, would have to be more characters from RWBY that we could play as, like Nora, Pyrrhah, etc, a game mode where you can fight other people in tournaments, and achievements.

If you're a part of the RWBY fanbase, the cost is negligable - you've already bought it.  If you're a beat-em-up fan, it may get better later but right now, it's not what your looking.  There is not enough of a substantial game here to pay 15 USD.\n\nPros:\n-Multiplayer works, and well.\n-The co-op multiplayer chaos is fun for the brief time the game lasts.\n-It's more RWBY, including lines delievered by the voice actors from the show.\n-I haven't found any significant bugs, ctd's, while playing it.\n-It looks good.  The environments and characters are all pleasant to look at.\n\nCons:\n-It's short, a playthrough of the entire game can be completed in about an hour over four short levels.  Across four characters, you're looking at four hours of gameplay before the game becomes mechanically samey.\n-There are some ballance issues accross the characters.\n-No auto-lock or any way of telling where your attacks are going.  This makes ranged combat wierd.  Combined with the sometimes wonkey hit boxes your character will sometimes turn 180 from the enemy you were hitting to hit something else.\n-Progression from a kill is granted only to the player that finished it, it undermines some support builds or builds that focus on single target damage in favor of aoe kill kill kill.  It also makes it competitive to get that extra kill to get that extra xp.\n-The game feels lonely, despite being a co-op game.  There is little incentive to synergize builds and attacks, the progression system of -last hit gets the xp- actually disincentivises it and you are only aware of your team mates when one goes down so you can stand them up for the 50xp.\n-Even if there are no game breaking bugs, there are still smaller ones - mostly animation bugs.\n-Combat could have a little more depth then button mashing the melee button and occasionally firing an ability.\n-The controls are not mappable in the game, they're fine for keyboard mouse but the controller controls are nowhere near as tight (Hold down a button and hit a button to activate one of the three specials for example).\n-For being RWBY, the sound effects are a little off on the weapons.\n-If you do not know anything about RWBY, the game will leave you confused.\n\nIf you enjoyed the show and want to play around with this game, then by all means, pick it up.  You'll probably enjoy watching it develop.  If you don't know anything about the show, you should probably stay away for now.","December 8, 2015","false","6.9"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

Simple enough to learn, even a team of novice players could take on a few dozen Grimm with no problems once they learn the attack patterns of each monster. Luckily the next update is set to add a bit more depth to the combat with heavy and counter attacks, as well as balancing the Grimm accordingly, which is great as I feel like it's a bit too easy right now.\n\n- The campaign we have right now adds up to maybe around an hour of gameplay. I hope the other planned campaigns and horde mode will be enough to keep people engaged. That said, the MOBA-like micro-progression is already a good reason for people to keep playing. You can't unlock every skill, but its fun to play around with different skill setups and see how effective they are. I love the combination of micro-progression and the fast paced action of a co-op hack-n-slash, I think it works great\n\n- The game looks great, which isn't much of a surprise since they're basically using the exact character and weapon models, as well as art style, as the show\n\n- Overall performance is great, pretty much constant 60fps, until you start fighting more Grimm at a time. Playing solo, this isn't much of an issue since the difficulty scales and you'll be fighting maybe at most 15 or less enemies at any one time. But with a full or almost full lobby, the number of enemies definitely starts to hit your performance a bit, and I have a decent rig (though I'm sure someone with a more powerful PC than mine would handle this just fine). It's most noticeable when you're in the collapsed Mountain Glenn sublevels fighting a large amount of enemies, with some that explode upon death\n\nGreat to see RWBY expanding to other media forms outside of the show, and great job to the dev team creating basically the exact game I imagined should be made after seeing each of the show trailers way back in 2013, I'm almost certain Monty would have loved to see this game to completion","February 17","true","13.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I think I can safely write a review about this game.\n\nNow, being 100% completely honest, the only downside to this game is the fact it is multiplayer only and yes, you can create a lobby and set it to friends only to play by yourself, but  it is still online, which means if you want to play the game offline, you are out of luck!\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid in terms of what they promised, it's hack n' slash with no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t involved, just plain ol' hack n' slash.\n\n\nNow comes the bad things!  There is an audio issue that really doesn't give you an in between, it's either too loud or too quiet, so you either start losing your hearing because it is so loud or you end up missing half of the things said because it is too quiet!\n\nThe graphical presets are pretty weak , even though I got a chuckle out of the 'potato' setting, but switching the settings literally did nothing and did make the game run better or worse, so it made me question why they included them.\n\nthe skill tree system is simple , which is fine, but it is too easy to get all of the skills in one game which brings me to another thing!\n\na progression system, while there is one in mid game, I think they could do ranks or a progression system outside of that, instead of having to get everything and earn it all again, which gets pretty tiring after awhile.\n\nFor an early access game, it's not too bad and it needs work for sure, but I hope RT reads the feedback and does this game some justice!","December 2, 2015","true","3.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

My friend and I are having a wonderful time playing it together and are excited for future updates! We both have one main complaint, however, and that is the lack of a saving feature for your progress. After a while it gets boring a repetitive redoing everything again just to get back to the point you were at, which makes the whole thing less enjoyable. Maybe incorperate save points after each main mission has been accomplished? along with this give the player who hosted the game a chance to load it again for when they wish to play next? Just a thought! Also the use of semblance would be a fun and interesting thing to have.\n\nAside from that this game is living up to my expectations!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tatsuhoshi/recommended/418340/","Tatsuhoshi","Tatsuhoshi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tatsuhoshi/","3071 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI picked this game up on a whim, largely because a lot of my friends like the series.  Though this game is in early access, RTG  has done a fantastic job of making the game run smoothly on systems old and new.  Samapuma and I both played through all three parts of the first chapter on one of my old and one of my lower spec'ed laptops without the game overheating or lagging significantly and we had a blast playing it.  So, now to the meat of the review.\n\nThis game is very much a toast to fans.  Those who are familiar with the series will appreciate that most of the original voice cast were used and the character models are really well done across all resolutions.  Considering the series was made entirely in CG, it would be disappointing if that wasn't the case.  The character animations are smooth, and ultra settings look great, even on my old laptop, which is only sporting an HD3650 video card and a gb of video ram.\n\nThe music is subtle and has enough length and variation that you don't get tired of listening to it as you play through the game.  I would probably pick up the soundtrack if it was made available later on.  The backgrounds match what little I saw of the tv series.  Actually, I'd say they are a bit better.  The series had very simple backgrounds with not a lot of details, but the backgrounds and scenery used in the game are pretty well detailed and don't seem like they just spammed a single model everywhere to put things together.  Some sort of notation about the edge of the map and ledges you can and cannot fall off of would be nice, though.\n\nThe map layouts, despite the above notation, are pretty good and make good use of corners for hiding things without making it ridiculously hard on for more casual players, and use different levels and heights for various things rather well.  The only stage where I had a problem with the map was probably the third part where you are doing a very tedious task while fighting enemies.  I don't have a problem with the task specifically; it was a nice change of pace, but, since the radar does not have a minimap or indicator for quest objectives, the mission was a bit harder than it needed to be.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth on a controller and less-so without.  I'd not recommend playing this game without a 360 or XBOne gamepad.  Armed with a gamepad, the controls are pretty well done and fairly intuitive.  Once you get used to holding down the trigger in order to execute your specials, you'll most likely be in good shape.  There were no signs of input lag between when the button is pushed and the character indicates the move, and charging times for specials are reasonable.\n\nThe difficulty for this game is a bit all over the place, however.  Samapuma is a casual gamer and not particularly good at these sorts of games.  Once she got used to it, she was helpful, but still had difficulty with most of the enemies, and that's not a good thing.  The game scales pretty smoothly for having more players, but is becomes very button mashy and less experienced players may have trouble keeping track of what does what.  The characters seem to have a good bit of variation to their moveset, while keeping to every character having a melee and ranged attack.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a very good game, especially for an early release title, and I look forward to seeing what they add to the game as it grows and develops.  Things I'd like to see added to the game would be, perhaps, a character customization feature where you can make your own student at the academy, with either generic voice or none at all.  I'd be happy to just play my own character in this setting.  I'd really like for there to be some degree of difficulty setting.  Samapuma couldn't really fully enjoy the game because she was struggling against a lot of the monsters, especially the rolling ones and the bears later in the game.  A single player campaign with either AI allies or even just taking one of the characters out solo would be nice.  This would give players a chance to practice various characters without having to deal with more experienced players complaining about how they don't know how to play for multiplayer.  Keep it short and I'm sure people will still be encouraged to play the game online with others.","February 3","true","5.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is a common hack and slash that must be played with friends as single player play is currently unblanced, boring, and just plain unfun.\nThe combat is not very fuild and combos will very often stop due to buggy counter attacks or teamattacks. Although, why do any of those things when holding down the power attack button and spaming it over and over can get you thorugh the game just fine.\nThe enemys themselfs are not hard unless they are in large numbers muli hitting you in what essenaly boils down to a one shot KO. While only slightly annoying in muliplayer, this is a huge problem in single player. You see, in muliplayer teamates can come over and revive you, and fairly quickly with a certan perk so being knocked out is not a big deal, however in single player you lose and must restart from a previous checkpoint. This is very tidous if you are engaged in a muliwave combat  you will not restart from the wave you died on, but all the way back to wave one. This gets very annoying and made me want to stop experminitng with combos, dodges, and counter attacks, to just going back to the power attack spam for fear of restarting all the waves agian.\nOverall RWBY is a work in progress game that should only be played with friends.\n","May 21","false","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There aren't a lot of combos but the characters all play radically differently and, between the animation and sound effects borrowed from the show, felt like they hit hard.\n\nHowever, since the Forever Fall update the characters now look like creepy lifeless dolls and the sound effects borrowed from the show were replaced by generic noises. Feeling like the show may not seem like much but it was this game's main selling point, and the dev team seems to have put an astonishing amount of time and effort into moving away from that.\n\nI'll change this review immediately if it moves back in the right direction.

Which is why I want this game to be great and it is to some extent. However there are some major flaws. Im going to be as constructive as I can with my criticism. PLEASE ANYONE FROM THE GRIMM ECLIPSE TEAM THAT IS READING THIS I IMPLORE YOU TO READ IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION. Anyone who has read the recent reviews see the backlash they are recieving from their recent updates. It seems at the start everyone loved it but now some people still really enjoy it while others have completely flipped their opinion. I like to say I'm somewhere in the middle. So starting with the things they need to improve or rather reimprove. (There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said a million times but it needs to be said a million more untill they fix it.\n* The face models- This is probably the biggest thing. I don't want to say that it ruins the game but its pretty bad.\n\n* The overall detail of the characters- This goes hand in hand with the face models. I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING THE CHARACTERS TO LOOK AS MUCH LIKE THE SHOW AS POSSIBLE.  If your take one thing from this review take what I just said (caps).\n\n*Grimm are damage sponges- DId grimm recieve aura all of sudden? Its so important in Hack n Slash games to not have damage sponges unless they are mini bosses or actual bosses. If you want to make it more difiicult simply add more grimm.\n\n*Improve the ability trees- The ability trees are far too barebones and some abilites aren't even worth getting. The more unique and diverse abilities you can add the more playstyles there will be.\n\nNow for the things you can add to the game.\n\n* Character interaction (IMPORTANT)- This is will definitely add to the story and replay value. Make the members of RWBY react to one another. For example, Yang makes a pun all members should have a reaction but they shouldn't all use it at once. For example in my example, Yang says her pun Weiss and Blake react to it and then Yang could even counter react to their receptions of the pun. However the next time you go through this level. Yang makes the same pun and only Ruby reacts to it. The next time you go through it nobody reacts to it since you're running a full team of Yangs. You see, it makes each playthrough unique. The longer the team can hold conversations with each other the more immersed you'll get into to it and the less it will feel like the same predetermined remarks. Sorry this one was so long its just really important.\n\n* Bosses- I think it would be really cool to see Torchwich, Cinder, etc cameo as bosses or if you want to make some new villians for the game that would be cool too. I just dont want to fight a giant mindless grimm for every boss.\n\n*Different enemy factions- I know its called grimm eclipse but maybe you could add in the white fang or again make a new faction of enemies that could call alongside the new villians.\n\n*Misc- As much as I love fighting it would be cool to see Beacon as level even if its just for a bit. For this Beacon level the fighting part could be team RWBY going up agiant team CRDl in a sparring match. THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. Also of course lets get some more playable character and/or cameos from some of the other teams.\n\nThats about it. It took me forever to write this which I hope shows you how much a care about this game. If you guys truly want to listen to the community and make the best RWBY game you can like you say you do than implement some, hopefully all of these changes. I think the RWBY communtiy can agree with me on most all of things I said. I know it must be hard making this game from the ground up. I hope this helps.\n\nP.S. The only reason I choose to not recommend this game is because I thought those are the reviews you would look at the most.\n\n\n\n","May 29","false","6.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

That being said, I'm happy to give constructive criticism as I think it's very important, especially for a Steam Early Access title.\n\nThe Rundown\nRWBY: Grimm Eclipse (will refer to it as "GE" from now on) is a hack n' slash style co-op game, where you play as a team with up to 3 friends to defeat the Grimm and figure out what's going on in the world of Remnant. Using the level up system to become stronger, defeat waves of Grimm and complete objectives until you finally reach your goal.\n\nPresentation\nSimply put, GE looks pretty awesome. It's very colorful, and the landscape suits the game. Fans of the anime will find that the art style is extremely similar to the show, and it works very well for it. The soundtrack is also well done, and fits the style of GE perfectly. The UI is great, as doesn't get in the way while simultaneously being helpful and not over-cluttered. Users playing on a lower resolution might find things hard to read as the text is also downscaled harshly with the game itself, which might be my only complaint about the game. You also cannot edit the video settings on your own, and are limited to only 3 options; potato, standard, and ultra.\n\nGameplay\nGE has a very simple "button smashing" type combat system. You press one button for your basic attack, one button for your ranged attack, and there's also 3 special attacks that all have unique qualities depending on which of the 4 characters you're playing as. To earn special attacks, you must achieve combos (which aren't too hard) that will grant you a special attack point. The game also uses a pretty cool leveling system where you earn XP to level up, and each time you level up, you're granted a upgrade point. These can be spent to increase your aura (health), increase your special attack limit, or upgrade your special attack, just to name a few options. Overall, I enjoyed the gameplay a lot. The characters all have pretty similar basic attacks, but they all have very unique upgrades that can become very powerful towards the end of the game. For example, Weiss can freeze enemies, while Blake can make clones of herself to fight along her side. I've seen some complaints that the combat system is bland and too easy, but I just think that those people haven't gotten into it enough yet, so don't fret.\n\nThe game also presents challenges that can be completed to unlock even better upgrades for your characters. All of your characters have unique challenges that can only be unlocked while using said character, meaning that the game has lots of replayability with pretty satisfying rewards. I've only unlocked Yang's' "best" upgrade so far, but it were super fun to use and I was happy that I spent my time unlocking it.\n\nThere is a few types of enemies, some with special attacks. There's standard Grimm, stronger Grimm with lots of health and dangerous attacks, and also more exotic types like a Grimm who has a rhino-like charge, and a mutated Grimm that will explode upon death. There isn't too much variety and I hope to see more in the future, but for day 1 of early access, it's what I expected to get.\n\nThe story is decent for a random person who comes across GE, but very cool for a fan of the show. The storyline is canon, so I recommend fans of RWBY pay close attention to what's happening, but someone who's not familiar with the anime might frankly be a little bit confused about what's going on. I'd recommend watching at least 10-20 minutes of the show before you dig into the game just so that you have a basic understand, and why not? It's free to watch!\n\nAs for the missions, there's currently only 3 unique ones available; a "defend the objective" type scenario, a "defeat _ waves of enemies" scenario, and a "escort the bomb" scenario. That might not sound like much, but it's enough to keep things fresh throughout the game.\n\nThere's only one mission currently available, with at least 2 more to come. Unfortunately, due to the fact there's only one mission (which lasts 45 minutes to an hour depending on how quick you are) the replayability of the game might be hindered a little bit to some people. However I have over 5 hours played already and haven't been bored of it yet.\n\nOverall\nPros:\n\n- Full controller support, including all console controllers and the Steam Controller. I couldn't find a single controller in my house that doesn't work with the game, which impressed me.\n\n- Fun, easy-to-learn combat system\n\n- Awesome visuals, voiceover, and music\n\n- Challenges\n\n- Replayability\n\n- Can literally run on any system you can find that runs Windows XP or better\n\n- An impressive lack of bugs, especially for an early access title\n\nCons:\n\n- Limited missions\n\n- Limited video and audio options\n\n- Story might be confusing to non-RWBY fans\n\n\nVerdict:\nWorth purchasing.\n\nThis game may be in early access, but it's actually quite impressive, especially for its price tag. There's clearly quite a ways to go in development, as expected from an early access title, but I still think that even for people who haven't watched RWBY before this game is worth checking out.","December 1, 2015","true","8.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

Firstly, I don't usually play hack-and-slash games OR co-op games, and if I wasn't a RWBY fan  then I probably wouldn't have glanced twice at this game. Secondly, it launched on Early Access literally yesterday, so there's a lot of updates and improvements to come. I'll edit this review over time to reflect those. With that out of the way...\n\nPros:\n*Fun, exciting gameplay\n*Varied objectives (the bomb cart sequence, for example)\n*Good graphics\n*Very faithful to the original series - if you like RWBY then you'll like this game\n*Challenging without being frustrating (for the most part)\n*Great music and sound effects\n\nCons:\n*No tutorial, not even a controls screen. The HUD tells you how to use Specials and spend your Ability Points, and that's it. (WASD to move, Space to jump, Left-Click for melee attacks, Right-Click for ranged attacks, press T to talk. You're welcome.)\n*Current EXP system effectively encourages kill-stealing\n*Poorly optimized. My laptop isn't the fastest but I'm not the only one with poor frame rates\n*Some of the dialogue is almost inaudible even at max volume [EDIT: This has now been fixed]\n*Dunno if it's just me but some of the upgrades don't seem to make much of a difference\n*Your basic ranged attacks (especially Ruby's) are pretty much useless as they're slow and do almost no damage\n\nIn spite of all its problems, however, I really did enjoy playing this, and I'm confident that the problems listed above will be ironed out in time. I'd honestly recommend this game, but if you're put off by its issues, come back in a few months' time and I'm sure it'll have improved a lot by then.","December 2, 2015","true","7.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cascade_Range/recommended/418340/","Cascade_Range","Robot Maid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cascade_Range/","359 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWelcome to the Robot Maid Review of... RWBY: Grimm Eclipse.\n\nDisclaimer: Even though it says "recommended", this is a very, very, VERY tentative recommendation.\n\nThe game as it stands is severely lacking in content which isn't a problem for an early access game, but because there is a price tag, they open themselves up to formal criticisms.\n\nSettings wise is very bare bones. A few presets and audio sliders. The lack of mapping controls or changing any settings is a minor problem which would likely be fixed later in the game.\n\nAesthetically, the game is pleasing and keeps to the art and animation style of the source web-series. While this is great for combat and environments, a few minor animations look strange and unnatural. Hopefully this is changed in the future.\n\nMechanically, the game handles very well in combat with a few strange mechanics which are questionable in quality in my opinion. The game takes inspiration from any game that gives you a red warning sign whenever the enemy attacks, but what struck me as strange is that enemies are invulnerable when attacking which kind odd and sort of makes it so that enemies can dictate the flow of combat, especially when there's a lot of them. Gameplay as a whole feels like they took the fighting style of Dynasty Warriors with level progression of Left 4 Dead. It's an interesting combo, but I think there could be better options for this style of game.\n\nAlso, the MOBA style leveling system DOES NOT WORK. It doesn't promote teamwork because only the player getting the kill gets EXP so if you want to get to higher levels, you have to either isolate enemies or kill steal them from your friends. Because this is a purely PvE game (that might change), it's a very flawed system. In my opinion, it should be something similar to Castle Crashers, where levels are tied to the characters (levels gained on Yang would not carry over to playing Ruby, etc).\n\nMy final thoughts on the game is that it isn't bad. It's got solid gameplay with a few strange happenings and a few bugs or oversights. I personally wouldn't recommend it at this price unless you have a friend or three willing to join you in playing as a bunch of girls with weapons combined with guns. Or Weiss.\n\nThis has been a Robot Maid Review. Thank you for reading.","December 4, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiverior/recommended/418340/","fiverior","fiverior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fiverior/","1 product in account","Early Access Review\n\nLove, love, LOVE this game! I'm so addicted! I only got it 2 days ago, but I've played through it like 8 times now!! It's a LOT of fun, and the replay value is DEFINITELY there! Even though you're facing the same enemies, it never feels boring or repetitive to go through and tackle them again, finding new areas and unlocking new abilities along the way!\n\nI've been reading through the comments and reviews, however, and I feel there are a couple of criticisms out there that aren't completely valid. At least for the sake of the developers potentially reading through this, I wanted to correct some of them and point out that we don't all feel that way; and maybe revision in those areas isn't actually necessary.\n\nMy biggest beef is people complaining that the "bosses aren't hard enough". I think the reason this bothers me so much is because I LOVE the flow of the game--I think it's been perfectly executed! It's always clear when one area moves onto the next, when some enemies are harder to kill than others, requiring more of your character's skill and special abilities. It feels like a story that way--it feels like RWBY!! Any fan of the show will truly appreciate the immersiveness of it all. But I think people complaining about the boss difficulty are wanting it to be a different game than what it is.... as a hack and slash game, and especially as a RWBY game, I think it's valuable that the characters feel strong... that the pace is constantly moving forward, and the fight scenes are immersive! I would be really sad if the developers felt the need to change this, if the game became all about beating the hardest bosses, and then some of that atmosphere was lost...\n\nSome constructive feedback that I do agree with however are:\n--the XP sharing thing; there is currently no real XP sharing. I don't have so much of an issue with the potential kill stealing, because I think there's usually more than enough grimm for all the players to have their chance. I think it would be nice though if breaking crates could always give XP to all the team members! In my experience it sometimes does, and sometimes doesn't--maybe I'm doing it wrong? But either way, I think that might be a nice touch! :)\n--The subtitles don't follow the voices all the way, and I think they even contain different dialogue sometimes from what's being spoken! So I might recommend a look at that.\n--It is kind of sad that you only get like 10 points to spend on your skill trees, especially when you've unlocked most of your skills!\n\nOtherwise, I have a million more positive remarks:\nGraphics are GORGEOUS\nCharacters are SO well animated, and feel so much like the characters from the real show! I love the little details, like Yang lighting on fire (and the awesome sound of her crackling), and their spot-on sprinting animations.\nCombat is loads of fun, rewarding, and perfectly perfectly balanced (seriously, it was never too easy, never too challenging, always so well executed)\nThe soundtrack is so great!!! I especially love when you're in a fight with a big boss and the RWBY fighting soundtrack kicks in--the first time it happened I could almost swear I was in the actual show! ;) Great touch, guys!\nPlot seems very good so far! Even the occasional cutscenes are great!\n\nA really well done hack and slash multiplayer game! Mad props to the developers, you guys are AMAZING! Keep up the wonderful, wonderful work, and please don't change the great RWBY-worthy atmosphere of hack and slash fun! :)","December 14, 2015","true","41.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is however very enjoyable. This is only but a teaser of what is to come. The play style is new and VERY MOBA. You don't get to keep any levels between play throughs. Which is interesting. However you DO get to keep challenge rewards. Challenges are things you do to unlock later teir skills and abilities. The progress is saved and so is the skill/ability unlock. An interesting addition that makes you want to play the game over and over again. Even though I have notice a lot of bugs and some things missing that I would LOVE added I can honestly say I ENJOY playing this game! The fighting can be hard to understand at first but when it clicks you become a badass in an instant.\n\ncons:\n\nThere is a lack of Music but I am sure it is comming! The series had a lot of epic music in battles so I am sure this will come into effect with in an update or two.\n\nI feel jumping should be more epic than it is.\n\nSome characters special passives don't seem to be in effect... Weiss' glyphs should give her a double jump at least (doesn't), Ruby has super speed but Blake seems to be faster then she is in game, and with Yang she should get stronger the less HP she has but I don't really see or feel that happening. These things however COULD be skills later in the skill trees that I have not seen/noticed. That would be wonderful.\n\nPros:\n\nThe voice acting shows promise and will only get better in time.\n\nThe environments are as beautiful as the show.\n\nThe fighting is satisfying and beautiful to watch. I hope they bring more combos into it though but as it is it feels really nice.\n\nCharacters randomly interact with each other vocally.\n\nThe game, like the show, revolves around team work to get through the levels. Making you feel like an ACTUAL team!\n\nThe abilities are just so much fun to watch.\n\nAs a fan, you get a sudden rush of glee everytime someone moves or does an ability like you notice in the show.\n\n\nin conclusion there is a lot of things to fix but it is a strong start and I am sure the game is only going to get better! It is enjoyable short game to play right now but has TONS of replayablilty and is heading in a VERY nice direction.","December 2, 2015","true","11.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However being a fan of the actual animated series I decided to give the game a fair go.\n\nThe game is still not fully completed and as such I can't talk about the full story as it's journey has yet to be finished, however the cannon storyline is both interesting and in-depth. However this is contrasted heavily by the chaotic combat, supplied by the online main story mode.\n\nThe leveling system is very fair being that when you start any game, you are level one unless you joing a mid-game session in which to are boosted to the average level. Kill monsters, collect experience orbs and artifacts to gain experience. Upon leveling up you can spend one point per level, with the points stacking up. The tree flow design is simple yet effective with various challenges to unlock additional skills. All in all requiring you to play certain characters to unlock unique special abilities or any to unlock generic upgrades such as health or aura.\n\nThe only problem with this system is that players are more orientated on experience than team work. I was walking for a box, that could potentially house an experience orb, before a player jumped in front to take my box. This is similar to combat against enemies. I can understand if it's a clustered fight and there is too many for one person but if I'm versing a single monster and I start to go for the last strike to kill it and earn the experience I don't like how people can do a ranged attack, defeat it and earn your experience. A shared pool may be needed?\n\nRealistic point... would I buy the game still knowing what I know? The simple answer, yes. The simplistic combat system is still both fun and engaging. It may be experience orientated but it is still humorous when playing with friends over skype. YES, play with friends. I enourage it to the ends of the earth. It allows better teamwork skills are is more enjoyable.\n\n======================================================================\nComat Update Review\n\nRecently I decided to play this game again because I'm bored from lack of work. To my suprise I found an extensive rework of the combat system. To me it had appeared as if the ranged button had been removed for a heavy attack (right click) and for the first ten minutes I taught myself all the new combos I need and their effects.\n\nI was playing for about ten minutes before a teammate casually asked why I didn't use my barrage ability to which I regrett saying, because I sounded like a noob, "how?". Apparently the 'R' now acts as your ranged attack with 'E' preforming a finishing move and 'F' making your charcter sprint to a enemy like they're offering free money.\n\nThe single player option is nice, allowing you to master your skills by yourself before worrying about multiplayer where people judge (as I was without knowing ranged abilities). The graphics and camera additions are implimented flawlessly with the game's appeal and overall its been a great update.\n\nWould I recommend the game, now? Yes, even more so than the previous time. The combat style makes it feel more worthwile and meaningful when an enemy actually dies. Improved enemy AI makes the game harder and more strategical rather than ridicously overpowered. Keep going developers. I'll be here and waiting.","December 22, 2015","true","40.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Until now.\nI played the fan game and the version they had for people to play at RTX and I don't see much improvement in this version of the game, the combat is super simple: spam left click, right click every once in a while, use your special moves when you are surrounded or you're attacking a tough enemy, and dash away when you're low on health. It would be fun to put on while you marathon a podcast, cartoon, etc in the background but it has incredibly frustrating aspects to the game like how teamwork is non existent and is actually more competitive in a bad way, the objective besides getting to the end of the level is to level up your character from last hitting an enemy, I repeat LAST HITTING an enemy so everyone attacking a powerful enemy to cooperatively kill it doesn't happen except when all other enemies are dead what normally happens is everyone separates and gets hordes of their own to kill and then try to get the final blow on the tough enemies that that poor sucker was attacking the whole time. There are no two person combos like in the show besides multiple people flaying their weapon at the enemies to hopefully get the last hit, also multiple people can play the same character when the lobby caps at 4 people so I kid not every 4 man lobby I've been in consisted of Ruby, Yang, Weiss, and Weiss. It just doesn't look or feel right. Other problems, all character progression go away once you leave a game which is fine but you can't leave and pick up where you last left off, the levels are all very repetitive, enter an area kill monster, enter another kill monsters, enter an area protect a stationary object from monsters, rinse and repeat, the enemy's are all so similar with slight differences in health and looks with one exception of the boar looking ones who role and have armor In certain spots so as far as I can tell no big bosses like the giant bird they fought in season one, I wouldn't know if there is because I can't make it 20 minutes without getting bored and quitting. You can't customize the resolution because wouldn't change to 1920x1080 it would just revert to 720 after trying to change it, the sound options are a joke, you have voice volume and music volume so I can't turn down anything else so I can't hear anything the characters are saying half the time because so much is going on. The game drops frame rate way to often on my computer that can run Battlefield 3 on full ultra graphics settings and Skyrim with all of the best graphics enhancements mods I could find. So overall the game is really boring and frustrating because of cooperative gameplay turning into competitive gameplay with a story that I don't know because i can't hear what they are saying and putting on subtitles and looking at the subtitles takes me away from the action, I have drop into a quick match in the middle of the game because their is no solo mode and none of my friends own the game. I realize the game is in early access but this is what is what Is wrong with its current state and I do realize that fan boys are going to down vote this because the game is 10/10 perfect no flaws in there eyes but I payed $15 wanting to like it and couldn't bring myself to play it for 20 full minutes.\n\nEDIT: After playing for a little while more I felt like I should add somethings that I like about this game to my otherwise fully negative review, I figured out how to play solo, you have to start a new game which puts you in a lobby and you have to do nothing until everyone else in the lobby gets tired of waiting for you then leaves then put the lobby to friends only, it is really mean to do but I really wanted to play solo and playing through the game I found it to be more enjoyable than a lobby full of people because it brings an actual challenge to the game, also the voice acting is pretty good and the graphics are pretty impressive. The only negative things that weren't mentioned above were that the running animation is not good at all the characters often start floating going up and down stairs and such but this isn't a big problem at all. Another problem is that there are invisible borders everywhere which didn't bother me much. It still is ironic that a RWBY game is more enjoyable solo than Co-op","December 2, 2015","false","1.2"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","22","40","0","0"

The action is amazing, the graphics are beautiful, and the updates will probably contain some pretty immense stuff! I absolutely love this game and I am glad that I will get to see it grow and expand!\n\nUpdate:\nI have now completed the game as all characters as well as tried out almost all of the skills, I am writing this after trying the Combat Revision opt in beta and I can now begin to see that the game is coming along nicely, there are still no more playable characters or missions but that is to be expected, animations have been greatly improved and in my opinion, the greatest addition to the game so far has to be either the combos in the beta or the camera revision and how it zooms out for combat and pans into the character when walking around.\n\nI still can't wait to see this game expand and know that there won't be a single update that I'm not happy with, also the hype is beginning to sink in for more stories and missions so that'll be cool. I will update this review as the game updates.\n\nFirst major content update (May 6th 2016):\nThis new update had me in awe, the "Awe yeah" from Ruby Rose welcomed me back into the game and I was greeted with a very red title screen that completely amazed me at how much detail the game now has in it. I started the game, this time as Blake (being my favourite of the four in the show) and immediately my eyes were drawn to the thick hair flowing behind her. I thought I was just overthinking things at first but after checking out the other characters I can see the player models have been updated into more 3D and detailed designs that stay truthful to the show whilst adding a unique depthness different from the show.\n\nOne thing that interests me is how they will manage to pull off the "Horde mode" which is an option within the multiplayer mode; it is not currently playable however I believe it will be in the next content update. I'm not going to spoil the new Forever Fall level and to experience what it is truly like you would have to play it for yourself as it is quite... surprising, you'll see.\n\nAnyway, get the game now, it's fairly cheap and most certainly worth the price; if you want to play a quick game or two then I might be free so just check my profile if I'm online, add me as a friend and send an invite!\n\nQuick update!\nSo as it turns out, the new models weren't well recieved and RT Games are getting rid of them and replacing them with the traditional ones; can't say I'm not upset but the old models were still awesome!","December 5, 2015","true","40.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

I’ll just talk about what I personally like or dislike so read it if you want detailed information about the game but if you want to short version then I have to say I like the game and I think it’s a great value for money and even greater if you manage to play with a couple of people you know or your just a fan of the show like I am. I do not regret my purchase and am happy to support this game where ever it decides to go.\n\nPros\nGameplayCombat is solid and enjoyable, not very difficult but not very simple either. You can die very easily if you don’t make use of the dodge button and your skills from which there are a good verity between the current four characters of the show. You have your basic combo attacks and a ranged attack which can mix together for a different combo and each of the characters have their own unique skills which use a portion of your skill bar. You can also upgrade your skills by levelling your character, which add some unique effects or just upgrade general things such as your aura which acts as your health. You gain one skill point per level, at the moment the max level is ten so you have a total of ten points to spend but again that could be only for now and could change later. Picking between which skills you want to upgrade more and focus towards is completely up to you and from what I’ve seen there isn’t a TRINITY between skills at the moment. But then again I only play Ruby and Yang so take my word for a grain of sand :P The game is also four player drop in and drop out co-op so you can have some great fun with friends or random people, enemies do increase in difficulty depending on how many people are with you so it doesn’t make the game easier in a sense. However I must say there is no lock on system which is kind of weird, it makes son skills completely miss the enemy you want to hit and sometimes hits the wrong one. You kind of get use to it as you keep playing but still, adding a lock on will fix this issue. It should also be mentioned that this game supports Xbox One and PS4 controller support surprisingly, the controls on a keyboard and mouse are perfectly fine in my opinion but the option is there for those who want it. I do not own a controller for either console so I can’t fully recommend them as I have no idea if they are a blessing or a curse but again the option is there.\n\nSoundSound is decent I guess, there is a track what plays through missions and sometimes have these epic tracks playing during large battles and boss fights which puts a smile on your face now and then. Voice acting is also here and for the most part works well, every character sounds like their own and isn’t a pain to listen to but then again I watch allot of anime so maybe that has something to do with it. Sound effects are spot on, you feel like your attacks are connecting and your specials are in fact SPECIAL. Not much else I can really say, I think it’s all great and works just as intended but it is worth mentioning that it does get a bit too loud especially the combat sounds. It just gets ridiculously loud for no reasons but again its nothing game breaking so…YOLO I guess.\n\nGraphicsGraphics are just as they are in the show which is a very and I mean VERY GOOD THING. It all looks right by nature and stays true to its origin. If you aren’t a fan of a cartoony style with an anime flare then walk away now because it is not getting any better than it is. The character models are perfect and represent the player characters and the enemy NPC’s perfectly. I personally love Yang’s hair as it’s the best thing to look at while laying the beat down on grimm :P\n\nCons\nLevelsLevels are a hit and miss for me, they serve their function with flying colours and there is nothing wrong with them in a sense. The problem is that there are way TOO many invisible walls for no real reason. For example during the first two missions where you play in large fields, you can see large open areas which you can’t get to because there’s an inviable force stopping you. It makes levels feel like a straight line, a corridor not allowing the players to explore these good looking areas in a large and interesting world. That said there are a good amount of secrets on each map which grant extra EXP which are very easy to miss but worth getting if you can so for that I will thank the designer, it does give the players a reason to actually explore the area than just go on with the objective. Also some missions have these “defend the objective” goal which isn’t bad for me since I like the combat enough but I can see if people start to get annoyed by this so mixing up the objective would be nice. That’s not to say that’s the only thing you do because it’s not.\n\nAnimationsAnimations are a mixed bag here, for the characters you control they are spot on. Each character feels unique and has a unique play style which makes you want to main a charter over the others which is always a good thing as you feel connect to these charter especially if you watch the show, I personally absolutely love Yang but will defiantly play Raven if she gets added. It’s the enemy NPCs who have issues now and then, for example Weiss can freeze an enemy in place with one of her upgrades but for some reason the enemy still attacks and even move around despite being frozen in ice. What the hell? It happens a hand full of times but way more common as you play more and more so hopefully that can get fixed.\n\nSkillsSkills for some characters are clearly better than others, for example Yang’s third ability “Blastwave” is completely worthless and unreliable as you miss your targets five out of ten times. Making the upgrades for that ability a complete waste. Another example is Ruby’s general upgrade “Armor piercing rounds” which increases the damage of your range attacks, why? This is a game where you have to combo enemy’s to even use your skills, range attacks are nice to have but don’t even get close to the same damage as your melee attacks do. So why have an upgrade for something you barely use? It may not be bad as I’m making it out to be but it does make you scratch your head now and then especially since you can currently only getting a total of ten points to spend, so you want to be sure your making you right decisions. It just when you have a good damaging ability you should have other good options which are comparably not a liability.\n\nConclusion\nIt’s a very solid game to play and enjoy especially if you have friends so if you’re a fan of the show then show your support and pick this up. Get some friends and you will have some great fun as I have with my friends. Really excited to see how this game will grow and hopefully it will be for the better. All in all I have not regretted my purchase at all.\n\nWhat I would like to see in the future.\nMore characters. (Please add Raven! I’ll pay whatever the price)\nMore levels because why not?\nRemove the invisible walls or at least make then less noticeable.\nChange some of the skills so they make more sense.\nA character creator.\nIf possible, a PvP mode. It would be awesome putting a team like RWBY vs JNPR.\n\n8/10 needs more Raven.","December 6, 2015","true","12.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sugarbuns/recommended/418340/","sugarbuns","Aminthea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sugarbuns/","218 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlright, a little about me and how I'll try all my might to not have this review be biased. I'm a huge fan of Roosterteeth, RWBY has been one of those series that have taken my heart and I am in love with this show, the world, the character, the concepts- everything. When I heard an official game was in the works, I swear I cried. Now that it's in my possesion, I was so excited to play this game, I expected a whole lot from a company so invested in video games, you'd think they'd get everything right.\n\nSo far, I'd say they got enough right for this game to be actually enjoyable- even if this is still a day one review.\n\nI'm only gonna summarize the game a bit. You and your team are a four-man squadrant composed of teenage girls with powerful weapons. You can pick one of these lovely girls to be in while you battle. These characters are Ruby Rose, Yang Xiao Long, Blake Belladonna, Weiss Schnee. Not gonna go over their characters, and I'm not gonna explain what they're doing or why they're here. The combat system is basically, spam left click, press some buttons, and try to defeat all the Grimm, (the strange monsters,) in the stage at that moment. When you join a game, you are basically going through a campaign, and once the "campaign," (I'm using the term loosely, because I think this is the only thing that really decribes this progression though the game,) is over, you return to the party screen, and restart the campaign. Now, lets get on to the looks and what not. You gain experience through combat, you can unlock powerups to your existing 3 special moves, and your health bar is the Aura bar at the bottom right. It depletes, you have a few seconds to dodge hits and not get hit again before you die. If you don't recieve damage for a certain amount of time, your health fills up, and you're able to go back to hacking and slashing your way through the game.\n\nVisually, this game is quite nice. The scenery surrounding you is wonderful, the character models are quite nicely done, and, (even if this is just the Day 1 review,) the animations are actually more glitch-free than I thought they would be. There are times where the walk cycle glitches out and the character model is stuck in the same pose as it walks down the stairs, but generally, the animations are fluid. The grim get the same issues when they are pushed against a wall, their walk cycles turn a bit wonky, but it's still nice. The GUI is lackluster, but this is early access, I wouldn't be surprised if it gets updated. The main menu GUI is simplistic, and that's totally fine, but the in-game gui is a bit confusing to get used to. I'm personally not used to looking at the bottom right corner of my games, because I usually get notifications there.\n\nIf someone logs into skype while you're playing this game, and you have notifications on- your aura bar is gone from sight and you only have some visual cues and audio cues to tell you that you need to get the hell out of there. (Added note; I would have also enjoyed being able to see the aura of my other teammates, and even their specials bar. It could make for easier coordination and teamwork, [this could also take away from the idea of a hack and slash, maybe, but coordination and teamwork are always fun.])\n\nThe BGM and voice acting are a nice touch though, I enjoy listening to all the quips and quirky one-liners characters say at the end of waves or stages. It's entertaining. I have to say though, there are instances where there were character dialog subtittled at the bottom, (because I like having subtitles on,) and their small character picture to the left was speaking, but an entirely different character's voice came through. Example; Yang's picture and subtitles were on the screen, but I heard Ruby instead.\n\nNow, the actual "campaign," (I seriously don't know what to call this,) follows team RWBY through a forest, through some ruins, underground, and then to the location of a bomb. Seriously. I appreciate the idea of incorporating so many different meathods of playing the game. It goes from a simple, stage by stage fight, then to defending a point, back to stage by stage, then another defend the point, some more waves of Grimm, and then the last part. The bomb part. This part of the whole game is by far the hardest part to do alone. I would know, my team ditched me and I had to get the bomb to the end on my own. Did I succeed? Nope. a 85% the bomb exploded and I was a sad sally, but you know, life moves on, and I figured this game was going to be impossible to play without teammates. If you also want a four player experience throughout the campaign, I'm going to tell you now, you're not going to get it. I've never been able to finish with all 4 characters present, people drop out way too fast when things get dicey. This is also a positive thing, because the game recognizes this and changes the difficulty, which is a plus.\n\nI quickly added this part before I posted the review, but I have to say, the combat between Ruby, Blake, and Weiss are strikingly similar and gets repetitive. While on the other hand, Yang's combat is lackluster compared to them. They all have AOE or large attacks that affect a multitude of enemies around them, while Yang has her two special punches, and a ground pound with the radius of a corn nut. It made my experience while playing Yang make me feel like I wasn't doing as much work as the rest of the team. She does make up for it by her ability to have her full specials bar come back in almost an instant, but still, her combat is the only one with slight difference in comparison to the other characters who can swoop in, use an AOE and steal all of the kills. All of 'em.\n\nSpeaking of teammates, I kind of want a single player version of this. Maybe a training mode where your teammates are really idiotic CPUs who let you have all the kills- just so someone could get used to the controls. But this is, yet again, something I want and if it doesn't get added, I won't be mad. I also won't be mad if you don't buy this game. It's not for everyone, and it's the best game yet. (Nor will it ever be, maybe.)\n\nEither way, this is a wonderful start for this game's Early Access and here's probably why you should, or shouldn't get it. I'm also not summing up anything I said in Pro's and Con's because I'm lazy.\n\nI am also too lazy to stop myself from doing it.\n\nPro's;\n- Graphically wonderful with pretty fluid animations.\n- Non-Overbaring story that guides you though the game, (good for people who don't actually know RWBY.)\n- Difficulty changes dependent on player count.\n- Exotic scenery and character designs make this more unique than other franchises, (which makes it good for the game also.)\n\nCon's;\n- Unbalanced Audio, (voice acting too quiet, special moves overbaringly loud, etc.)\n- Repetitive Combat\n- Early Access\n\n\nShould you get this game? I'd say yes if you like RWBY, like unfinished games, and enjoy watching cute girls battle monsters. In any other case, just wait till it's out of Early Access, or more updated.","December 1, 2015","true","13.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","6","9","3","0"

However there are currently quite a few issues / things that need to be improved upon. To list a few: more variation in combat would be nice, escpecially with ranged attacks (they are pretty weak and pretty much keep your character from moving while your are firing). There definately needs to be more balancing with player health vs damage done by enemies, and the special attacks bar needs to be easier to refill since it requires you to get combos to refill (which is very difficult to do later on, when you frequently become surrounded). There also needs to be more encouragement for working as a team and there needs to be more exploration allowed. I would also like to see more customization for your character, more indepth skill trees, and possibly more gamemodes.","December 2, 2015","true","4.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Yes more teams and playable characters and levels would be nice. I'm sure they'll come this is early access after all and of course there are a few bugs but this game is fantastic in my opinion. The art style is excelent, fits very well with the art of the show itself. Each character is unique and feels well balanced which means there will still be playes using each character in the multiplayer. It is very clear that most of the players are fans like myself as conversations and puns usually break out in the chat amongst playes. The gamelay is fun and is excelent at creating a team atmosphere where you rely as much on the skill of your fellow hunters and huntresses as much as you do your own skill which is exactly how a RWBY game should feel. I have huge hopes for this game and I will definately put a lot of time into it. If your a fan I 100% reccomend this game. Maybe not while in early access. But definately upon full release. Also I haven't found any water levels which is cool... I uh... don't like those. I'm not scared. Don't listen to Sun...

Still early , But shows signs of a well made game with great potential.\n\nThe Pros of the game:\n\nGraphics\nMusic\nCharacters\nGameplay\nStory\n\nThe Cons of the game:\n\nMusic levels by default aren't set very well\nsubtitles aren't to the word of the audio ( thats norm for a lot of games anyway)\nGameplay can be a little repetative but was expected from the style. Does get harder at times.\nStory seems to be set mid way into season 3 of the series, Unsure as of yet . All I know is its further than the series.\n\nThe Characters:\n\nRuby: By far the all-round strongest, Main Character . there are 3 special attacks that each character can do. One is a shot or long range attack 2nd one is a heavy single unit attack. And 3rd is a area of attack. Ruby hold the best for area attacks and has a decent long range shot. her single power attack isn't as good but after playing them all, Ruby is by far the strongest.\n\nWeiss: Fast percise and agile. Weiss Focuses on single targets more than a group. Her group attack is awful from the 4 of them. she is best at her single unit attack or her long range attack as she uses dust to attack.I found I lacked a lot of points and kills while playing as Weiss but I played more of a "medic".\n\nBlake: The first character I played as, Fast great at combo hits and has a decent all round spec. Doesn't excel in anything but is a key player in the field. I find you will be shooting more with blake than any of the others. blake could also handle any situation on the spot without struggling as much as some did.\n\nYang: The best Single unit attack and great at giving the team some "space" with her mighty shotguns! Yang was a great teammate who was better in single unit attacks than the others. Was also a slower but more "tank" character.\n\nSummary: The game sticks close to the series in its good ways, with it still early Access and ideas changing all the time. I found the game very smooth to run and the control system was great! Some characters had auto aim for their weapons , others did not.\nWhile playing it was fun and I had a laugh,  If you were on your own the game would spawn less grimm to make it easier. While having 2 Ruby's on my team made a unsettling balance and I found it to be very hard to play. The game is based on teamwork and everyone must play as someone different. The in game settings were basic but substancial. Geforce experience didn't detect it as a game and while trying to twitch, it was showing as a desktop. Yet again still early.\nThe game had no bugs and everything ran smooth in the 4 gameplays I went through. A few minor things need work but I'm sure they will be ironed out way before launch. Worth every penny.(Pun intended)\n\nI can't wait to see what they plan to add and bring forward for the game, Keep up the good work Roosterteeth!\n\nLove it and I want more :D - 100/100\n","December 1, 2015","true","3.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

First off, I've been a fan of the show since day one, so I'm a little biased. Also, this is in early access, so I don't count its flaws against it.\n\nThe game is an absolute blast. Fast paced action, well designed enemies, playing as Team RWBY is extremely well done. Also the graphics are nice, looks very much like the show, but could still use some polishing.\n\nOn the downside, it's terribly unoptimized. Hang-ups everywhere. I have a GTX 860M and had to take it to "Potato" quality at 720p to evade the hang-ups. Connectivity isn't the best, but once you're in a party with good connection it works fine. The animations are a bit clunky. I feel like the jumping could use some work. Also, button mapping would be greatly appreciated. Finally, the audio quality is... weird. It sounds super-compressed.\n\nHowever it's extremely impressive that they've managed to put this out with such a small team! Rooster Teeth continues to amaze me with how much they get done between so few people. It would be a dream to work on a project like that. Awesome job, dev team, keep it up!\n\n--Bottom Line--\nThe game isn't finished and it shows. If you're not a big fan of the show, I wouldn't buy it until the full release. If you are a fan though, it's an awesome experience that I highly reccomend.

Even though for now you will have to have watched the series before being able to play this game knowing what and who everyone is, it already has so much potential. For a hack and slash game this doesn't come short in any way. It's fun, get's you to do and see lot's of things and overall is something you can immerse fully into. The game might get repetitive after a while because it is only in it's beginning stages where the campaign isn't at it's full length. But! Every character and their style is unique in lots of ways. Try Ruby and then Weiss for a change, you'll notice you have to work up more experience to build a bit of a skill level with either. Overall I would say I love this game and it hasn't let me down ever since I onced wished Santa Rooster Teeth Claus to bring out a game as awesome as the series can be! Lot's of potential to make an awesome game! Maybe even Player vs Player tournaments? ;)","December 15, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I very much like this one. Given that this is an Alpha/Beta version of the game, I hope they expand on the playable characters (Please make Penny a playable character!!) and add a few more game types. Maybe even a tutorial section. Would also be cool for each person to have a little dance emote or even a button you can press to call out for help. All that being said, I love the game!

To strart of with, I recommend this game for 3 simple reasons:\n\n1) If you like RWBY, like I do, you will enjoy this game\n2) It's a decent price for Early access and shows a lot of promise\n3) Any game with a graphic setting of "Potato" really deserves some praise and attention\n\nHowever... lets be realistic here people.

It really does feel like a Hack n' Slash just like Dynasty Warriors, except there isn't thousands of grimm to slaughter. You get to play as team RWBY, each has a basic attack, long range attack and 3 specials. The combat is smooth except for the long range attacks and specials, with thes you can end up shooting the ground instead of hitting the grimm rying to eat you. I believe some sort of lock-on mechanic would be able to fix this.\nThe upgrade system is.....well functional. You need to do earn certain achievements to unlock certain skills and bonuses that increases your special damage, your aura(HP), aura recharge rate and special bar(used to activate specials). But due to the current short nature of the game, you'll only be able to get a small amount of these upgrades (I managed lvl 10 by the end of the 3rd mission).\nThe game features a fluid difficulty, the more players, the harder it is. Soloing it is childs play while a full party of 4 people is still childs play. I feel the game is lacking difficulty, I find it that the presence of the grimm is not menancing enough and really easy to clear out, soloing or in a full party.\n\nThe glismp of the story we get  is interesting which adds a little bit more lore to the RWBY universe and does not require the show to understand it (would be helpful to get to know the characters). Would like to see how the full story plays out.\n\nGraphics wise, would be similar to a JRPG, and has 3 settings, Potato ( can't believe this was actually a setting), Normal and Ultra. I also find no difference between Normal and Ultra. There's multiple  resolution options to chose from.\n\nI do find people are disconnecting a lot in parties, which the hosts are usuaslly are blamed, but I find it unlikely that every host has bad connection. So the server seems to need some tweaking for proper multi-player experience.\n\nTL;DR\nBare bones of the game, fighting mechanics are there, barely any story. Only recommend if you're a massive fan of the show and want to support this game production.","December 7, 2015","true","36.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is an amazing game. It has a lot of potential and I will be updating this review as there are more updates to the game. I can't stress how amazing this game feels, but note it is like 5% done. I wouldnt even call it an alpha, I would call it a ploit, a pre-alpha, even a concept.\nPOINT: If your fine with the fact that you are spending $17 on an pre-alpha that literally only has a bare bones structure, then buy this now.\nSeriously, it has nothing yet, no save progress, no loot, not a great combo system.\nThe only thing it offers now is online co op and beating up certain grimm enemies.  Everything else is not fully developed yet, hence the early access.\nNOTE: Don't read the other review about the pro and cons about the game. They are judging a game that is in early access and not even close to completed.\n\nIf you are not ok with buying a game that is not even close to being done, then dont buy this yet. Wait for it to get out of early access or at least wait for it to have a bit more elements to the game.\nIf you made it this far in this review.

If you have no idea what RWBY is, go to YouTube, look up "RWBY Season 1 Episode 1 : Ruby Rose" and start watching right now. Remember Haloid? Dead Fantasy? Red vs. Blue? The creator(s) of all three of those are behind this series.  It basically runs on the TV Trope "Rule of Cool."  (Yeah, you're now going to spend the rest of your day on TV Tropes.  You're welcome.)\n\nVisuals and Sound: Holy crap they're actually using the character models from the show itself and the real voice actors but they need more lines and *squeeeeeeee*\nGameplay: "FUN BUT BUGGY."  To be expected from a title which has literally been in Early Access for less than two weeks as of this writing.  That being said I'd be remiss in not critiquing this, as that's the point of Early Access -- feedback.\n\n* Lots of invisible walls are frustrating, especially when it's not immediately apparent why you can jump off one ledge, but not off of another ledge which visually looks exactly the same.  @Devs: If you're going to do this, please add some visual aid like a fence to explain why we can't jump off something.  Current invisible wall placements feel arbitrary, especially in The Emerald Forest.\n\n* Left-click combos tend to automatically go into the air after the first couple of clicks, which can be annoying if you intentionally do not want to go into the air and want to stay on the ground and keep slashing.  @Devs: Need more control over combo attack directions.  I mean I wasn't going into this expecting a Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance level of combat complexity but you may want to look at that game for ideas!\n\n* Aiming gun modes (right click) is frustrating as you have seemingly little to no control over where you're aiming and have to have faith in ye gods of autoaim to hit the right target.  Devs: Please, please look at Dark Souls and Metal Gear Rising and Phantasy Star Online for examples on how to do auto-lock-on targeting well.\n\nAs this is an Early Access title, this review will be updated after my next RWBY:GE session (especially with the next version).\n\nIf you read through all this, please leave a comment! :)","December 10, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Its one of the best hack & slash games I've played so far. Currently there's only 1 campaign that you can play with. The people in this community are pretty nice. Most of them are English speaking al least. If you are a non-english speaker then you shouldn't be playing international games since you can't communicate using english at all. Its pretty hard playing with someone who speaks in a foreign language to begin with.\n\nThis game focuses more in Teamwork. You may be bad at playing this game at all but don't lose hope. Your team is there trying to help you at times of defeat. I love how unique the leaderboard is all about that it only shows at the end of the match. I hope it stays until the end of the development.

If you have no idea what RWBY is, go to YouTube, look up "RWBY Season 1 Episode 1 : Ruby Rose" and start watching right now. Remember Haloid? Dead Fantasy? Red vs. Blue? The creator(s) of all three of those are behind this series.  It basically runs on the TV Trope "Rule of Cool."  (Yeah, you're now going to spend the rest of your day on TV Tropes.  You're welcome.)\n\nVisuals and Sound: Holy crap they're actually using the character models from the show itself and the real voice actors but they need more lines and *squeeeeeeee*\nGameplay: "FUN BUT BUGGY."  To be expected from a title which has literally been in Early Access for less than two weeks as of this writing.  That being said I'd be remiss in not critiquing this, as that's the point of Early Access -- feedback.\n\n* Lots of invisible walls are frustrating, especially when it's not immediately apparent why you can jump off one ledge, but not off of another ledge which visually looks exactly the same.  @Devs: If you're going to do this, please add some visual aid like a fence to explain why we can't jump off something.  Current invisible wall placements feel arbitrary, especially in The Emerald Forest.\n\n* Left-click combos tend to automatically go into the air after the first couple of clicks, which can be annoying if you intentionally do not want to go into the air and want to stay on the ground and keep slashing.  @Devs: Need more control over combo attack directions.  I mean I wasn't going into this expecting a Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance level of combat complexity but you may want to look at that game for ideas!\n\n* Aiming gun modes (right click) is frustrating as you have seemingly little to no control over where you're aiming and have to have faith in ye gods of autoaim to hit the right target.  Devs: Please, please look at Dark Souls and Metal Gear Rising and Phantasy Star Online for examples on how to do auto-lock-on targeting well.\n\nAs this is an Early Access title, this review will be updated after my next RWBY:GE session (especially with the next version).\n\nIf you read through all this, please leave a comment! :)","December 10, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Its one of the best hack & slash games I've played so far. Currently there's only 1 campaign that you can play with. The people in this community are pretty nice. Most of them are English speaking al least. If you are a non-english speaker then you shouldn't be playing international games since you can't communicate using english at all. Its pretty hard playing with someone who speaks in a foreign language to begin with.\n\nThis game focuses more in Teamwork. You may be bad at playing this game at all but don't lose hope.

Why? Well, depends on how much you know and like about RWBY.\n\nGranted, the gme is currently in its early development stage, which shows that it can become a promiing game for anybody who decides to pick it up. But, as it is now, it features four color coded girls with some crazy weapons destroying hordes of black creatures. That's... kind of what RWBY is in the first place. But, hey! I love it.\n\nThe game is an action packed beat 'em up with a feel similar to Devil May Cry, but not there yet. The game will be fleshed out later as it releases its full version. You pick one of four characters, each different but similar. They each have a standard combo, some which knock the enemy into the air and your character assaults it from there, and each has a ranged attack, which has the most variation of all of them. The special attacks are all similar as well, each character having an area attack, an attack good against single high level enemies, and a long ranged special. While they are all different in effect, visual, and feel, they all follow that same catagory. While this may seem like a negative thing, I find beautiy in this. While each character has their own quirks and battle style, I don't have to worry about whether or not I will be able to hold off multiple foes or be concerned with facing off against one. The characters all feel different, but they all have the same foundation; this is something I find intriguing and applaud the creator for doing (I can't remember his name...)\n\nThe game has it's pros, being fun, action packed fights that do indeed have a difficulty to them where I don't feel as though I reign as a god because the enemies attacks can hurt you if you don't pay attention. With an environment, storyline, and characters that has all RWBY fans whooping in celebration for one of the things they couldn't wait for, there are some negative quirks that will most likely be fixed. First off, your character level is not saved. You restart every time you play. The game is obviously a trial, as there are only four levels to play, after which you are whisked back to the main menu where you will either try again as another character or find something else to play. The game feels like it has a "rookie" feel, what from the visual aspect being a bit singular (there isn't a whole lot of detail or variation; a small thing, really), the characters movement feeling robotic (no acceleration; again, small detail), and some issues with targeting (no target lock, and I can't tell you how many times Ruby used Dust shot on Grimm that I wasn't even looking at). The grande scheme of the game looks fine, but if RT wants to make this a game that will win over not just RWBY fans but gamers in general, it has a bit of a ways to go.\n\nRegardless, I loved the game. It was fun. I got to play as my favorite characters from my most favorite show. If and when RT makes this game bigger and more epic (I hope they wiil, at least), it will be one of my favorites as well. Personally, I wish this game had the combat of Kingdom Hearts + Devil May Cry, the open world of Far Cry, and craziness of Just Cause. Of course, gamers also want to see Half Life 3. I have a better chance than they, but still, chances are slim.","December 31, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

And I was not disappointed. Being in Early Access stage I figured it would lack a lot of content and have several flaws, but just the little that was already done made me quickly recommend it to others. I love playing as Ruby, especially since she's my favorite character. Even more do I love to see places that I recognize and figuring out ways to handle challenging enemies like the bearlike Grimm (it's probably the deadliest one since I just can't interrupt its attacks).\n\nThe characters in this game varies in difficulty, which again varies from player to player. I've heard others say that Blake and Weiss are easy to handle, while Yang and Ruby are harder, while I have the opposite opinion. The skill-tree for each character is nice as it gives each player the opportunity to play in their styles. An example is for instance that I love the Crescentos-ability as it hits everyone around me and I'm quite good at entering a massive horde, activate Crescentos and then get some distance between me and the remaining Grimm, just to repeat it until a few are left standing, easy to take out.\n\nWhat I miss is more ways to play the game. Currently it's pretty much straight forward and gets boring over time. And treasures and XP-boosts are always in the same places, meaning you can't get much excitement of "treasure hunting" and try to find the stuff before your companions, as everyone who's found the stuff before knows pretty much where it is.\n\nAs the game is still under development, one cannot really complain about the lack of content, only about the quality of the existing content. This is why I feel it is wrong to say that this game gets boring because it is short and repeatively. However I do hope that this game will give the player more variety in the future, perhaps even several game modes like participation in the Vytal Festival, missions with a separate team (like JNPR) and perhaps a social platform where one can explore the cities and do other stuff peacefully (or violently if you're of that type. Though I doubt it will happen in this game, it would be fun if people could create their own characters and form their own teams one day, for instance in a ranked contest or something.\n\nNow enough of my crazy ideas, in overall I would give this a 7/10 as it still needs to work on some things to be one of the more "perfect" games.","January 2","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although it isn't perfect and there are definite improvements that can be made, the potential is through the roof for this game. Initially I got a very bayonetta and KH vibe from the game just from the overall feel too it. It stays true to the hack and slash genre and incorporates a relatively basic attack system. The combat consists of 3 specials, a basic meele attack, and a ranged attack. In the future I hope to see a more combo oriented combat style with the requirements of being able to weave all three together. Another thing they NEED to add is a quicker way to level each special attack. A huge annoyance during my gameplay experience was being unable to level abilities without risking being KO'd. Another thing I would like to touch on with the combat is the grimm. I liked the mix of grimm chosen, each provided a different combat style you needed to recognize and adapt too. However it seemed to easy to dodge each Grimm's special moves, more noticably the Borbatusk and the Ursa. All you would need to do is stop attacking and press SHIFT (dodge) when the Grimm would flash white. In the future adding more difficult timing and a multitude of attacks for each Grimm would keep players on their toes and actually punish them for making mistakes. My final critique on the combat is the lack of teamwork needed to play this game. Although I don't expect it yet from such an early build, the addition of team attacks and combos would not only stay true to the show but make the overall experience more submersive. Currently it boils down to who can secure kills and steal the most XP possible. The leveling system is also very strange. I would personally like them to take a skill tree route rather than the MOBA like leveling they have chosen. It feels extremely akward and doesn't seem to work in a 4 campaign game. Overall the game needs work but for being such an early build the potential for it is extremely exciting! I recommend to buy the game only if you are a fan of Roosterteeth and RWBY. If not then I would wait until more changes and updates are added to help create a full experience. Overall I give it a 6/10 for an early access but the potential is through the roof.","January 3","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

GG, killing enemies grants you special bars that are required to execute special moves, depending on their\nlevel they require different amount, for example fully upgraded aoe attack requires two bars of special, you level up your\ncharacter and can distribute points to upgrade your stats, aura or abilites.\n\nEnemies have red dots and glow white when they are about to execute an attack move, so you know when to dodge, some enemies only have the red dots over their head when attacking.\n\nDodging itself works well, if you just blindly dodge all the time you will get hit, so timing is required.\n\nGraphics. the layout in the world could be better, but overall the game looks beautiful.\n\nFor some reason i get fps drops at 1080p, even though i have beast pc, dont know why maybe it's just server lag\n\n\nSome bugs/annoyances\n\nSometimes when you do an aoe attack the enemies are not affected, and they just stand there like nothing happened.\n\nyou cant hit enemies that are starting or in middle of an attack move, same goes with if you are doing a special attack, then you cannot be hit, this can\nbe seen when charging an aoe attack.\n\nRunning is slow but there is sprinting in the game, it's on the dodge button so you dodge and keep holding the button to sprint.\n\nAnimations look a bit too fast on some moves, like Yang jumping and shooting, looks like shes shooting from between her legs. The running animation gets stuck\nfor a little while but then continues normally, other than that i dont understand what people are complaining how the animations are really horrible, to me most of them\nlook smooth, considering its early access, ♥♥♥♥ like this should in my opinion be forgiven.\n\nIn some places You can rotate the camera and see inside the world and even go inside the world. 	the world the world inside the wolrrldlsdlsdl insde the world the inside world wordl the sindetiete\n\nSometimes theres just so many enemies following you that it is difficult to start killing them, and with no special you just have to dash in there and somehow get a few kills\nor hope that someone saves your ♥♥♥.\n\n\n\nControls.\n\nController works very well, and the camera is easy to control , and i had no issues at with it.\nonly sometimes dodging didn't work, but i might have not been pushing the button agressively enough.\n\n\nReplaybility\nThe other characters.. nothing else really.\nThere are some ablities that require you to have 300 kills to get some better upgrade for it\nand the kill counts does stay on characters you have  already played with\nif you played the game alone then you can have quick fun with your friends\n\nSound\nI found the music to be very good, no clipping and it is not distracting, and during a boss fight badass metal starts playing\nthe health regen sound i found to be too bassy, like the constant WOOOOM sound when losing health because of a hard situation, does get annoying.\nThe voice acting is good, sometimes it does feel a bit forced.., YAY we win part\n\nCinematics,,\nThere are only two cinematic sections currently in the game and they play out smoothly, just the fire effect in the explosion is cheap.\n\nPrice\nCurrently the game costs 15buks or 15 euro's, For an early access game with barely an hour of content, that is alot.. unless you are like me and like to play\nwith all the characters, enjoy this kind of Hack and slash games then you got almost 4 hours, of fun so it's not a bad price, who knows if the price goes up, after more content is released\nand how many anime kawaii gurl hack & slash games are there on pc anyway?\nSo i say its a good purchase, there is alot of potential for this game and i hope they make it a great baddassss ♥♥♥♥♥\ncos this is just the kind of game i've been waiting for, for years.\n\nThe Pro's, the cons and the Scoring\n\n\nPro's\nFastpaced gameplay\n4 charaters, (Anime gurls)\nEasy controls\nsomewhat challenging but not too difficult, or too easy.\nEasy learning curve, if any.\n\n\nCons\nshort for now, Barely 1 hour of gameplay with 1 character playthrough.\n15 bucks\nannoying bugs\n\nNow for some scoring\nScoring\nGameplay 9/10\nGraphics 9/10\nAnimations 6/10\ncontrols 8/10\nSoundtrack 8/10\nReplayability 7/10\n\nOverall score 7.8 Good Game!","December 30, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As well as some maps have some glitchy spots.\n\nnext the character roster is very small being theres only 4 heroines to play as ruby wiess blake and yang.\n\nplease again keep in mind its early access and i think the deves are really looking at good feedback to make the game awsome. becouse remember those percusing early access are buying a promis not afull game but this promis seems to be a fun one.

I honestly thinks its worth te $14.99!\n\nPros:\n\nGraphics - The game looks great and it looks amazing on ultra settings. The characters looks just like the ones from the show and the art style is great. Nothing for me to complain about here.\n\nCombat - The battle style in the game is unique. It can be repetitive if your playing alone but if your playing with a group of friends at max difficulty the combat is anything but repetitive. I like all the characters and their abilities.\n\nVoice Acting - The characters are voiced by the same people in the show which really made me happy because I RWBY is a great Anime/Show. Whichever you like to call it.\n\nExploration - People might think its not worth much but there are hidden artifacts to help you level up throughout each level and destroying the boxes help give players xp so I recommend that you explore the map and take advantage of this.\n\nAbilities - Some are generic but your characters combat abilities are great. Each character kinda has its own playstyle and abilities and then they have the set of abilities that all characters can unlock. For example of a generic ability, is that you can revive people faster. Also I like the fact that you have to do challenges to unlock the abilities. Makes the game more fun.\n\nCons:\n\nSound - The game was really loud for me and I mean mostly the combat and footsteps. You can turn down music and voice but the combat and footsteps stay the same. I think it would be nicer if players had the option to turn that stuff down. Luckily I went to Volume mixer and lowered my game.\n\nAmount of Current Content - It's lacking levels and characters. The game is great and I know its early access so yes players can be expecting more content to come and I know that its going to get more levels but right now there are currently only four levels and its can be boring after a few playthroughs.\n\nWalking - When your characters walking sometimes their feet start to glitch and its kind of funny. Its just a small bug and the developers will surely fix it.\n\n*NOTE* - I will be updating this as the game continues to release more content. Thanks for reading this and I hoped it help.","December 4, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Needs some more levels as well as achievements, but is a game I would recommend to anyone wanting a fun hack and slash game.\n\n[Edit] Love the new controls scheme, with the heavy attacks, different ranged attacks after a set of three, and the whole countering system, but not so keen on the new camera control. Seems to lag a bit, setting the camera ahead of my camera, and seems to affect the camera rotation. But still a great game. Keeps getting better with each update.

I enjoy it as a mix between MOBA and Tecmo-Koei's various Warriors series.\n\nPros\n\nThe game is pretty fun, and the abilities make for a pretty unique experiance for any players.\n\nOur awsome game designers always inform us when an update is coming, send us teaser images, and are planning to implement the duetaganist(s) of RWBY Jaune Arc, Nora Valkiry, Pyrrha Nikos, and Lie Ren of team JNPR.\n\nNew shader gives the game a look of its own compared to the show.\nCons\n\nObivous one, the shader gives the game a look different of the show.  (Some people like it, some don't, I personally am just happy to have the dang thing)\n\nThe max level is 10, so if you like seeing numbers go up, well I'm sorry.\n\nCertain abilities are locked behind 'acheivment walls' meaning you have to do certain things to unlock them.  (Understandable since the powers are strong enough to become a game changer like Wiess's Barrage ability.)\n\nWhen defeating grimm, only the person who lands the finishing blow gets EXP. (Team attacks, if you can react (shoot now I have to pay the Fine Brothers) fast enough give about thirty experiance to the players who made the enemy vunerable and who followed up.  Letting you know this, I hadn't been watching the exp bar last time I played, so The first part may not be true.\nCan I recommend this game?  The answer is a firm yes.  Just want you to know what you're getting into.","May 9","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not only do I get to play as 1 of 4 members of team RWBY, I also get to experience a story that isn't a rehash of the series.\n\nThere are only two things I wish the game had:\n1. I wish the shooting had an option between rapid fire and going through the shoot combo sequence. Example: there are times where I would want to just continuously shoot with Blake's pistol and times where I would need the extra range from her slash wave. Having the choice would be very useful especially in terms of strategy.\n2. The option (not a requirement) to make a room where only one of every member of RWBY is allowed. It gets a bit boring and weird when you have 4 Rubys in one team and everyone is doing the same thing. It can be fun, yes, but also a bit chaotic and it lacks diversity.","May 5","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've played it way too much and enjoyed every hour, testing out everything for all Team RWBY and loved playing each one of them (Except maybe for Weiss, not becasue she's bad or anything but becasue I just don't like her, sorry not sorry)\n\nNow if your not a big RWBY fan I won't say don't get it, I want them to get as much support as they can, but if you don't watch the show you won't really know a great deal of who you are, what and why you're fighting, or really feel connected to the world of Remnant in the slightest. But hey, I think you'll have some fun with it.\n\nBut if you like fairly simple hack-n-slash games with a cool art stlye and amazing music with the support of one of the best companys as well one of the best communties behind it, get it and who knows maybe you'll start watching the show if you haven't already.\n\nP.S.

It's not as good as you would like it to be and rough around the edges as a hack & slash type game. The game is in beta or Early access so don't expect too much out of it except for fanboy/fangirl characters you wanted to play as or fighting along side.\n\n-PROS:\n*The lag is barely noticeable & get to play with people\n*The Controls are nice for an Early Access and hope they improve it\n*The Whole RWBY team is avalible for play and have their different attacks based on their style\n*The voice acting for english is actually very well done! Keep up the good work!\n*Style & Graphics maybe rough but it'll grow on you like part of the world during gameplay\n\n-CONS\n*No single player: Seriously, there is none whatsoever and you're always online which kinda sucks\n*No Character Creation: Not really a con but it'll be great to fight along side the RWBY team or have your own attacks\n*Many people can be the same character: I literally had 3 yangs on one team. Funny though but so much yellow ...\n*No control Mapping: It's actually hack & slash friendly but no option to change for other people\n*No other characters besides team RWBY: I would like to see more characters besides the main team.\n*Graphics: a Small problem but you look like you're walking on air and the style needs to be flourished more (to me).\n*The biggest problem I have with the game is the attacks and Leveling. once you comeplete 3 stages you beat the early access game story line. Once you start again you go back to level 1 no matter what and some of the perks are locked due to challenge you have to complete. Not having a save feature for this level is much to be desired but it's early access so probably in due time\n\n-SUMMARY:\nEven though it may have a ton of cons in this review but the pros outweigh it by light years if only the game wasn't $15. I wish this was a bigger project so you can be another character or be one in the series. The Combat needs to be improved along side the stats so you can feel like you're actually getting better. Though as it's a beta it's fine! Just wish there was more and hope it doesn't catch the early access cold where this is the game as most like H1Z1 did to other people.Other than that, Most cof the cons can be a Pro which is a very big plus on this game and wish they follow up with it.\n\nRWBY: Grimm Ecipse is not a buy it now ... rather keep a close eye on it with a lot of potentia!\n\n","December 7, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good hack and slash game and of course fans of RWBY.\n\n\n\n","December 1, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Only 4 missions atm but this is early access, so a lot more content is going to be released. Plus challenging difficulty leaves everything down to skill and not numbers. Only complaint is the fair amount of lag/hiccups in frame rate. Hopefully RT will fix that but in the mean time give this one a try!","December 2, 2015","true","12.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, I've been a long-time fan of Roosterteeth and I follow RWBY with a passion. I also played the original fan-made version and the pre-alpha on the Roosterteeth site. So boy howdy did I buy this as soon as it went up.\n\nThe first thing I should point is that I'm obviously going to be biased towards the game, but I'll try to point out some of the flaws. Bearing in mind this is the first version of Early Access, so I bet in a few weeks this review will be entirely outdated.\n\nPros:\n- Combat: Solid hack and slash combat. Each character has three unique skills as well as a general skills that are shared between the characters. Weiss for example, has a lunge attack, an AoE and a long range barrage attack. Special attacks use up segments of your special bar, which can be refilled by chainging combos on enemies. Enemies are reasonably varied and require different tactics, although once you've played through a few runs you begin to determine the best ways to beat them, so it's a case of memorisation e.g. Beowolves can be killed with a single combo, Ursas take multiple and you should avoid their ground pound etc.\n\n- Upgrade trees: Characters can level up their skills over the course of a campaign. You get 9 points (assuming you reach level 10) to invest however you want, and at the end of the campaign your character is reset. This MOBA style leveling allows you to play different roles each time. Using our Weiss example, one playthrough I might max out her Nova AoE attack, allowing me to freeze enemies and control the crowd. Another run I might max her lunge, letting me quickly dispatch high health enemies. Challenges that let you unlock special skills are persistant though, so once you unlock them you never have to again. This rewards people that play the game with special upgrades as time goes by.\n\n-Voice acting: Since the game is made by Roosterteeth, all the characters have the same voice actors as the show, which really puts you in the world. Ruby and Yang especially make you feel like you're taking part in an episode.\n\nCharacter variation: Each character has a distinct style of combat, so it's really refreshing to switch between them. Yang is very much an in your face brawler, Blake excels at moving around the battlefield picking off targets quickly, Weiss can provide incredibly useful support in the form of freezing, Ruby has superb long range attacks and varied skills for any situation. Additionally, the unique passive skills you can unlock feel perfectly suited for each character, tied to their history and styles.\n\nCons:\n- Bugs: To be expected for Early Access, but surprisingly minor bugs so far. Characters suck at going down slopes, their animations freeze or stutter until they get onto level ground. If using a controller, moving at low speeds causes your character to glide. Blake has a weird period of glide if you move immediately after firing her gun. Ruby's ranged attack propels her backwards, so sustained firing can cause you to sort of merge into walls, although I've not gotten stuck from this yet. However, the combat is absolutely solid. I've heard that two characters that are downed next to each other can revive each other but I've not experienced this myself.\n\n-Jumping: To be honest, the jumping feels kind of pointless so far. Most enemies are low enough to the ground that jump attacks just miss, and the ones that you can hit (like Ursa) you're better off getting a ground combo off for full damage.\n\n-Short: While the character leveling and variation lends itself nicely to multiple playthroughs, at the moment there's only one campaign, spanning four 'stages'. It can quickly get repetitive, but there are a planned 3 total campaigns. That's probably around 3-4 hours content if you play multiplayer, more in singleplayer. But, the real appeal is in the character development so this should balance out fine.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of Roosterteeth, RWBY or solid hack and slash games I highly recommend Grimm Eclipse. It's a small team of 4 developers, but since they're not on a schedule and this is basically a side project for RT they can take their time and make exactly the game they want to make. Very fun, High replayability, Great matchmaking/co-op and less buggy than Assassins Creed.","December 2, 2015","true","33.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Fighting is very fluid and enjoyable. So far i havn't encountered any bugs and the Grimm seem both easy to deal with alone, but watch out if you are seperated from your team and surrounded by them.\n\nSo far the only issues i have with the game are minor. Ruby could use a targeting crosshair or aiming assist for her Right-Click shoot as i could never tell where i was aiming. Settings of course could be expanded. The fighting and Grimm sounds are LOUD AS ALL CAN GET and nearly blasted my ears off without the setting to change the sound for it. A tutorial would be nice to assist with learning the abilities, but after just playing around for 5-10 mins I got the gist of how the abilities worked.  The only Bug i have encountered so far is Ruby's animation freezes when walking down a slope/hill, instead of showing the walking animiation but its not too big a deal.\n\nAnother little thing that bugs me is how out of place the characters look in the world. In the underground city section of the emerald forest, Ruby's model was bright and stuck out compared to the underground tunnel she was in, and she had no shadow.\n\nSince this is early access i understand the game is still very early in development. Like others i would love to see player progression and customization in the future. I had 2 Blakes in my game and the only way to tell them apart was to walk up to them to see their names.\n\nOther than these little things i mentioned, I so far enjoy the game a bunch and i'm about to go hop into a game with some friends now to play.\n\n8/10 overall.","December 1, 2015","true","4.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I feel no reason to play her other then liking her as a character\nBlake's hit boxes are also bad\nWay to short even for early access. 3 hours and Ive beat it all using characters. That includes soloing on play through\n\nReview: Other then some pretty big fault in character skill and hit boxing I enjoyed it. I would recommend if you have the money to spare and you don't mind the repetition. I feel like the environment fits the lore well and it is fun to explore outside of what we see in the show. With there was more game play then gauntlet fights that pretty much wrap up all but one of the levels.\n\nCharacters are pretty fun to play as, I had a lot of fun messing around with Ruby and Weiss. Yang took a bit to get used to, I could see her being hard to play if you dont get the special that helps restore special skill. The scoring is heavily dominated by decent AoE attacks so Blake and Yang suffer a lot from that from not having good ones. Blake by far is the worst character in the game and has majority of the flaw/bugs character wise. Her moves are pretty bad, they either dont do like any damage compared to the others or sometimes are just useless. He shadow clone ability I think is really cool, however it take 1 special to use and is only good if you chain it with other clones. Her gun pretty much misses 70% of the time. I literally stood in front of a box and missed. Yangs problems I think is in her DPS. I think she should be a harder hitting character, maybe not a huge difference but I think she should do a bit more. Ruby and Weiss don't need much improvement, I think they are easily the most OP characters with their god like AoEs and specials.","December 2, 2015","true","13.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Many. Just to address that a offline single-player mode should be added in later development since online only is just a little off-putting. Second: A save feature should added later since upgrading skills and leveling up seeming pointless at the moment since every time you play a game you reset back to lvl 1. The audio is great but audio in sounds really drone out the music even when music volume is maxed out sometimes so audio levels need to be adjusted later in development. Comabt is very fun but the special moves need some work more so on how to increase your special meter, personally i think a cooldown meter would be a lot better because it is so irritating that one hit breaks your combo meter espically when you need 12 hits to increase it by one block, hitboxes are another problem too since sometimes it feels and looks as close-range enemy attacks seem to hit me farther than usual which go in into the same issue with the special moves. Lastly some attack animations are missing from enemies, very very noticable when they are attacking the control center in those "protect the control tower" parts where you can clearly see them just standing in front of it while the area's health lowers. In conclusion this game still needs alot of work and improvements but this is why it's in early access state of development, the game is fantastic and loads of fun with other people but i'd say to wait maybe just a little longer to purchase since it still needs some improvement cause this has alot of potential. I still recommend it to RWBY fans and hack-and-slash fans, just don't expect perfection since this just released and is in early access","December 3, 2015","true","6.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I'm a big fan of RWBY and Rooster Teeth, so I didn't want my bias to get in the way. But after playing as all four characters and experiencing the game with lots of diffferent groups, I can say its pretty fun.\n\nThe controls are tight and feel good, and although there's no tutourial (which I hope the main game will have) it doesn't take long to pick up on things. I noticed a difference in the characters with how hard they hit and how fast they moved, though it could have been my considerably defensive playstyle. The levels look beautiful, and I'd love to explore them more, but besides the occassional branching path there isn't much deviation. The game sounds good, from the music to the voices, but sound effects (especially leveling up and health regen) need to be reduced, or at least have a slider.\n\nMy biggest complaint is probably the initial interfacing. If you play with randoms, you can't tell who the other characters are, which sucks if you want to go with the full Team RWBY setup and end up with Team RRWY.  I was initially a bit upset that you had to start from the begining unle,ss you joined a friend, butr considering how short a full playthrough is (about an hour) it's not a big deal. I just hope the final version has a level select and slightly better single-player setup.\n\nThis game is short, but a lot of fun. You can tell by the way it ends that they're setting uup for the full release, which is fine by me. I hope the cutscenes are animated like the "World of Remnant" shorts, and they do even more voice acting. The $15 feels a bit pricey for a game that is clearly more akin to a demo, but it's early access and from Rooster Teeth, so I trust this will be more than worth it in the future.","December 2, 2015","true","7.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I also am a game dev myself so yeah there actually will be critisism in here. "I have a reputation to uphold" - Weiss Schnee\n\nAs it is early acess you should be expecting bugs. So if you want a PERFECT game turn away now. It's bound to get better in the next 8-10 months though (at least i hope so).\n\nSo lets get into it -\nPros:\n- Doesn't take up much space on your computer (small file)\n- Maps are beautiful\n- The characters (team RWBY) so far look great\n- Controls are good\n- Fast paced gameplay\n- Easy to chain combos together\n- The health - contrary to what most people are saying, i think the health is a good idea.  Getting youself surrounded in this game gets you killed just as quickly as it would in the show. If you're a casual player... yeah go play something else. This game isn't even that hard.\n- OMG THE VOICE ACTING\n- AND THAT SOUND TRACK (I'm a sucker for a good sound track)\n\nCons:\n- If you don't watch the show this is quite literally going to be a waste of your time and money.\n- When you are walking up or down hills the walking/running animation is frozen (you look like you stop moving and glide across the map)\n- The targeting system doesn't always work with you. You'll find yourself shooting at the wrong target and missing straight line skill shots.\n- Oh yeah, it's really repetitive.\n- Invisible walls... like lots of them.\n- Almost no customization. It'd be cool if there was a basic character and weapon creator as a feature but that'd probably create more than a few bugs in and of itself. It gets to me because I love OC's (original characters) in games like this one. The closest thing to customization in this game is the skill tree (which gets wiped clean everytime you start a new game).\n- All the characters pretty much feel the same. Melee, Skill, Shoot, Kill.\n- Same enemies every time.\n\n\nConclusion:\nAt the end of the day this game is faithful to the show and in my opinon has quite a few bugs. I DO NOT REGRET MY PURCHASE. I have faith that the game will improve quite a lot in the coming months and even if you aren't a die hard fan I'd recommend picking up this game.","December 2, 2015","true","11.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Its hard to pay $15 for a game where in it's current state you can play and see everything there is to see in two playthroughs (about an hour worth).

I do understand that this game is still in early access, but here are are few things I would like to point out to the developers.\n\n1. For me at least, I have noticed the game crashing after finishing the mission in Mountain Glenn after the tall building falls down. At this point I'm directed to a frozen screen where I'm meant to transfer to Mountain Glenn Underground. This is where the game crashes for me.\n2. I am getting vibes from Dynasty Warriors on this game, as far as the playstyle is concerned, but, like the more recent rwby episodes, the fighting seems too rushed, and I feel disconnected from the character at such a distance away. If we could integrate heavy and light attacks at a slower and more believable pace, we could discover some really cool combos as well as some hybrid ones with the firearms, and people would be able to see cleary how their button presses effect the characters fighting. And yes, there should be a blocking mechanism.\n3. Majority of my reasoning is not just my own, as I believe many have already pointed these things out. One last thing I wanna ask the developers is if they have seen the AllTheoryNoPractice channel on Youtube where there is a RWBY Design video. This guy was at RTX when Rooster Teeth announced that they were becoming a game studio, and so had "10-ish" hours worth of design that went through his head for the game as he saw it.  The way he envisioned the RWBY game is much different to the way the game is given currently, but I won't give all the details since his video explains it all much better than I would.\n4. Lastly, as far as my recommendation, I would recommend th game, since as the game develops, most likely the price will increase, especially if it takes on what AllTheoryNoPractice entails, except, of course during Steam deals and holiday discounts.\nOtherwise, great game so far. Continue to do your best Rooster Teeth for your community as far as this game goes and as the story of RWBY progresses.\n","December 6, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Its artstyle is very very close to what you see in the show and it gives to its players a sense that they are playing RWBY. The action is very swift and fast paced, small skill trees that makes you feel like your almost playing a moba, and a small set of combo attacks. Its not combo heavy but it is certainly a hack'n slash at its core.\n\nThus far its only 3 days after its early access so it only really has one campaign so far that takes between 30 minutes to an hour to complete. I wouldnt critisize this too much cause its got 4 distinct area's to it with mobs that act like they do in the show. The more players you have the harder the fight gets up to 4 players.\n\nLast note I shall shine on is the characters. when playing each character you feel like you are them from the show. it is very well thought up and the combat style, even though there are small area's of improvement I see, are spot on.\n\nI can easily see this game be a smash hit if the developer gives it just the right amount of elbow grease. Tons of action, lots of potential gameplay, and a limitless possability in campaigns and missions. If the skill system is panned out just a tiny bit and maybe broadened. I would say this game is going places.\n\nOn a side note. I would like to state that it would be awesome to see a wavebased survival mode. This is exactly the type of game that would well support that and would broaden the game in general.

Fun beatem up style, even for non-RWBY fans.\n\nAlright everybody, I'd like to preface this by saying I am in no way someone who reviews games on the regular. I probably don't know what I am talking about, but this is my opinion of the GAME (Not as part of RWBY).\n\nThe feel of the gameplay mechanics seem very Dyntasty Warriors in my optinon. It's a beatem up game in which they throw many weaker enemies at you. Its fun to kill massive amounts of these creatures. Dispite being simplistic, the controls still allow for a good amout of diversity with the combos that you can preform. Most importantly is the 3 main abilities which are unique for the four characters. They all feel effective and worth using, although I have personally run into issues of larger creatures blocking the damage from them by attacking. Either way, people find what playstyle they want to go for, the abilities and level ups give you the option to focus more on a specific style of play. Contrary to popular beleif, your progress does save, your level does not. So when an unlock requires you to kill x amount of grimm, once you unlock that you don't have to re-unlock it later. As far a gameplay is concerned there are some issues that appear (Glitching and whatnot). However we have to remember that this is an EARLY ACCESS game. Meaning this review is based on this games potential.\n\nGraphically this game is beautiful, and dispite having many many invisible walls  you still feel as if you can roam around a little. I noticed some complaints about how the main characters looked. That they seemed flat, specifically in their hair. to me, thats the style they were going for. The sound effects need some toning down, as they are super loud, but that's an easy fix I would think. Of course the voice acting is good, although characterized.\n\nAll in all i would recomend this game, I think it will be improved on by the developers as I have never known RoosterTeeth to slack off in anything they do. Give it a little more time and this'll be a very fun beatem up game to play with friends.","December 2, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I don't feel like I need to point out the different story related elements since most of your already know them and the rest will have read it someplace else.\n\nAs an early access it was pretty obvious to me even before I started that the game would contain lots of bugs and little content, but despite knowing this I still wanted to dive into the RWBY universe and feel the rush of controlling one of the four protagonists from team RWBY.\n\nMy personal experience from playing this game is very positive, the controls required some getting used to but was very smooth. The battle animations was smooth aswell but certain enemies could sometimes lag in their attacks and mess up your dodge timing, but I endured it since it's just an early access. Obviously most of those issues will be dealt with as bug/glitch fixes and polishing.\n\nThe sound was alright quality wise but the sound levels was abit all over the place, loud combat sounds and low voices made it feel abit frustrating at time (I ended up lowering them alltogether and pull out my RWBY vol.1-2 soundtracks).\n\nGraphics is really nice in a charming way, it's nothing fascinating like the big titles of 2015 but it serves its purpose of staying true to the RWBY universe. It's my personal hope that they do not change the style and direction they are going for, I just wish they would add alittle bit more of what already is there to the world and give it some more "depth".\n\nWhen this review was made there was only one "Chapter" I suppose you could call it, called Emerald Forest and it had alot of areas for casual battles and a bunch of defense locations, a boss room and a escort mission. So there is/was quite alot of things to do. Only thing most people complained about here was that your leveling progress was resetted between each new run, only thing that was consistant was the progress of unlocking new ability upgrades. Hopefully they will look into this more ahead or perhaps they already plan to make changes to that.\n\nThere was some minor bugs that me and my friend personally found but nothing that halted the games progress so far, game has alot of work and polishing to do but all in all it was very fun and I could tell it would be one of those games that brings out an addiction in people once it's completed.\n\nNow for some biased stuff, if you're into RWBY like myself... GET IT NOW AND STOP READING REVIEWS!!! The girls need you!!!\n\nThanks for taking your time to read this and I hope to see you all ingame, let's support and enjoy this game untill and past it's full release. :D\n\n","December 1, 2015","true","4.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","7","12","2","1"

The animation, combat, and story are non-existant for the time being. There is enough there to be a decent hack-n-slash game, but nothing more.

That being said though, the campaign currently out is way too short for me to recommend for the price. Maybe at 10 dollars until more stuff is added in. I know that 15 dollars (14.99) doesn't seem like much to Rooster Teeth but honestly I feel a tad cheated. There is only 1 game mode (that's ok) and it is the story mode I assume, however the issue of pricing became a concern when I found that the story mode has 5(Maybe more or less? I played 3 complete sets with 3 different groups and it kind of blurred) linear maps with holdout missions and nothing else. Experience points from crates are fought over (Why not share with the team? This is a cooperative game after all and artifacts count towards everyone already.) My biggest gripe would be the General Abilities which are unlocked by performing certain skills to kill enemies, reviving team-mates etc. In what universe are any of the player characters reasonably going to reach 200 kills using 1 of their abilities just to unlock a general ability like mastery? Some of the skills need work as well. I found myself only using 1 ability mostly because there is only about 1 per character worth investing in with the exception of Weiss who has a heal.\nA good temporary fix for the game in its current state would be to have more Grimms per map and more waves of enemies during holdouts. This would help players get exp and pad out the gameplay because as it stands the game can be done in 30-45 minutes or so (feels like so much less)\nLove the show\nStoked about the game but I can't recommend right now\nMight change when new stuff is added or things change","December 3, 2015","false","8.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/418340/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI decided to be one of those guys who insta-buys the game, so others can read early opinions of the game before risking buying it. So, is it good or bad? It depends.\n\nAre you a fan of RWBY? Do you like those "Smash one key non-stop to win" kind of games? You like to support good companies who actually tried to put an effort into an Early Access title? Then you should buy it(although, 15€ for this is a high risk for now).\n\nAs I usually do, I'll start with the bad things of the game. First and foremost, look at how much I've played the game. Less than an hour. That's what it took me to finish it. I'm not joking, the "campaign" that there's already in the game is arround an hour long, which is kind of short for 15 DAMN €'S. Of course the game will get more and more as the game goes on, but I can't say this long enough, there will be some dumbass who'll buy it at full price and expect hours and hours of content. Of course, it's fun to play it with friends (I literally have noone to play it but stranges as I have no friends who bought it yet), but you can only play something so much times before it eventually gets repetitive: It needs more content, fast. The story that there's on the game is actually good, and impressive for Early Access levels, but I just hope it doesn't take the devs 3 months for each new story.\n\nSecond, the characters. Don't get me wrong, I like the RWBY characters, but having only 4 is kinda weak. There's another team of 4 characters which could be insanely fun to have here, and if you saw the series, YOU KNOW WHICH GUYS I'M TALKING ABOUT. I just want to make sure to make the devs know it: the game NEEDS more characters. That being said, the characters already on the game, being Ruby, Yang, Blake and Weiss are cool enough. Specially Yang, of course. I haven't yet seen Weiss ingame as noone picked her, but I bet she's also fun. Also, they look great, taken directly from the show. Oh and, one other thing... When characters talk, the subtitles don't advance. A lot of lines are too long to fit on the screen, and get stuck on limbo. Fix that, please: non-english speakers will have A LOT OF TROUBLE OTHERWISE!\n\nThe third thing I'll comply about, are the enemies. I know, it's a Dinasty Warriors-kind of game... But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be original. There are a bunch of enemies taken from the show, but not much variety. Some boar-like monsters that spin and charge like Sonic, the Grunt-like monsters that don't do much unless they come in packs, the Beowolfs that do some sort of plunging attack with their claws, Bear-like Grimms that for some reason, stomp the ground hard enougnh rocks explode, and later on some green beasts that explode. The main complaint with this is that once you find out their weakness, dying is a joke. It should also say, there are no real bosses. There's a big guy with tons of HP, but he acts just the same as the bear Grimms, which was kind of a dissapointment.\n\nThe last bad thing I see, is on the skill-tree and XP system. First of all, XP is given to however gets the killing blow, or finds XP orbs hidden in crates (XP from artifacts is shared). Now, why does it work like this? It should at least be shared, meaning the killing blow gives 100% XP, and helping gives from 75 to 25%, depending on how much damage you did to it. Right now, you can just spam your skills when things go low and take it all for yourself. That being said, the Skill-tree needs some work. As there is no tutorial, you can't now right off the bat what the characters do, that's a problem. While adding a Tutorial could help a lot, I think you guys are going the wrong direction: I believe levels should be global and unique for the character. Meaning, you reached LVL2 with Yang, you'll be LVL2 with Yang even if the game ends. That would give the game A TON of more replayability, as games could become eventually harder and harder. Also, it should have two skill-trees at the same time: One of passive abilities such as "Having more HP" or "Saving people faster", but also adding increased power and HP with levels and skill-points, and another for your actual skills.\n\nAll of that being said, what do we have left? A game that will probably be something great... But right now it's more like a demo. It's hard to tell if the game will or not be great right now, but it does look like the Devs placed a lot of effort on it, so I'm going to stay positive about it.\n\nThe voices are just great. The graphics are simple, but cool. The models look great, as they have been ripped from the show. The game can be entertaining for a while, as it's quite simple. The maps look great, although I did find an area on the last map with some sort of glitch that the devs over-looked.\n\nIs it worth it? As I said, it depends. If you have 15€ to spare and want to help a good Early Access game grow, jump right ahead. If you're a fan of RWBY like me, you'll find it good enough. Otherwise, you mind want to wait for more updates. Oh and, I'll try to update this as things get added in, of course.\n\nAnd please, Devs. ADD RED VS BLUE REFERENCES. I MEAN COME ON, I KNOW YOU CAN'T PHYSICALLY ADD CABOOSE TEAM-KILLING PEOPLE BUT AT LEAST SOME SORT OF CAMEO OR REFERENCE!","December 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I am a huge fan of RWBY, probably one of the biggest, but this game in all honestly is really underwhelming. I know this game is still in early access, and I know the game will definitely improve over the next couple updates and become an amazing game, but for now, it's really bad. This game as of now is not worth 15 dollars, so don't buy it unless you're a diehard RWBY fan such as myself.\n\nI'll start with the cons first of this game.\n\nCons:\n-The Animations for this game is very choppy. When I see the characters walk, I sorta cringe a little because of how bad it was.\n-This game gets VERYYYYYY laggy at times. When you hit big waves, which you're going to often encounter, the game can't handle all the mobs and gets super laggy.\n-Your character progress does not save once you exit the game. This is very frustrating at times because I would get my character to a pretty high level and it doesn't even save.\n-Very Limited move pool. I know this is going to expand further as the game updates and such, but each character only has 3 special moves and then the normal slash combo. Pretty underwhelming because if you compare it to other Dynasty warrior ripoff games, they have this aspect correct.\n-Subtitles are pretty bad/can't keep up if they speak very long sentences.\n\n\nNow onto the Pros:\n\nPros:\n-It's a ♥♥♥♥ing RWBY game. I've been waiting for this for so long. Once I heard it was on Steam greenlight, I immediately upvoted it because more RWBY stuff = More RWBY love and popularity.\n-Voice Acting is very good. They got the Voice Actors for each of the RWBY characters in this game and it's really awesome hearing them speak in the game.\n-Besides Limited move pool, the combat is really fun at times. I'm sure they're going to eventually add more moves and newer enemies in the game, and that'd be super awesome.\n-Character designs are awesome. Besides the choppy animation, them character designs are to die for.\n-It's a New story, new enemies we've never encountered, it's pretty awesome if you want to see that.\n-The ♥♥♥♥ing music is beautiful. let me spell it out for you. B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L.\n\nI love the RWBY series, I love everything about it. From the characters to the music to its lore. But my god this game is so not worth 15 dollars. Unless you're a die hard RWBY fan or a person who likes playing Early Access games. Don't buy this game for 15 dollars. This is at best a 5-10 dollar game, but not a 15.\n\n*UPDATE*\nWhat I want to see more with the game:\n-It'd be awesome if we get some sort of PVP system going in the game, just like the battle colosseum in Volume 3 of RWBY.\n-A custom character creation. It'd be really awesome if we can create our own character and play them in campaign missions.\n-A firefight game mode. Just pure waves of grimm until you all die.\n-Unlockable characters such as Cinder and Neo. I so want to play that adorable small ice cream lady.","December 6, 2015","false","2.1"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","22","42","4","2"

Ruby is very childish, Weiss is a whiney smart ♥♥♥, i don't think i even heard Blake talk even with my friend playing her the whole time. And Yang?

Running down hills and stairs is you just floating down with your legs in a running position, not moving until you hit a flat surface.\n\nx (Fixed?? I don't know if this was really considered a problem, but they replaced the audio for it.) The aura regen sounds like it was ripped from Halo. While this is not really a problem, it doesn't sound like it belongs there.\n\nx Lack of enemy variety. I think we literally fought 5 enemy types and for the most part they attacked very similarly. (Also, ♥♥♥♥ those boars)\n\nx (Blake only) If you try to run immediately after shooting, Blake will do a standing slide for about half a second.\n\n\nI will periodically play and update this review.

So far, I enjoy it.\n\n+Graphics are great. It feels immersive when I run through the stage.\n+Fighting mechanics are great so far. I didn't notice any gameplay bugs or problems while I am fighting an enemy.\n+Music is enjoyable. It's captures the music of the RWBY show itself.\n+Ability and level-up features are great.\n\nHowever, I do notice some parts of the game that need improvement:\n\n-The camera angling needs work. I find myself adjusting the camera so that I am able to see the enemy I'm fighting directly.\n-A dash mechanic would be nice. It kind of feels dragged out when I'm taking some time trying to get from one place to another.\n-It's a small thing, but it would be cool if the radar on the top left shows the terrain.\n-Some graphical dynamics would help give the game more "oomph" when you are using a special attack or a crazy combo.\n-A manual lock-on feature would help me shoot the correct enemy from afar.\n-Sound effects could need some variety.

Which means, it will be expanded upon.  Which means that it has an excuse for being short.  That said, what is already in the game, for the most part, is great.  The look of the game is great, as are the sounds.  Combat is good for the most part but things could be improved.\n\nAlso, when reading the list below, keep in mind I have 9hrs, with a lot of it pretty much all playing on Blake, so there will be a number of points focused around her..\n\nThe Good Stuff:-Graphic style\n-Smooth combat ( dodges, attack notifications)\n-Good 'ol music\n-Voice acting (mostly)\n-Easy to play with friends\n-Not restrictive on who you can play\n-Enemy variations\n-Character models are brilliant!\n-Active dev team\n\nThe Stuff-which-could-be-improved:-More content (again, EA so it's okay for now)\n-Bugs (EA, again, it's okay for now)\n-Blake's VA gone missing! (But seriously, I wish for Arryn's voice on Blake; which I assume will be coming)\n-Invisible walls make movement a bit clunky between fights\n-Blake's attacks often leave her in the air, missing the all the mobs below (esp. annoying on Alpha Beo's)\n-Lack of some variey between characters (As I ahve palyed more of each character, there are definite differences between them.  But from the start, they still feel sorta similar.  I think more creativity with the skills could draw out more variety)\n-Lack of move combos (I felt as if there was more in the Alpha, which is a bit strange...)\n-Subtitles (a bit too much in each display on the screen, some text is lost offscreen, inaccurate at times)\n-Aiming (ranged abilites are very hard to make hit what you want them to)\n-Late animation transitions (animations take a split second change, i.e. running to standing - Still running in place for a moment.)\n\nSummary     Now this seems like a lot of negative stuff and little good stuff.  Something to keep in mind is that this is the first game RT has made, it hasn't even been out for a week, it's Early Access, and they've already put out a day #3 patch.  Also, it's way easier to complain than compliment anyhting in life.  So, I look forward to how this game develops, can't WAIT for more content (as far as campaign and progression go, and would highly recommend getting this game.  A lot of the negative points are, in reality (or rather gameplay), small things that largely go unnoticed.\n\nSee y'all in Remnant!\n\n\nTL;DRShort game with a fair amount of unobtrusive bugs.  Captures the feel of RWBY damn near perfectly.  Team has already shown development on the game (post-launch, of course).  Plays well.  Buy it.","December 6, 2015","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is still in its early stages, so naturally, it's going to have flaws. But, despite being in early alpha, it has already managed to impress me. So, let's go through what this game does well, first.\n\nRWBY: Grimm Eclipse does a fantastic job of making it feel like you're 'playing the show'. The animation is great, and every once and a while you get a little quote from one of the characters, which, just like the show itself, is fantastically voice acted. The graphics are great, and the game holds up well enough performance-wise.\n\nPerhaps the thing that was focused on the most in the development of this early access game was the combat. Fighting in this game is so satisfying, especially when you land a huge hit on an enemy and they go flying back, melting away slowly. The attacks and fighting styles are fluent and beautiful, and it just feels right when you hit something. The four playable characters each have three special attacks that, through leveling up, increase in power. Every character has a fairly in-depth skill tree that you can put points into, to make your character more powerful. Keep in mind that this game features  MOBA-style leveling, so each time you play, you will be set back to level one. This may sound like a drag, but it is a very good concept. When you start a game with friends, you can place your points according to how you want to either support your team, or just be a full blown killing machine.\n\nAs far as story goes, there really isn't much in the realm of story as much as there is just slaying hordes of monsters, with an objective here and there. So far, there are only four stages, which can all be completed in a matter of 45 minutes. Obviously there are more to come, but at the moment, we have only four stages. Surprisingly, playing these levels over again does not get boring. With the ability to make a different character build every game, the seemingly repititive gameplay continues to be exciting and fun.\n\nAs stated earlier, of course this game is going to have flaws. There are a few, not many, but only two stand out to me.\n\nFirstly, I found that the four playable characters are very unbalanced. Yang and Weiss are fairly versitile, but it seems like Ruby is too overpowered, and Blake is too underpowered. I've played as both of them, and playing as Ruby was so easy, while playing as Blake put me through the ringer. Some more balance would be nice.\n\nLastly, the lack of a main story makes it very difficult for someone with a limited knowledge of RWBY to know what's going on, or know who anyone is. There really isn't much more to say. Hopefully the full game will have a cutscene at the beginning or something like that to introduce tha characters, and the plot.\n\nOverall, so far this game is well done. There's still plenty more updates to come, though. Perhaps we'll get new characters, new abilities, the possibilities are endless. This game is an easy buy for big RWBY fans, but for others who are either new to the series or never heard of it, I'd wait for the full game to be released.\n\nOverall Rating: 6.5-7/10\n\n","December 6, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

I believe that it has huge potential in the future, and I can't wait to see where they go with it. That being said, there are a few things that I do take issue with. First, the auto target is crap. A game like this is definitely in need of some kind of lock on system for long range attacks. The second thing, as some others have mentioned, is that the combat can get incredibly repetitive and dull the longer you play the game. Most games like this use the standard "heavy attack, light attack, gun" and it tends to work very well. A combo system of some kind would also be nice.\n\nHowever, the biggest issue I have with this game is the fact that it's online multiplayer only. I hate online multiplayer, and I always will. Now they do have a "play with friends" option, but I don't have any other friends that use steam. They all play consoles and I don't like to play with just random people. When they said it was similar to Left 4 Dead, I was hoping they would also include a single player mode in which the AI could control the other three characters. Sadly, this isn't an option and it kind of dissapoints me. I won't say the game is bad because of this. Most people don't mind it, and there isn't anyting wrong with it. For what it is, this is looking like it could be a really decent game and I would definitely recommend it, but be aware that it is online only.","December 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Still, for what is already there, this is a fun example of what can be expected. A four player cooperative hack and slash game based on the hit series from Rooster Teeth and creator Monty Oum.\n\nI don't know where to begin, other than saying that this is a good game in the making. Still, there is a bit of "I wish this was there" in my case, and I doubt I'm the only one. I guess, however, that this can be added at a later date, since it's an early access title. I'm talking about a single player offline mode.\n\n*Update: There is a Beta single player mode now, as of the current version of the game, which you have to opt into. It runs quite nicely too!\n\nNow, if the game could have three bots controlling the unselected characters and remain stable, that'd be perfect. Perhaps sometime down the line?\n\nThe gameplay, visuals and music all do justice to the show it's based on. The added point of this not being a retelling of the first two seasons is an enormous bonus.\n\nAnother update: I find the new combat controls to be quite nice. The camera often goes out of bounds when bumping against the scenery, but that's nothing that won't be fixed down the line, I think.\n\nLet's wait and see how this game develops. I could go on with a long wishlist for characters I'd like to see, but I highly doubt it's much different from everyone else's.\n\nRecomended? Does Barbara Dunkelman say silly puns?

The game is really fun and I spent hours getting all characters maxed out on their upgrades and tried each one to the fullest. My first impression for this beta version is well positive with a few things I do not like.\n\nPros;\nEach character has their own uniqe feel. Each one is good at certain points and certain monsters.\nThe game is really fast and the keys are well timed,( have a high end computer)\nThe graphics remain similar to that of the show and the characters have the same persanalities.\nThe skill tree for each one is simple to use and to focus on specializing in different fighting tactics.\nLandscape is well laid out and there are few locations that sends you down a different path different play throughs.\nEasily replayable even if you mastered all characters.\nCan start a new game or jump into one already in progress.\n\nCons;\nSeveral players drops out a lot which causes slight caos till the difficulty is reset.\nA few small glitches and graphic bugs.\nVery straight foward and rare environment interactions.\nOnly 4 characters.\nVery simple option menu no customizing hardly.\nOnly 1 chapter at this point.\nNo training season. Just throws you right into the fight.\nStory is somewhat flat at the moment with just a few talking here and there.\nWhen the host computer losses connection it sends the other players back a ways sometimes all the way back to the beggining.\n\nWhat I wish to see them add;\nBoxes also randomly drop special refill orbs similar to the XP orbs.\nHave more playable characters be able to unlock and played from the show.\nMore environment interaction\nAble to have higher lvl attainment\nMore skills for each characters.\nHave a key that brings up a quick order comand, ex; Help, Form up, Wait and so on so we do not have to chat it.\nNew game menu have a toggle for random characters you have and a toggle for no repeat of characters. This way you form a team and not have 2-4 of the same character.\nA training chapter so new and old players can train and practice the different characters.\nWould love to see more of the songs from the show added into comabt and more frequent.\nDifferent game modes; teams, solo, time trial, competitions\nLike to see an arena style game mode that lets players fight other players.\nA way to invite frinds to your new game start up.","December 21, 2015","true","48.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I'm so hyped for when they add more characters (here's hoping that team STRQ gets added at some point). I'll admit, the game feels a tad basic at times, but it's still early access, so I'm not worried. Even if it weren't, it'd still be a really, REALLY good game.\n\nAll I can say is that this is a 10/10 game, unless you're a RWBY fan, which makes it an 11/10.

But also if you love hack and slash games, with this game being a early access game I can see great potential in new combos, more characters like Sun would love playing as him. They could also include a versus mode in the form of the tournament for arena and so much more, special combo attacks between characters and more... so much more room to grow XD\n\nThis game is awesome and will keep getting better.\n\nI find mainly 3 problems at the moment that bother me, 1st when you character throws an enemy in the air to keep an aerial combo the enemy wont leave the ground so you end up comboing the air. 2nd the lack of a center camera button (since I like playing games like this with controller) and last but not least the lack of the epic soundtrack we know and love for. Would also like more dialogues between characters as they seem to talk alone a lot, like one liners. Also there should be an option that doesnt allow a player to pick another character already in use, I mean seeing to Rubys for example is kinda weird.\n\nWell thats all I got to say, great game, great potential, few cons. Like Ruby would say: This is AWESOME!","December 7, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat, skill mechanics for the 4 current characters (Ruby,Weiss,Blake,Yang) are all awesome and super fun to play.  Maybe I haven't been able to successfully navigate to more content but from what I can tell there are only 4 levels(that must be played in one continuous session or you reset). Various other bugs including super loud audio for sound effects that you can't turn down other than going into your system tray. Honestly I think the game will end up good but right now unless you really like the series you should know what you're getting into.

Ruby's attacks hit very wide, weiss feels very sharp and precise, blake has a sort of jumpey floaty feel to her, and yang feels heavy and weighty with her attacks. personally, i think as the level caps grow, more skills could be added that would defferentiate them better.\noverall, this is a pretty solid core game, and the only thing really lacking right now is content. more campaign chapters, characters, and skills would bring this game up. one thing i did find odd to be missing is any kind of tutorial though. nothing about control mapping, or explenation of the controls. that being said, they are pretty basic, so a few minutes of button mashing and you'll figure it out! for now, i'd reccomend this game to fans of the show who wanna support it's continued development. for 17$ CDN, i feel this was a worthwhile purchase","December 13, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I undertsnd that complete so I will keep this brief.  Really the only thing that I feel I would like to see is some sort of saved character progression.  That does it for me in a game if I feel like the past hours of the game I played dont mean anything and I will need to start at square 1 again.  To me it makes it hard to pick up the game unless I have a solid 2 or 3 hours (which I usually dont) and know there will be no progression other than unlocking some upgrades that I can eventually use for combat but that is all. Other than that this game is fun as anything and I cant wait to see where it goes in the future.","December 10, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty much feels like a complete game so far, that just needs some more content in the long run.\nThe currently available gamemode is a nice mix of MOBA elements with the typical campaign/story mode system of levels with progressing difficulty, which (at least personally) I haven't really ever seen before in a multiplayer game.\nThat being said, I have do an issue with the design choice of allowing players to all pick the same character as each other in a game. Forcing players to each pick a different character and switch up their playstyle couldn't be that harsh of a restriction, and honestly could lead to more interesting sessions instead of four Ruby's with dust nukes.\nHowever, if Rooster Teeth does decide to add more characters, I think it would be amazing to not restrict four player teams to only the four characters of a team. Allowing players to mix and match different characters from different teams would create some incredible synergy with all of the combinations people come up with. However, I imagine the work load would be a lot more than just restricting players to a single team for a session, because it would require literally balancing everyone with everyone.\nOf course these ideas come from someone who has never actually made a videogame, and are really just things that one person would like to see come along in the game. I could also just be repeating what's already known, so yeah.","December 11, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I’m much more of a solo-player than a co-op player, but it’s nice to play with friends or even random people with the same interests. When I wanted to play it by myself, I simply started the game with only myself in the party, and it was pretty fun to play by myself. However, like I said, it’s also fun to play with random people. It makes for a good way to make new friends (if you like making friends). The FPS was kind of annoying at first, because I’m used to higher FPS, and it only got worse when there were more Grimm around. Although, I’m sure that will be fixed after several updates. After all, it is an EA game.\n\n\n-	Overall Opinion\n\nIt’s a fun game, and the art work is beautiful. I look forward to seeing what all Rooster Teeth plans on doing with it.

Overall it takes about 30-35 minutes to finish the first (and only) available campaign. All your favorite voice actresses from the show are present in the game as well as the few current male voices available. The sound quality is great and the music is really nice to listen to wether you're running through nature or taking it to the Grimm. This is definitely a game that is more fun with multiple people, at least two are recommended if you plan to run this, solo it gets stale pretty quickly and it's fun to see who can rack the highest score at the end of each stage. Overall right now I'd give the game an 8/10 due to the apparent problems which are still being worked on and patched as they make fixes. Is the game worth 14.99? Absolutely I'd say, I've found myself playing this time and time again with friends and strangers alike whenever I feel the need to let off some stress from work or just a bad day.

I believe that it has huge potential in the future, and I can't wait to see where they go with it. That being said, there are a few things that I do take issue with. First, the auto target is crap. A game like this is definitely in need of some kind of lock on system for long range attacks. The second thing, as some others have mentioned, is that the combat can get incredibly repetitive and dull the longer you play the game. Most games like this use the standard "heavy attack, light attack, gun" and it tends to work very well. A combo system of some kind would also be nice.\n\nHowever, the biggest issue I have with this game is the fact that it's online multiplayer only. I hate online multiplayer, and I always will. Now they do have a "play with friends" option, but I don't have any other friends that use steam. They all play consoles and I don't like to play with just random people. When they said it was similar to Left 4 Dead, I was hoping they would also include a single player mode in which the AI could control the other three characters. Sadly, this isn't an option and it kind of dissapoints me. I won't say the game is bad because of this. Most people don't mind it, and there isn't anyting wrong with it. For what it is, this is looking like it could be a really decent game and I would definitely recommend it, but be aware that it is online only.","December 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the other hand, they should probably work out some more bugs before they start adding anything too big. None of the bugs I've encountered are paticularly intrusive, in fact most of them are apparently very useful for speedruns, and even then I probably woundn't have noticed most of them if my friend hadn't shown me, but they are very easy to find if you know they are there. Also, the game actually recognizes my ps4 controller on it's own, which is something that I've seen much more prominent games with much larger budgets completely ignore.","December 10, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, overall, I have enjoyed the combat, storyline and graphics, even when on 'potato'. Props to the development team at RT for creating such an awesome game!\n\nPros:\n- Reasonably smooth animations\n- Well rendered environments\n- Good leveling system\n\nCons:\n- Special bar takes FOREVER to regenerate\n- Too many invisible walls, especially in the underground Mountain Glenn level\n- Yang is too OP\n- Auto-aiming system isn't very good\n- Not properly optimised for weaker PCs yet\n\nEven though there are more cons then pros at this point, I feel that this game has HUGE amounts of potential, and, although I wouldn't reccomend it for people who aren't fans of the original show, I would reccomend it for anyone that likes testing games out or for people who are massive fans of the show, like I am. Like I said, well done to the 4-man development team at RT for doing so well with this game.","December 6, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would probably recommend something in the option that can give the player a short re-cap of what happened between seasons 1 & 2, this can allow players who got this game without watching the series to get a basic summarization of what happened and possibly allow them to look into the series more themselves through the game.\n\nAside from that, really fun game with beautiful graphics. I've only played as Blake and Ruby right now but I personally like how each character's skills and playing style fits with how they are in the series. Using RPG class terms, Blake is similar to the Ninja that attacks quickly and is better at at a distance as well as reviving her team mates, while Yang is similar to a Monk class that just tanks and deals damage. Most of the errors in this game have already been mentioned, but my only thing that I'd recommend is check the audio files in the game before releasing updates. There was one point I saw Yang's picture but heard Ruby's voice, and Ruby wasn't even around. So mistakes like that do need to be corrected as it is something that does bug me. Other thing I can recommend is saving LV progress, because in reality with how much Grimm can swarm you at some points and the amount of abilities you have being small in number makes keeping LVs not a big deal as recklessness can lead to you getting surrounded. Using this idea, if people wanted to start from LV 1 they can play a different character and level them up,, which in turn will go well if more characters are added like say members from Team JNPR or even Team CFVY.\n\nOverall, for an Early Access, this game is great and I liked it a lot. Looking forward to seeing what will be in there later on in the story, what new characters will be in the game, what they'll do for the other Grimm (Like the Nevermore and the Death Stalkers) and much more. RWBY fans will certainly enjoy this, and I'm hoping eventually gamers who aren't familiar with the series will eventually look into it.","December 6, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each character is unique: Rwby with Area of effect attacks, Weiss with Homing and Dust based attacks, Yang with Short range attacks, and Blake with Long range and One on one attacks. There are some improvements that need to be made though. The Chat function is worse than on Tri-Force Heros, theres not enough time between battles to talk, and because the game has basically become a race, First to smash the boxes, First to get to the enemys, First to get the last strike. If you stop to chat you won't be able to get to level 10, Since not everyone is going to get to level 10 no one is really working as a team. Having some pre made sentances to be able to say, like "Hold up!" or "On my way!" would really be helpful, or just get rid of the problem by having a mic function. Another problem is the keys, and the best way i can think to solve it is to be able to change each keys function/controler function in the settings menu.\nand just some personal things, Blake likes to fly up too high when attacking and could really use like a down smashing attack. I've got caught out of the map a few times. (around the cages when attacking in the corners) And it would be really cool to have, like two person attacks. Over All a great game in Early access, so dont let these few small things affect your veiw of the game, its got great levels, hard fights, and cool abilitys. just buckle down, because you're in for a long game!","December 5, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't feel that would change my view of the gameplay, but it is worth mentioning.\n\nThis game is a simple yet enjoyable hack 'n' slash game that allows for up to four-player co-op.  I have seen people compare it to the Warriors games, and I feel that isn't a particularly apt comparison.  While you do fight large hordes of enemies, this game is very focused on special moves, which each character has three of.  Proper application of these special moves, as well as management of the special meter, is the key to success.\n\nBesides the special moves, each character has a melee and ranged attack.  Repeatedly using the melee attack will lead to a combo, which a player can either do all the way to the end, or use the ranged attack button to do a different combo ender.\n\nSince this is early access, they're only focusing on one section of gameplay at a time, and as of the time of writing that section of gameplay is only about one-two hours.  While there will be more, and I do think there is plenty of reason to replay what there is, for many that just isn't enough, and I understand that, and suggest you check back in later.  That said, the full release of the game will be more expensive, as they wish to have it be a lower price for early adopters.\n\nIf you enjoy some fun hack 'n' slash gameplay, a fun co-op time with friends, or just like the show RWBY, I think this will be a good purchase for you.","December 5, 2015","true","27.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is by no means bad but it's simple, this simplicity seperates players. To the untrained eye there are zero combos however this is untrue.\n\nAnimation cancelling is what makes a combo in this right now.\nRuby; Right before her slam attack at the end of her ground combo you can shoot, this stops yourself from being knocked up and resets your attack chain allowing you to continue a onslaught of ground based melee damage.\n\nAnother example with ruby is on her third melee swing you dodge, you should get off 4 attacks because of this, your dodge is an Iframe making it so monsters have a harder time targeting you accuratly and making it so when you should potentially get hurt you take no damage.\n\nI would however like to see a lot more;\n\nMore melee attacks. I would like to see at least 2-3 melee attack types that you can combo and chain together\n\nThe ability to animation cancel with attack variants will greatly improve the current combat system and allow mastery over the game to those who invest time\n\nMore characters; I understand people are all over the idea of playing Ruby and the gang but with only 4 playable characters this does limit playstyle as there are not many variants to attacks other than animation cancelling and picking the strongest special ability your character has to offer.\n\nAllowing more characters like Juane into the fray gives a massive boost in what could be done and considered possible to the developers. The addition of a new weapon and combat style in a character like Juane allows a focus on a defensive or possible protective playstyle, this however does not mean he would not dish out damage. Rather than evasion with a dodge you can be encouraged to block damage or intercept attacks with dash based specials.\n\nThe current special attack limitations are a but rough, ruby and yang having the best methods to get past this through less hits required and aura failure charging to full special respectively.\nSpecials should charge over time, slowly, as well as or being limited to being charged minimally by every attack rather than chaining a combo without getting struck.\n\nI'll edit my post with updates.","December 5, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course this game is still in development, I know.\n\nHere's what I'd like: I was hitting buttons and such and there wasn't any actions with the scroller or scroll clicker. My thught is to scroll through semblance abilities and use the scroll click to activate the semblances.\n\nAnother thing is, it's linear, one path. How about some platforms or cliffs throughout the valleys and open areas. Be sure to watch out for Nevermores. Also, how about multiple paths? It be strategic if the team chooses one path or split up. Iif one ally is down, it would take some time for another ally to assist.\n\nAlso how about multiple objectives when splitting the party. Players can choose to group together to finish one objective faster then move to the next, which takes time or split the party and finish the objective faster but be more difficult.\n\nOn the platforms, distances of long range attacks are increased. I think the control buttons don't have a function, how about using the left control to enter scope mode? With Blake and Yang's weapons, of course it won't do much, but for Ruby and Weiss, this would be helpful.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game so far. Great visuals and battle mechanics. Liked how there are free experience throughout the levels with the relics and crates.\n\nIn the future, how about single player campaign and be able to choose which character you want and the ability to create your own character and weapons.

What a great and fun early access demo. I'll get the negatives out of the way first. It is a demo, it has some FPS and simple gameplay things that can be refined, but nothing game-breaking or even annoying. It is rather short, even for an early access. The leveling up is simple, but that's not a bad thing in its own way. Storyline doesn't go very in depth, not yet at least. For $15, I don't think there was enough content either.\n\nNow to the good things, which there is a lot of. Amazing fun, a level up system that really makes you feel the progression, dynamic gameplay, moderate skill required, problem solving, unique characters, so much fun to play with friends. I can go on but I think all I really need to say is that the good things heavily outweigh the bad.\n\nAs far as the not worth $15, yes, it alone is not worth it, but it is important to remember that you're not just buying the early access, you're supporting RoosterTeeth to continue to refine this game and make it blossom in to something AMAZING, even more than it already is. I'm a huge fan of RoosterTeeth, especially RWBY, and this game has me excited for all that is to come from it. Don't look at it as $15 for this small portion alone. Look at it as thanks to RoosterTeeth for making an amazing game to come, thanks for making an amazing series and story universe, and an investment made to help them continue to develop this title and a way to show your support for what is truly a worthy game, and a worthy developer.\n\nI very much recommend this title.","December 4, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the fluid combat system and skill tree possibilities, this could easily be a long and rewarding game. Though I know there's still a lot of development going on, here are a few things that I feel could be done better.\n\n1. The running animations are fine, however, shen running downhill or from a ledge it seems to freeze the legs in an awkward "floating" position, sure it's comical, but it's a little distracting.\n2. A more expansive skill tree that incorporates the character's "semblance" in a more refined manner would be fun and entertaining.\n3. There seems to be quite a bit of connectivity issues, what with a consistent string of disconnects among players. Not sure if this has to do with the players just quitting, or if the servers themselveas are flawed.\n4. The lack of character level save function that would make it a little more rewarding to play through the game.\n\nThat being said, I see a huge amount of pros that outweigh the cons of the game immensely. Here is a short list of things that I found to be enjoyable.\n\n1. The difficulty is great, forcing you tou be a little more tactical and conservative with your aura as you are forced to dodge and fight as necessary to make it through the areas.\n2. The incorporation of objectives gives a sense of purpose behind the reason you are fighting or fleeing the hordes of grimm and makes you prioritize your tasks based on what will or will not be most beneficial to the completion of your objectives.\n3.The fluid and uninterrupted combat system allows you to meld your regular attacks with your specials exteremely well, making the fancy combos look all the more beautiful when you finish them with a big resounding "YANG".... er "BANG"\n4.As much as I would like to see other characters such as Nora and Pyrrah, It's still nice to be able to choose whichever character you like as opposed to be forced into using a character that is unused, in the end it allows the player to choose the specific play style that they are most comfortable with.\n5. The art comes together nicely and makes the world of RWBY come to life in the most colorful and intricate way. Being able to explore the places that you saw on the show as well as new places in the world of Remnant.\n6. Although the running is a little glitched the animations are great, the hair and clothing moving fluidly with the character makes for an enjoyable p visual experience.\n\nFor those reasons and more, I am glad to have paid out for the early access and I am excited to watch the game as the development progresses.","December 4, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's early access, so it's still pretty rough. But it's come a long way from the pre-alpha demo that RT Sponsors got early this year, and I have a feeling we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg here.\n\nPros\n+ It's RWBY! In video game form! Any fans of the series are going to enjoy the game just for that fact alone.\n+ The playable characters (So far, just Ruby, Weiss, Blake, and Yang) have movesets that you'd expect them to use in the show.\n+ The music and scenery are all fitting for the world that it is supposed to be set in.\n+ The character models, both playable and nonplayable, are spot on. If you told me they were ripped straight from the show, I'd believe it.\n+ Lindsay Jones (Ruby), Kara Eberle (Weiss), Arryn Zech (Blake), and Barbara Dunkelman (Yang) all reprise their roles from the show, as well as Ryan Haywood (Professor Port) and Joel Heyman (Professor Oobleck) providing commentary and mission objective updates.\n+ Patches! It seems that the development team is working hard to make sure everything is working the way it's supposed to, and their first patch came out within a few days of release.\n\nCons (Because this is early access, some of these can be taken with a grain of salt, as they will probably be fixed later)\n- While the controls are pretty pick-up-and-play, there is no tutorial or controller map, so you're left guessing what buttons do what.\n- No offline mode. You absolutely HAVE to play online.\n- No matchmaking. Players are matched up entirely at random, and you can't even choose to start a room on your own. If you want to host a match, you have to hope to get lucky.\n- No lock on mechanic. There's no way (as far as I can tell) to lock on to a single enemy. You're basically left to swing away until you hit something, and during heavy fighting, you can end up switching targets multiple times.\n- Might just be personal, but I experienced delays in animation when characters start to run, resulting in a motionless glide across the ground.\n- Minimum requirements are fairly hefty. I play some pretty intensive games on this computer, even online, but this game gets quite a bit of lag when multiple enemies and players are on screen.","December 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For those who enjoy the frantic button-bashing and reaction-based dodging of a proper hack-and-slash, but also enjoy SHOTGUN FISTS.\n\nCharacters feel very similar but at the same time a little different. You can play all of them reasonably well using the same techniques, but to get the most out of them one should adopt certain playstyles which (IMO) suit the characters really well.\n\nRuby does best when cleaving down hordes of Beowolves and chaining up combos quick, Weiss plays very well as an AOE-spamming crowd-controlling magic-user type, Blake works best by (again) chaining up long combos, but her special moves can flow seamlessly into regular attacks, suiting her ninjtastic style of weird deception and unpredictability. Yang? PUNCH STUFF. If you get punched to near-death, you'll only come back stronger.\n\nVery short, but even at this early alpha stage RT have included enough stuff to have one playing the same four levels repeatedly. First to max out your level, then to complete the little challenges to unlock different techniques.\n\nWorth the price even for the alpha, I'd say (At least, for RWBY nuts). This game's got some serious potential, still!\n\nI shall be on the edge of my seat waiting for further updates. :D","December 7, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Currently there is no level select or way to save your progress but a full playthrough of the 4 levels should take roughly an hour. On top of 4 characters and the challenge system to unlock more upgrades,\n\nThe game is in a position where it can only better, though in it's current state it's not turning any heads and I don't think i would of purchased if I wasn't a fan of RWBY, so I would suggest to anyone who is looking at this game with no knowledge of RWBY, go watch RWBY.\n\nAll in all the developers deserve your money, they're kind hearted people and this project is more a tribute to the fans than a money making machine.","December 8, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though on PSU it was LB but I think RB isn't being used on this game so there's a use, gimme lock on.\n\nI'd like to see more levels, and maybe a PvP type arena. (Or PvP and Levels could be DLC)\n\nMore characters, yes please. (Maybe another possible DLC)\n\nIf at all possible, outfit variations, or completely different outfits, either to unlock by completing certain criteria, or DLC, or both. Mainly to descern who is who more easily, which I did have a problem with because I could barely read everyones Steam ID unless I was standing about 15 feet away (Totally a guess).\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI love the game and where it's headed so far, even if some of the suggestions I've said don't get implemented, I enjoy the game, and I've never watched the series! So as far as $15 is concerned, I'd buy it, well I did, but that's besides the point, one it's Rooster Teeth, I used to watch their Red Vs Blue series, LOVED it, this game, I think they'll be keeping up with it, and I know a lot of people stay away from Early Access games. It's fun, buy it, play with some friends, no friends? Make new ones who play it.

I love this series.  And from what I know, you guys want us to report bugs, or maybe changes?  I can do that right now, though it's mainly just a change I feel you should look at.\n\nIn my opinoin, if you want to make this game challenging, you should nerf Yang's passive ( the one where you kill enemies after having no aura).  I can just spam my quake ability, purposly get low, get my special refilled, and have my aura regen fast because of another "general" ability.  I can run around for that full 30 seconds just fine before I start spamming my stuff again.  My advice is that you should make the cooldown on that passive longer.  I was able to solo this game with way too much ease as her.\n\n\nThis game is good, and I have reccomended it to all of my friends who are RWBY fans.

Despite being Early Access (a concept I have mixed reviews with, thanks, DayZ), I find it to be an enjoyable time consumer. I'm a huge fan of RWBY, with wall art and clothing to boot, and this pleases my inner fangirl to a large extent. However, there is not a lot of content to keep you coming back for a long long time. I've played the game over and over, unlocking content, but I've seen the end of what is here so far so I'm not looking forward to much when playing. As well, there's a game breaking bug I've experienced 3 times already where if someone disconnects during a wave, the next wave won't spawn, and everyone must leave the game, that's it.\n\nHowever, it's 16 bucks, that's a damn good price for a game that will absolutely continue to be worked on, I have entire faith in RT to continue their work on this game, unlike some others (ahem, DayZ).\n\nWould absolutely recommend this game to anyone that's a fan, and I look forward to future updates. If you're considering getting this, but don't want to pay for something with limited content (for now), I'd still get it, because I can personally promise that this game will continue to be worked on regularily, I trust Rooster Teeth with everything they do.","December 10, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe it's just my aim but I swear those grimm kinda feel like they only get hit when they want to.\n-Area of Effect abilities outclass one hit moves by a mile. Since your usual enemies are hordes of grimm, things like Quake for Yang or Nova for Weiss are almost always the better option against everything that isn't a single enemy\n-Enemy movement is a bit disjointed, really only notice it for the boar but at times enemies feel like they jump and stutter so as to avoid getting hit\n-While graphically the game is pretty, the areas themselves feel rather barren. Besides the spare artifact here and there there's not a whole lot to find. Like Mountain Glenn, plenty of debris and busted buildings to look at but never explore.\n-Although it's short, not being able to pick up where I left off with just myself or my friends can be a bit of a pain. I see this getting fixed seeing as how there's not many areas but you can only build team RWBY so many different ways to blast through the same 5 areas.\n-Needs more combos\n-Not enough JNPR.\n\nThis game's potential is absolutely insane, seeing as how it's Early Access I'm super excited for what the future holds as I feel most of my gripes are soon to be nonexistent.

The moba style leveling system is different for a run around beat-em up style game making things entertaining and interesting.\n\nSo far with it only having 4 levels each taking about 10-15 minutes a piece it is very short but pretty fun while it lasts.\n\nWith that being said it is still early access and full of bugs, some of them come in the form of broken subtitles. If the particular line is long and the character keeps talking the subtitles only follow through the first initial burst of words and doesn't continue to follow along.\n\nAnother bug that I came across while playing earlier took place during the bomb sequence. A player pressed the switch to open the door before prompted and was ejected from the level into an endless abyss to which myself and another player ended up when we responded next to them.\n\nThat being said it is still pretty enjoyable. The characters for how little they seem to talk do still hold true to their personalities in the show.\n\nHere is hoping that in the future we can play as other characters such as Jaune, Pyrrha, Nora, ect.\n\n10/10 would break the game again.","December 8, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its not bad at all with one or two people because there aren't as manny grimm all        at once, but with three or four players, waves can have up to 40 grimm. This leads to quite a bit of lag and you get maybe 5-10 fps. That quickly ends as enemies start dying, though.\n-No definitive end. After the second Mountain Glenn level, the game just goes back to the title screen. I'm pretty sure its just a bug, but it has always happened for me. (Edit: I now see that it says end of campaign 1, but the first few times it wasn't there or I didn't see it and it was confusing)\n\nOverall, this is a great game for fans of RWBY, or hack-and-slash games in generall. As of early December, 2015, its not worth the $15 price except for die hard fans, but it looks to get much better as time goes on and the price will be worth it soon.\n\nI'd give it an 8/10","December 5, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay acts as a Co-op Hack and slash type, which in my opinion is a really enjoyable experience. Most of the Characters have the Original Voice cast, but strangely Blake sounds a bit different for some odd reason, perhaps its how the game is directed or a different Voice-Actor all together, But thats a small detail.\nEach Character has a different Skill Tree, and most of those skills are unlocked through Challanges, in which is actually a good Idea believe it or not, It encourages a different way of playing everytime. The Skills are the same set always and they don't sinergize with the combos very well, but again this is Early Access, so theres alot of room for Improvment.\n\nPros\n-A RWBY Game Yeah!!!\n-Gameplay is Enjoyable and not tedious [Looking at you Dynasty Warriors]\n-All of Team RWBY is present\n-The Level Design is pleasing\n-Promising game\n-Music is on point\n\nCons [Honestly these are more as Nitpicks at best.]\n-Walking animation is a bit wonky with a few Characters\n-Needs more Customization with Combos\n-Voice-actors are a bit lacking\n\nOverall as this game is now, Id give this game a solid\n7/10 As of Day 1 this game is amazing, Hoping for some updates and more levels!","December 1, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, there's no reason to be biased, let me list the pros and cons to this game.\n\nPros:\n-Dynasty Warriors and Left 4 Dead Co-op gameplay\n-Characters have good personalities from the start, and the voice acting is great\n-The game seems to have a great way of server connection, with my internet being bad 90% of the time, I never have problems connecting to another player's game\n-Each character has their own skill trees, attacks, combos, etc.\n-The Ultra setting looks amazing, I recommend building a PC for it\nCons:\n-While it is Early Access, the animations are a bit choppy/delayed\n-Doubles. By this, I mean that everyone can play as the same character (example: Four Weiss, Ruby, Yang, and Blake) leaving out so much variation at some parts of the game, making it not as fun when someone is playing as a double character.\n-No voice chat, while this is a minor problem, it'd be easier to use voice chat instead of typing so you can easily communicate in the middle of battling\n-No character saving, making it a bit tedious at times to play the same mission over again and starting back at level one\n-Unless you're a RWBY fan, you won't understand much of the game\n\nNow, here's some recommendations I'd like to see as the game updates and gets more larger:\n-More characters or teams. It would be cool to be able to play as teams like JNPR or CFVY and be able to play as the characters from said teams\n-Fix the Idle and Running animations\n-Make character restrictions, so there's more variation in matches\n\nOther than that, it's a great game with solid combat, great voice acting, and interesting story, I personally give it a 9/10\nIf you want to support RoosterTeeth, I recommend picking up the game while it's in early access.","December 20, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Would recommend 5/5 , and I can't wait to see whats in store for the future. The game makes you feel like a stone against the tide especially when your in a party. One thing I wish it had however are combo variations so theres various reasons to use your characters "smash" attack after 1-3 hits otherwise some people like Ruby and Blake are just too good to not just mash the attack button. Visually I like the upgrades but I kinda wish there was more of a diversity such as one of Yang's special Blast Wave normally is a short to range attack and the upgrades either make it a heavy hitting short rang or make it a wide hit, and what I would love to see if adding another choice to instead fire one of Yangs rockets for a long range AoE attack or something to that effect (Which I feel could be why Yang might not have it since Ruby does), but just variations like that I would like to see more where when you pick the talents you may have an upgraded original move or mabye you get a new move alltogether, But hey early access so who knows what they have in store later.","December 10, 2015","true","38.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was amazing. And I like the whole gameplay. It's smooth on my computer but i have a gtx 970 and it runs great. They kept the same animation style from the show by that i mean the graphics. Each character lives up to its rep and its overall just great. Some things i noticed though.\n\nWeiss- Her Barrage tends to not have as long a range as it probably should and on occasion 3/5 or 4/9 of the bullets will just go aimlessly on into the abyss.\n\nRuby- I haven't played her too much but holy ♥♥♥♥ is she fun. However. Her second ability (i believe it is called cresendo) You launch in the air and come spinning down in a blade dance of red death. REALLY COOL. But theres no auto aim on it. It requires skill its not a glitch. I absolutely love it.\n\nBlake- Meh. It's Blake. The most badass faunus kitten on the face of the planet. Essentially a teleporting neko. With two swords. It's also a gun. All of her skills are fun and for the most part well rounded.\n\nYang- Hm.... The only thing i didn't like was that the starting (i forget the name of it but you shoot a explosive round at the ground in front of you works just as well) <-- that thing. It's starting range was crap. It's supposed to be an AOE attack but it has no A to its OE. Other than that. It's Yang. The big breasted brawler. No negatives there.\n\nNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A LATER EDITION OF THIS GAME.\nCustomization.\nAnd by that i mean.\nYOU JUST GOT OUTTA SIGNAL WITH YOUR OWN WEAPON THAT YOU MADE! WHOOOOO\nBy this I mean within reason you get to build your weapon. Colorize it and then use it in a display of battle.\nBut i mean it has to work. Your dagger cant turn into a rocket launcher.\n\nALSO SEMBLANCES\nThese are... Superpowers. For lack of a better term.\nIn the show We quite a few.\nRuby's superspeed. Weiss can make Glyphs (...er...Landmines? Not sure how to put it.)\nYang turns into a hulk. Blake makes shadow clones.... Not a naruto reference.\n\nI would love to see this game complete with as many aspects of the show while still being the fun and amazing game that it has been made to be so far.\n\nAnd to those who look at it and are like... Meh... Buy it. Support it. This game is already amazing. Just buying it helps it along and who knows. You just might like it.\n\n","December 10, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is so much fun, being able to pick from the main cast with more being added in the future. Keep in mind this game is in early development but it is pretty meaty in content, each character has her own specific set of talent tree along with her unique set of weapons, currently there is only 1 main misson that is ready to be played which lasts for around 1 hour. The voice actors return to their roles for this game only story featuring new never before seen areas and villans and it is set between the events of volumes 1 and 2.

This? this was really good! it was intensely good. I was beyond happy and very impressed.\nI can't wait for more story. Right now it took us about an hour to get through, and it was really fun all around. Really rooting for more.\n\nI played as blake. I suck and probably didn't pick the best upgrades, so i'm blaming my preformance on my level--but i felt like blake lacked large scale attacks. Though again, blaming it on me and my inability to unlock lots. haha.\n\nI love the attention to detail. The fact that i could see yang's shotgun shells on the ground and ruby's shells as well was phenominal! Really cute attention to detail.\n\nThough apperently there's  no Mac version? I bought a gift copy for a friend, since they're the one who introduced me to RT and all that, and turns out...They have a mac. I kinda felt really bad they couldn't play it : ( Will there be mac version soon? I really hope so.

Very tight controls and great combat. The abilities are suprisingly difficult to master though incredibly rewarding when you pull off combos.\n\nMy only issue is with the mana or special power system, which doesn't regenerate outside of combat and is only refilled by levelling up or landing large enough hit combos. This tends to hamper play quite a lot - often I found that going into a combat instance with a full power bar would have been nice, rather than being forced to quickly fill and instantly use generated power.\n\nOverall tremendously entertaining and incredibly satisfying for a fan of both Dynasty Warrior and RWBY :)","December 8, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am a super nerd of RWBY and when I saw this game I freaked out and was super excited so my opinion will most likely be super biased. Moving on from that I love this game. This game has amazing art and the witty remarks that the characters say throughout it just bring a smile to my face. However this game is not at all perfect for many reasons. It has a very short storyline so far and it's only hacking and slashing at Grimm till you reach that point. The enemies in the game can get very frustrating at times due to their invincibility frames and how easily they can swarm you. That doesn't make this game bad in any way however as the combat feels nice and you can have a more "tactical" team if you have a group of friends to play with. This game brings elements from RWBY that I absolutely adore and if you're like me and like the show, you like fighting games, and you wanna support this project then buy it! <3","December 8, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But this isn't that big of a deal and also there really is no one you're competing with, or rather against, here. Just some hack 'n' slash fun. And boy do I love it. This being early access, I know there's a lot more to improve, but I can already see a bright future ahead for this game.\n\nThere's a lot of elements to the game that really glued me to my seat upon my first try. Aesthetically, the graphics look great. The UI is not too crowded and targeters help guide where you wana keep looking at. The characters' attacks and abilities and their animations are smashing... literally. And I don't think I need to say more about our beloved characters.\n\nAs for gameplay, it didn't take me too long, but I had to get used to staying on 1 Grimm during basic attacks. The camera would shift little by little as you progress through a characters attack chain and this causes a target switch. But once you get used to this everything's going to go a lot smoother. [Either this is actually a thing or I subconciously move my mouse little by little while I use basic attacks lol]\n\nTHE ABILITIES! Love it. Love the mechanics and the progression. It's like I'm in a moba or an RPG. Feels good when you can finally fire 5 projectiles at a time after holding the ability going "haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh"....... tmi\n\nSo far this game looks promising and is already a lot of fun. I highly recommend it, even to youngsters. It's quite family friendly. Plus, the characters are cute, c'mon!\n\nShtuff for the developers:\n- There's a crate in Mount Glenn, right after the first big fight, which you can destroy but can't get the XP if ever XP drops. As in you can't reach it.\n\n- Blake's basics in the juggling part of her attack chain doesn't hit the (bare with me on this one) standing, not fat, Grimm with tons of hp. The ones whos attack is slashing you a few times then leaping a short distance to slash you again.\n\n- I was going to suggest something, but now I feel like counter-suggesting (if that made any sense). I wanted to suggest a menu where you can view the characters and their abilities along with their respective trees. However, now I feel like it takes away a certain element to the game. I can't exactly explain it but I think you know what I mean. So yeah... don't do that :D","December 8, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I undertsnd that complete so I will keep this brief.  Really the only thing that I feel I would like to see is some sort of saved character progression.  That does it for me in a game if I feel like the past hours of the game I played dont mean anything and I will need to start at square 1 again.  To me it makes it hard to pick up the game unless I have a solid 2 or 3 hours (which I usually dont) and know there will be no progression other than unlocking some upgrades that I can eventually use for combat but that is all. Other than that this game is fun as anything and I cant wait to see where it goes in the future.","December 10, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty much feels like a complete game so far, that just needs some more content in the long run.\nThe currently available gamemode is a nice mix of MOBA elements with the typical campaign/story mode system of levels with progressing difficulty, which (at least personally) I haven't really ever seen before in a multiplayer game.\nThat being said, I have do an issue with the design choice of allowing players to all pick the same character as each other in a game. Forcing players to each pick a different character and switch up their playstyle couldn't be that harsh of a restriction, and honestly could lead to more interesting sessions instead of four Ruby's with dust nukes.\nHowever, if Rooster Teeth does decide to add more characters, I think it would be amazing to not restrict four player teams to only the four characters of a team. Allowing players to mix and match different characters from different teams would create some incredible synergy with all of the combinations people come up with. However, I imagine the work load would be a lot more than just restricting players to a single team for a session, because it would require literally balancing everyone with everyone.\nOf course these ideas come from someone who has never actually made a videogame, and are really just things that one person would like to see come along in the game. I could also just be repeating what's already known, so yeah.","December 11, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I’m much more of a solo-player than a co-op player, but it’s nice to play with friends or even random people with the same interests. When I wanted to play it by myself, I simply started the game with only myself in the party, and it was pretty fun to play by myself. However, like I said, it’s also fun to play with random people. It makes for a good way to make new friends (if you like making friends). The FPS was kind of annoying at first, because I’m used to higher FPS, and it only got worse when there were more Grimm around. Although, I’m sure that will be fixed after several updates. After all, it is an EA game.\n\n\n-	Overall Opinion\n\nIt’s a fun game, and the art work is beautiful. I look forward to seeing what all Rooster Teeth plans on doing with it.

There aren't really any noted game-breaking bugs, there are a few balance issues and mechanic issues, but overall it's fairly solid. The only primary issue is that there is no in-game sound effect slider, which leaves gameplay to be eardrum-blowlingly loud. On first startup, game music and voices are also very loud, but in the options there is a spot to turn down the volume, but for sound effects there isn't, so they stay extremely loud.\n\nMany other fans and I would certainly love to see a patch allowing better sounds control ASAP.","December 4, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you add a counter attack method that's would make fighting grime more fun rather than always having to dodge them. 2. Team Attacks.  A player could signal they want to do a team attck and the closest player could press a key neay them and execute it. 3. Maybe add a shop between levels.

I absolutely LOVE RWBY, and thankfully RWBY: Grimm Eclipse does not disappoint in the slightest.\n\nIt's a really good action-adventure hack-n-slash with pretty good mechanics, fun dialogue/SFX/audio, and lots of over the top action that we're all used to from the show. I'm so hyped for when they add more characters (here's hoping that team STRQ gets added at some point). I'll admit, the game feels a tad basic at times, but it's still early access, so I'm not worried. Even if it weren't, it'd still be a really, REALLY good game.\n\nAll I can say is that this is a 10/10 game, unless you're a RWBY fan, which makes it an 11/10. Highly recommend getting it first chance you get!\n\nRest in peace, Monty: your work - and now legacy - continues to inspire and entertain countless lives.

Secondly, the game is actually very fun to play for a while. It's not Skyrim. I doubt you'll see anyone putting thousands of hours into this game, but for a couple hours of play its very worth it. And that was just my solo experiece, I'm sure it would be a bit more fun with friends to play with.\n\nNow of course the game has its problems. It is a very early access game with a lot of potential for improvement.\nThe main issues are the sound design with a few issues regarding the movement animations. But for the most part the game looks pretty good and plays well. I do think that the number of enemies needs to be increased a bit or for a difficulty option to be added since the fights get a bit repetitive and predictable. Hopefully with some feedback and time though there can be features added to this game to make it just that much better.\n\nTl;DR: Fun game for a decent price with a few issues that will be improved upon with time but do not detract from the experience.","December 2, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another one of my problems with the game was the running animation.It was very janky but that can be fixed easily. One last final concern I had was the fact that the Xp gain for whatever character in a game doesnt save and I dont know if thats intentional but it kinda bothers me after playing for an hour to rank up a character and fiind that next game it isnt there.Overall great game and I recommend and hop you play it.

But where do i begin? The game it's self plays smoothly and fluently with the ocasional graphical glitch here and there but besides that the game has a rather unique fighting and leveling system.\n\nThe fighting is kind of like an MOBA but with the touch of your average fighting game with one default combo that can be ended with a signature move. The special moves are something that really cought my interest, they're all different and have a certain litte touch to them that make it so well, special!\n\nThe leveling system is the usual system beat enemies get XP same old same old, but in this there are artifacts hidden all around the levels that'll help you level up, you can also get some free XP by finding it in crates, other than that it's the same.\n\nThe characters are something good to, it isnt just the same person with a different skin, each character is uniqe, for example Weiss is a squishy character that can do massive amounts of damage to single opponents unlike Ruby who can do moderate damage to an area of enemies.\n\nAlso want to point out one of the video settings is called 'Potatoe'\n\nThe game is outstanding for early access BUT it does have some things that could be fixed, for example when moving the character, upon stopping you'll still be doing the running animation, not that bad but really annoys me and others probably, the difficulty is unbelievable, especially when playing with friends and there isnt a way to change it, you cant save your progress and the story mode is really short so far, took me and my friend an hour to beat it so yea that could be fixed but other than that the game holds great potential and will hopfully live up to the hype.\n\nI give this game 7.3/10","December 2, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's pretty impressive given how buggy and lagging it can be sometimes, but it seems to capture what I love about the show: guns + weapon + monster killing = pure awesome!! I wish the gun shooting had an aiming system of some sort though or a lock-on mechanic in general , and there were some easier what to use the points I get from leveling to upgrade myself without having stop and pause from the action for a bit and slow down the other players in the process. A tutorial of some form in the beginning would be nice since I spent the first few minutes trying to figure out how move around using my keyboard and still haven't quite mastered all the controls because I just realized there was a gun button after just right clicking. Some of the other thing complaints I have are just simple things like my level for the character I was using not saving and having to start over in the first area everytime I start a new match, but those are things I know and strongly believe will be fixed overtime as this an early access game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bogaloo/recommended/418340/","Bogaloo","Electric Boogaloo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bogaloo/","51 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhile still very early on in development the game has a lot of noticable flaws, but also a lot of noticable quirks that make it lovable, characters are pretty unbalanced as far as team RWBY goes, highly noticable but don't let that stop you from playing your favorite of the four. Overall it takes about 30-35 minutes to finish the first (and only) available campaign. All your favorite voice actresses from the show are present in the game as well as the few current male voices available. The sound quality is great and the music is really nice to listen to wether you're running through nature or taking it to the Grimm. This is definitely a game that is more fun with multiple people, at least two are recommended if you plan to run this, solo it gets stale pretty quickly and it's fun to see who can rack the highest score at the end of each stage. Overall right now I'd give the game an 8/10 due to the apparent problems which are still being worked on and patched as they make fixes. Is the game worth 14.99? Absolutely I'd say, I've found myself playing this time and time again with friends and strangers alike whenever I feel the need to let off some stress from work or just a bad day. Overall I say give this game a try if you're a fan of the show, just be ready to see some obvious flaws.","December 12, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the other hand, they should probably work out some more bugs before they start adding anything too big. None of the bugs I've encountered are paticularly intrusive, in fact most of them are apparently very useful for speedruns, and even then I probably woundn't have noticed most of them if my friend hadn't shown me, but they are very easy to find if you know they are there.

It was amazing. And I like the whole gameplay. It's smooth on my computer but i have a gtx 970 and it runs great. They kept the same animation style from the show by that i mean the graphics. Each character lives up to its rep and its overall just great. Some things i noticed though.\n\nWeiss- Her Barrage tends to not have as long a range as it probably should and on occasion 3/5 or 4/9 of the bullets will just go aimlessly on into the abyss.\n\nRuby- I haven't played her too much but holy ♥♥♥♥ is she fun. However. Her second ability (i believe it is called cresendo) You launch in the air and come spinning down in a blade dance of red death. REALLY COOL. But theres no auto aim on it. It requires skill its not a glitch. I absolutely love it.\n\nBlake- Meh. It's Blake. The most badass faunus kitten on the face of the planet. Essentially a teleporting neko. With two swords. It's also a gun. All of her skills are fun and for the most part well rounded.\n\nYang- Hm.... The only thing i didn't like was that the starting (i forget the name of it but you shoot a explosive round at the ground in front of you works just as well) <-- that thing. It's starting range was crap. It's supposed to be an AOE attack but it has no A to its OE. Other than that. It's Yang. The big breasted brawler. No negatives there.\n\nNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A LATER EDITION OF THIS GAME.\nCustomization.\nAnd by that i mean.\nYOU JUST GOT OUTTA SIGNAL WITH YOUR OWN WEAPON THAT YOU MADE! WHOOOOO\nBy this I mean within reason you get to build your weapon. Colorize it and then use it in a display of battle.\nBut i mean it has to work. Your dagger cant turn into a rocket launcher.\n\nALSO SEMBLANCES\nThese are... Superpowers. For lack of a better term.\nIn the show We quite a few.\nRuby's superspeed. Weiss can make Glyphs (...er...Landmines? Not sure how to put it.)\nYang turns into a hulk. Blake makes shadow clones.... Not a naruto reference.\n\nI would love to see this game complete with as many aspects of the show while still being the fun and amazing game that it has been made to be so far.\n\nAnd to those who look at it and are like... Meh... Buy it. Support it. This game is already amazing. Just buying it helps it along and who knows. You just might like it.\n\n","December 10, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ruby, Weiss, Blake, and Yang are unique from each other, and I love to play as all four huntresses. The soundtrack that plays when playing the game is really good, and the controls are not stiff. I love the gameplay as well, and the teammates you play with are supportive (after all, working as a team is crucial when playing multiplayer). I may love the game, but there are two flaws that makes me cringe a bit. First comes from the lag that may occur if too many things are going around. I am only referring to certain enemy attacks or the loads of enemies that appear when battling, but the rest of the game runs smoothly which I like. Secondly and possibly the most important is the experience players receive when playing online. Artifacts, exp orbs, and wave clearances are fine, but getting exp from Grimm becomes an issue. The exp is given ONLY to the player who finished off the Grimm, and that can be frustrating, especially those who took so long to weaken the enemy and all of that is ruin when someone else takes it out. So why not instead have assist exp for those who help out fighting Grimm a player is having issues with. The person who took it out will get the most experience, but players who helped out can also get experience so it can be fair for everyone. Overall, the game is enjoyable especially with people online, and I bet the team is still creating some new features and fixing bugs and hiccups for the game. I reccomend this game to anyone who loves RWBY and/or hack-and-slash games.","December 10, 2015","true","55.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I undertsnd that complete so I will keep this brief.  Really the only thing that I feel I would like to see is some sort of saved character progression.  That does it for me in a game if I feel like the past hours of the game I played dont mean anything and I will need to start at square 1 again.  To me it makes it hard to pick up the game unless I have a solid 2 or 3 hours (which I usually dont) and know there will be no progression other than unlocking some upgrades that I can eventually use for combat but that is all. Other than that this game is fun as anything and I cant wait to see where it goes in the future.","December 10, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty much feels like a complete game so far, that just needs some more content in the long run.\nThe currently available gamemode is a nice mix of MOBA elements with the typical campaign/story mode system of levels with progressing difficulty, which (at least personally) I haven't really ever seen before in a multiplayer game.\nThat being said, I have do an issue with the design choice of allowing players to all pick the same character as each other in a game. Forcing players to each pick a different character and switch up their playstyle couldn't be that harsh of a restriction, and honestly could lead to more interesting sessions instead of four Ruby's with dust nukes.\nHowever, if Rooster Teeth does decide to add more characters, I think it would be amazing to not restrict four player teams to only the four characters of a team. Allowing players to mix and match different characters from different teams would create some incredible synergy with all of the combinations people come up with. However, I imagine the work load would be a lot more than just restricting players to a single team for a session, because it would require literally balancing everyone with everyone.\nOf course these ideas come from someone who has never actually made a videogame, and are really just things that one person would like to see come along in the game. I could also just be repeating what's already known, so yeah.","December 11, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I’m much more of a solo-player than a co-op player, but it’s nice to play with friends or even random people with the same interests. When I wanted to play it by myself, I simply started the game with only myself in the party, and it was pretty fun to play by myself. However, like I said, it’s also fun to play with random people. It makes for a good way to make new friends (if you like making friends). The FPS was kind of annoying at first, because I’m used to higher FPS, and it only got worse when there were more Grimm around. Although, I’m sure that will be fixed after several updates. After all, it is an EA game.\n\n\n-	Overall Opinion\n\nIt’s a fun game, and the art work is beautiful. I look forward to seeing what all Rooster Teeth plans on doing with it. This game has my full support, and I’m excited to play it as it develops.\n","December 11, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't notice any gameplay bugs or problems while I am fighting an enemy.\n+Music is enjoyable. It's captures the music of the RWBY show itself.\n+Ability and level-up features are great.\n\nHowever, I do notice some parts of the game that need improvement:\n\n-The camera angling needs work. I find myself adjusting the camera so that I am able to see the enemy I'm fighting directly.\n-A dash mechanic would be nice. It kind of feels dragged out when I'm taking some time trying to get from one place to another.\n-It's a small thing, but it would be cool if the radar on the top left shows the terrain.\n-Some graphical dynamics would help give the game more "oomph" when you are using a special attack or a crazy combo.\n-A manual lock-on feature would help me shoot the correct enemy from afar.\n-Sound effects could need some variety. For example, there could be something like varied pitches of the same sound effect.\n\nFor what it is, I like the game.

Overall it takes about 30-35 minutes to finish the first (and only) available campaign. All your favorite voice actresses from the show are present in the game as well as the few current male voices available. The sound quality is great and the music is really nice to listen to wether you're running through nature or taking it to the Grimm. This is definitely a game that is more fun with multiple people, at least two are recommended if you plan to run this, solo it gets stale pretty quickly and it's fun to see who can rack the highest score at the end of each stage. Overall right now I'd give the game an 8/10 due to the apparent problems which are still being worked on and patched as they make fixes. Is the game worth 14.99? Absolutely I'd say, I've found myself playing this time and time again with friends and strangers alike whenever I feel the need to let off some stress from work or just a bad day.

It's a bit clunky and there is a bit of an issue with lag in sessions with friends but it's still a really fun hack'n'slash. There aren't many levels yet and the characters feel a bit unbalanced, but it's still enjoyable in it's current state. So long as RT keep working on it dilligently I believe RWBY: Grimm Eclipse could become one of the best games to come out of Greenlight.\n\nIf you like Dynasty Warriors games then you should feel right at home here, it's quite rough around the edges but shows a lot of promise.","December 5, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PMMilewskiQ/recommended/418340/","PMMilewskiQ","PMMilewskiQ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PMMilewskiQ/","1 product in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet's Review...RWBY: Grimm Eclipse.\n\nIf somehow you didn't know, RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is a hack-and-slash game by RoosterTeeth Games. As far as i'm aware, this would be their second game and it is pretty well-off for early access.\n\nThe Menu:\nYeah, sure; The menu isn't super technical and may not be as flashy as other games, but it does carry itself with the font and color. I know it's probably not noticable, but it does make a visual difference.\n\nThe Settings:\nJust looking at face value, the settings seem to be very bare-bones and simplistic. Now, one could argue that the enjoyment is really more gated towards gameplay instead of having you fiddle around in the resolution and graphical differences. But on the other hand, getting the best possible qualtiy from your equipment or visual enjoyment is what some people strive for. It's a mixed bag for me.\n\nNow the main part, The Gameplay:\nThere isn't a single-player campaign mode, but you can access a sort of pseudo-single player by establishing a private lobby and just hopping in to the carnage by yourself. The online mode is more focused on. You can join in a Quick Match, create a new lobby with New Game, the previously mentioned Play with Friends, and lastly just straight up leave like you never wanted to be there anyway (Exiting highly un-recommended).\n\nThe player models are intact and are retty close to what you would see in the show. The animations are pretty good and very fluid. Since it IS in developement, there was maybe one or two hiccups for me, but they corrected themselves. There is a respawn and revive system, but it leans more towards having you get revived rather than respawning.\n\nThe combat is very hack-and-slash, reminiscent of almost Devil May Cry or even Dynasty Warriors. The abilities are super helpful when crowded by Grimm, but you only get to a cerain level so not all upgrades can be unlocked, so choose carefully. There about 3 abilities to choose from and are quite similar between characters (Weiss' Nova and Yang's Quake) are both AoE attackes and the difference is just the effect it has...which could mean they're different?\n\nThe environment are scenic and pretty, but they do have a sort of Tales of feel. You know, where the plains are absurdely large and there are only enough monsters for about an eighth of the filed, that's how RWBY: GRimm Eclipse plays it and it's not so bad when you playing with four people (The fieds flood with darkness), but by anything less than 2, the field is just to big. Other than that, it works well.\n\nMy suggestions and Thoughts:\nThis are all open to discussion from you all (Players of RWBY: GRimm Eclipse and/or  others). Don't get me wrong, RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is a great game and good starting point to further developement, but it's far from complete.\nI'm not to miffed at the menues or the settings. Could they be improved upon, but not in any need for a complete overhaul. The lobby system the game uses is also fine. Within point, Nothing technical needs to change.\n\nThe combat works as is, but tere should be more skills to choose from or implement semblances as a 4 skill that uses all special at once. The skill trees fit their purpose, however I feel as though if they maybe implemented the passive skills in with active skills it would look more like a tree, or even include more specific passive skills that increase damage, range etc. of the active skills.\n\nIn regard to the environment, although lovely and battle spacious, in my mind it feels like there is hidden potential in it. Maybe, have class assignments that fall like dead-drops and add more challenges or specific condition for bonus EXP. You could also add a mini boss, beside Alpha Beowolves and Ursas.\n\nAnd just for kicks (Kinda serious) there is only one thing that I can think that may just be fan service and not really the best choice for overall developement. But what if there was an option to model and script you own character into the game. Now, I understand some people could easily turn this into a bad thing, but there are also good things that could come from it. I don't know, just food for thought.\n\nAlthough this review may have came off as strangely negative, I hold nothing but the highest regards and faith in RooserTeeth Games in making RWBY: Grimm Eclipse one of the greats. So to you, The Members of the RoosterTeeth Games crew, Keep up the Great work.\n\nLove <3...Platonically of course.","December 5, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's early access, so it's still pretty rough. But it's come a long way from the pre-alpha demo that RT Sponsors got early this year, and I have a feeling we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg here.\n\nPros\n+ It's RWBY! In video game form! Any fans of the series are going to enjoy the game just for that fact alone.\n+ The playable characters (So far, just Ruby, Weiss, Blake, and Yang) have movesets that you'd expect them to use in the show.\n+ The music and scenery are all fitting for the world that it is supposed to be set in.\n+ The character models, both playable and nonplayable, are spot on. If you told me they were ripped straight from the show, I'd believe it.\n+ Lindsay Jones (Ruby), Kara Eberle (Weiss), Arryn Zech (Blake), and Barbara Dunkelman (Yang) all reprise their roles from the show, as well as Ryan Haywood (Professor Port) and Joel Heyman (Professor Oobleck) providing commentary and mission objective updates.\n+ Patches! It seems that the development team is working hard to make sure everything is working the way it's supposed to, and their first patch came out within a few days of release.\n\nCons (Because this is early access, some of these can be taken with a grain of salt, as they will probably be fixed later)\n- While the controls are pretty pick-up-and-play, there is no tutorial or controller map, so you're left guessing what buttons do what.\n- No offline mode. You absolutely HAVE to play online.\n- No matchmaking. Players are matched up entirely at random, and you can't even choose to start a room on your own. If you want to host a match, you have to hope to get lucky.\n- No lock on mechanic. There's no way (as far as I can tell) to lock on to a single enemy. You're basically left to swing away until you hit something, and during heavy fighting, you can end up switching targets multiple times.\n- Might just be personal, but I experienced delays in animation when characters start to run, resulting in a motionless glide across the ground.\n- Minimum requirements are fairly hefty. I play some pretty intensive games on this computer, even online, but this game gets quite a bit of lag when multiple enemies and players are on screen.","December 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though on PSU it was LB but I think RB isn't being used on this game so there's a use, gimme lock on.\n\nI'd like to see more levels, and maybe a PvP type arena. (Or PvP and Levels could be DLC)\n\nMore characters, yes please. (Maybe another possible DLC)\n\nIf at all possible, outfit variations, or completely different outfits, either to unlock by completing certain criteria, or DLC, or both. Mainly to descern who is who more easily, which I did have a problem with because I could barely read everyones Steam ID unless I was standing about 15 feet away (Totally a guess).\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI love the game and where it's headed so far, even if some of the suggestions I've said don't get implemented, I enjoy the game, and I've never watched the series! So as far as $15 is concerned, I'd buy it, well I did, but that's besides the point, one it's Rooster Teeth, I used to watch their Red Vs Blue series, LOVED it, this game, I think they'll be keeping up with it, and I know a lot of people stay away from Early Access games. It's fun, buy it, play with some friends, no friends? Make new ones who play it. Enjoy.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nWould touch Ruby again.","December 3, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The moba style leveling system is different for a run around beat-em up style game making things entertaining and interesting.\n\nSo far with it only having 4 levels each taking about 10-15 minutes a piece it is very short but pretty fun while it lasts.\n\nWith that being said it is still early access and full of bugs, some of them come in the form of broken subtitles. If the particular line is long and the character keeps talking the subtitles only follow through the first initial burst of words and doesn't continue to follow along.\n\nAnother bug that I came across while playing earlier took place during the bomb sequence. A player pressed the switch to open the door before prompted and was ejected from the level into an endless abyss to which myself and another player ended up when we responded next to them.\n\nThat being said it is still pretty enjoyable. The characters for how little they seem to talk do still hold true to their personalities in the show.\n\nHere is hoping that in the future we can play as other characters such as Jaune, Pyrrha, Nora, ect.\n\n10/10 would break the game again.","December 8, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I understand that her weapons are actually shotguns but I just think the the explosive projectiles would be better since thats how she uses them in the show.  And I found that the sound of Yang's weapons seemed off.  Finally I think there needs to be a Qrow character pack down the line because Qrow is the best.","December 8, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Was waiting for a while to see a game of RWBY come out, which I'm a big fan of.\nPlayed through the ''story-line'' in about 45 minutes with my friend. This is to be expected since it's still Early Acces. This will probably be expanded in the future.\n\nFor the leveling systems it seems to take a bit before you unlock the ''challange skills''. 2000 kills to unlock a skill? I have no clue if this is much or not for this time of game genre since I havn't played much of these types of games yet.\n\nPreformance was not an issue. Running it smoothly with my old GTX 660. (not like this game is graphics intense or anything :P)\n\nFor what I would like to see in the future\n-More content (probably being worked on, but since they are a small team it will take time)\n-Several difficulties. Once you know what you are doing I think it would be nice to be able to crank up the difficulty. Make the grimm stronger/add more grimm (or whatever else you can think of) . and with this raise in difficulty more exp?\n\nOverall a great 10 bucks spent. I'll see myself playing a bit of this between some other games, using it as commentary material for my Youtube channel or just when I feel like it :D.","December 8, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Especially when it comes to jumping and landing on the ground. There’s also the sort of stale lack of variety combat? (I am speaking as someone who has ONLY played as Weiss. So for all I know the issue can be limited to just her) There aren’t really much combos. It’s spam a physical attack or a long distance attack and then your special meter lets you use like more fancy attacks. But you have to actually build it up and it drains fast. So pretty much it seems like most of the time you’ll use the same basic button mashing attack the majority of the time which can sorta get a little stale after a while?\n\nI mean when you compare it to some other similar beat em up hack and slash fight fight hoard games I’ve played like Pirate Warriors for example which is just Dynasty but One Piece from what I understand, the focus should have been on making basic non special meter required attacks more fun with more variety. (Despite this I mean it is still slightly satisfying to spam it on enemies regardless but clearly I recognize that there's more potential to be had)\n\nVisuals are actually pretty nice. The landscape and lighting (Of course the characters are always kinda glowing and never change no matter what type of lighting you’re in) are rather nice. And I do enjoy that there’s some down time with the world feeling fairly big (But only so much so, it’s a linear game)\n\nI would have liked maybe a little moooore exploration but this game is probably designed with the intent that players would rather rush it and fight fight fight.\n\nMy advice is rip off DMC and Dynasty Warriors a bit more maybe.","December 6, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Probably better than the show's.\nThe controls are easy to understand and work very well.\nThe replayability is great.  I come back to this game everyday thanks to the different styles of gameplay.\nAnd the gameplay...\nGrimm to destroy, four different characters to choose from with four different special abilities to unlock, different passives for each character, and the satisfaction you get from defeating a large wave of Grimm...\n\nThis game is wonderful. And it's still an Early Access!\n\nHere's a list of things I would like to to see in future updates:\n\n-Character Customization. It would be really cool if the more you played, you could unlock different outfits from the show to put on your character\n\n-Trading Cards. I need my Yang background. Now.\n\n-Team JNPR. Yeah, this is obvious. Rooster Teeth are most likely to do this in the future.\n\n-Improved Minimap. Instead of your allies being blue, it should be that you can see the faces of the character they're playing, and to see where a fallen ally is also.\n\n-Ability Loadout. I'd love to customize which abilities I can unlock instead of staying with the same ones.\n\n-More Character Voices and Lines. If we can get more lines from team RWBY (and possibly JNPR), it would be wonderful.\n\nThanks for reading!","December 13, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Not much new has occurred except for new visuals and info from the dev team during the livestream. Review has not changed)\n\n[PROS/CONS]\n+Beautiful graphical design. very similar to the actual show's design which adds to the immersion\n+Voice acting, while limited, is high quality. The girls, Ryan, and Joel all did fantastic work\n+Diversity. Yes there may only be four levels and an equal number of Grimm types but let's remeber where the roots of this game were with one level and one type of enemy based on the older concept of the Beowolf.\n+Online connectivity. practically seemless ability to connect to matches and lobbies and no lag if a player drops mid game\n\n-limited worlds/levels. As stated before, there are only four levels and those four levels are also highly restricted to a linear path. Hopefully the Game Dev team at Rooster Teeth will expand upon the limits of the levels they have (Can be forgiven thanks to the announced forever fall map in early 2016)\n-Skill menu is too small. The choices in what to spend your skill points are still in the early stages so there aren't many things to put your points towards as many are locked away behind challenges\n-Combat needs to be worked on. This goes as the most urgent of gameplay updates to me. there is only a dodge, no blocking and enemies gain both invincibility and speed during attacks making it tough to counter if at all. The addition of Lock on is also a must as ranged attacks are a real crapshoot for if you're gonna hit\n-Only four characters. Yes I know, Team RWBY is the lead group but I would love to see the ability to play as JNPR, CFVY or even non Beacon affilitated teams like SSSN.\n-More grimm are needed. Bring on swarms of Nevermores or giant Deathstalkers\n-No boss fights. I want the "Defend the control point" system to include a major boss at the end of each wave defense segment (4 waves of normal enemies/pack leaders and then one fight against a Giant Grimm or equivilant boss)\n-Difficulty based lobbies. As of right now, difficulty adjusts to player count. i would love to see specific chosen difficulty (from easy or trainee, to Very hard or True Huntsman or something)\n\n[RECENT CHANGES]\nTwo patches have come out since My review of the game. These mostly adress preformance issues and don't work towards the combat system or the skill menus of the characters but they do make the game feel a bit smoother. Which is always an added bonus. There are also more breakable objects to find xp orbs in and while I didn't ask for it I'll welcome it all the same.\n\n[WHAT I WOULD WANT UPDATED IMMEDIATELY]\nFirst off, Fix the ranged attacks, if nothing else. Blake's ranged attack is too quick and overpowered. Ruby can only do three shot bursts and count your lucky stars for hitting something all three shots in a row (Saving grace is her personal armor piercing upgrade which allows you to damage the tougher enemies like Borbatusks and Ursa). Yang fires shots with a cone shape animated blast but from what I've seen the bullets still fire in straight lines. Weiss' attack is too slow compared to everyone else in the ranged catagory.\n\nSecondly, Lock on would be a godsend especially for challenge related skill use since it is very easy to miss an attack or do a combo straight out of the field of enemies.\n\nThird. Larger level scale, the number of invisible walls are too damn high!\n\nStill, after a week and only two patches the game in my opinion is worth the time and money, now if you excuse me, I have challenges to complete and skills to unlock. Happy hunting, students.","December 4, 2015","true","31.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, there's no reason to be biased, let me list the pros and cons to this game.\n\nPros:\n-Dynasty Warriors and Left 4 Dead Co-op gameplay\n-Characters have good personalities from the start, and the voice acting is great\n-The game seems to have a great way of server connection, with my internet being bad 90% of the time, I never have problems connecting to another player's game\n-Each character has their own skill trees, attacks, combos, etc.\n-The Ultra setting looks amazing, I recommend building a PC for it\nCons:\n-While it is Early Access, the animations are a bit choppy/delayed\n-Doubles. By this, I mean that everyone can play as the same character (example: Four Weiss, Ruby, Yang, and Blake) leaving out so much variation at some parts of the game, making it not as fun when someone is playing as a double character.\n-No voice chat, while this is a minor problem, it'd be easier to use voice chat instead of typing so you can easily communicate in the middle of battling\n-No character saving, making it a bit tedious at times to play the same mission over again and starting back at level one\n-Unless you're a RWBY fan, you won't understand much of the game\n\nNow, here's some recommendations I'd like to see as the game updates and gets more larger:\n-More characters or teams. It would be cool to be able to play as teams like JNPR or CFVY and be able to play as the characters from said teams\n-Fix the Idle and Running animations\n-Make character restrictions, so there's more variation in matches\n\nOther than that, it's a great game with solid combat, great voice acting, and interesting story, I personally give it a 9/10\nIf you want to support RoosterTeeth, I recommend picking up the game while it's in early access.","December 20, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay acts as a Co-op Hack and slash type, which in my opinion is a really enjoyable experience. Most of the Characters have the Original Voice cast, but strangely Blake sounds a bit different for some odd reason, perhaps its how the game is directed or a different Voice-Actor all together, But thats a small detail.\nEach Character has a different Skill Tree, and most of those skills are unlocked through Challanges, in which is actually a good Idea believe it or not, It encourages a different way of playing everytime. The Skills are the same set always and they don't sinergize with the combos very well, but again this is Early Access, so theres alot of room for Improvment.\n\nPros\n-A RWBY Game Yeah!!!\n-Gameplay is Enjoyable and not tedious [Looking at you Dynasty Warriors]\n-All of Team RWBY is present\n-The Level Design is pleasing\n-Promising game\n-Music is on point\n\nCons [Honestly these are more as Nitpicks at best.]\n-Walking animation is a bit wonky with a few Characters\n-Needs more Customization with Combos\n-Voice-actors are a bit lacking\n\nOverall as this game is now, Id give this game a solid\n7/10 As of Day 1 this game is amazing, Hoping for some updates and more levels!","December 1, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Howhever , every character has 3 skills.\nEvery time you level up you gain 1 skill point, which can be use to upgrade one of your skills or a "general characteristics" (Health, aura, special (Which is like mana))\nNow, there are some skill/general upgrade that are locked , and you need to do "challenges" to unlock them. Most of them just are "kill X quantity of enemies with this skill". Howhever those, once unlocked , they stay unlocked, so you don't have to kill 100 enemies with a skill every time you want to unlock a specific upgrade. These, too, can be completed in multiple playtroughs. So lets say you need to kill 50 enemies with ranged attacks, if you kill 20 in a playtrough you only need to kill 30 in the next one.\n\n","December 4, 2015","true","46.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the ever-increasing fanbase RWBY has Rooster Teeth have some high expectations to reach for many people who are part of this fanbase including myself. Usually I personally don't touch Early Access games but this has been an exception especially after it broke several records in the Steam greenlight section and I have come out pleasantly surprised. Here are some things I have found about the game so far;\n\nThe good....Multiplayer Functionality - Now this is something I will admit I was genuinely surprised with. RWBY: Grimm Eclipse has an incredible amount of work put into multiplayer functionality, matchmaking systems and so on to the point I have experienced no problems with it, nor have any of my other friends who play this game. This is an amazing feat for a complete work let alone something in Early Access so I applaud Rooster Teeth for creating such a smooth multiplayer experience.\nAdaptive Difficulties - I was concerned going into this game, having seen a screenshot of the options menu that it would be "one-difficulty-suits-all". During gameplay I had several people leave the party and new members re-join and each time someone left or joined the difficulty had adapted to a level that was beneficial for all players, not to hard and not to easy.\nVoice Acting - If you're a fan of the animated series, you know just how wacky some of the characters can be. This game truly captures the personality of the characters we have come to love, and incorporate it into the dialogue of the game. If anything I wish there was a bit more dialogue, which there probably will be once the full version is released but the dialogue currently in there is everything I could have hoped for.\nHack and Slash Aspect - This game, is without a doubt a Hack-and-Slash game. If you don't like games where you are constantly moshing you're mouse to swing/fire your weapon then this game just isn't for you. Rooster Teeth have done a great job with the weapon and general fighting animations. Understandably though, as the game is in Early Access, the animations are limited and I sincerely hope that Rooster Teeth adds more in coming times.\nStory - To be honest I've never been a fan of Hack and Slash games as I find they rarely have a story that is truly immersive. RWBY: Grimm Eclipse however does appear to have a good in-depth story behind it. Being Early Access only a very small amount is known about the story but what there is, is enough to pique my interest.\nLevelling System - The levelling system in the game reminds me much of a MOBA levelling system. As you advance in levels you gain ability points and spend ability points on what skills are available or to upgrade existing skills. The skill tree is also nice and easy to understand so there is little confusion.\nAnd the bad.....Aura Bar - The Aura bar, this game's Health Bar, is very sketchy. Depending on what level you are and what skills you choose one hit from enemies can completely bring down your Aura bar to nothing, but you can continue to take another 10 hits or so even after it's empty. You would think once your health reaches 0 it actually means 0.\nOptions Menu - As of this time the options menu is incredibly basic. The two main problems I have with it is whenever I launch the game it resets my resolution settings, so I have to change it every time I launch the game. The second thing I wish would be different with the options menu is that we could customize key bindings. The keys to use are displayed in-game as part of the UI but there is currently no options to customize them.\nSubtitles - Subtitles are switched on by default, and as a gamer and a King I do enjoy my subtitles. Unfortunately the one issue I do have with them is when the dialogue passes the first lot of subtitles and should then go onto the next lot to cover the next lot of dialogue that is being said, it doesn't change. Meaning the subtitles stay the same throughout the entire dialogue when it should have changed several times.\nConclusionFor an Early Access game and a fan of the series it has surpassed my expectations and more. I commend Rooster Teeth for the effort they have put into this game in recent times. The gripes I have with the game are only small, and are only a result of the game still being in Early Access, and I feel the good outweighs the bad exponentially. If you're not a fan of Hack'n'Slash then I wouldn't recommend this game to you. But if you don't mind that genre of games, or if you are a fan of the series then I can whole-heartedly reccomend this game and that it will definitely be worth the $15 in the long run and even initially.\n\nReview by King Henry the VIII\n"We had vegans in the 16th century too.

As the description said, it's a co-op hack'n'slash and I think therein is its problem: the repetitive predictability of hacking and slashing.  It reminds me of Dynasty Warriors (although minion enemies are way more active/aggressive) where the gameplay emphasis is overwhelmingly on button-mashing melee with the occasional spice of abilities thrown in.  In fact, the (only?) fastest way to recharge your resource to activate those abilities is to score sequential basic weapon hits without taking a hit in return.  In no way does this game feel like the spirit of the online show RWBY.  In the show, teammates constantly display new and inventive tactics where cooperative synergy is the dominant force and the finishing moves are mind-blowing uber powerful one-off abilities.  In Grimm Eclipse, however, the abilities play a minor role versus the efficacy of basic melee, are embarrassingly underpowered compared to the "real" characters' inventive potency, don't recharge fast enough, are prone to missing or having suboptimal effect if the enemies aren't lined up 'just so', and one player's abilities have no beneficial synergistic effect with any other player's.  The only coop effect I could perceive was that when my character was fighting (in melee of course) near to another, our individual melee hits seemed to do a lot more damage, much like, again, Dynasty Warriors coop mode.  If this game is to do proper homage to the show, the abilities need a massive beefing up with greater complexity, frequency of availability, ease of use, and team-oriented effects.\n\nSome good things:\n1, the music.  (Thank you for adding a sound fx volume slider after I wrote this review, but why are character fighting voices applied to sound fx instead of, um... Voices slider?)\n2, Although the mayhem of melee feels like button mashing, there is a bit of strategy in it in that you can and should use jump and dodge and, by throwing those into your rotations, your chain attacks change up a little bit.  (I'd like to see more of that.)\n3, Every character has their niche and feels distinct, even when doing basic melee animations.  For instance, Yang is great at keeping enemies occupied by kiting them with right-click cone effects, compared to Weiss who can pick off enemies with long range attacks.\n4, The MOBA style levelling up works.  Personally, I'd prefer a persistent character whom I could take back to the starting chapter with a friend and power through.  (Think 'The Legend of Korra'.)  But with the MOBA style you're encouraged to stick with your team and help each other keep leveling up and progressing.  You quickly become attached to the power/improvements your character gains.\n5, It's a great coop game.  Very easy to pick up and play, no team killing shenanigans, no server/lobby lag, people can drop and join at any point, and the enemy difficulty scales to how many players are in the party.  Oh, and a party can consist of four Blakes, if you really all want to have kitty ears.\n\nSome little things I'd recommend improving:\n1, I already said the abilities.\n2, Please do balance the volumes.\n3, I think it only makes sense to have the crate experience spheres contribute to group xp just like the artifact chess pieces.  No point in making people fight over crates or prioritize them over enemies.\n4, Wave fights are good and all, but I sincerely hope later levels will include more coop based mechanics, like simultaneous activation puzzles, or needs to separate enemies and tackle them away from each other, or enemies who are especially vulnerable to flanking maneuvers.\n5, I know it's a hack'n'slash MOBAish thing, but please let there be some way to save progress.  This game has the potential to be virtually unending in its maps/chapters, but that'd be ridiculously infuriating to have to leave suddenly or have internet hiccup and disconnect a player when they're 20 chapters in and are forced to start over from Ch 1.\n6, There should be a lot more evidence of semblance power.  Ruby should become faster as she gains more sequential hits or by capitalizing upon the recoil from Crescent Rose's sniper fire (as is canon).  Would also be nice if she had an ability to sprint across the map to help teammates.  Weiss should have more glyphs, like being able to freeze at a distance, teleport, speed up teammates while slowing enemies, imbue teammates with power, etc.  Blake should do a lot more teleporting and should be able to deploy a distraction dummy of herself, turning invisible or at least dumping aggro until it's destroyed.  Yang should be able to absorb hits and channel that energy back as extra melee damage.\n\nOverall, a fun game, wonderfully reminscent of the world of Remnant, beautiful canon aesthetics, cute little quips from the characters, smart level design, etc.  Good game.  But can be much better.","December 4, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once you get farther in the attack patterns are more intricate and make it a challenge. With its mulitplayer feature you get a nice group that you can hang with some friends on and go RWBY squad cause Blake is bae <3! It also gives a nice solo feature which is actually very challenging depending on the character. Each one has a variety of skills which you can slightly change with the alternate skill unlock routes. So you can make a more supportive class, or a more tank, or even a full glass cannon! Whatever you want!

However, there's no reason to be biased, let me list the pros and cons to this game.\n\nPros:\n-Dynasty Warriors and Left 4 Dead Co-op gameplay\n-Characters have good personalities from the start, and the voice acting is great\n-The game seems to have a great way of server connection, with my internet being bad 90% of the time, I never have problems connecting to another player's game\n-Each character has their own skill trees, attacks, combos, etc.\n-The Ultra setting looks amazing, I recommend building a PC for it\nCons:\n-While it is Early Access, the animations are a bit choppy/delayed\n-Doubles. By this, I mean that everyone can play as the same character (example: Four Weiss, Ruby, Yang, and Blake) leaving out so much variation at some parts of the game, making it not as fun when someone is playing as a double character.\n-No voice chat, while this is a minor problem, it'd be easier to use voice chat instead of typing so you can easily communicate in the middle of battling\n-No character saving, making it a bit tedious at times to play the same mission over again and starting back at level one\n-Unless you're a RWBY fan, you won't understand much of the game\n\nNow, here's some recommendations I'd like to see as the game updates and gets more larger:\n-More characters or teams. It would be cool to be able to play as teams like JNPR or CFVY and be able to play as the characters from said teams\n-Fix the Idle and Running animations\n-Make character restrictions, so there's more variation in matches\n\nOther than that, it's a great game with solid combat, great voice acting, and interesting story, I personally give it a 9/10\nIf you want to support RoosterTeeth, I recommend picking up the game while it's in early access.","December 20, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Secondly, the game is actually very fun to play for a while. It's not Skyrim. I doubt you'll see anyone putting thousands of hours into this game, but for a couple hours of play its very worth it. And that was just my solo experiece, I'm sure it would be a bit more fun with friends to play with.\n\nNow of course the game has its problems. It is a very early access game with a lot of potential for improvement.\nThe main issues are the sound design with a few issues regarding the movement animations. But for the most part the game looks pretty good and plays well. I do think that the number of enemies needs to be increased a bit or for a difficulty option to be added since the fights get a bit repetitive and predictable. Hopefully with some feedback and time though there can be features added to this game to make it just that much better.\n\nTl;DR: Fun game for a decent price with a few issues that will be improved upon with time but do not detract from the experience.","December 2, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But she has the lowest health (That I have seen) Which means you will need another player to use her attacks effectively.\n\nYang is the tank of the group she has high health and abilities that if used when on low health they deal more damage than they would normally. The skills she has are she can slam down on the ground dealing damage to all enemies around her and knocking them back allowing her to move around a bit easier she also has an upward dash which allows for either Blake or Ruby to jump in and deal damage with their mid-air attacks and finally she has a dash forward punch allowing her to jump into crowds and start gaining aggro before team mates decide to join in. But she doesn’t have any long distance range attacks her shotgun gauntlets only allow to hit things at a close to medium range.\n\nBlake is the damage dealer of the group she is very fast and when she gets a target she throws them into the air allowing team mates to deal damage without her getting in the way. Her abilities are quite lacking compared to the rest she has a clone ability where she jumps back leaving a shadow of herself which you can put special effects on after playing the game for a bit. She also has a dash ability that allows you to jump around enemy that are in close range of her allowing you to clean up most enemies or damage a large amount allowing for Ruby or Yang to clean up the rest and finally she has a defining (I will get onto the audio mess in a min) range attack which after a few levels you can level up to throw three at once this is the worst attack I have found because it does barely any damage and take too long to charge. But she has the second highest health and her basic range attack seems to have infinite range as long as there is nothing in the way which you would expect from Ruby seen as she has a sniper but oh well.\n\nWeiss I don’t even know not played much of her sorry can’t give much of a review of her.\n\nOther than that the only thing I think needs to be change is more levels. (which I guess will be added at some point) The audio needs a bit fix its way to loud even after turning it down in my volume mixer to 5% For real having headphones round my neck and It was still far too loud and to top it off there are some missing animations like the most noticeable is when you run down stairs or down a hill.\n\nTDLR: Very good for the team’s first ever game and very early access but better than 90% of stuff on there\n","December 2, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What right have we to judge it as if it were a triple a class production with a multimillion dollar production budget.\nLittle dicey at ultra graphics level, but that might just be on my end, small bugs/ exploits here and there like one where you can use Ruby's sniper rifle while falling or up against a wall in the air and basically become untouchable god mode until everything is dead.

It's extremely fun, especially with 3 friends, and for it to be this early access, it's very impressive. There aren't really any noted game-breaking bugs, there are a few balance issues and mechanic issues, but overall it's fairly solid. The only primary issue is that there is no in-game sound effect slider, which leaves gameplay to be eardrum-blowlingly loud. On first startup, game music and voices are also very loud, but in the options there is a spot to turn down the volume, but for sound effects there isn't, so they stay extremely loud.\n\nMany other fans and I would certainly love to see a patch allowing better sounds control ASAP.","December 4, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Not much new has occurred except for new visuals and info from the dev team during the livestream. Review has not changed)\n\n[PROS/CONS]\n+Beautiful graphical design. very similar to the actual show's design which adds to the immersion\n+Voice acting, while limited, is high quality. The girls, Ryan, and Joel all did fantastic work\n+Diversity. Yes there may only be four levels and an equal number of Grimm types but let's remeber where the roots of this game were with one level and one type of enemy based on the older concept of the Beowolf.\n+Online connectivity. practically seemless ability to connect to matches and lobbies and no lag if a player drops mid game\n\n-limited worlds/levels. As stated before, there are only four levels and those four levels are also highly restricted to a linear path. Hopefully the Game Dev team at Rooster Teeth will expand upon the limits of the levels they have (Can be forgiven thanks to the announced forever fall map in early 2016)\n-Skill menu is too small. The choices in what to spend your skill points are still in the early stages so there aren't many things to put your points towards as many are locked away behind challenges\n-Combat needs to be worked on. This goes as the most urgent of gameplay updates to me. there is only a dodge, no blocking and enemies gain both invincibility and speed during attacks making it tough to counter if at all. The addition of Lock on is also a must as ranged attacks are a real crapshoot for if you're gonna hit\n-Only four characters. Yes I know, Team RWBY is the lead group but I would love to see the ability to play as JNPR, CFVY or even non Beacon affilitated teams like SSSN.\n-More grimm are needed. Bring on swarms of Nevermores or giant Deathstalkers\n-No boss fights. I want the "Defend the control point" system to include a major boss at the end of each wave defense segment (4 waves of normal enemies/pack leaders and then one fight against a Giant Grimm or equivilant boss)\n-Difficulty based lobbies. As of right now, difficulty adjusts to player count. i would love to see specific chosen difficulty (from easy or trainee, to Very hard or True Huntsman or something)\n\n[RECENT CHANGES]\nTwo patches have come out since My review of the game. These mostly adress preformance issues and don't work towards the combat system or the skill menus of the characters but they do make the game feel a bit smoother. Which is always an added bonus. There are also more breakable objects to find xp orbs in and while I didn't ask for it I'll welcome it all the same.\n\n[WHAT I WOULD WANT UPDATED IMMEDIATELY]\nFirst off, Fix the ranged attacks, if nothing else. Blake's ranged attack is too quick and overpowered. Ruby can only do three shot bursts and count your lucky stars for hitting something all three shots in a row (Saving grace is her personal armor piercing upgrade which allows you to damage the tougher enemies like Borbatusks and Ursa). Yang fires shots with a cone shape animated blast but from what I've seen the bullets still fire in straight lines. Weiss' attack is too slow compared to everyone else in the ranged catagory.\n\nSecondly, Lock on would be a godsend especially for challenge related skill use since it is very easy to miss an attack or do a combo straight out of the field of enemies.\n\nThird. Larger level scale, the number of invisible walls are too damn high!\n\nStill, after a week and only two patches the game in my opinion is worth the time and money, now if you excuse me, I have challenges to complete and skills to unlock. Happy hunting, students.","December 4, 2015","true","31.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sound is design will get worked on, animations will be smoothed out, combos probably expanded (and shown in some sort of tutorial, hopefully), and I don't get motion sick.\nOne of the only things that get me is the combo meter. It seems to reset after a certain amount of time of not hitting anything. Some sort of indication of how long it will last will really help players gauge who to engage when in combat. It's also a pain regaining specials when the only one left standing is a big ♥♥♥ Beowulf who won't stagger and apparently has heat seeking claws.\nRegarding the camera, it's movement is a bit stiff, and gets cramped near walls. This is really only a problem for me during combat, when my thumb is occupied with combos and can't tweak the camera to see my surroudings. Panning the camera out in combat or allowing it to move slowly and smoothly to get as much of the action would be a great addition. Until humans get two right thumbs, this camera's gonna need some work.\nBesides all that, I'm having fun with the game. I do wish that the skills gained through leveling would stay, even if we have to get the xp over again.\n\np.s: After playing for a few more hours, one suggestion I have is to allow the number of hits you have on the combo meter to affect how much xp you get. For the purposes of the beta, this would only affect multiplayer; since, the only way to get the cap is to completely dominate the field. But, in the main game, hopefully a better fleshed out combat system will warrant more complex perk trees, and reward players who use their perks effectivelywith more xp. I don't mind having to choose perks to employ. Actually, knowing that I'll eventually have every single skill in the perk trees is sort of boring to me.\n\nCuz Steam is a pain in the balls, I loosely recommend this game. For now, just to test it. We'll see how this turns out.\n\nAs of 5/18\nBy now, I got a really good look at the the controls for all the characters, and I really like how they all play and their subtle differences in attack combos. The extra features added to combat are a welcome change as well; like the heavy attacks, ranged and stagger attacks becoming the upgradeable abilities, and enemies breaking through our combos if we go too long, forcing a dodge. It's so good to see RT sticking with this game, and it's potential is insane. But, I have only one major gripe. While the character models did get a very nice touch up, they look like cabbage patch kids in the face. Maybe that's just a result of the new style that they have now, but I really, really like the way looked before.","December 7, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's still early access, with bugs and only one campaign, and we're still sinking hours into it without a second thought! The gameplay is reminiscent of a Warriors game (Dynasty, Samauri, etc), which is a huge bonus in my opinion. Plus, it's a game made by the company that made the show. So you know there'll never be a problem with sub-par story, or mismatched voice acting, or anything like that. It's just like playing an episode of the show itself.\nThat said, if you don't have friends to play with, it loses some appeal. You can join in random games, but it's just not the same.

Content here is really small having only about 5 missions but I enjoyed the 1 hour of gameplay I had. Music is alot like the show which is great. Recommended to most people but not for the people who likes lots of game content.\n\nBut now with the addition of a revamped combat system gameplay is much better. The only things needed are more missions and the story mode. Recommended to play with friends and now worth the price. Still the combat has things that won't show out of the box where I had to figure out how to chain team attacks. Only one game breaking glitch happened to me were one of the players disconnected and a door that should open stayed closed. Anyway the level system still needs a step up as shared xp is better rather than solo xp because someone else can last hit and they receicve the xp.\n\nNice things:\nMusic is on point.\nGameplay is action-packed\nReally stable for an Early-Access game(Glitches occur but mostly fine.\nPretty graphics (I forget to walk just by looking at the lighting effects and scenery)\n\nIn the middle\nTeam RWBY feels the same on combat but distinct enough to know who they are in the team. *A little better because their skills tend to stand out now because of the combat revision.\n\nNot so nice things\nNot a lot of content (They just rolled out a beta update and that is just it)\nOccasional glitches (Understandable and mostly minor)\nPeople leaving games frequently ( I had a full team on the 1st mission and it went down to 2 of us on the 3rd one). Playing with friends can fix this but solo players will find this annoying\n\nPotentials and things I want\nA really robust system for combat ( Something more than this MOBA style abilities system)   * Just a bit more tweaking to the combat like heavy combo chains less animation stagger when using heavy attacks and it will be great.( Counters are OP so please fix)\nCharacters, more of them ( I want to see Team FNKY and JNPR )\nMission Diversity ( Defend X and Fight off Y waves of enemies will be boring for about 10 hours most games have)\nAn offline singleplayer mode with or without AI companions ( Coding the AI might be hard because the team working on the games only have a few people working on it.)\nA lock on system like Metal Gear Rising or Kingdom Hearts where there is a soft lock on nearby enemies and a manual lock where you want to target an enemy in longer ranges.\nColor swaps if somebody is playing the same character, it get confusing really close.\n\nI really enjoyed the short time I was playing this game. Kudos to RT for making this and developing the game. More content and play time will come so buy this game on the coming Steam Sales that will come.","December 8, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

How do I think they have executed it? Let's find out.\n\n+Pros:\n\n-You like hack'n'slash? Good; its for you.\n\n-Beautiful Environments? Good; it relatively polished.\n\n-Button prompts and response with a controller aspect is well thought out.\n\n-The fact that I don't need a third party program to use said controller and have it automatically recognized is a big plus.\n\n-All in all if you are a fan of the show and just want to chill with some friends or join a lobby. Good you will have fun with it.\n\n+Cons:\n\n-No way to select level designation.\n\n-No real way to see who is in the team; character wise, before joining a game.\n\n-Though the button combo presses are solid; the inevitable bug exists with team attacks not working correctly.\n\n-Coding and generalized optimization fixes need to be done to make it a smoother experience.\n\nThe Pros; in my eyes, over-weigh the Cons here. For a small 20 USD you can get a package yes; and yes, its Early Access. But Rooster Teeth has never let me down as far as solid product as a customer and a subscriber to them for years. In short, you should get it to support it as a development and learning process for them and if you just love the show; as well as the game type. I've been suckered into A+ titles and gotten far less of an experience and fun out of it.\nHow I got to 109+ hours I really don't know, more so I was looking for every nook and cranny to get a bug or to see something that coders or other reviewers didn't; as well as enjoying the game along the way. And I plan on putting more hours in and to support everything this great company has offered in a fun little package.","May 10","true","115.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat has been improved vastly with more attacks thrown in to make it feel less button mashy however I will say the game is still kind of repetitive with samey objectives throughout most of it. I also wouldn't mind some more playable characters thrown in too.

Secondly, lets see the Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:Awesome new combat system, I felt the old one was a bit too hasty and could never find the correct skill button in time\nEncountered as much bugs as SETI aliens, thought there was one time but still not sure\nNew camera system\nC-C-COMBOS!\nSome places were redisgned\nNot screwed by Cinder in any way!\n\nCons:Not screwed by Cinder that way.\nThe aforementioned Camera system is a bit wonky\nSome places were redisgned\nFor Oobleck's sake, not enough CFVY!\n\nWell, for now that's all. Oh wait! To not just be some jerk telling what's wrong with the game, here, some suggestions how to make it better!\nObviously, most of all, right now the wonky camera system is my issue, I'm gonna take down the mouse sensitivity by a lot, still, I think the camera handling would be better if you could set the camera to be not independent from the character, e.g.: The character turns with the camera, would help a lot on us, FPS fans. If you make this option a tickable box then even those whom would have an issue with this option, couldn't whine. Oh! And of course, we need some CFVY now, or JNPR, either way it is a cool game, despite it isn't complete yet, which to say, not bad considering the team's size.

The sound is design will get worked on, animations will be smoothed out, combos probably expanded (and shown in some sort of tutorial, hopefully), and I don't get motion sick.\nOne of the only things that get me is the combo meter. It seems to reset after a certain amount of time of not hitting anything. Some sort of indication of how long it will last will really help players gauge who to engage when in combat. It's also a pain regaining specials when the only one left standing is a big ♥♥♥ Beowulf who won't stagger and apparently has heat seeking claws.\nRegarding the camera, it's movement is a bit stiff, and gets cramped near walls. This is really only a problem for me during combat, when my thumb is occupied with combos and can't tweak the camera to see my surroudings. Panning the camera out in combat or allowing it to move slowly and smoothly to get as much of the action would be a great addition. Until humans get two right thumbs, this camera's gonna need some work.\nBesides all that, I'm having fun with the game. I do wish that the skills gained through leveling would stay, even if we have to get the xp over again.\n\np.s: After playing for a few more hours, one suggestion I have is to allow the number of hits you have on the combo meter to affect how much xp you get. For the purposes of the beta, this would only affect multiplayer; since, the only way to get the cap is to completely dominate the field. But, in the main game, hopefully a better fleshed out combat system will warrant more complex perk trees, and reward players who use their perks effectivelywith more xp. I don't mind having to choose perks to employ. Actually, knowing that I'll eventually have every single skill in the perk trees is sort of boring to me.\n\nCuz Steam is a pain in the balls, I loosely recommend this game. For now, just to test it. We'll see how this turns out.\n\nAs of 5/18\nBy now, I got a really good look at the the controls for all the characters, and I really like how they all play and their subtle differences in attack combos. The extra features added to combat are a welcome change as well; like the heavy attacks, ranged and stagger attacks becoming the upgradeable abilities, and enemies breaking through our combos if we go too long, forcing a dodge. It's so good to see RT sticking with this game, and it's potential is insane. But, I have only one major gripe. While the character models did get a very nice touch up, they look like cabbage patch kids in the face. Maybe that's just a result of the new style that they have now, but I really, really like the way looked before.","December 7, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sound is design will get worked on, animations will be smoothed out, combos probably expanded (and shown in some sort of tutorial, hopefully), and I don't get motion sick.\nOne of the only things that get me is the combo meter. It seems to reset after a certain amount of time of not hitting anything. Some sort of indication of how long it will last will really help players gauge who to engage when in combat. It's also a pain regaining specials when the only one left standing is a big ♥♥♥ Beowulf who won't stagger and apparently has heat seeking claws.\nRegarding the camera, it's movement is a bit stiff, and gets cramped near walls. This is really only a problem for me during combat, when my thumb is occupied with combos and can't tweak the camera to see my surroudings. Panning the camera out in combat or allowing it to move slowly and smoothly to get as much of the action would be a great addition. Until humans get two right thumbs, this camera's gonna need some work.\nBesides all that, I'm having fun with the game. I do wish that the skills gained through leveling would stay, even if we have to get the xp over again.\n\np.s: After playing for a few more hours, one suggestion I have is to allow the number of hits you have on the combo meter to affect how much xp you get. For the purposes of the beta, this would only affect multiplayer; since, the only way to get the cap is to completely dominate the field. But, in the main game, hopefully a better fleshed out combat system will warrant more complex perk trees, and reward players who use their perks effectivelywith more xp. I don't mind having to choose perks to employ. Actually, knowing that I'll eventually have every single skill in the perk trees is sort of boring to me.\n\nCuz Steam is a pain in the balls, I loosely recommend this game. For now, just to test it. We'll see how this turns out.\n\nAs of 5/18\nBy now, I got a really good look at the the controls for all the characters, and I really like how they all play and their subtle differences in attack combos. The extra features added to combat are a welcome change as well; like the heavy attacks, ranged and stagger attacks becoming the upgradeable abilities, and enemies breaking through our combos if we go too long, forcing a dodge. It's so good to see RT sticking with this game, and it's potential is insane. But, I have only one major gripe. While the character models did get a very nice touch up, they look like cabbage patch kids in the face. Maybe that's just a result of the new style that they have now, but I really, really like the way looked before.","December 7, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay seems to move fairly smoothly and the abilities and weapons make each character a new experience. The lack of a lock on mechanic hurts this game a bit, as sometimes you can just fly through a group of enemies and only hit 2 out of 10 of them. The game is a bit too simple, as you only have two attack buttons, no real combos, and a basic jump and dodge. The game has a long way to go, but it's honestly amazing once you consider this is the earliest stage of the game out. Once this game gets some good updates, it'll be an amazingly fun hack and slash.","December 2, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It feels a lot like Dragon Nest which is one of my favorite games due to the fighting mechanics. I also played the first version of Grimm Eclipse and loved that as well. As soon as I saw the Early Access trailer I immediately loaded up Steam and bought it. Next thing I knew I'm playing Ruby while singing a messed of version of Willy Wonka's "A world of pure imagination," changing imagination to decaptitation. In fact, when I went to get a drink of water after playing, I then realized that I had played until 10:30ish when I meant to be done at 8:00 to watch the Flash.\n\nCon Ramble:\nMy only complaints are the random bugs here and there, like hit box missing and awkward slope sliding. This is understandable as it just came out and I know RoosterTeeth is committed to their fanbase. The campaign is also incomplete though I feel like they did that on purpose... They also need to add control editors as I am too used to pressing enter to chat with other people.\n\nOther Rambling\nWhile this game is early access it is well worth the $15.00 and just play around even without friends. The game is easy enough to where you feel godlike on the battlefield and hard enough to where you need to use strategy to complete your goal. In all honesty it doesn't really matter that the campaign isn't finished yet.

It was great, but the shots recoil was definitely more intuned with how it was showed in the show.\n\nThe only real problem is, and although it was JUST placed on Steam today, was that my computer sadly was not able to process Mt.Glenn after a while. Then again, it WAS just made. So it would benefit both RoosterTeeth and anyone with any lower spec comps, if they could process it, to debug that portion.

While most of the game has background music boss fights have songs from the RWBY OST.\n\n+ Each character feels really different. I have seen people say this is not the case but I have played as all 4 that are out now and each one plays different.\n\nRuby plays as heavy damage and crowd control. Her abilities are tailored to be able to take on hoards head on.\n\nWeiss plays as support. She can freeze enemies and knock them back away from her team which is helpful for reviving.\n\nBlake is less straightforward. In the game you get special blips to use special moves. To get one blip you have to fill up the combo bar without getting hit. On her own she deals fast low damage but fills up her bar quickly. Her special attacks are pretty good ranging from crowd control to boss killing moves.\n\nYang plays as two ways that I have found. She is either crowd control or a tank. Her attacks and special upgrades allow her to take a lot of damage and when her Aura is depleted she gets a full special bar. This combined with high health and wide weapon spread makes her perfect to take enemies.\n\n+ The upgrading. Each character has 3 specials and a general for upgrading. The specials vary from character to character but the general is mostly the same except for 2 upgrades special to each character.\n\n+ Its a challenging game. Most of the Grimm are weak alone but can quickly overwhelm you. To add to that you have "Major" Grimm which are much stronger versions and can be tricky on their own.\n\n+ A good variety of Grimm to fight.\n\nYou have 5 types to fight each with three upgrades.\n\nCreeps\nBeowulfs\nBoarbatusk\nUrsa\nAnd a new mutated nameless Grimm.\n\nIn the end I would give RWBY:GE a 8/10","December 1, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Right now, there is just a short unfinished campaign which you can play co-op.\nJust as the developers have intended, there is a Left 4 Dead feel to it, though it doesn’t seem as replayable as L4D at the moment.\nThere have been complaints about sound etc. but these are bound to be fix in due time. Personally I did not experience many problems. Just occasional FPS lag and the running animation freezing. But seriously, you can deal with that.\nThis game is fun even in early access so you can only imagine the potential it has when it’s completed.\nThe game looks cool. It’s got a potato setting. The characters look cool. The environment is cool. The attacks are cool. What else can you ask for in an early access game?\n","December 1, 2015","true","27.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also, some creatures attacks should not always be an outright elimination of Aura (such as the boars attacks removing an improved Aura bar completely, when they do that normally). Apart from that, I can't think of many other improvements that you haven't thought of already (such as more levels and characters). So I will leave this review with the fact that this game is incredibly fun and entertaining, but it needs improvements, and I assume they will be made further down the line, and so would like to thank you for them.

I think the game-play is decently fun and the story is alright. So when you read the rest of the review, keep in mind that I DO like your game, I just think that it could be improved in multiple ways.\n\n[If you are reading this to decide weather or not you want to buy it, stop here. The rest is for the developers.]\n\nMy major problems with this game revolve around how much so many parts of the game feel the same. After about the 10th time playing through the campaign I have almost completely memorized all of the encounters. My biggest suggestion to improve this feature is by potentially randomizing the spawn locations of the relics and boxes, and putting a small randomization in the spawn rates of the mobs that we will be fighting. Also, all of the characters feel, for the most part, the same. The abilities seem to be lined up like this: AoE Damage/Utility, high damage single target, long range damage. To improve on this you could potentially either make it so that each character has a truly unique move set, or give each character the option between 5 or more moves that they would simply chose 3 of. Another way to add customization and diversity is by allowing people to upgrade their character with bonuses to health/speed/skill damage/flat damage/ attacking speed/whatever you want (look at the mod system in Warframe to get a better idea of what I'm talking about[I'm not saying copy the whole system, just the general concept of mods and slots]). As for the basic attacks, I suggest looking up the game "Vindictus" and trying to implement an attack/combo system like they have for their characters. It doesn't have to be identical, but there is currently little point to doing anything other than spam left click with the occasional tap of shift to dodge or space to jump. Alternatively, you could take a note from, again, the game "Warframe" by implementing differences in the attack combos based off of movement or pauses in stead of right clicks. This might solve the repetitive nature of the current combat system and make the game a little more enjoyable, but that is not what I think the main problem of the game is. As far as I'm concerned, the main problem with this game appears to be intention.\n\nAs far as I can tell, your current intention with this game is to make a fun game for people to buy, play a few times, then drop. Decently fun, good deal, maybe pick up every so often to play with friends, but not anything truly amazing. THIS WOULD BE A TERRIBLE WASTE. This is a fact that I can not stress enough: this could be an amazing game that people will still be coming back to when RWBY is in season 10 (if the series has that many seasons), or potentially outlast the actual show! All you would have to do is follow a simple formula, and this game could go from an alright game that friends play every so often, to a game big enough to compete with AAA titles.\n\nIt may seem like this is to small of a game to ever grow to the sizes that I may have mentioned, but all you have to do is 1 simple*(not really that simple) thing: continue to release content. Add more campaigns, continue to release new characters(it's not like you have any shortage to chose from), add cosmetic options(either in sets or for individual slots like chest, boots, legs, head, weapon), and even survival modes. Another way to increase interest in this game is by introducing a competitive scene, by having endurance challenges and/or races in preset unique situations. The rewards could be in-game currency (I'll get to that in the next section), unique cosmetics, or even potentially real RWBY merchandise. Holiday events are also another way to get attention and returning players. If you continue to add content and host events, you will have people coming back to this game till the end of time.\n\nNow you may be currently thinking "aside from appeasing our fan after the complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T WE JUST PULLED IN THE LAST TWO EPISODES OF SEASON 3!" (*takes deep breath*) "Why would we do this? New content is expensive to produce and there no assurance we would get that much out of it." In reality you could make it quite profitable in one of two ways. The first of which I will call the "EA approach" and the second I will call the "Dangerous but Loved approach"\n\nThe EA approach is quite simple, and DLC is the name of the game. Just look at Payday 2, a very simple game (that is in my opinion isn't even that amazing) that has lasted far longer than it should have by a constant stream of frankly impressive DLC and developing content. You could release characters in team based packs or individually, payed cosmetics, and a billion different other things that people could buy for a (pleasepleaseplease) low price. The good part about this method, you will almost certainly make money off of each expansion you release. The down-side, people will hate you. You'll be accused you being money-grabbers and probably lose a good portion off players and fans. This is not the method I would personally suggest. Instead I would suggest...\n\nThe Dangerous but Loved approach. The idea is that you release all of your expansions and DLC free of charge. Any new content that could affect game-play you give to all your players completely free. Now hold on just one second before you call this method financial suicide, you still could make decent profit this way, but it would require a significantly larger amount of work. The idea is that you would pump out as much cosmetic DLC as feasibly possible. You could buy these cosmetics either with direct money transfers or an in-game currency that you purchase with real money. These cosmetics could easily be costumes (like previously mentioned), but you could also offer alternate skill effects, such as changing the color, but you could really do anything to just make them look different. You could introduce pets that don't actually do anything, just follow you around and look cute. I'm sure you can see the reason this is called the Dangerous but Loved approach, there is a significant risk of not making as much money as you may expect, but those who can't afford that much can still enjoy the game at a very low cost. While it may seem that you might not even break even with this payment model, I would suggest you look at Grinding Gears Games. They are a small game company that popped up only a few years ago, and is using almost this exact same model for an entirely free-to-play game. You could also take a not from their supporter pack by releasing time limited exclusive packs of cosmetics and real life merchandise. With your current fan base and the quality of the game as it is before you make any of my previously mentioned changes (if you do that is), I have no doubt that this game would be able to survive on this model.\n\nIn the end I just want to say that I am a huge fan of RWBY, both the animated series and the game. I think that this game could be amazing if you put the work into it. IF you put the work into it. As it is not and in the direction it's going, I think it will be an alright game that I definitely wouldn't pay more than 15 dollars for, but I just want you guys to know what this game COULD be, and hope you take this opportunity to make this the truly amazing game it could be.\n\nEdit: since I posted this I've noticed that the developers have made updates as to new combat systems being introduced soon and a new hoard/survival mode coming in soon. I'll have to wait untill they are released and then will update with what I think of them.","February 14","true","17.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are a few quirks with rendering, holes in the map and still needs to be balanced more. but those are all minor problems. The balance issue doesn't really effect me since I almost always end up on the top of the leaderboard at the end of every game (both kills and deaths:( ). If you are a fan you really need to buy the game while its in early access since the price is said to go up soon enough.\n\n-Every character has an individual skill tree with three specials and two unlockable upgrades.\n-The specials include an area of affect, individual target and directional.\n-You have to reach a certain amount of kills to unlock several of the third tier upgrades for the specials.\n-Of the two individual upgrades, one usually requires a certain amount of special attack kills and the other is only unlocked when you reach level 10, but it stays unlocked for future playthroughs.\n-Other upgrades include: increased health, increased aura (pretty much shields), decreased aura recharge time/delay, decreased revive time (requires 5 revives to unlock), and increased amount of special attack points.\n-Only has one champaign but will have a total of three\n\nRecommendations:\n-keyboard is fine but prolonged playing hurts your fingers. USE A CONTROLLER\n-Always get the Lvl 10 upgrade on your first lvl up (assuming youve made it lvl 10 in a previous playthrough)\n-get the revive upgrade early on\n-locate all the artifacts\n\npersonally, Yang is my least favourite in game character\n\nThe potential for this game is very high with the possibility for a great workshop community for different skins and campaigns (if their is a workshop section, but the guys at RT have a good sense of humor and are pretty loose so I wouldn't rule out workshop). More characters are potentially possible. I personally don't like the idea of character creation but it seems to be heavily supported by the RWBY community.\n\nIT IS ONLY EARLY ACCESS but is surprisingly polished.

Even on potato settings, the game is jittery as hell, and I have a GTX 860M which should be able to run a game of this graphical quality with ease (with fast paced combat, a good framerate really improves the experience). Also, the game is very early in development and lacks any real polish either in the UI or the combat. So why the recommendation, you ask? Well, I'm a huge fan of the series, and in particular I think they've done a fantastic job setting up a universe where a game like this has the potential to be INCREDIBLE. The show delivers each character with a unique weapon and combat style, which would make for a perfect cooperative game with players that take on different roles and mesh with each other to balance out strengths and weaknesses. The only thing that the devs need is the time and money to create it. Should you buy the game right now if you've never heard of RWBY? Probably not (unless you are very interested in the final product and think you'll buy the game eventually). Should you buy the game if you're a fan of the show and want to support the game, whether or not the final product meets expectations? Yes.

The hack and slash aspect isn't as straight forward as one may think. Charging into a group of enemies will get you mowed down. Tactical retreat, hit and run, and attacking with your allies is the way to survive. The action and use of source material makes this the best in my books. I understand this is an early access we have so far but here are some things I've noted while playing thus far.\n\nThe settings menu doesn't seem to like saving the previous session settings. I toned down the resolution and quality for my first time playing. I have an older machine so I didn't want to stress test it just yet. When I went to change the video quality, the resolution also changed to 1920x1200 without my input. The second time I opened the game, it forgot I turned on subtitles.\n\nThere are certain gameplay aspects that I found to be lacking. Whenever static artwork like a speaking characters face was shown, it was a low resolution but blown up image. I hope this will be resolved in the successive releases. The fighting audio seems to overpower speech audio. Perhaps you can have all sound lower slightly when a character is talking?\n\nI know animation work is difficult and doubly so for a gameplay where the models are at the player's whim. The animations are pretty good for walking on even ground and jumping but there was an odd falling animation and sound when going down a gentle decline. It also prevented additional movement input like jumping.\n\nIs there a way to include mutators before the match? Perhaps having the option to prevent people from selecting the same characters. I also suggest a way of changing characters when changing levels.\n\nThese are probably the major issues that I have encountered. As for suggestions… the opening credit scene plays for too long, the main menu screen lacks a help option to see the button mapping, perhaps allowing button mapping in the settings menu, an extras menu option for tracking stats, concept art, artifacts found, stats on how many kills, and achievements, aura recharge upon leveling, and perhaps a UI upgrade to have a transparent backing to make it look similar to the phones or screens as shown in the series.\n\nI’ve rambled on long enough.

Can't wait to see it expanded upon.\n\nIt definitely does have that RWBY feel, not just some cut and paste hack n slash with your favorite characters on the cover, it's a RWBY game through and through. The game is not without its issues, nothing game breaking, just a few tweaks to be made and it could be essentially perfect. Like I said, it's early access, with minimal issues this early in the game, and for the issues themselves to NOT be gamebreaking? It's simply fantastic.

Its a minor thing but i would like to look at the world.\n- more menu options. Just have a little more settings so we can remove shadows or lower the light graphics cause potatoe doesn't run flawless on meh P O S laptop.\n- smoother walking animations. This one might be difficult, i know how hard it is to please people with this and ive only made 1 game before and we never did get it right.\n- have our own reticle so we can aim. Just a small detail that doesn't matter.\n- add other team's like JNPR.

Starting out as a fan game, the main dev was contacted by Monty Oum less than 24 hours after launch, and it ended up being picked up by RoosterTeeth as an official game. And they have done a fantastic job. If you have any questions, I stream this game regularly at www.twitch.tv/victorsevengames and I would be happy to answer them.\n\nControls are tight. Movement neither feels too heavy nor too slidey and floaty. Combat is insanely fast. Think Devil May Cry on crack in a slightly Dynasty Warriors setting and X/Y combo relationship. Currently available are the four members of Team RWBY, each sporting their own strengths and weaknesses, and distinct play style.\n\nThe game feels a bit more like a demo than anything, showcasing the first four levels of the game, no story beyond Professor Port and Dr. Oobleck narrating your objectives. The levels include multiple sections which feel like Warframe style missions, from Exterminate sections to Defense sections before flowing to the next section.\n\nAll in all, one complete run through the current version of the game takes around an hour or so depending on how you play it. Even so, I still say it is well worth the $15, and a must-buy for any RWBY fan. Featuring all of the original voice actors (except Blake, whose actress hadn't recorded her lines yet at the time of release), there is some banter and funny quips during combat and certain sections of the game that make you smile in reminiscence of the show.\n\nI have bought 7 copies of this game so far for friends, and still have 2 left for giveaways because I KNOW whoever wins them will love this game.

I would say the next thing that should be focused on is Challenge saving. I've completed several challenges to unlock abilities such as Yang's Sunbreaker Mastery, and more. I was rather upset that after exiting the game, it does not save, and once I reopen the game and begin playing I must start anew. It's rather unfair and upsetting, especially for those who try to complete the challenges that involve killing 300 enemies a certain way. Once this is taken care of I will be very pleased that my progress won't be erased. After that's taken care of, I would love to see the characters combos develop more, and become sort of unique.

Meaning if you have not seen it, get on that RIGHT NOW. The game itself had a lot of thought put into it as each character has a different play style with its own strengths. Also, the combat is very solid as it is both fun and challenging at the same time. This helps point out a major part of this game: WORK TOGETHER. As this is still in early access, the levels are decently designed and the graphics of the game looks good, but the levels feel sort of empty or lacking life. Now this is a problem that will most likely be fixed as the developers actually finish the game. Also, it should be said that the game does run with very (I mean VERY) few glitches. Lastly the game can drop frames on ultra settings (or at least for me), even though my computer plays most games max settings, but other than than it is smooth.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game is fun. If you are a fan of the show, definately pick it up. It's tons of fun with friends and at $15 it's a decent price.Well, I actually see it as more of an investment, but the game already is very good. So, pick it up and slay some grimm. Just be wary of ultra settings, but other than that it's fine. Also I recommend a gamepad as it was more comfortable for me.\n\nFinal Rating\n8/10\nIt is fun and plays well, but lacks some content.

"Wow for a fan game this is really good! I wonder if RT will ever make an official version of this?" Little did I know at the time that would be a reality.\n\nOk, so trying my best not to be biased by my fandom, here's my take on the new Grimm Eclipse. It is clearly an early access game. Bits of it are a little rough around the edges, particuarly in the early levels, but that's to be expected. The important detail here is that it doesn't stop the game from being fun ... which it is very.\n\nThere were a few issues I noticed early on, such as the absence of a tutorial. Most of the controls are straightforward enough so it isnt too much of an issue, but it did mean that it took some awkward practice before I got the hang of it. In addition, one of Blakes lines in the first level sounds a bit odd, but she evens out later on. Ruby handles quite nicely and for the most part so do the other girls, but they could use a bit of tuning, particuarly Weiss. Her skills are expensive compared to Ruby's and not equivillantly powerful at low levels. That said, the melee combat is very fast paced and exciting once you get used to it. When it comes to ranged combat, you can tell it's definitely meant to be secondary. It can be somewhat difficult to aim from longer ranges, but that could easily be fixed with a small reticule or dot.\n\nI was a little worried about how RT was going to add elements of Left 4 Dead with characters as powerful as team RWBY since in L4D a lot of the fun comes from that feeling of being overwhelmed. However, i'm pleased to say they pulled it off, because team RWBY isnt up agaist just a few grimm, or even a bunch of grimm. Grimm eclipse boasts legitimate hoards of monsters while still maintaining a sense of sheer power with weapons like crescent rose.\n\nSo far the game looks great, in my opinion is reasonably priced (with the assumption that more content will be added later on kept in mind), and as an added bonus it ports fairly easily with wineskin, if you want to run it on a Mac. The game requires no additional tweaks to run. RT did a good job coding it. I look forward to seeing where they go with it.","December 1, 2015","true","17.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I didn't even think twice about grabbing this on day one of early access.\n\nEdit: I have now played through this about a dozen times. My opinions have not changed much.\n\nI am aware that this is (very) early access, and anyone reading this should keep that in mind as well.\n\nIt's very rough and very simple. The visuals are pretty good, but the gameplay needs some help. Anyone who loves RWBY will love playing through this game... once or twice.\n\nStory:\n\nErr, it's kinda there? I can't really judge it, becaues you only get to play three stages so far, and you only get a brief glimpse of it. Basically, you find some tech lying around that belongs to a company that was supposed to have gone under when a city got overrun by grimm, thus taking out their headquarters and whatnot.\n\nVisuals:\n\nThe art is fantastic. The characters are spot on and so are the grimm. For the most part, the particle effects from attacks and whatnot are pretty good too. Only issue I had is the shockwaves from some attacks look silly, since it's litterally a line of big, stone blocks flying through the air. But that's it.\n\nThe running animations are a bit weird though. I noticed that Weiss looks funny when she's "sprinting" because it's basically just her normal run animation, but sped up. Haven't taken a look at the other characters yet, but I get the feeling it'd be the same with them. Also, the running animations totally break when running downhill and you just start skiing...\n\nGameplay:\n\nAnd here's the important part. The gameplay is basically one big game of cat and mouse as you try to attack the enemies without getting smacked down. The enemies have no basic attacks. None. At all. This is what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most back when the demo was on the Rooster Teeth website.\n\nI hate this with a passion as it makes comboing enemies nearly impossible, especially when they gang up on you. With a little practice and liberal use of the dodge button, you can SOMETIMES get around this... but...\n\nWell, let me explain. Enemies will have a little "aggro" symbol pop up over their head. They will then use one of two special attacks. Each enemy has only two attacks, and they are invulnerable while using them. Yes, that's right, when even the wimpiest enemy uses an attack, you can't fight back. And there is no block button, only a dodge button.\n\nCreeps will burrow or do a backflip attack. The burrowing is annoying, as they disappear and then pop up beneath you, but whatever. It's what they do, and it's fairly easy to deal with. The backflip is a nightmare, as there is very little warning, and fighting a mob of them as they all take turns slapping you upside the head interupting your combo gets old fast. Fortunately, creeps are fragile and you can usually just dodge away and coem back from a safer angle... or just kill them all if you have enough energy for an AOE special.\n\nBeowolves are actually not too bad... in small numbers. They're great for beating on to build up a combo (combos restore energy as you build them up) but if there are three or more in one place, good luck doign that. They'll take turns using their little "fury swipes" special attack.  They are totally invulnerable for the duration of it, and since they have no other real attacks, they'll spam it until you or they die. If you try to focus one, another will hit you from behind... and so on and so forth. Your only hope is to use hit and run, or knock one free of the pack and chase it down.\n\nBoarbatusks are the worst. They have a "spin dash" they they use over and over again. You're supposed to dodge and then hit them while they're "vulnerable" as they "recover." Except there is no noticable cooldown on their dash. They use it repeatedly, consantly ending up well outside of your melee range, and they're immune to ranged attacks (they're armored) so you have to chase them down. And you can't really stunlock them, so they'll constantly be activating their invulnerability states. Killing them is just far too tedious.\n\nThen there's the Ursas who are actually pathetically easy to kill one-on-one. Attack, dodge, attack, dodge, and so on. They're very slow. But very powerful. They also have a ranged shockwave attack which makes keeping your distance from them actually LESS safe since they'll make trying to mop up the weaker enemies around them a nightmare. BUt good luck focusing one down while the hoard is at your back...\n\nTedious is the best way to describe the combat in this game.\n\nIt's actually more fun solo where the mobs are smaller, thus allowing you to more easily maneuver around and focus enemies down. The number of enemies or "difficulty" increases as more players join the game. Playing a character like Weiss and soloing the game was far more fun than playing Yang, who is great for crowd control (her ranged attack is an AOE shotgun blast which is fantastic), but still gets overwhelmed by the massive number of enemies in a four player game. You literally cannot attack fast enough to stop from just getting ganged up on and destroyed. Your aura, which protects your HP, will disappear in one or two hits, and then you can't take much more damage before you just go down.\n\nAnd there is no way to fight a crowd of enemies without getting hit. You try to tackle a group head on, without dodging, and you will lose. Every time. Hit and run is the only thing that works, but it gets boring and makes you feel far too weak.\n\n- - -\n\nI still had fun, and I'm gonna try each character once or twice, but the gameplay needs a ton of polishing. But that's why it's in early access. If you're a fan of RWBY, and you have the money, it's worth grabbing to support the franchise. But if you aren't a fan or RWBY, or are on a tight budget, I REALLY can't recommend the game in this state. Currently, the quality makes it worthwhile for super-fans only right now.\n\nSo yeah...\n\nRecommendation: Only for fans with money to blow. Otherwise, wait a while.\n\nWhat it needs?\n-More melee combos to spice up combat.\n-More durability for characters.\n-Less invulnerability/special attack spamming from enemies. (After playing a few more runs, I believe this even more.)\n\nPros:\n-Looks great\n-Combat sounds good\n-Fast paced\n-RWBY voice actors\n-Can be fun to experiment with how to get the most out of each character\n\nCons:\n-Tedious combat\n-Glitchy running animations\n-Subtitles are broken\n-SFX are overbearing and drown out voices even when voices are at max vol.\n-Invisible walls are ridiculously prevalent and in places that make little to no sense at times. Can be very annoying. You could call it "immersion breaking" if you'd like.\n-Story is shallow so far (if the story's pace doesn't pick up dramatically as the stages go on, this will remain a huge con.)","December 1, 2015","true","20.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I watched the show and the actresses do so much better in the show, I hope that the lines are re-recorded so that the acting sounds believable because I know they can act, also I think the actress for Blake was using a different mic because her voice sounded very low quality compared to the rest of the actors.\n\nThe game itself is visually appealing, however the models that you play as and fight against don't look like they belong there. The models look anime which is true to the show, but the maps look like an entire different art style. The best way I can describe it is think of the opening cutscene to Sonic '06 (for reference I love RWBY and am only making this comparison because I want this gme to succeed) where you have these final fantasy-esque graphics with detailed models and complicated lighting. And then Sahnich shows up looking totally out of place with a simple model and hardly any definition. I don't think this would be hard fix since your taking pixels OUT of the map textures.\n\nAnimations are nice but conflict with eachother animations when switching to a different task\n\nWhenever you stop moving the running animation continues for a second making movement very awkward.\n\nThe combat gets repetitive quick, some good ways to fix this would be to add finishers or making it so you can use enemies against themselves. For example what if you could lead one of those boar grimm into a hoard of beowulfs stunning all enemies who are hit. Add collaboration to your combos by using duos of characters in a team.\n\nThe game takes no effort into explaining the story of RWBY, leaving newcomers to the franchise confused and with a bad taste in their mouth\n\nFinal Verdict: This game is unfinished obviously. But I still think its worth picking up. Once RT adds more content and fixes all the glitches I think it will be very fun.

I think the game-play is decently fun and the story is alright. So when you read the rest of the review, keep in mind that I DO like your game, I just think that it could be improved in multiple ways.\n\n[If you are reading this to decide weather or not you want to buy it, stop here. The rest is for the developers.]\n\nMy major problems with this game revolve around how much so many parts of the game feel the same. After about the 10th time playing through the campaign I have almost completely memorized all of the encounters. My biggest suggestion to improve this feature is by potentially randomizing the spawn locations of the relics and boxes, and putting a small randomization in the spawn rates of the mobs that we will be fighting. Also, all of the characters feel, for the most part, the same. The abilities seem to be lined up like this: AoE Damage/Utility, high damage single target, long range damage. To improve on this you could potentially either make it so that each character has a truly unique move set, or give each character the option between 5 or more moves that they would simply chose 3 of. Another way to add customization and diversity is by allowing people to upgrade their character with bonuses to health/speed/skill damage/flat damage/ attacking speed/whatever you want (look at the mod system in Warframe to get a better idea of what I'm talking about[I'm not saying copy the whole system, just the general concept of mods and slots]). As for the basic attacks, I suggest looking up the game "Vindictus" and trying to implement an attack/combo system like they have for their characters. It doesn't have to be identical, but there is currently little point to doing anything other than spam left click with the occasional tap of shift to dodge or space to jump. Alternatively, you could take a note from, again, the game "Warframe" by implementing differences in the attack combos based off of movement or pauses in stead of right clicks. This might solve the repetitive nature of the current combat system and make the game a little more enjoyable, but that is not what I think the main problem of the game is. As far as I'm concerned, the main problem with this game appears to be intention.\n\nAs far as I can tell, your current intention with this game is to make a fun game for people to buy, play a few times, then drop. Decently fun, good deal, maybe pick up every so often to play with friends, but not anything truly amazing. THIS WOULD BE A TERRIBLE WASTE. This is a fact that I can not stress enough: this could be an amazing game that people will still be coming back to when RWBY is in season 10 (if the series has that many seasons), or potentially outlast the actual show! All you would have to do is follow a simple formula, and this game could go from an alright game that friends play every so often, to a game big enough to compete with AAA titles.\n\nIt may seem like this is to small of a game to ever grow to the sizes that I may have mentioned, but all you have to do is 1 simple*(not really that simple) thing: continue to release content. Add more campaigns, continue to release new characters(it's not like you have any shortage to chose from), add cosmetic options(either in sets or for individual slots like chest, boots, legs, head, weapon), and even survival modes. Another way to increase interest in this game is by introducing a competitive scene, by having endurance challenges and/or races in preset unique situations. The rewards could be in-game currency (I'll get to that in the next section), unique cosmetics, or even potentially real RWBY merchandise. Holiday events are also another way to get attention and returning players. If you continue to add content and host events, you will have people coming back to this game till the end of time.\n\nNow you may be currently thinking "aside from appeasing our fan after the complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T WE JUST PULLED IN THE LAST TWO EPISODES OF SEASON 3!" (*takes deep breath*) "Why would we do this? New content is expensive to produce and there no assurance we would get that much out of it." In reality you could make it quite profitable in one of two ways. The first of which I will call the "EA approach" and the second I will call the "Dangerous but Loved approach"\n\nThe EA approach is quite simple, and DLC is the name of the game. Just look at Payday 2, a very simple game (that is in my opinion isn't even that amazing) that has lasted far longer than it should have by a constant stream of frankly impressive DLC and developing content. You could release characters in team based packs or individually, payed cosmetics, and a billion different other things that people could buy for a (pleasepleaseplease) low price. The good part about this method, you will almost certainly make money off of each expansion you release. The down-side, people will hate you. You'll be accused you being money-grabbers and probably lose a good portion off players and fans. This is not the method I would personally suggest. Instead I would suggest...\n\nThe Dangerous but Loved approach. The idea is that you release all of your expansions and DLC free of charge. Any new content that could affect game-play you give to all your players completely free. Now hold on just one second before you call this method financial suicide, you still could make decent profit this way, but it would require a significantly larger amount of work. The idea is that you would pump out as much cosmetic DLC as feasibly possible. You could buy these cosmetics either with direct money transfers or an in-game currency that you purchase with real money. These cosmetics could easily be costumes (like previously mentioned), but you could also offer alternate skill effects, such as changing the color, but you could really do anything to just make them look different. You could introduce pets that don't actually do anything, just follow you around and look cute. I'm sure you can see the reason this is called the Dangerous but Loved approach, there is a significant risk of not making as much money as you may expect, but those who can't afford that much can still enjoy the game at a very low cost. While it may seem that you might not even break even with this payment model, I would suggest you look at Grinding Gears Games. They are a small game company that popped up only a few years ago, and is using almost this exact same model for an entirely free-to-play game. You could also take a not from their supporter pack by releasing time limited exclusive packs of cosmetics and real life merchandise. With your current fan base and the quality of the game as it is before you make any of my previously mentioned changes (if you do that is), I have no doubt that this game would be able to survive on this model.\n\nIn the end I just want to say that I am a huge fan of RWBY, both the animated series and the game. I think that this game could be amazing if you put the work into it. IF you put the work into it. As it is not and in the direction it's going, I think it will be an alright game that I definitely wouldn't pay more than 15 dollars for, but I just want you guys to know what this game COULD be, and hope you take this opportunity to make this the truly amazing game it could be.\n\nEdit: since I posted this I've noticed that the developers have made updates as to new combat systems being introduced soon and a new hoard/survival mode coming in soon. I'll have to wait untill they are released and then will update with what I think of them.","February 14","true","17.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have watched all of the episodes up to Volume 3 Chapter 6, and the movesets of each character is well made to fit their abilities. I like the 4 person multiplayer, but as this game is currently in Early Access, there are only 4 characters to choose from. Hopefully, Rooster Teeth will decide to add in other teams besides Team RWBY, such as JNPR (Jaune, Nora, Pyrrha, and Lie Ren), CFVY (Coco, Fox, Velvet, and Yatsuhashi), and maybe some others. I appreciate the Dynasty Warriors type gameplay, but I feel there should be a few more Grimm to fight, as it feels too easy. Again, because this is Early Access, there are only 4 levels, Emerald Forest Parts 1 and 2, Mountain Glenn, and Underground Mountain Glenn, but more are to come. The music composed for this game is good, but I wouldn't mind hearing some songs from the show. I feel this could be integrated if each character gets an exclusive special that uses up the entire bar, and then the game plays the character's theme song, such as Red Like Roses for Ruby, I Burn for Yang, Mirror Mirror for Weiss, and From Shadows for Blake. I would recommend this game to fans of this show, for people looking for a nice Dynasty Warriors like fighter, and for people who want to get into this show.","December 18, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some customization would be nice and I loooove the fact that it's the original voice actors with creating a new storyline. I know it's early access so looking up the controls is good and all but a tutorial for new players always helps. So far my impression of the game is that it's really good and has a lot of potential to further expand the RWBY universe.

Personally I did not experience many problems. Just occasional FPS lag and the running animation freezing. But seriously, you can deal with that.\nThis game is fun even in early access so you can only imagine the potential it has when it’s completed.\nThe game looks cool. It’s got a potato setting.
