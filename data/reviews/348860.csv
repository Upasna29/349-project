These developers didn't take the only review so far ...my original review found below, being negative and basically saying this game is too early in its development status to charge $30 USD.\n\n..These developers LISTENED to me... and to the other people in the community forums saying that this game is asking too much money for it's early state of development!\n\nI will leave my original review unchanged below just so that viewers can see my original first review based on this games original $29.99 USD price tag at it's early access launch.\n\nBut because of the developers listening to this only review so far... and the other posters on the forums here... I must say that I LOVE this kind of professional response so quick from them.\n\n..They didn't blame me for having an insufficient computer or blame the way I played their game.\n\n..They didn't make excuses of any kind.\n\n...They simply listened and dropped their price in half, and are offing refunds to anyone who purchased this game at it's original price tag for early access of $29.99 USD.\n\n....And for that reason, and because I do believe this game certainly shows a ton of potential... and also because I can see most users getting $15 USD worth of fun out of this game in its current state, then I am CHANGING my review from a negative to a positive review.  Obviously, changing the price doesn't fix the problems, bugs, or make the game itself any different.  But what it does do is shows me that this development team listens to feedback which is HUGE!  I do believe they will fix bugs and continue to give this game updates and make it better and better as well.\n\nIt is now worth it's asking price.  And it has developers who listen and react quickly to criticism rather then act like cocky jackazzes who make every excuse in the book (we've all seen too many developers like that, right?)\n\nThank you developers for listening.  And reactiving professionally.  You have my support now, and I will in turn play your game more, upload more videos, and share why "MyDream" is worth it's new asking price!\n\n....If only more developers were like this!  Other developers can and should learn from this!  :-)\n\n******************************************************************************************************\n\n---- EVERYTHING BELOW SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WAS BASED ON THIS GAMES INITIAL ASKING PRICE OF $29.99 USD AND BEFORE THEY SHOWED THEY CARE ABOUT LISTENING TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND REACTING QUICKLY AND PROFESSIONALLY.   THIS ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW WILL REMAIN UN-ALTERED, HOWEVER  WHAT I STATE ABOVE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS MOST RECENT REACTIONS FROM MYSELF ON THE VALUE OF THIS GAME, THANK YOU. ---\n-----------------------   ------------------------------   -------------------------\n\nWatch My Video Review At This Early Access Launch Here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92lNiAhKn28\n\nOkay, against my better judgement, I bought into this game.. another early access sandbox voxel world game at what seems like a hefty price.\n\nAfter 3 days, not a single review has come in for this game, and I decided to be the first one to buy it, play it, and give all of you out there my 'honest' thoughts and opinion as to whether this game is worth it right now.  The key words being "right now" as of February 23, 2015.  Things can change over time, and this game could be completely different and much more evolved in two or three months then it is right now, just three days after it's Steam early access launch.\n\nSo... is MyDream worth it's asking price?\n\nIn my opinion, as much as I want to like this game... my answer is a firm NO.  I think that answer would apply to most people who might be looking at this game with interest or curiosity.  For most people, I think there are better options out there for your money.\n\nMinecraft is cheaper right now and offers tons of player support, community add on, mods, texture packs and more available for free.\n\nCreativerse right now is $10 cheaper, will be free-to-play sometime in the next 6-8 months likely and I believe is much further evolved and more playable then is this game.\n\nIf creating quests and placing treasure and loot and monsters is what you are looking for, then please take a strong look at 'Fight The Dragon' at half the price of this games current asking price.  Fight The Dragon is much more complete and fun in my opinion then this game is currently.\n\nAll of the above options would be my recommended options for people looking at this game to consider first.  There of course are always exceptions to the rule.  I'm sure there are some people who love creating things that might easily get their moneys worth and be happy... but again.. I think that kinda person would be an exception rather then the typical onlooker curious about this game.  Most people will probably feel a little scorched for their dollar paying $30 for this game right NOW in the state it is in currently.\n\nRight now, there just isn't enough finished tools in the game, nor enough players actively playing or even on this game's own websites forums to support their asking price.  Again, this is only my opinion... and I really WANT to like this game and give it my thumbs up, but I just can't honestly do that now.  I will come back and re-review this game in four to six months and see how much has changed and if I feel differently at that time, but for now, I have to give this game a thumbs down.  (If it were half it's asking price now of $15 USD, then I would likely give it a pass, but $30 is just far too much for what you get now I believe)\n\nIf you are looking for specific reasons as to why I say "NO BUY" on this game now, please watch my video above, at the top of this review.  You should see many specific reasons in that video as to why I give this game a thumbs down review currently.\n\nI hope that my honest review here has helped save someone some money and more importantly saved them the disappointment I felt with this game at it's current early access state of development.\n\nSorry devs!  I DO see a ton of potential for this game... please keep up the hard work!  I'd love to be able to play this game in a few months and change my opinion around 180 degrees and become a supporter and lover of this game!\n\n\n- Zaxx","February 23, 2015","true","3.4"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","35","44","3","1"

There's a great deal of room for improvement but equally there's a great deal of room for potential as well. The Developers seem to have their heads screwed on and an idea of how they want this game to play out. At the time of this review it is in very Early Access with very limited content so I can only recommend this game to you if:\n\nYou are interested in the game, want to be part of the development process and want to support the Developers.\nOr\nIf you really like Construction games and want to build structures, buildings and landscapes (As this is the only fully implemented feature at this time).\n\n\n\n\nPros:\n+ Good graphics\n+ Good environments (Very primitive Procedural Generation at the moment)\n+ Great terrain mechanics (It's curved and not blocky like most other Sandbox games)\n+ Great building mechanics\n+ Large amount of building objects/decorations\n+ Decent background music\n+ Amazing concepts/ideas for the future of the game\n+ Reliable, helpful and responsive Developers\n\n\n\nCons:\n- Bad audio\n- Extremely low FOV (Subject to change soon)\n- - - Extremely Early Access\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information:\nThere's not a lot to do in this game at this moment in time, you can pretty much just build which is what the majority of the playerbase has been doing, if building is your thing then you'll have fun playing this. Unfortunately, due to it's very Early state I can only recommend this game if you like building or if you're willing to wait for future updates.\n\nThe graphics are fine, they could be better but they could be a lot worse - especially for an Early Access game so I'll let it slide on this.\n\nLook at this marvellous house I built!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Khrayfish/screenshot/538519528516368715\n\nThe original price was $30 but the developers listened to the feedback and decided to reduce the price of the game! It's good to see developers that care ☺\n\nUnfortunately that's about all I can say about this game at this moment in time, it's a very niche game so only buy it if you're absolutely sure you want to or if you like the direction and you want to support the developers.\n\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","April 8, 2015","true","6.7"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","22","28","2","5"

It's a game based around user-generated, story-driven voxelized worlds where just about anything goes, and this gives it a lot of potential.\n\nThe graphics are decent, although they're much better than that OTHER voxel-based sandbox game everyone enjoys. I'm playing on a laptop with an integrated graphics card, too, so I'm sure it's not running at the highest quality the Unity engine delivers. Audio quality is good, but I'm not much of a techno/electro fan.\n\nI had issues connecting to other worlds, in that I attempted to join four/five of the most popular worlds for at least five minutes each time and could never establish a connection (server problems? location issues?). So that could use some work. But the offline mode was fun; I made a little maze, and my girlfriend had fun exploring it. We've played Minecraft and Terraria together, and we both agreed that this is a nice step up from those games in both GUI and accessibility. I look forward to being able to connect to other worlds and play the stories/puzzles others have created.\n\nThe game is in early access, so I imagine any bugs will be fixed before the final release. It's shaping up to be a great game, however. I can see this taking off.","April 11","true","2.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I recieved the alpha, and even then I was impressed! The Gameplay is Surprisingly Refreshing For The Sandbox genre With A Calming And Mello Tone. If You Play Sandbox games For Building, Purchase This Game Now. If You Play For The Adventure I would Hold off For Their future Updates, The Developers Plan To Add Many Adventurous Features, But So Far Its All About The Building.  But What I Found Even More Impressive Than The Game Were The Developers Attitudes Towards The Consumers, I Would Ask About Glitches And A Few Hours Later they Would Respond, I would ask about computer preformance, they would respond, And Probably The best example of their Interaction with the consumers is when this game first came to steam with the steep price of 30 US Dollars. Thats Steep. I Wouldnt Pay 30 Dollars To Any Game Alpha Or Finished Without It Being fonamonal! And Mydream Just Isnt At The 30 Dollar Mark yet, But A Consumer Told Them This What Did They Do? They Refunded Half Of every Purchase of Their Game And Dropped The Price By half For The Rest of The Consumers! Amazing! This Game Is Now Worth Everypenny I Can Not Wait To See Where it Will Go, And How Close The Developers Will be With Their Players. if You Like Sandbox Games Stop Reading, And Purchase This Now.\n\n\nI Would Also Like To Say You Should Check Their Kickstarter Page To See Future Plans If You Are Still Unsure About This Game.

Right now its in Early Access Mode but you have a lot of content already.  You can play alone, offline or Online with friends and other players.\n\nFor my first time, I started to play it offline. You dont need to create an Account to play in that way, for Online Mode you need an Account.\n\nGame starts like other Building Games, you create a randome world, where you can build things you like. there are Walls, Windows, Doors, Plants, Stones, Signs and many more. I started to build a house and a temple, controlls are easy but a bit tricky on some parts but after a while you get used to it.\n\nThere are a few bugs and glitches but thats normal for EA, I didnt had bugs like freeze or crashes, but sometimes when adding a window on my house it rotated and I was not able to put it in the direction I liked or when you build a lot it starts to use too much Ram. Also a few items attacks you and you can die, so you have to be a bit carefull ^^\n\nGraphic loocks nice and soundtrack is greate.\n\nIf you love Building Games and you don`t have problems with Early Access Games (what means the game is not finished yet and can have a lot of bugs and glitches) buy it, you will enjoy it, else you can give it back if you don`t play more then 2 hours. So there is no risk at all.\n\nThis Game has a lot of potential and will hopefully be much better in the future, especially with the multiplayer.","April 13","true","6.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

I feel like there's tons of hidden potential in creating mini-games, maps, scenarios, or just overall fun interactive levels. It looks good on Unity (as always), and def a new take on the Voxel side of gaming. I don't know if I am creative enough to do anything crazy, but I would love to see other minds creating things.\n\nIt displeases me that the invert mouse setting does not work/apply. I didn't have any frame drops. I am unsure of what the 2nd tool was (laser gun?) and walking speeds is tremendously slow.\n\nCouldn't find water blocks when trying to create a world... could be me.\n\nThe main menu was fine, but the online menu after logging in was quite convaluted and could be reduced to please the eye more, or at least arranged in such a way that would not be overwhelming.\n\nI want to see a multiplayer community develop for this game. A lot of fun can come from this!\n\nReminds me of a voxel/unity version of Blockland (minus the explosive physics).","April 11","true","0.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

What you do in this is build. Primarily, that seems to be the goal of the game - to build, build, build your heart out and to set up your own little adventure games within the confines of the game mechanics. This sort of thing is my bread and butter and I LOOOOVE it. So these elements definitely elicited the, "Oh, Neat!" factor.\n\nMove like mollasses!\n\nMy biggest complaint comes in the speed at which you actually move around the game world. Jumping is fine, mouse movement speed is fine, but the actual walking/sprinting speeds are so incredibly slow that it feels like you're swimming in a river of mollasses. There's simply no get up and go, as there is in other games of this type. If other games run like a Ferrarri, this one moves like an 84 Buick Regal.  If the movement speed were turned up, it would vastly improve the playability of the game.\n\nGraphics are the strongest part of this game.\n\nGraphically this game is excellent, with a shiny-world sheen to everything that really sucks you in. The way the textures repeat and everything is simply divine - I didn't get eye fatigue from looking at the same stupid color palette the entire time I played it, and the cute-factor of the way simple things look is through the roof. Period, it's a really good looking game.\n\nI have to confess something...\n\nWhen I first started playing around with the game, and as I said my game playing time on Steam isn't accurate for some reason, I didn't see myself playing it for long. In the past couple of weeks, I've probably put about 6 hours total into the game. I'll probably multiply this by a factor of a dozen or so by the time I feel like moving on from it (That's not that many hours, I realize that, but consider that most games reach around 20 hours of play time for me and then get dropped off the planet because I don't feel like doing that much. There are only a few exceptions to this.)\n\nOther things that the devs could improve...\n\nOther than the pudding-swim movement speed, the devs would do well to try and improve the connection speed of the online options. Most of the time, I just give up because the load times are so incredibly long. Considering I have a connection speed of almost 200mbps, this isn't something that's on my end of the connection. They NEED to fix this sort of issue, or they'll be wasting a lot of potential on an amazing-looking game.\n\nAt the price, I'm going to recommend it without any hesitation. The problems it does have need to be fixed, but they seem relatively minor when you look at what the big picture. There really isn't much of a soundtrack to talk about, but if it had to be compared to something I would throw a Spore by Maxis vibe to it. This game is going to be great, and I can't wait to see where it goes.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","April 23","true","0.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This game mentions it is in Alpha currently from the store page, but from an hour of exploring the world and its tools there is a lot already available in terms of creating tools and options. So this game is definitely not lacking in its content and what you can do with the worlds you want to create. There's a lot to toy around with, especially with materials and crafting items.\n\nThere are some kinks still, as is to be expected from an Alpha. As I have justed started exploring, I feel as though there is a lack of community tools. However, there is already a large community building their own worlds that you can explore, which is quite interesting and really adds appeal to the game. With so much to explore, there's always new content to go back to, so this game holds more replay value than I could say for most games. With the price point this game is currently at, that is a lot of content for the price I would say.\n\nI am thrilled to join the community in this game, and can't wait to see where the game goes from here.","April 11","true","0.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Just want to be constructive and help both users and developers with the review.\nGameplay smooth, controls are fine, and easy to understand.\nTutorial... been unable to complete it, for now, tried it like 10 times and always got some rocks.. or an enire mountain in the middle, wich makes impossible to advance. The futher i've got at the tutorial is where you have to climb, and got a rock right above me, making it impossible.\n\nVisuals: 8/10 Seriously, for being an indie game, the textures and models are gorgeous.\nScreenshots of the game (minimum settings)\n\nNote about visuals: player model needs resize (or camera/collider check), from the camera POV the gloves and foot go under the terrain while looking down.\n\nPerformance: Well, this could be a bit of a negative point, regarding the suggested specs of the steam store page.\n\nDid many tests as of now about performance, and for very prop-crowded scenarios even with system specs like mine, got low fps (20 or below), else depending on the scenario/map, fps can be from 40 to 150(uncapped) at medium settings.\n\nPlease check my system specs at my Profile page\nWill be updating the review as i'm still trying the game and i'll keep playing and trying new things as they come to my mind.\nThe game looks promising, thumbs up, devs (read below, please)!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nSuggestions/bugs report:\nWhile in a world, when i do /help, i can't scroll up to see the entire list, remember that the people can always 'guess' some commands, but not them all.\n\nThe in-game (in a world) help button of the menu is not working.\n\nHigh-populated maps (regarding props, not players) are lacking optimisation, even with a high-end system are hard to manage. It could be also because of shaders or lightning but from what i saw ingame i would bet for prop's fult.\n\nTutorial Needs to be fixed, my suggestion for this would be that instead of 'randomly' generate the world for the tutorial, to set it on a flat map, at least for now as a quick fix.","April 11","true","3.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pavepode/recommended/348860/","pavepode","PashaMonster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pavepode/","1314 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMyDream is a 3D first-person god sim, where you start building from a scratch on a generated world and may create your own vision, with a mouse and keyboard, on how a fantasy world should look like, and what one would be able to do on it.\n\nFor the game you will need to create separate account on MyDream servers. Once you're done with that you will log into the main menu. From there I had a hard time finding tutorial- button, which I then found under the Question mark- menu. (Hint for the other new players!) I have to remind you that the game is still in Beta, so I didn't expect everything to work - just like the tutorial, which I wasn't able to finish since my way was blocked by rocky structure. Also I fell through the ground couple of times but teleporting back to the starting point fixed that.\n\nOnce you start creating your own world you get to decide your own world's name and layout. The given map is big enough for exploring and you are able to create your own quests for future world visitors. Think of this game as a Minecraft with graphical boost, plus the ability to create your own quests for others and yourself.\n\nBuilding structures (I- button opens the inventory) was hard but rewarding - I built some mazes which I then accidentally destroyed. I realised that the more you build the longer you will have to wait for the world to get loaded.\n\nMyDream has hours upon hours of structure building, terrain editing and quest creating - each world is an adventure of its own. However, I missed more sound effects and music inside the actual world, which would be awesome to be edited by the creator himself.\n\nJudgment\nIf you get bored you can always play piano sounds from 9 different piano tones.\n\nWorth the price for possible next-gen Minecraft. But not for the updates!\nPLUSSES AND MINUSES:\n\n- unfinishable tutorial\n- bugs and lags\n- no music inside worlds\n- hardly any players online\n\n+ many worlds\n+ create your own buildings, terrains and quests\n+ hours of planning and implementing\n+ greater graphics than just cubes compared to Minecraft\n\nGRAPHICS6SOUNDS EFFECTS3CONTROLS6MATERIAL RICHNESS8\nOVERALL RATE: 6","April 20","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although the game is in the early access phase, it is not lacking in content.\n\nMyDream is a great sandbox game where you can play alone or with friends online. To play online you need to make an account but you don't need to make it to play offline. Online you can visit other people's world and it is amazing. I had a lot of fun playing with others. Also, be careful visiting worlds because there are traps that will try to kill you like Stone Dark.\n\nThe game starts like others building games, you create a random world where you can build things you like.

I didn't had issues like freeze or crash during my gameplay.\n\nGraphics, environments and building mechanics are great and overall, the game is pretty good and has a lot of potential.\n\nIf you like sandbox games and want to build structures, buildings and landscapes you should definitely buy this game.","April 13","true","3.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You're able to create your own world or join any world created by other players and, well, build anything you want to. To be fair, there's still a long way to go before it will be finished and polished, but in the first 5 minutes of gameplay, you can clearly see the potential and how big this game might get in the near future.\n\nAdvantages\nGameplay is smooth and visibly optimized even for lower machines\nMusic is well made\nGraphics are not really up to date, but they're still very good and enjoyable\nTerraforming and building is really advanced and developed\nGame is formed by the online community, some of online levels were literally amazing, can't wait to see it grow\nContent of the game is very expanded, ton of things to build, create and even explore (price tag is 101% adequate)\nDesign of UI and menu overal is nice and clear\nDisadvantages\nLacks any introduction to some mechanics and tools. There is a tutorial, but it's pretty unclear and chaotic\nOnline levels really take their time to load, in a few cases I had to wait over 5 minutes for it to load up\nYou will encounter some bugs for sure, but the game is still in the early access so give it a chance and be patient - it's worth it!\nSummary\nMyDream is slowly shaping into an amazing game, I can already see how it becomes an awesome AAA title, but there's still alot of work to do in my opinion. For now, you can do almost anything you want to with your own world, shape it and build there almost anything you want to. I had fun with exploring it and creating quests in my own world, but the most fun I had when I wandered in some online worlds - things people can create in there are amazing, "players-driven" game is a great idea. I hope it will grow enough to meet dozens of players in there, it would be much more fun with others around, but unfortunately for now it's almost empty, I met only 1 player in one of the worlds. If you like any kind of games focused on building, you will instantly fall in love with MyDream for sure.\n\nPersonal score\n7.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","April 16","true","5.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

While exploring the world that you are in, you are able to build your own world with such a variety of tools and assets that are provided.\n\nGameplayMyDream is a open world sandbox that was released on the 20th Febuary 2015. The game is based around generated levels and has a voxelized sort of world which you can create your own thing with anything that you can think of. Whether you wanna play online or offline is up to you, if your playing online you will need to create a account. There is a fair amount of assests and materials that are with the game, walls, windows, doors, plants, signs, stones and so many more. If I would have to describe this game, it would be a mix between Lego worlds and Minecraft because of the open world and creativity with what you can build throughout the game. Although I didn't spend that much time on the online part of the game, it does seem that you can visit other players worlds and see what they have created as well. With the game having pretty much endless possibilities to build and explore. The game is still in Early Access so you are going to expect some bugs here and there as you play through the game. I'm sure that they will be patched through the next few patches and updates. The game has a kind of unfinished tutorial, which doesn't really explain how each of the blocks work and how to use them.\n\nThe graphics of this game exceeds to be another minecarft clone. The graphics are way more than just blocked graphics and basic assests that you can use to create your worlds. There is a range of different types of graphics for each of the blocks, with all of them being nicely detailed. The players look alright, but I feel like the sprites could be crisped up and polished a bit more.\n\nAs far as the sound effects go for this game, they really aren't all that good. They seem to be a bit unclear and not really the high quality sound effects you would expect for a game like this. Although the games strong point isn't it's audio, I hope that they will sharpen up on the audio and make this game better in the upcoming updates and patches of this game.\n\nPros+ Many assests and blocks to use to create whatever you want\n+ Online and Offline mode\n+ Exceeds from just blocked graphics\n\nCons- Some bugs here and there\n- Tutorial is unfinshed\n- Player sprites could be a bit more polished up\n- Sound effects could use some work\n\nResult / Final thoughtsWith this game being in early access, it does seem to have a decent and nice amount of content and blocks that you can use. There is a wide variety of sort of blocks and materials that you can use to create anything that you can think of. It's not another mincraft clone, I would say that this gam exceeds to being so much more than a minecarft clone when it comes to building. Although the game does need to work on some things, the tutorials, sound effects and some various bugs I still currently recommened this game.\n\nRating: 6.4/10","April 22","true","0.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I suggest you play this with a Quad core or you might not be able to enjoy this boundless world to the maximum.\nAs far as I know, the devs are working on a MyDreamVR Tower Defense mod which is currently in beta (they have experience with VR so I this sounds promising).\nAnother positive aspect of the game are the hundrets of items which you can use in order to create a world of your liking.\nYour world can be visit by others and of course you have access to all other community-made worlds.\nIn a nutshell, I recommend investing into this game's future development","April 15","true","4.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Do NOT buy this game. After playing Minecraft for quite some time, I thought to myself that I wanted to try something new. I found MyDream on Steam, and figured that I would give it a shot. When I start the game, I am being met with a title screen, having no sounds at all. On this title screen, there are two strange characters; waving their hands to you. Suddenly, one of the characters picks up a "magic" glove, and shoots the sh*t out of his other friend.\n\nPROS\n- Beautiful soundtrack playing (once you start the game).\n- Piano like sounds when you scroll through your inventory.\n- The skies are amazing.\n- A lot of content.\n\nCONS\n- The game spikes, no matter what resolution you put it to ( I have a beefy computer).\n- Mouse Sensitivity too high; no matter the settings.\n- Complex crafting system you don't even want to bother learn.\n- Not smooth at all. Almost like playing a Facebook game.\n- Graphics are basicly skyboxes, emitters and textured chunks.\n\nThe game is not cute or cozy. It looks more like a weird dream rather than anything enjoyable. Lack of understanding gives you a really painful chill down your spine. There were only three or four positive comments; no negative ones at all. That is also strange. Especially when the game has been stated to have been out for a full year, and it still looks like this? Its also stated that the developers are constantly working on bringing new content into it. Why would someone leave a game in this state for over a year, still working on it..?\n\nPlease.. Just. Go play Minecraft. Minecraft or Terraria.

Like normal ill be doing the pros and cons of this game :)\n\nPros\n-UI is nice and straightforward for this type of game\n-Has heaps of user content (4,000+ worlds)\n-Has heaps of items to be used/placed in each scenarios\n-User control on worlds which is handy if your trying to make a quest baced world\n-Nice and smooth terrain deformation\n\nCons\n-Framerate issues with worlds that contained alot of assests (however it juts might be my graphics card which is getting old 660m)\n-The game tutorial could be improved\n\nMydream is a good game to play with friends and muck around with but also has some serious potential for some really good story driven games :). So would i buy it yes you get alot of game for what you are paying for an can seriously see some people putting heaps of time into this game, In the end though its just a fun game to play\n\nBubbleeey :)","April 21","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This doesn't affect my opinion of the game in any way.*\n\n(This Review was written about version 0.90, so some of the flaws mentioned may have been ironed out at a later date)\n\nMyDream is definitely a game i can see having a lot of potential... if it stays afloat. It's an Open World Sandbox-Building game, not exactly dissimilar to Minecraft or it's many clones. In that regard, it does what it does well.\n\nThe building is fairly fluid, and fun. The interface can be a bit confusing to work with at first, but once you get adjusted to it, you can build some pretty impressive things. The Screenshots at the top of the page of those large, lavish structures? If you've got the time, it's not hard to do that sort of thing.\n\nThe controls are fairly intuitive. If you've ever played a similar game, then they'll make sense to you. If you've ever played Minecraft or anything similar, you'll adjust pretty quickly.\n\nGraphically, it looks really nice. My only major complaint is that the blocks/voxels you use to build with don't exactly... "match" the enviornments, but that's easy enough to overlook. The playermodels have the same issue, but again, it's easy enough to overlook.\n\nMy only major problem is the multiplayer. At the moment, there's a decent amount of multiplayer going on, so it's easy enough to find a server. In a year or so? I don't know. The game, while fun, doesn't really hold up long by yourself; once you've built something fairly impressive, there isn't much else to do at this point. If the game holds up, perhaps this worry won't be founded. Here's hoping it does.\n\nOverall, i quite like MyDream. It makes for a decent building experience, and it's honestly fun. I'd recommend it if you've got the spare cash, so long as you're creative and come into it knowing there isn't much else to it other than that.","April 20","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
