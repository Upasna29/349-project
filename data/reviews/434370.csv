And boy... this makes you think.\n\nThis truly is a gripping game, not so much a game but much like a novel or a game by TellTale (The Walking Dead). I went into this expecting it to be a flash game of some sort or a very poorly made game judging by the pictures I saw and the basic description given to it. And does the game prove me wrong.\n\nI don't want to give any details about what happens in the game for this review as it could lead to spoilers and I would rather leave it to you the reader (if any) to figure it all out for yourself. Most choices are based on curiousity and don't make much of a difference to the story but more the gameplay and flow. You won't know what's crucial until you've done it, and it's too late to turn back or start over.\n\nThe atmosphere the whole game is bone chilling, you physically feel cold while playing it, and your mind thinks hard about what you would do in a situation like this. I was on edge from the moment my character woke up and the first set of dialogue ran across the screen.\n\nSome could say this is an indie version of a Telltale game which I can agree with... but it easily matches it for how good and thrilling this sci-fi adventure is! This should never go on sale, as it is DEFINITELY worth the $3 as it has plenty of replayability!\n\nIf you enjoy adventures and like to push reality a little bit in your imagination... buy this.\n\n\nTopic: Text-Based Sci-fi Adventure\n\n\nReplayabilityGreatPrice TagGreatWith friends?Not recommendedAge groupTeens & AdultsDevsHelpful & Responsive\n\nSingleplayer9Story10Characters9Gameplay9Controls10Graphics10Sound10Text-Based10Sci-fi10Adventure9\n*Curator's pick for STORY*\n*Curator's pick for SOUND*\n*Curator's pick for SCI-FI*\n\nScore: 96/100\n\nThanks for reading!

But as a story it still has a way to go, and some of the issues are so integral as to likely prohibit repair. Still, for the most part not a bad way to spend three hours. (Due to offline play, I can only estimate game time at over three hours. There is a LOT of text. I found this to be both a plus and a minus, as you will see.)\n\nThe premise of “Buried: An Interactive Story” (BAIS) is that you are the boss of a logging crew who very suddenly finds that he and his crew are the victims of a mysterious and unknown disaster deep in the forest. You find your way into an underground government facility, where things really start to go bad. The story/game is broken into 5 chapters, each chapter is further broken into small segments, allowing for pauses.\n\nThe story of BAIS is pretty basic Lovecraft-like, and not particularly original. Saying that, I would also say that the mood generated is adequately creepy, with a story that feels both complete and real, in the context of this type of game. If the idea was simply to create a great story, this would fail. But since the point is to create an interactive story, it succeeds quite well, with the storyline leading not to more story so much as more decisions. The purpose is simply to drive the player to the next choice, and the choices really stand out (at least for the first three chapters.) The choices really are often quite difficult to make, as they almost always involve other characters for which you feel a genuine sense of responsibility. Some choices are simply to move the story along, and give the feeling that the response would have varied little based on the decision made, if at all. Some choices are significant, as you are notified once your choice is final. At the close of each chapter the player is notified of the statistics involving each significant choice among existing players.\n\nUNFORTUNATELY, once the fourth of five chapters of BAIS is reached, the choices do next to nothing for the story and are rarely significant. In virtually every case it’s a simple choice of “noble choice” versus “selfish choice”, and shallow beyond belief considering the depth of many choices offered in the first three chapters. I chose “noble” (this IS fiction), so I have no knowledge of how other choices would have played out. About his point, the complexity of the game that was such a strong feature to begin…..comes crashing down. In numerous cases the story feels unconnected, and one death as related in the story was absolutely NOT the death that had occurred in “my” story. While there were many pluses to the first half of the story, I was quite happy when it finally came to a grinding halt.\n\nGreat attention was paid to the grammar in BAIS, which was much appreciated. I only found one case of a typo, one of a sentence that made little sense linguistically, and one case of “I” instead of “me”. While there were numerous cases of commas improperly used (or absent), they were by no means dealbreakers. The minor background sounds added much, as did the background stills and the choice of typeface. The feature of leaving the game with a simple ESC, then returning regardless of the position within a chapter segment was very welcome.\n\nWhile I wish BAIS had either been shorter and cheaper, or long with more attention paid, it was still acceptable. Still, I would recommend waiting for a sale price of no more than $1.50 US.\n\nBUY ON SALE ONLY.\n\nThank you.","February 12","true","3.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It is not really a game, in the traditional sense, but an interactive story. Do not go into this expecting traditional gameplay found in most titles as you're bound to be really, really annoyed. It's not even like a point and click adventure. You have no control over your character's movement, just some decisions that he makes throughout the 2-3h story.\n\nWithout ruining too much of the story, this is a sci-fi text-based adventure that takes place in the woods of Kentucky. The story is narrated on screen via text, an eerie/haunting soundtrack and evocative imagery. I highly recommend that you play this game in the dark, both literally and figuratively. Knowing anything about the story in any form would ruin the thrill completely, and for this purpose I'm not going to go into detail here.\n\nThe bottom line is - don't go into this expecting more than what you see in the title. It is just that - and it does what it does remarkably well.","January 25","true","8.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The visuals are minimal but effective, the sound is spooky and immersive, and the writing is simplistic and a tad underwhelming but gets the job done. No great shakes, and fairly short (a few hours, tops), but worth the three bucks if you're up for a moody and sometimes action-packed tale with a wee bit of interactivity. It won't be an earth-shattering experience for anyone who's read the odd horror/sci-fi short story - or played a certain famous video game franchise, which I won't mention the name of for spoiler reasons! - but it's an entertaining enough diversion for those of us with an unquenchable taste for the eerie and enigmatic.\n\nOh, and for those greatly concerned with such things: it would also appear to have some small degree of replayability due to the variety of choices on offer, even if one suspects that most if not all of the story's main mysteries are revealed in a single playthrough. But hey, what do you expect for three bucks? A blow-job AND a marriage contract?! C'mon, let's be realistic here...\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","May 30","true","2.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Definitely a game if you like to read and are ready for about 3 hours of sci-fi, suspense, terror, and all around mind-boggling decision-making during crucial plot points. However, if you're not into reading and music/photos don't really create an effective ambiance for you, I'd suggest moving along. I'm very impressed with the detail that went into the writing and how much effort the developers clearly put into making this game. So congrats to them on a job well-done. I will definitely be recommending this one to all my friends! Worth more than $3.00, in my opinion.","May 27","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has been a while i was so evolved with the story of a game.\nThe text is easy and good to follow, choises are clear and all have they'r results on what will happen.\nIf you liked Telltale games then you will adore this. It is heavilly inspired by it and 1 thing that shows it is that at each chapter you get a little menu that shows how many % of what players made what choise.\n*random example* 36% of the players desided not to inspect ______ body.\n\nTo give you a idea.\n\nDo i recomend it? Yes. Totally. If you like atmospheric games and reading. Totally go for it!\n\n\n1 thing i have to confess is that they made the mistake of not making it feel YOU are there, dont get me wrong but they let you play as a 41 year old guy that owns a wood chopping company, if they gave the idea that it was you standing there and you could fill in names of friends then it truly is a masterpiece.\n\nMaybe just me but non the less it's great. i love it so far","January 28","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
