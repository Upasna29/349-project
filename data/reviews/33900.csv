I do, emphatically. I hope this anecdote from an in-game multiplayer experience I had will explain why. Prepare yourself for ARMA2: The Review: The Movie.\n\nSpring, 2011; early in my ARMA career, first tour of duty after a Steam Sale. I'm a fairly fresh recruit, seasoned with a couple dozen game-hours spent trudging through an expansive and swampy learning curve. Spent today at work, drove home, made dinner, cleaned up; it's Game-O'clock. Steam. ARMA2. Launch. Menu surfing, looking for multiplayer. Server browser hits my face with lists of information. -AWP-Warfare Capture the Island mode looks appealing tonight. Played it a couple times before, and I feel comfortable with the basics by now. Server connection established.\n\nClick! I'm in, filling the boots of a digital NATO badass. Apparently, international treaty organisations occasionally require the service of men with guns. Disturbing thought, but I'm no politician. I'm just a nobody with a rifle, taking orders that filter down the food chain. Those orders fill my mind now. Objective: town. Location: nearby...as the crow flies. Heh, the team's commander does have airborne technology unlocked, I just don't have the cash to buy a lift yet. Looks like I'm taking the scenic route. A quick check of my map tells me I'm at one of our hidden frontier bases and that there's two whole mountains between me and the nearby town. Great... I'll be taking the scenic route to the scenic route. The map tells me more: several of my team members and their A.I. controlled task forces are currently approaching the town. I'm already late for the party :(\n\nMight as well bring the fireworks.\n\nThe base I'm at has only an armour factory and infantry barracks, but both will well suit my rapidly forming battle plan. I'm thinking heavy calibre fire support from high ground, overlooking the town. The topographic information in the map shows that the road I'll be taking is nestled around a minor hill as it approaches the town. Perfect. I'll park two BMPs there and they'll provide overwatch of the whole area while my comrades finish their capture of the town. An LAV will ferry me and one squad of A.I. infantry to the combat zone. I spend the required funds and set the plan in action.\n\nWait a tick, BeatYourHeadIn, are you telling me you actually have to plan how you’re going to get your troops and equipment from point A to point B in ARMA2? Logistics in a game!? Yes, actual logistics...in a game with a map so FRIGGIN’ big you need to employ logistical planning skills to see any sort of success. And it's not boring!\n\nBack to the story. Formation of a military convoy. A few orders issued to my A.I. controlled task force later and the BMPs are on point while I lounge in the command chair of the LAV at the rear of the column. I man the turret-mounted automatic grenade launcher, a devastating weapon. Its barrel is ominously pointed at and tracking a lollygagging friendly player as my convoy departs base. Yeah, that's right chump, make one wrong move and I'll end you! Though itching to test the power of my new toy, I decide it's not worth getting banned over.  I let my teammate live, for now.\n\nThe A.I. drivers of my convoy are as dim as a new moon, but I can fine tune my plans and keep up with current events while they drive. It's an 10 to 15 minute (realtime) drive that negotiates a winding mountain pass through an elegant evergreen forest. These are backroads, unpaved; enemy forces unlikely to be using this route. I feel secure enough that I spend most of the trip looking at the map, reading topography, lanes of fire, positions of friendlies. I smile when I realize I could probably minimize ARMA2 and play a few rounds of Counterstrike while my convoy travels.\n\nDying immediately is certainly the last thing I'm worried about as I crest the peak of the second mountain.\n\nSuddenly: EXPLOSION..DEAFENING SOUND..FROM BEHIND..MASSIVE DETONATION..JESUS H. CHRIST WHERE IS THAT VOLUME KNOB! What is going on here!?\n\nMy turret pans to the rear of the LAV. The sight, what a sight...I'll never forget. Fire. Wall. 60? 70 feet tall? A wall. Of fire. Taller than the trees in the forest, literally FILLS my view from left to right. There is nothing in view except the fire. I'm in awe. Confused. Shaken. I've seen 'splosions in this game before, BUT NEVER LIKE THAT! Did somebody tried to nuke me FFS!? I know there's no nukes in this game mode, so...\n\nOver the cacophany of destruction: the scream of jet engines. Very close. As the flames die down, a large shape traverses the air over the crest of the crag. Airframe, Sukhoi configuration. Enemy. Wing tilted down slightly; canopy visible. I know he's surveying the carnage below him. Hunting me. Cursing his aim when he sees the LAV still intact. I feel small, molecule small; what I just witnessed was caused by his war machine. Napalm bombs. Heavy ordinance. Whatever it was, it dealt complete destruction to that forest.\n\nUnderstand this, readers: in this game, air superiority is a literal phrase. Air is SUPERIOR in this game. This isn't your Battlefield "oh look I can shoot a few rockets from my jet fighter and maybe kill one or two goofs on the ground and then reload (because reloading rockets on a flying jet makes a lot of sense) and kill a couple more goofs" experience. No! In ARMA your aircraft can have a payload of more than a hundred devastating rockets and you can fire 'em full auto like a machine gun and destroy an entire town worth of goofs on the ground if you wanted to. Ha! Forget about balance! This is the real life Shiznit. Modern air forces don't invest heavily in war planes because they're "balanced". They invest in them because they can kill a hell of a lot of people quickly! ARMA2 knows this. Simply put, the developers have a big Bohemian boner for air power.\n\nBut BeatYourHeadIn, what happened next? Tell us! Okay, I'll tell you. A miracle happened. My convoy survives the 'splosion to end all 'splosions. My battle plans go up in smoke like the forest around me. My current objective is to live through the next 30 seconds. The LAV is the only reason I'm still alive. It is damaged, but drivable. I order my drivers to haul ♥♥♥ in a forwardly direction. I track the Sukhoi as the convoy labours onward. The receding bogey performs a wide highspeed U-turn. He's heading straight for me again. Relentless much? He's the UPS guy we all wished was real: the one who comes back after he missed you the first time, instead of leaving a note telling you to pick up your package at the office near the airport!\n\nThen, from beyond the first mountain I had passed: a smoke trail racing skywards. Anti-aircraft missile! Ha! RETURN TO SENDER, A-HOLE! Two vectors intersect in a puff of smoke and light. Direct hit! Booyah! Wait, uh... he's still flying at me. HEY! HE'S STILL FLYING AT ME!\n\nWith black smoke billowing out of his engines, this topgun is still determined to deliver my severance package. Frantically, I order the BMPs to target the limping jet. Cannon rounds arc through the sky in attempt to smite the airborne menace. Sukhoi Dude is getting closer, but he's losing altitude. Fast. He's now descending below my level on the mountain, looking up at me through the trees as he approaches. None of the BMP fire connects, but it doesn't matter. THIS GOOSE IS COOKED BOYS! Relief. Now, his desperation salvo of rocket fire is way off-target; falls harmlessly some distance away. I watch him frantically yaw right and nose up as his fighter loses the last of its life-sustaining lift and plummets in a sideways cartwheel into the trees. The inferno he leaves behind is a feast for the eyes. There was nothing left but a dark crater.\nNow, I can start thinking about that town again...\n\nWhat, are you apes gonna dig him a grave!? We got our own mission to die for! Forward march!\n\nAll that's left to say is: play this game!","April 14, 2015","true","171.4"," 434 of 465 people (93%) found this review helpful 206 people found this review funny","93","434","465","206","11"

One last day. I run to the sarge. One last fight. I board the huey and we take off to the island of chernarus.\nWe land, and slowly crawl out and lay in the drenched bushes from the last nights rain. Our objective is to take out the target, a war lord that is helping out the OP-FOR take over the island. We move up to a shaded, half destroyed barnhouse that was obviously bombed a few days ago. We run upstairs, and sit at the side of the window so we don't get spotted out by a sniper. The quiet is too much, no distant battle noises at all, no vehicular action whatsoever. Just the sound of the metal from our rifles resting against the shattered glass window frame. "Delta-one, come in. We have spotted an enemy convoy heading to your position, possibility of the commander in one of the trucks, how copy? Over." "Good copy, over." "MEN, GO PUT YOURSELF AGAINST THOSE WINDOWS AND DEFEND THE HOUSE!" The sarge yells. I sprint over to the right side window and rest my M4 against the smashed out window. A silhouette of a tank comes over the horizon of the road. "Sarge, I see an armor coming over the horizon, over" I say. "Take cover and wait for my orders!" The sergeant barks at us. The rest of us wait for a few minutes as the sarge keeps peeking over my window, wondering how we are going to evade/take this convoy out with one M136 Rocket Launcher.\n\n\nThe sergeant peeks over again. "The convoy has stopped infront of the house, get ready boys, I think we have been spotted!" "АК Солдат! Перейти четкое наверху!" A russian voice from downstairs yells. We all point our weapons at the stairs, and we see a shadow emitting on the wall appearing to be walking up the stairs. "Get ready" Sarge whispers. The russian soldiers head pops over the stairs, we all start shooting our rifles at him. "ВРАГ пятнистый! --- Черт!" The soldier yells, one bullet hits his head and a mist of red blood flys from his head as he drops to the ground. "Dossy, go check the window!" The sarge demands, I look out the window and see a russian soldier wielding an rpg in his hand pointing up at the window. The rpg turns into a fireball coming closer and closer, and the whole top floor is leveled by the explosion.\n\nMy eyes open, to see the sarge, and the rest of the squad dead around me. My legs are broken but that doesn't stop me. I equip my rifle, load a magazine, aim through the sights and put my sights on a russian soldiers. I shoot him in the chest and he drops, still alive, he pulls out his makarov and shoots my shoulder. My hands shaky, I fire a few more bullets in his direction before manages to get a shot on my head.\n\n(Based on Multiplayer ACE Milsim I played.)","November 2, 2014","true","52.2"," 301 of 368 people (82%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","82","301","368","51","18"

Arrowhead is a different story. The game is still very alive, the issue with Arrowhead is the community is ruined. DayZ brought around some of the worst types of people. Before DayZ Griefers were very rare, now they are everywhere and the worst part is, they hack and destory servers and get accounts banned. The game in its current online state is poor, and that is sad, very sad, especially since I remember when it wasn't like this. Arma III is shaping up to be a much better game than what we currently have in Arma II, and the community seems to be holding together, more than likely because DayZ is now a standalone game. My gripes are more personal and subject to opinion though. Both Arrowhead and Arma II are amazing Military Simulators. The Singleplayer is realistic, and top notch. Nothing but the Original Operation Flashpoint can really stand up to it.\n\n9/10 - Both great titles, but I would recommend not buying them anymore and just purchasing Arma III until maybe the DayZ fad finally dies out.","March 22, 2014","true","46.5"," 151 of 188 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","151","188","2","11"

Hundreds of mods have been made for this game and each one making the experiance even greater. Another great thing about this game is the size of the maps. They are HUGE! The amount of vehicles and units is another big plus for this game.

I mostly enjoyed this game as a Combat Flight/Tank Sim to be honest, not to say the ground combat is bad - I just really enjoy the feel of flying a Helicopter/Riding an APC into combat with 2 or 3 friends inside. It's a hardcore fps experience that will leave you extremely frustrated and laughing your head off, Hours have literally flown by playing this game and messing with the editor. Definitely a step up from CoD, or other typical FPS games, if youre looking for something more elaborate, and you have the hardware to take advantage of this games huge maps, doin't hesitate to try it, although overwhelming at first, rewarding in the end. Great modding and mature community.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the game: Playing with friends requires ports to be adjusted, this game is not easy to play with friends, and you should do your research before getting excited about multiplayer. This game is also hard to optimize, again do your research!\n\nWould I buy at current asking price of 12.99?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rofldanger/recommended/33900/","rofldanger","Hamdip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rofldanger/","186 products in account","EDIT: I have changed key portions of this review due to fanboys freaking out over a difference of opinion. Let me clarify something; If you honestly enjoy this game despite its flaws and quirks, that is COMPLETELY fine. I'm glad you enjoy it, and I wish I did, but I simply do not. That's all it is. You're not an idiot for liking it, and I'm not an idiot for disliking it. Please, read the review, and consider it as someone else's point of view. It should not change your point of view if you enjoy this game. Thank you, and enjoy my review of Arma 2 :)\n\n\nI've have given this game many chances. I play it for a bit, than uninstall it, and then I reinstall it, thinking I may have missed something, seeing as a huge portion of people love this game.\n\nHowever, the more I try to play this game, the more I am mindblown this game is so popular. Let me elaborate a little.\n\nFirst off, I'm not knocking the games aesthetic appeal. It's a very good looking game for the most part. There are a few textures that look like they were made for a 90s PC mystery game, but overall, I am pretty impressed with the games looks, and how fast it runs.\n\nThat's not my complaint though. That little feature right there, is the ONLY thing this game has going for it. Once you get past the looks of the game, get ready for a mind bogglingly BAD control scheme, unusable menus, and possibly the worst voice acting and music you've ever heard in a game.\n\nLet's start with the music and voice acting. Good lord are these bad. The score sounds like it's from an old 80's Segal movie. It's trying SO hard to be badass, and it falls so short. I'm not saying it's BAD music in itself, but with scenarios they play it in, like WALKING ACROSS A DECK, they've decided that blaring rock solos so loud, to the point where you can't even hear character dialogue, is appropriate. Really? Why is that an issue? The music should never drown out dialogue in a game, especially when it's ambient background music. This should only happen if the music is LITERALLY happening from something in the environment, like a concert or something. Now along with audio, lets look at voice acting. Now, not ALL of it is bad, but the majority is pretty much something out of vampire diaries. I know most marines and soldiers are normal guys who all want to have a good time as much as anyone else, and use phrases like "bro" and "dude" like anyone else, but when those phrases are used in this game... Oh my god. It legitimately sounds like that ONE kid from school that tried way too hard to fit in. They emphasize "BRO" way too much. "Tell me about that new sweet house of yours, BRO." And if you read that with a 90's surfer accent, you'd be spot on.\n\nLet's move onto menus. This SHOULD have been something simple. However, I made an online game over LAN (so no one would join) and was simply trying to get the hang of the controls. First off, just trying to make the game, was a task in itself. WHY IS THERE NO SIMPLE MODE SELECT?! Instead, we get this rediculous list of unspecified random words. 1. FIRST OF WAR. WHAT IS THAT??? Is that a mode? Is that the campaign? What is that? A little description would be nice, but no, there's nothing else. Just a huge list of things like that. So I selected a random one, and I get the campaign. That's fine in itself, but I'll get back to this later. Let's move on for now.\n\nSo let's talk about controls. I have never, in my life played a game, that has the most backwards, rediculous, most roundabout way ever, to make controls for a shooter. Now, I'm no huge CoD fan at all. I've played a few, but I've never lost my crap over them or anything. They're mainly just "meh" games. But I'll tell you one thing; NEVER have I EVER complained about controls in a CoD game, or a BF game, or a Halo game, or just about ANY other shooter ever. Why change this scheme? I've looked at the controls, there's no reason to have them that way. Why can't MMB be the button for zooming with the scope? Guess what you use instead? THE "+" key! So NOW you're juggling between your mouse and your keys, and switching hands and WHY NOT JUST USE THE SAME CONTROLS THAT HAVE ALWAYS WORKED? So why not use the MMB to zoom the scope? Oh, I see why! Because it's being used to scroll the "ACTION WHEEL" so I can open a ♥♥♥♥ING door. No, you can't just click to open a door. You scroll to select the action, and THEN click to open. Mind you, this is how ANY action in the game works. If there's multiple things going on, like say, you're near a door, and a gun, and a person to talk to, you have to scroll through all this ♥♥♥♥, and pick the one you want AMIDST all the action going on. So have fun juggling with your scroll wheel on your mouse, while trying not to get shot. Why isn't "F" the action key you ask? Because THAT'S being used to switch weapons! WHY NOT THE NUMBER KEYS?? BECAUSE THOSE ARE BEING USED FOR RANDOM SQUAD DIALOGUE! ... "C" is crouch, which is fine, but for SOME reason this isn't a toggled crouch. You have to hit "X" to stand, and "z" to prone. WHY? Why get rid of these instincts that have been ingrained in our brain since the first Halo game? Why change something that works perfectly well? Why not HOLD "C" for a couple of seconds to prone, and just hit it again to stand?\n\nSo as the tutorial is teaching me this, and I think I'm getting the hang of it, and I continue to hear more robot people try to voice act, I finish the tutorial. Well you know how I'd selected the mission from the "create a game" menu before? Well instead of acting like a normal ♥♥♥♥ing game, and continuing to the next mission, it just repeats. WHAT? Why would I want to do that? Why not go to the next one? That's literally the most irritating and pointless system possible. This isn't Gallaga. I don't want to try and replay to get a higher score. I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME. So I try to quit the game, but hitting quit JUST RESTARTS THE ♥♥♥♥ING LEVEL. I had to ALT+TAB to minimize and then task manager that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. Then I figured since I'm doing all this crap, might as well uninstall it!\n\nI can't recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a game that plays well. If you can see past the broken controls, bad dialouge, a mediocre score, and unworkable menus, and truly enjoy what Arma is trying to be, then go right ahead, and game on. But for me, some one who is probably overly critical, I can't enjoy, or recommend this game.","December 26, 2014","false","1.4"," 118 of 189 people (62%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","62","118","189","17","55"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/finky45/recommended/33900/","finky45","Hylomane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/finky45/","116 products in account","I'm going to try and keep this simple and to the point. I am not much for words but I'll try to condense what I think about this game.\n\nPros:\n1. Huge potential. Large seamless maps. You can drive, fly or run across km after km. Towns, roads etc.. Basically entire detailed islands.\n2. Great military sim taking advantage of the above. Realistic damage from small arms as well as vehicle weapons.\n3. Lots of realistic military vehicles and aircraft. Even boats.\n4. Multiplayer is fun, especially coop.\n5. Speaking of multiplayer, Dayz mod is something special. Very fun and you can waste hours and hours in it.\n6. The single player story is alright, I guess. Nothing to tell mom about.\n\nCons:\n1. Bugs, glitches, more bugs. Absolutely unbearable, game breaking, punch your monitor and throw your computer out the window kind of bugs. Because you can only save 2 times per mission and the mission mught be very well broken before your first save and you won't know it until the end, which can take 1 hour or more if you take your time like me. All sorts of bugs. AI pathfinding drives your teammates vehicles off of cliffs. Mission scripts break and you can't complete the mission. You may fall through the floor and injure yourself badly or die (especially annoying in Dayz). I could write pages detailing the bugs, you get the idea.\n\n2. Second most annoying thing is the interface and the interaction system. You have to scroll through a list of actions to change your weapon, get in a vehicle or perform some other mundane function which shouldn't be that complicated. There's a key for everything and then some. It's very clunky, slow and prone to you pressing the wrong button or doing something unintended. Controling your squad mates and telling them where to go, what to attack is tedious at best.\n\n3. Clunky player movement? Even cars drive like crap and those are the easiest to control.\n\n4. Inaccurate helicopter controls. Don't even get me started, whatever you read on the net, trust me. The heli controls are bad and make no sense. I have no idea what they were thinking when they decided that the helicopter would start acting like and airplane above 50 mph. I can fly no problem in flight sims and the Battlefield series. I even fly RC in real life. This is innacurate, plain and simple.\n\n5. Devs had plenty of time to address these bugs/issues and this is a problem. What a bunch of underachievers. Their strategy is like this: For every new iteration/expansion, focus on adding more crap and complexity built on the same shoddy engine/interface and ignore all the bugs. Then collect money and develop the next uncooked iteration.\n\nArma2:OA isn't that much better, either. The missions bugs are fewer, but everything else is the same.\n\nThe bottom line: This is the kind of game you play because you know what to expect and you still want to play it because there isn't anything like it. You have to be a cult follower, or else you will hate it. The main reason you might get this is to play Dayz mod, which is great, but expect to be killed falling through floors, off ladders, killed by zombies walking through walls, etc... Definitely not for the casual gamer.","February 19, 2014","false","9.8"," 32 of 50 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","32","50","3","0"

Before playing this, I did not realize just how open world it truly is. The single player campign is fun, if a little glitchy, the coop is easy to start up, and the editor is easlily one of the best I have ever used. The graphics are impressive, even for a game thats a couple years old. The voice acting is odd in this game. Since there are so many different siturations you could be in, the audio bits are all cut up. It sounds very disjointed and almost funny, but you will get used to it quickly. One big drawback that needs to be talked about is the AI. It is simply disgusting. Your squad will almost never do as they are told, and can die very quickly. And scipted evens rarely tigger, so lots of reloading required. The draw distances inparticular are impressive. I have only played a few minutes of the mulitplayer, and it seems that it lacks direction, and could take a while for anything to happen. DayZ is fun, however is somewhat annoying. I would not buy ArmA just for Dayz. I have only had this game for about three days, and have already put 15 hours into it. If you have the patience to learn it, please buy this game, and love it like I have.\n\nPros:\n+Realism (Sometimes too realistic)\n+Graphics\n+Coop\n+Mod support\n+Map editior (But jesus is it confusing)\n\nNeutral:\n*Voice acting (You get used to it)\n\nNegitive:\n-Scipting errors (Waiting for hours for the AI to realize what they need to do)\n-Learning curve\n-AI\n\nOverall: 7/10 This game will appeal to only a select group of people. If you are on edge, probably dont get it, as you will most likely not like it. This requirers a ton of time to even begin to learn how to play it, and even then the game is broken a lot of the time. Yet somehow I found lots of enjoyment out of it. Dayz is very buggy and at this point just get the standalone if you want it so badly.","November 25, 2013","true","21.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

If you want to feel as close to a real war or shoot out as possible this is the game you want to play. The game vanilla isn't to bad but arma 2 is best with ACE or some other mods or custom missions.\n\nOnce you play Arma you understand what a mil sim or tacitcal game is and what it isn't. Run forward like an idiot and you die, hide and you die, look the wrong way and you die. Very little hand holding and its wonderful. Its a game that attempts to recreate a warzone while still retaining some fun.\n\nIf you buy Arma 2, pick up Operation Arrowhead with it because alot of mods like Dayz (I hate that garbage) require it or are better with it.\n\nHooking up with a nice milsim group and you will have alot of operating fun. The only disadvantage is that Arma 3 is out so 2 is on the way out. Even with only another freind or player or two Escape Chernarus is a wonderfull mission especially with ACE.\n\nGraphics, Gameplay, its all good and intuitive. AI can be very impressive with ACE, vanilla AI can be very cumbersome and slow though but once they do react it can be quite impressive. Though there are alot of glitches here and there one thing to remember is its a mil sim, not a driving simulator or what have you.","November 26, 2013","true","77.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Our Driver dies from a headshot and we crash into a rock(I call them the leg-Breakers.) So we all take cover and flank around behind the sniper and quickly gun him down.

The problem with this game is that it is being compared with battlefield and call of duty franchises. This is not a game, it is a SIMULATOR.

Yes. But you will have to seriously get used to it in order to enjoy it. Ok, Im not saying that this is a bad game. But it feels mostly unfinished.\n\nFirst off, the voice acting is horrendous. You know your FPS game is bad when you have some of the worst acting since Tactical Intervention. I still think Tactical Intervention's acting is worse, but this comes as a close 2nd. The game has super glitchy voice acting that feels like they just edited it all with Sony Vegas.\n\nAlso, when I was playing Scenarios on single player because I wanted to get the hang on Multiplayer, When you get shot at least twice or three times, you are down. I see what they are trying to do here, it is suppose to look very realistic which Bohemia does a very good job at it, but no one will help you no matter what. Even if you try to call for help by pressing 5 and clicking and choosing which one words you want to speak out, it doesn't matter, the AI is too stupid to do anything and even if all your teammates are down, they just keep doing what they want!\n\nAlso, When I first started playing, the Controls were so confusing. You had to do some stupid combinations by pressing SHIFT+U+L Or whatever which made it even more stupid. But after a few tutorials, you can easily get the hang of it. The Tutorials in the game don't even tell you which controls you have to use! You just have to be like "OH I FRIKN PRESS THIS AND THAT!"\n\nThe Graphics and sound are fine for the most part, the sound being the most impressive thing about this game as the gun shots are very realistic sounding.\n\nBut Overall, a huge disapointment. You know its a bad sign when watching gameplay of the game is better than playing it. So simulator fans and fps geeks will probably like this. But if you just want the DAYZ mod, just get the standalone version.\n\n56/100 C","April 26, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When i was still a newbie to the game, people helped me and were friendly, altho the game looked a bit weird and difficult to me I got used to it and is now my Favourite game. I do recommend this game for people who like challanges and are patient. The game also has many downloadable content from Mods, Maps, Weapons and Vehicles to Single and Multiplayer missions, Graphics, UI and character change options. As i said, i do recommend this game, its got its weak points and glitches, but there also are those awsome moments when you snipe a jet with a T-72 or a SMAW, or get a lucky headshot on a guy gunning on a UH-1Y Venom.","July 28, 2014","true","343.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Just like the real thing, the battles are drawn out, tactical, and a thinking mans game.   This game is not friendly to the run and gunning COD players, and that is what it's main draw is in my opinion.  Graphics are not bad for the time this was released, and when cranked up with view distance above 5000 it is quite stunning representation of ARMA maps.\n\nSingle player is quite lacking in my opinion,  but nobody should be buying this game for that reason.  The indepth mission editor and online multiplayer mods is what sells this game.   But you can have a good time learning the game in the campaign.  Thats about it tho...\n\nAll in all,  I recommend this game because I can enjoy a nice long battle, choose my involvement and position in  that battle, and not be a nervous wreck twitch shooting everything that moves....   From front level infantryman, to the pilot dropping players off at the front lines, everyone can find a place to be happy in multiplayer.\n\n","January 25, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Scope and Scale of it is just massive. No it's not like a run and gun CoD, or an Arcade Battlefield. The Trailer is a bit bad, but when you are playing a proper multiplayer mission, its just immersive. The Campaigns and scenarios have alot of content, and even then you have a huge editor to mess with in tons of different locations, easily 100s of sq KM big.\n\nThe Gameplay and controls can be quite clunky, but it's what makes it a tactical shooter, and a huge strategy game. It's really like playing those old school war strategys overhead, but as the units yourself.\n\nThe Graphics are still great for an old game, and you'll never have the feeling that its too dated to play. The realism features are amazing, with the gun ballistics and the vehicles.\n\nWhile it may have the hardcore, slow realistic look to it, it has its fair share of of epic moments, one of my favourite is how the buildings collapse and how when air vehicles crash they leave huge ruptures in the ground.\n\nDont buy it if you are looking for a quick shooty bang bang game, if you're willing to be patient and put the effort in its a very good game.","April 26, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Scope and Scale of it is just massive. No it's not like a run and gun CoD, or an Arcade Battlefield. The Trailer is a bit bad, but when you are playing a proper multiplayer mission, its just immersive. The Campaigns and scenarios have alot of content, and even then you have a huge editor to mess with in tons of different locations, easily 100s of sq KM big.\n\nThe Gameplay and controls can be quite clunky, but it's what makes it a tactical shooter, and a huge strategy game. It's really like playing those old school war strategys overhead, but as the units yourself.\n\nThe Graphics are still great for an old game, and you'll never have the feeling that its too dated to play. The realism features are amazing, with the gun ballistics and the vehicles.\n\nWhile it may have the hardcore, slow realistic look to it, it has its fair share of of epic moments, one of my favourite is how the buildings collapse and how when air vehicles crash they leave huge ruptures in the ground.\n\nDont buy it if you are looking for a quick shooty bang bang game, if you're willing to be patient and put the effort in its a very good game.","April 26, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you dont like one style of gameplay there are several other types that are completely different and have their own independant followings and a very robust community overall despite this game having been out for years already.  Your probably already aware there are several spinoff games that have been made after mods, and many people still prefer the original versions and still play them.\n\nPersonally right now i am going back with realism and sound effects mods (ace), a ai upgrade (asr), and some graphic upgrades (blastcore) and the game becomes a thing of beauty even just the normal campaign and i wish i had started off with some of these mods to begin with.

Has a great moding community that is really helpful.  Arma 2 has a campaign but dont bother with it.  Terrible is being generous.  This game is all about user generated scenerios, and those that you make yourself.  Its pretty easy and there are lots of tutorials.  I made numerous games, some fun and goofy, others serious and hard with bits of story for my friends and I to play.  Even scenarios can be different each time as you have a chance to appear option.  Between the base game and the expansion (A true expanson) as well as player made items and viechles I see no reason to play arma3 and its fake made up guns and veicles.\n\nFor those of you who think dayz is garbage, I agree with you only because this game engine could not be a worse match.  The reason the zombies do not work is arma has no melee mechanic and building fighting was not a priority for the AI.  In 7 days to die the zombies will literally rip your face off.  Dont judge base aram2 and ace mod on that.\n\nGetting off topic.  The game is old enough now that even the notorius CPU hungry arma engine should be easier to manage.  Also turn off motion blur.  I forget if it is an option or if you have to delete a file.  I remember it being a pain.  You will get sick, why games insist on putting blur in that my human eye will already produce for me by looking at the screen is beyond me.  It just amplifies it to a point where we would have gone extinct if thats how our eyes work.\n\nOverall if you want to make scenarios with massive engagements, scripts, or small ones in a huge map, then yea this is really the only game out there.","January 21, 2015","true","111.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

It's complex, and brutally unforgiving. Make a mistake, even a small one, and you will take the one or two bullets necessary to die. You will be fired at - very effectively - by enemies you can't see. You are probably not going to be casually taking down armored vehicles and helicopters while dismounted. The TUTORIAL can curbstomp you with vicious efficiency.\n\nLet me put it like this. "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow Of Chernobyl" is a cakewalk compared to this title.\n\nBut the game (if you can call it that) is beautiful. That is, it's beautifully crafted, with oceans of effort apparently invested in it being authentic. That authenticity - or what appears to be authenticity to a layman like me - is what makes the experience so lethal.\n\nAnd engaging.\n\nI barely scratched the surface of the game's content, even after putting in over 20 hours. I ended up quitting because I couldn't manage the difficulty curve, but my total experience was one of being very impressed. There's a lot to do, and a lot of freedom.\n\nI do dispute a review that says the game rewards patience. Sometimes it does, and sometimes it punishes your patience with devastating force. Then it punishes your impatience. Then it punishes your patience again. That's not a flaw. That's the nature of simulating war.\n\nThe flaws that I did find were mostly related to AI and event triggers. Sometimes, what I thought would happen after issuing a certain order or carrying out a certain task is not what ended up happening. I also found the "command" interface to be rather strange. I made it work a fair bit, but I never really got the hang of it.\n\nEven so, I feel that this piece of software is a masterwork, and worth experiencing if you want to try something different...and something so difficult that "Nintendo Hard" doesn't even begin to describe the ride.","December 10, 2014","true","21.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Fine, but I bought it for the single player, having enjoyed the OP Flashpoint series and similar. Holy hell, was I disappointed. The mission scripting is extremely buggy, involves a lot of just sitting and waiting (which may be realistic but is horrible design), the controls are horrible, the AI might as well be doing stuff completely at random and the voice acting is a complete disaster.\n\nSince the missions are so long the fact that the scripting is buggy is especially atrocious, since you may be left with no option other than to restart if you get stuck on an NPC that simply doesn't appear or an event that fails to trigger.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to finish the campaign or to try out any of the DLC, thankfully I only paid a very small sum for the whole lot.

It's fun to play with friends, is a good challenge, and is generally really fun. You can buy a Hummer, appoint your trusted friend as the cunning witty gunner, you can go on a nice roadtrip to the objective, and then watch as everyone you have in your car is shot to bits, as you're trembling behind the stering wheel, cowering for life. NExt thing you know, you're miles behind enemy lines, trying not to take an enemies gun where the sun doesn't shine. Then your cunning witty gunner is also a cunning witty pilot.... ok nevermind, he's dead now, but ♥♥♥♥ it.

Where do I begin? First off, let it be known that this game is NOT a 1st/3rd person shooter game, it's tagged a "Military Simulator" or "MilSim", for short, for obvious reasons. This game is designed to deliver a realistic warfare feel to it, complete with accurate ballistics, realistic gear loadouts, and over 40 weapons and vehicles. I paid for this game and all the expansions, forking out a pretty 40$, mainly for the DayZ mod, as Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead are required, the other expansions supposed to "improve graphics/animations", so after it sitting in my library for a couple years I felt inclined to try it. With that out of the way, time for the nitty gritty of this review.\nThe game spans over many miles (yes, literally MILES) of open country to explore throughout missions, including many cities, villages, farms, industrial complexes, hidden camps and castles, and the general rolling fields and foothills. Although, alot of this is just more "eyecandy/backdrop" than actual relevant terrain, as some of the missions only have you operating within specific areas. No worries, as when the missions open up for you, you are allowed to decide exactly how, when, and where you go about meeting and accomplishing your objectives. So, putting you in the boots of an experienced First Recon Marine Combat Vet, and allowing you to control his squad, drive Humvee's, or call in Helo-Extract at your leisure sounds tempting, correct? This is where the game is wrong. Firstly, if you've docked many hours in Call Of Duty, or Battlefield even, and for some reason think this game is gonna be along those same lines, then you're wrong. It's nothing like them. In more bad ways than good, I'm afraid. A vast majority of the voice acting is horrendous, im saying Marine's that havent hit puberty horrendous. Or how important character's voice over sounds like it was done over a phonecall, perhaps google translate even, and any character that is not in your squad has terrible or non-existant animations, standing like statues only moving their mouths to the occasional garble the spit up. Top it off with even worse AI and you got yourself a nice ♥♥♥♥-garbage cake. Try this, order your squad to pile into a Humvee, then order them to drive to a specific location, for me it was literally up the road 1/4 mile, in a straight line. Now proceed to witness them drive into anything and everything that was not in that straight line. Im talking hitting walls, buildings and other vehicles, while tring to backup continuously into the brick wall behind us, despite a simple order to move "forward". Ok then, them driving is a no go, let us try the Helo. Some missions allow support vehicles, such as Helo transport. Call it in, it flies to your position, you pick a drop off point, it flies there. No problem. Right? Wrong, again. In the middle of clearings, I've had the chopper refuse to land to get me and my squad, I've had it crash trying to take off, or drop us off, I've even had one of my squadmates run into the rear propellar and die instantly, when all I told him to do was get in. So far, so good I suppose. However, if you find yourself more perserverant than I, and want to continue to play this game, some advice should help;\n-Get used to not firing your gun throughout an entire mission. Only having 5 mags may seem daunting at first, but once you realize your squad is going to most likely see the enemy before you do, they're gonna shoot them (or try to at least) first.\n-Battlefield veterans can recall experiences when getting sniped from across the map was frustrating, but you'd just wait for a buddy in a chopper to rain down hot 5mm hell on them. For this game, imagine every damn enemy is a sniper. Most engagements for me and my squad involve us firing at enemy "positions", meaning "where we think they are", at an average of 150-300 meters away, or just shy of 1000 feet away. Thats about 10 football fields in distance.\n- game deletes your saves upon completion of a mission, meaning if it didnt quite go according to plan, which is alot of this game is planning, have fun restarting the mission.\n\n--PROS--\n\n-Good graphics\n-4 expansions\n-plenty of weapons/vehicles\n-weapon ballistics is fun to play with\n\n--CONS--\n\n-Terrible AI\n-Game saves deleted when mission ends\n-Horrendous voice acting (literally can't stress this enough, although kind of remedied from expansions)\n-Character animations are stiff, and poor overall.\n-perhaps too many controlls, not for everyone.\n","January 31, 2015","false","8.8"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"

Although I have heard much praise for the game I could never even get the base game to work correctly in co-op LAN.  Also the game runs slow as crap even on strong machines with dual GTX 560s.  I find the game overall to be a little too realistic if you are an actual Soldier (or have been in) in real life.  Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, and SWAT are all games that are pseudo-realistic and have both working multiplayer and fast-paced action that can be jumped into relatively quickly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brainwashguy/recommended/33900/","brainwashguy","Jefferson Davis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brainwashguy/","158 products in account","Okay, so maybe in the future I'll write a game for Operation Arrowhead but for now this is a review on Arma 2. Honestly, don't buy this game. This is a great game with dozens of hours to play and a lot of *fun* hours, something a lot of games don't do. There are an unbelievable amount of choices in singleplayer gameplay this game has, and all are really enjoyable. LOOK AT LAST PARAGRAPH FOR WHY TO NOT BUY IT.\n\nFor Arma 2's campaign, it isn't amazing, but it can be pretty fun. I really think the RPG elements they added were pretty cool, especially making this game's campaign less linear and more about random events, since that gives this game a lot of replayablility, along with like 4 different endings. The more short-term missions felt like a good scenario, but sometimes the long missions drag on a lot, adding unnecessary hours of just driving that isn't really fun. A good example is the mission "Razor Two", an unbelievably boring missions that takes like 3 extra hours (without a walkthrough) to get every piece of evidence and do everything. Too many of these missions have the evidence thing, and it's definitely rewarding at the end game, but when I realized what it did, I was really, really disappointed. It plays it out to be a huge thing that really affects the game, because I mean, collecting evidence of terrible war-crimes is a pretty big deal; unfortunately, it literally just gives you strong reinforcements so the last mission is easier, and that really made me feel like spending maybe an extra 5 hours on the campaign (and this campaign is short, the campaign is probably 15 hours if you don't search for evidence). Overall, this campaign isn't bad, but I don't think I'd recommend getting the game for it; it just isn't memorable.\n\nScenarios are an entirely different story. These are pretty fun, and there are a lot of them (I think 7 of them). They are essentially a short term burst of action and fun while including some decisions that aren't necessarily long term, but rewarding. They all vary in gameplay a good amount too, giving lots of choices for gameplay style and pace. There are even some that feel like a one-man first person RTS, which is really interesting, especially since it still maintains the feeling of a sim. Overall, I strongly recommend at least trying every scenario, they are really well made and fun to play, and just feel good.\n\nArmory and Editor are shorter in descriptions, but much more in content than Scenarios and the Harvest Red Campaign so I'll group them together. The interesting thing about Armory is it really feels more like just a thing to mess around with, experiment, and get a feel for the weapons, but it can be much more than that. There are little side missiosn that you get to do that put your weapon into actual realistic situations so you can imagine its usefulness on the battlefield, which is a pretty neat thing to add. I don't personally like editor, but for anyone who has fun making levels, this is really well done. It's pretty simple to use, and it doesn't take too long to make a detailed, fun, and good mission to try yourself. Also, you can download other people's missions to judge them yourself, which can be really fun. While I don't think these are as good as the main stuff for singleplayer, but these are just fun little things to tinker with while you're bored.\n\nThis doesn't really sound like I dislike this game, and I don't, I think it's amazing, but it isn't worth buying, which is really unfortunate. It really comes down to the fact that Operation Arrowhead has every single thing that I described and like 50 more hours for just singleplayer. Really, you shouldn't be buying this if you think this game looks cool, and should instead buy OA instead. This game had multiplayer removed recently (which is a huge problem, the multiplayer for this game is a lot of fun) and Operation Arrowhead actually gives not only another campaign, 7 more scenarios, and great multiplayer, it gives $8 DLCs with campaigns, scenarios, weapons, factions, and vehicles which are a ton of fun. So if you really want this game, buy OA and you'll experience what's so great about this series without spending money you didn't need to spend.","August 10, 2015","false","50.9"," 53 of 107 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","53","107","3","3"

Played the game itself, coming in with high expectations from the mod. Was extremely let down.\n\nThe soundtrack sounded like a generic, trying to sound badass and not half bad but not really good one.\n\nThe voice acting through the entire thing felt extremely fake, and the radio callouts (while a cool idea) were cobbled together in a way that just ruined any sense of immersion.\n\nThe backstory is rather sketchy. It certainly isn't bad but it isn't anything new or unique.\n\nThe weaponry? Grade A. Shooting things was a pleasure in this game, and that *is* what FPS games are for after all.\n\nThe map? Awesome. Well designed, huge, and one of very few maps that realistically fills the area.\n\nAs far as the most important bits go, this game did a great job. If there was a way to play through the campaign deaf without being completely ripped from the story and also missing half the stuff you're supposed to be doing, I'd have done that and I'd have loved this game.

It instead caters to players who want a realistic military shooter. And realistic it is. Before playing any game, the player must properly plan their course of action with their team members, or hell will break loose. This aspect of the game is extremely fun and engaging. It's when the mission actually begins, however, that the game becomes quite unsatisfactory.\n\nThe gameplay is, unfortunately,  like a three legged horse trying to win a horse race while suffering with diabetes and terminal cancer. The sad reality is that the game's graphics are not up to par with the 2008 standard I'm used to, and the actual firefights are extremely unsatisfactory. The movement, strange screen bobbling, and clunky guns don't sound good, and their damage and recoil is questionable at most times.\n\nTo make matters even worse, the interface is clunky and not easy to learn. Me and my friend were struggling to determine how to coordinate several missions. I'm all for a detailed interface, but make the options relevant in the game. Movement is even worse, and feels sadly completely broken. There are also a handful of glitches that I encountered such as falling through maps and colliding with enemy units and not being able to separate again. The AI suffers from strange glitches as well, and don't respond well to the terrain.\n\nThe worst part of the game is the voice acting. Oh god... it sounds like they hired Joe at the bakery to do the voice acting, and it really shows. I have always been a stern believer in that voice acting should only be done if you have qualified voice actors who can do that job. If not, just having text is NOT a bad thing at all.\n\nOverall, Arma 2 is not the realistic military shooter that you should choose. The only realistic thing you will find here is a damaged keyboard from anger issues.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcgravel/recommended/33900/","marcgravel","Kramit The Frog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcgravel/","235 products in account","Bought it for the DayZ mod, love it for the DayZ mod, the DayZ mod gets a thumbs up from me.\n\nOtherwise it's just too control complex to be fun, especially (plane) flight. The beauty of a PC game vs a console game (among a long list of things) is that controls don't have to be limited to roughly 12 buttons. But seriously.... you dont need to use all 116 keys and every part of the mouse for EACH control scheme (infantry, land vehicle, helicopter, multiple types of aircraft etc.) It's near impossible to fly without a joystick. imagine, if you will, the following:\n\nA + D = roll... Yep got it.\nW + S = pitch ...so far so good =)... now add\nQ + Z = trottle up and down... ok so it's hard to bank left and use throttle, I can handle that... but wait there's more!\nX + C = Yaw.. so now that you're trying to make fine adjustments to properly lead and strafe you need to completely forget you're throttle because you're trying to maintain your bank to match your're adversary. but wait... turning too hard makes you loose velocity.... so stop tuning with yaw, correct speed. return to yaw. But wait there's more!\n\nF = to select your weapons, which aren't quite clear what they even are at first, until you accidentally fire one of the 2 only missles, 2 bombs, or 300 bullets you have (which you can empty in 4-5 seconds.)\n\nBut wait! There's more! While you're trying to simply stay away from the ground and fumble in utter dumbfoundedness with you're weapons while trying to hit a peanut sized target with next to no ammo remaining, you moved you're mouse! Oops it controls pitch and roll too, at the same time as the keyboard! While trying to grasp all this at once you realise your landing gear is still down.... ok so now it's off the the scroll wheel menu (which is actually quite alien at first) to retract it. Now you're distracted for a few seconds from the incoming ground with your upside down aircraft seemingly resisting all your movements by about 25%. So on top of all this you now need to compensate for the resistance to your movement. Oh and remember to close/retract/lower your flaps. Whatever term the game uses is useless because you're scroll menu offers "flaps up" or 'flaps down". Am i lowering them from the top of the aircraft to close them? Or was it bring the flaps from the bottom up to retract them... Oh hey, there's a note on the top right of the screen, something about using TAB to acquire targets... Wait... there were instructions there.... that's ok I'll restart again.... *reading* Welcome to the tuto... *switch* times up! new message! In this excercise we will be going to *switch*. There is litterally a 5 line message that is on screen for less than a second.\n\nDid I mention this is only the boot camp?\n\nNow lets clear something up. I LOVE complex games. From ROTK to Total War to Crusader Kings II to Europa Univeralis. I enjoy a steep learning curve because the time invested usually nets a fantastic game that not every ♥♥♥♥♥ can just jump on to "pWn HiS n0oBzoRs" or whatever it is they do. I have over 14 hours of play simply in the tutorials. I have nearly given up on the main game. But I'm a stubborn type that will keep doing it till it's done. But most people will have given up ages ago, which is a bit of a shame. The game has a fantastic engine overall and is almost unerringly realistic. If the tutorial gets a very extensive tune-up I could see many more positive reviews. But too many people are kicked flat in the teeth with this (fun but) incredibly newbie unfriendly game.\n\nEnding on a positive note thought, glitches have been non-existant to me. So I don't know if I'm just missing them out of sheer dumb luck or they have been fixed by now.","November 26, 2015","false","43.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I say memorable because sadly the game is dead and gone, all that is left is the single player so lets get into that first. Now the start of the game throws you right into the night where positioning yourself is a critical moment, there are also back stories from the first game but i'm not getting into that because that would label this review as a spoiler. Now you control an african-american man named Cooper along with his squad mates. This story is the best ive heard of since Red Dead Redemption, and I gave that game a ten on metacritic. Now besides that this game is very VERY difficult, now i know what you're thinking: "This game has smart AI that shoots from tiny holes? Nope, not going to buy it". If you think that way then you're more than wrong, they use the general flanking and proning tactics that you've never EVER seen. Knowing your sorroundings is a very important lesson here. And besides going first person you can also go into third person to see you're sorroundings better. It also features a "leaning system" which is similar to Battlefield 4's and CoD: Ghosts leaning systems in multiplayer. The game also features different endings dependent on how you perform. The campaign took me about 6 - 8 hours to complete, but more so when you're looking for these hidden objectives. Now, lets talk about how the multiplayer was. It was FREAKING AWESOME!!! You have alot of different modes to choose from, do you want to go in with teamwork to neutralize AI enemies and seize the different towns and villages in the map? Or are you one of those resourceful and want to unleash your fury with tank combat PvP? Or would you cooperate with 3 of your friends in "Escape Chernarus" mode? Then multiplayer was for you. Sadly since the Gamespy shutdown the game's multiplayer is dead and gone (If you don''t count Operation Arrowhead). Now I specifically didnt purchase the game for its multi or story I actually bought it along with Combined Operations for the DayZ mod, but that is a game review for another day.\n\n\nRight now it deserves a 6/10 since it has only single player mode, ive heard talks about restoring the game's multiplayer but until that it needs this rating.\n\nNow, if Gamespy hadn't shutdown the game would've got a 10/10, and ive recommend it to ANYONE who thinks shooting galleries are beginning to get old.\n\nThis game had potential, until the final nail got into its coffin. However, if you realy want multiplayer then wait for a sale on this game along with Operation Arrowhead, Bohemia has restored the OA's multiplayer thanks to steam's multiplayer system.","December 31, 2014","true","93.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I absolutley love the teamwork that you must use in order to win battles. Not only that, but I love the vehicles, the roles you can play, and the aspect of reality. Even though this is a somewhat elder game, it is fun... like Counter Strike... exccept the fact that you don't rush in this game. You have players that cooperate and are nice while doing so (some people).\nThe only downsides to this game is the majority of people who play it, the glitches, DeSync, and hackers. Most of the people who are playing this game are annoyed by everyone and want them to shut up, little squeekers, hackers, and just flat out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The glitches are terrible in this game; one minute your driving over a bridge in a APC, then your tank does a summer sault and blows up. Not only glitches, but DeSync... if you think it's bad on another game... think again; even the AI DeSync along with players. And the last but not least are hackers. This is a main annoting thing about this game. Say if you're in a game coorperating very well with your team-mates, and you're drawing back then enemy and everything is going well, then suddenly you die along with everybody in your team and when you try to spawn and get a vehicle, that one person blows then all up, then after he/she's done doing that, they'll change you into either a hooker, rabbit, priest, old lady, boar, dog, etc. It get's quiet annoying when especially when atleast one game get's hacked everyday and this could happen 1 or 2 more times a day.\nDo I recommend this game for you? Yes and No (even though it says I recommend it)... you decide.","June 25, 2014","true","190.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you like FPS games but also a taste of realism, give Arma II. In my opinion, it is the best in the series, along with Operation Arrowhead. Arma II focuses on giant scale war, where the player works with friends or AI to capture towns in the map or patrol sections that are at risk from enemy control. When you come under gunfire, you better get down, because there are no indicators of where the shots are coming from, and you die easily. Buy weapons to keep an edge over the enemy, if they're firing from an overwatch position, bring a sniper, or an ACOG scope, if it's CQC buy an automatic rifle. The game is loads of fun playing with friends and if you understand and like the game it's hard to get bored easily.","January 5, 2014","true","11.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The same people play the same servers which allows you to make friendships which will help you on missions that will take you across the vast map. Controls are vast due to the necessity of realism.

I began with an intro scenario in which my compatriots and I were helicoptered in to an active battle zone, with the goal of moving about, shooting people, and holding territory. I played several other scenarios, and never gave the game the amount of effort or care needed to master it.\n\nFirst Impressions: This is a frightening game that alternates between somewhat boring movement, and extremely dangerous combat. Combat feels quite realistically dangerous, without any sort of health bar, or clear explanation of how injuries work. In my first firefight, I got lucky for a bit before taking a shot, and being brought down. I didn't die however, and spent some time waiting for first aid before returning to the fight. In other fights, I seemed to take injuries that caused me to bleed (at a hard to discern rate), die instantly, or be knocked down, presumably wounded. Not taking cover, or generally acting like an action hero/video game character were recipes for disaster and death. Additionally, combat tended to take place at such a long distance that it was difficult to tell where the enemy was firing from.\n\nMy highlight: I eventually realized that the map covered an area much larger than my immediate combat zone, and in one of the missions decided to steal a pickup truck and leave. This actually worked, and I managed to make my way out of the combat zone (after taking a little bit of fire, resulting in a broken window). I followed the main dirt road out of the village we were supposed to be sweeping, and found myself in another village. This, and all subsequent villages were devoid of life, presumably ghost-towns fled due to the war I was taking part in. I drove some 3 km through farm villages before hitting a paved main road. From there, I drove through woods and mountains to the coast (stopping to swim in a pond). From the coast, I swam out to a small island and decided to end my 3 hour run as the unofficial lighthouse keeper of this empty country.\n\nMy verdict: This game works really well at what it's trying to do, but that isn't exactly to my taste. So, I do not regret picking it up, but I can't see myself playing beyond 3 hours. Next time I'll be covering the Day-Z mod.","April 3","false","3.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

But at least what you can do in it, and what's possible, is very wide-open and varied. Who knows, perhaps I'm just not one of the ones grabbed by it.

The best deal I could get at the time was $20 for everything, which seemed like a steal. However, It didn't run well on my computer at the time. Since getting a faster computer that could handle it, and playing ARMA2 itself fluidly, I realize that it's still not a terribly fun game. Keep in mind, it is first and foremost a Military Sim. That doesn't mean that, when it comes down to combat, the gunplay isn't well done. It is! It's difficult yet satisfying to actually make a kill. However, the game still doesn't feel well pollished. Even though the controls are supposed to feel more real than FPS-ey, they work exceedingly slowly. It just makes for a bore. And when I finally got DayZ up and running, it just keeps crashing on me.\nIf I had to suggest what to do, I'd say get the game DayZ, and if you really want a military sim, get ARMA3. It supposedly has fixed many of the glitches that this game has, as well as having extended content. This game ain't worth $20, even for each DLC and the free DayZ mod. It's worth your money to skip this and get better games. Sorry.","January 1, 2014","false","8.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Great Graphics, Great Detail, Great Land, and you get to fly planes and helicopter and drive tanks and cars and stuff like dat. i know battlefield has that but its not like Arma 2 you can zoom hip fire, you can zoom aim down sights, you can use a map and gps.  in all great game but its fall point is that it has many bugs with the multiplayer and the campagin isnt the best. i give it a 6/10 only because of its bugs.","December 28, 2013","true","38.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

It's hard to put it in words. The campaign is alright, and the scenarios are fun, but the multiplayer is what it must be like in real combat. It's not this Call of Duty ♥♥♥♥, it's watching planes scream over head and hearing tanks rolling by, not knowing where the enemy will be next. But the build your own mission, it's like coordinating an army, then fighting along side them. You feel a certain pride you get no where else as an A10 Warthog screams over head, dropping bombs on a target you marked. Or capturing an airfield with just you and your buddy.\nPros-\nPetty OK\nRealistic gunplay\nRealistic combat\nFun\nCons-\nClunky animations\nbad Voice Acting\nNeed a beastly PC\nSeriously, it's like Skyrim and Battlefield 3 combined. Can't even wait to see how friggin awesome Arma III is gonna be. Guys. Buy this. Or Arma 3\nSeriously, I can't even describe the feeling this game gives you. Remember, BUILD YOUR OWN MISSION. It's much more fun. And more badass. Link to a tutorial-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plzPQ5qfXWc\nWatch all the parts and youll figure it out. BUY THE GAME.

Unless you go onto some super professinal server where everyone is shouting orders into their mics, this game will end up being more silly then real. The in-game editor is where it all happens. While some people will waste months making super-realistic missions that are so detailed you'd think the devs made it, most others like myself just ♥♥♥♥ around in the editor. Spawn 100+ F-15's and hop into one. Spawn 100+ C-130's and watch them all crash into each other. Spawn as a cow. Spawn 200 soldiers. 100 US, 100 RU. Now, this game has intense detail and a HUGE map, so unless your machine is fairly good, you'll have a very laggy time. Their are countless things you can do to the files to make your game run faster, I mean, my "Machine" is a 2010 Toshiba laptop for Christ's sake and I can run it at about 35-45 FPS.","July 3, 2014","true","57.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you're going to buy it, try to watch a few let's plays beforehand and learn how the game works. Otherwise, you might wind up like me.\n\nIn my opinion, I really don't like this game. The interface is terrible, the game responds really slowly, the controls are bad, and it's impossible to get into. Above all that, the engine is complete crap. I don't know how to put it any other way than, "Playing this game feels like trying to steer a boat through molasses."\n\nIt's not that it runs poorly on my computer, either. It just feels slow and clunky, and that's why I find this game nearly unplayable. I had a few laughs in it's DayZ mod, but the thrill wears off quickly as you find that the same problems plaguing the base game are even worse in DayZ.","January 6","false","1.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The lack of instruction during the multiplayer, leaves me with about an hour of trying to figure out my controls. Also, during multiplayer I've spent a lot of it just driving to my objective and when I arrive there's no action and I'm left with another long trek to repeat the same process. Also, it's incredibly resource greedy. I'm getting a solid 24 fps and any given time, and the game still looks like doo-doo. And this is a computer that runs BF3 at around 100 fps. All in all, I can see why it is such a entising franchise, but personally I'm going to have to not recommend it. I'm glad I paid only $2.49 for it.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone willing with a somewhat higher than avergae intelligence to understand and learn all of the functions and elements of them game.

With it's clunky, overly complex controls, ARMA II might as well ship in-packaging with a Moog synthesizer to even begin to appreciate the sub-par gameplay experience this "simulator" has to offer.\n\nTo a certain extent, I can understand the appeal to hyper-realistic first person shooters, though, when you're required to hold your character's hand through the entire experience of firing his rifle, you might as well assist him in rubbing peanut butter on his testicles and beckoning his dog into the room with him. Then assisting him to pat the dog on it's head whilst you reassure him that his wife will never find out, and the dog won't remember.\n\nIf you love reading maps, playing typing games, or even cleaning your bathroom, GI Joe Simulator 2009 is the game for you.

They stretched the engine to the very limits, but it's just too old to do much with.\n\nAs for the gameplay, the engine is still holding the game back. Compared to modern gameplay (and even real military combat) it's really slowpaced and clunky to control. The shooting mechanics are pretty in-depth and fairly fun though, but you will often find yourself getting killed with little indication simply because of the failures of the engine. There is little feedback in this game; shooting someone causes no movement or any kind of indication of pain or disability, so it's incredibly hard to tell if you are hitting and doing any real damage some times until they fall down with the prone animation or the death animation. You almost immediately notice just how many work-arounds they had to implement to get the engine to do what they want, sort of like how Blizzard had to work around their old engine for WoW.\n\nAs for the simulation side of things: it's probably the best you'll ever get to a fun simulation of combat without playing those really cheesey and un-fun military simulators out there. The game can be as realistic as you want, since you have to set the rules for yourself. Want military-grade training and cooperation with a heavy dose of roleplay? You might be interested in ShackTac. Want to just mess around and have fun without much serious RP? There are tons of those, but I recommend getting friends to play with for this.\n\nOver all, the game is really showing its age even though it isn't that old. The technology wasn't ready for a game of this scale when it was released, and it shows, not to mention the really bad engine.\nBut despite these things, I think it's safe to say that this game is the most fun you can have in a cooperative video game. There is nothing like playing ACE with 3-7 friends on missions meant for 20-30 people. There is nothing like assaulting militia bases in Takistan with 3 of your best mates, going up against the odds well into the morning. There is no feeling similar to what you can get when you organize your close friends to all install ACE mod and playing it for the first time, helping eachother out of the ropes.\n\nI can't recommend this game to anyone anymore, as ARMA III is now here and there is no reason to play this game anymore since the mods have all been updated for the new game. But rest assured: this game will always have a place deep in my heart.\n\nI only have a few hours played here because there's no reason to launch ARMA II over Operation Arrowhead.","February 26, 2014","false","2.7"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

Multiplayer was once the main appeal, but now few people play online, and it was always very vulnerable to hacking. But there is still nothing quite like ARMA.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisaniceurl/recommended/33900/","thisisaniceurl","Ultralight Beam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisaniceurl/","315 products in account","This review is all done after initially playing about 5 hours of said game.\n\nI don't believe I have ever had a more confusing experience. I really wanted to like this game. It's extremely ambitious in design and looks pretty solid in areas. Modes such as Armory are relatively fun and grand in scope; however, playing the game is a frustrating experience.\n\nThe controls are very strange and do not come to the player easily. You have to fiddle around with it to get it to your liking, which is easier said than done. Think about most first person shooter games with their controls: now remove aspects of sensitivity and general feeling of control on the weapon. I had a problem on more than one occassion where I died because I could not aim at the enemy at all. After going through the control menu, I selected a lock-on control scheme. The only way I could manage to hit anything is with this mode, and I'm questioning if I am simply stupid or the game is too buggy. Another problem I have is picking up weapons; it's very slow, and causes certain games (DayZ) to be incredulously hard to play because you end up getting caught off guard trying to get a weapon that you can't aim anyway.\n\nThere are multiple views (third and first), and first person view is relatively hard on the eyes as the head bob on it is ridiculous (you can set it lower); I find myself more comfortable with the third person view, which gives a bigger picture anyway.\n\nThe worst thing I encountered in ArmA II (or any of its other games) is that it simply isn't fun. I never felt like anything was going to plan, that almost everything I did was hindered by the control. Perhaps if I had a controller, the game would respond better. Another big deal is the bugs within the game; they constantly appear, from minor ones as texture problems to really big bugs such as your helicopter flipping over randomly to kill you, lock the screen, and cause you to bring up task manager to get out of the game.\n\nThe frustration does not end there for me. I also wanted to get in on the DayZ Mod, which conveniently has a download on Steam. This download is not an updated version however, and is completely and utterly incompatible with 99% of online DayZ servers. So, you have to download a completely separate mod, DayZ Commander, to update all of your ArmA II games/DLC and also download updates to the DayZ mod, and then you can finally play a game. Great, right?\n\nWrong. Most servers seem to require something called "DayZ Epoch", another mod of a mod that you need to download. An extra 400mb on.\n\nSo you get that done, and you're ready. It's too bad that the mod has the exact same flaws as ArmA II that I listed above. I struggle to hit ANYTHING, and if I don't have a weapon, finding one while zombies attack you is next to impossible. The atmosphere is pretty cool, and the immersiveness is great, but it just doesn't seem to work at all for me.\n\nI do note here that the creators of ArmA II did not create the DayZ mod, but I have it here for reference due to the fact a great deal of players buy this game to play this mod.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not recommend this game; I dislike it for many reasons. If you feel like you can deal with a lot of frustration and can look past multiple issues within a game, then this is for you. I wanted to love this, as it offers a lot, but my experience with it has been bad and I wish it wasn't.\n\nWait until your friend gifts you this, or try it out before you spend your money. Don't regret buying a game you cannot refund.\n\nGraphics: 8/10 "Graphics are sound. Texture issues are common for me. Other than that, it is very good."\nGameplay: 4/10 "Lack of real control in weapons and in vehicles. Helicopters sometimes bug out and flip completely over, and one time caused my game to completely lock up for no apparent reason."\nOverall Fun: 3/10 "I tried desperately to have some semblance of fun in this game, but I barely got that. Armory mode is the most fun I had with this game, and it barely delivers."\n\nTotal Average: 5/10\n\nMy apologies to the developers, but this simply was not my cup of tea. If it were not for the hard to handle control scheme this would be much higher. Perhaps it's me that is stupid, but I don't believe so.\n\nEDIT 18/1/2014: I got a controller and attempted to play it to give it another chance, hoping something would be different. It was actually worse. Sensitivity and control is so bad, I literally either miss the target, accidentally hit one, or (and most of the time) get killed before I can manage to aim at a target. Don't even say  that "you're not giving it enough time" because I'm just so tired of the crap controls, annoyed at the constant bugs, frustrated with the lack of instruction, and I am just generally regretting this purchase.

I bought this game on sale (thankfully!) but I barely got past the tutorial.  Why?  Well, where do I begin?  Let's start with these few complaints:\n1) the objective markers on screen are not only very faint, but they are almost the same color as the background.  So it's REALLY hard to see where you are supposed to be headed.\n2) not only are the controls not very intuitive, but...\n3) the controls are also totally OVER-WHELMING (so many damn commands there aren't enough buttons on the keyboard...literally!  Commands need to be double-keyed -- for example: tap x to perform this action, double-tap x to perform this action, press and hold x to perform this action, etc, etc.)  It's ridiculous.\n4) graphics are mediocre; not terrible, but not definitely great either.\nI could list more complaints, but that would probably qualify this review as "a rant", so I'll spare you.  In any case, for this game I'll say: Don't waste your money.  Just my two cents...","December 2, 2013","false","0.4"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","9","25","0","0"

Character moves like he's got concrete for feet. Aiming does nothing. NPC enemies are psychic. Did i mention the ♥♥♥♥ing menus? And you have to do that under fire. And then slog ten miles. The UI literally tells you nothing about where to go. I like freedom in games. But no direction at all is worse than extreme linearity.\n\nGraphics look like something from 2000 even on highest settings. Characters phase through doors. People have no emotion. The facial animation can be out done by a sock puppet. Characters also have these horrfying souless eyes. Sound is just...bland.\n\nBack to the combat. Even on easy your character can barely take a wad of spit before the bones in his legs suddenly turn into powder. And good ♥♥♥♥ing luck getting an NPC medic to help, since he's off picking his nose with the barrel of his gun.\n\nSo no. Don't even bother. Call of Duty is at least entertaining for ten minutes.

It is open, it tries to be realistic, and in many ways it succeeds.  There are plausible scenarios, tons of weapons, interesting views and tactics.  But.  The UI is clunky, the controls are clunky the feel of the game itself is clunky and needlessly complex.  On top of these points, the dialogue and music are hardly compelling, in fact, they are like cheese on a soggy pizza.  Yes, it's technically pizza, and pizza is good, but this is some bad cheese.\n\nThe best part about Arma II is that you can mod Arma II.  You can add extra toppings to make the whole thing a little more palatable.  Can I recommend Arma II as a buy that is used to create a fun gaming experience?  Absolutely.  Can I recommend it as a stand-alone product?  Unlikely.  This review reflects Arma II as a standalone game, and as a standalone piece of software it gets a 6.8/10.

Kinda.\n\nAfter playing 114 minutes of Arma2 I realize now why I got it for $4 on a Steam sale.\n\nIt's so amazingly clunky and buggy it's almost impossible to hit anything. Felt like I was playing an alpha version. Not to mention the controls are so weird I don't even know where to begin. One of the few impressive things about this game is map and terrain size, as the game environments are massive. But besides that, the dialogue and interface for issuing commands to my team were barely functional since my team acts like drunken, glitched out morons that often caused me to fail objectives.\n\nThe graphics are total crap on default settings, and I was only able to play on maxed settings to see anything more than 3 feet infront of me. By default everything is like looking through someone else's glasses that make everything super blurry. I had to max everything out to see the textures clearly without any blurring. But what I saw looked more like they were intentionally blurry, and there's no way that can seriously be the way the game is intended to be played.\n\nMaybe there are other great things about this game, but I'm not willing to go that far yet since I have many more games to play on my list. Perhaps I'll revisit this game at a later date. But for now, I'm not going to wander into megaglitchland again for a while. Sorry for the negative review.\n\nArma II: 2.","November 23, 2014","false","1.9"," 3 of 24 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","3","24","0","1"

I bought this game 2 years ago, I played for 20 minutes and didn't touch it again for 6 months.  I tried again, put it down, didn't touch it again for 6-12 months.  I tried again, for several hours.  This is absolutely the most worst possible experience for an end user of a game on the planet.  They advertise it like a SIMULATION, but it lacks the simple user interface that more than 5 people on the planet will understand.  It's like the game devs said, hey, let's make a game that only .0002% of the population will spend more than 40 hours learning how to use the ♥♥♥♥ing interface, with a completely buggy tutorial system that takes hours to complete, the first mission.\n\nIt's like all of the developers and designers decided "hey, let's make a game that is completely un-like any other game that uses basic input/outpus from the end user, let's forget everything that everyone knows about user interface design, and completelty change it, so that, if you play the game, you will have to be a veteran, just to learn basic controls, that way if anyone complains, we can just call them NOOBS!"\n\nBECAUSE NOTHING IN THIS GUNDAM USER INTERFACE IS STANDARD.  Everything is custom for this game as if it was designed by one person without the help of asking other's advice on "hey, is this usable by a percentage of the population?".\n\nI'm pretty sure, this game was made by the programmers, and they completely forgot to hire or advise anyone from the public.  And I'm also pretty sure, that unless you spend 100 hours playing this game, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE PLAYING THIS GAME.\n\nIf you want a hardcore experience, that will require weeks and weeks of your time, just to learn to play the game, let alone have fun, then buy this game.\n\nIf you want a game, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, STAY FAR AWAY FROM IT AS POSSIBLE.  THIS IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE ON THE PLANET FOR A GAME!  This game should honestly be classified under the software category, as it has nothing to do with being a game.\n\nI went ahead and took the liberty of doing some research for the developers, as it appears, the owner of this franchise doesn't give a flying f***.

But here goes. To me this is an ageless game that is made by the player generated missions and the players you play with. This game DOES NOT support itself with Campaign, but thrives with the Editor, in which you have next to infinate possibilities and the Multiplayer, which is anything from Deathmatches to COOP strategic excapes from an island. Now, like many, I got this game for DayZ and have stayed for this incredible game. At this point, I have logged over 300 hours in ArmA2, and ArmA2: CO. And I am still having fun. This also serves as a great game for military piloting, but I feel like ArmA3 has surpassed in terms of realistic aerodynamics. Overall, definately worth it, and I will be coming back to this years in the future for a great bit of nastalgia.","June 1, 2014","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The variety of weapons is amazing, most of which are about as satisfing to fire as it can be in a video game.
