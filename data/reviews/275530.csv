Much closer to the original game, especially with the removal of the video borders.\n\nA few recommendations based on Zod Engine and the orignal to the devs:\n\n-Game pause needs to be improved, should pause within game while still allowing you to issue orders. Original game allowed in-game pause like this.\n-Multiplayer is really a must, you're on Steam, use their in-built matchmatching. Orignal game had multiplayer, Zod Engine has multiplayer, you should have multiplayer.\n-Consider 2-click scheme option for select unit and issue order.\n-Please improve the menus, still terrible.\n\n-------------------\nOriginal Posted on 4 Jul @ 6:07pm:\nLow resolution, terrible menus, no multiplayer, very awkward controls. I thought I'd support a classic I enjoyed, but honestly, just go on Google and type in Zod Engine to get a way better implentation for free, with multiplayer support, better controls, and even a linux release, and for some reason far better looking textures and full-screen high-res support.\n\nThe developers really lost a chance here because there is still a crowd for this game and they really blew it with this pathetic release. They couldn't do better than a free release.\n\nI want my money back, thanks for butchering my childhood!","July 4, 2014","false","0.5"," 380 of 480 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","380","480","0","25"

Non PC Users) but still has many of those bugs reported prior to August 2014 going back to release. Its controls are still clunky, we don't have a level editor or the Z95 missions, we still have stupid bugs like Toughs and Pyros not being able to destroy buildings. The pathfinding is still worse than the original and so forth.\n\nBut the devs have their game on the mobile market where they can make their money from impulse buys and people who don't care about the game beyond a 10 minute tap fest on their slates and won't moan too much about bugs and oddities.\n\nAll those promises to the PC users and the Steam Users have not been acted on, no patch ever materialised and the devs have been missing in (non-)action since August 2014.\n\nDon't buy this game, support the original and locate a legit copy on ebay or amazon or somewhere else, then use the WinXP/Vista/7 launcher to run it. You'll enjoy the game a whole lot more than you would with this shamble of a remake, plus you'll have the Z95 editor, mods and improved controls, all the things you won't get here.\n\nSupport this type of game by not buying this remake and going for the original.\n\nBuy the remake and you are only supporting cash grabbing devs who only seem to care about mobile compatibility and ride along on a string of broken promises and non-communication with the PC community.","September 30, 2015","false","3.4"," 86 of 91 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","86","91","2","0"

Is this true? is it hell! this is a complete lie.\n\nZ is one of my favorite childhood memories sitting down playing this after school with my big brother on our playstation 1. Back in the good old ays this game was absolutely great and it's the reason I got into strategy games. I'll be honest, I saw this game and instantly payed for it to try and re-live some of my youth and it is very similar to the way I remember it being (although I now hate my brother lol). The slight changes they've made to make it control better with the PC aren't all that great, it gives you a few tabs at the bottom to select all units of a certain type to save you dragging boxes around all your units (which I still did anyway). the game plays just how it used to and is a great blast from the past, however... is this a good port? no, not at all. the resolution is appauling in this day and age and to actually get the game working I had to mess around with my monitor to actually see anything. Personally I will put up with this just because I'm such a huge fan of this games and have great memories with it, but advising this to someone who wants to play a competant strategy game would be very difficult.\n\nSo on that that basis I can't recommend this game and am giving it a thumbs down. the game itself is great fun but it's severly let down by the amount of effort put in to making this run on a PC. Unless you're like me and played this when you were younger and just want to have a little bash on it without searching in your attic for your old console and disc then yeah it's not a huge price to pay, but I won't recommend it to anyone else unless they do some serious work into making it more PC friendly and if they do I will edit my review accordingly.\n\nthanks for reading x","July 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 126 of 176 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","126","176","0","10"

If they do, I will fix and update my review as well.\n\nWhile the original Bitmap Brothers game was fantastic, the new developer TickTock Games managed to butcher most aspects of the game they touched.\nI did not want to believe the negative reviews but unfortunately they are right.\nEven though the developers claimed they might fix some things and add the much needed multiplayer After the first 3 very minor updates there is still a long list of issues before this can be recommended.\n\nThey first made a mobile version and then just put it on Steam without any significant changes. This leads to several frustrating aspects, especially in all the controls and functions from the original game not working any more (repair stations etc.)\nThe language localization that was taken from the original game is good but everything they added is worse than Google Translate.\n\n>About the original game\nIn a time where RTS was mainly about first gathering resources and building a base, The Bitmap Brothers made something radically different. Instead of resources you capture the sectors of the map which have factories and facilities already on them - the only resources are time and the sectors you hold - the more you control, the faster your units are built and then send to destroy the enemy fort (by attacking it from afar or sneaking any unit through the front entrance to sabotage it). In the beginning of the match you will have to race your opponent to capture sectors or sometimes empty vehicles or artillery that are scattered across the the map. You can even try to snipe the driver out of vehicles and then capture them yourself.\nWith a simple gameplay and a set of about 15 units the game offered still amazing strategic possibilities.\n\nSo whether you are a fan of the 1995 MSDos classic or only just stumbled upon this: Do yourself a favor and look for the original open source remake Zod Engine (multiplayer) instead, because what TickTock has done to the game is not worthy of Commander Zod.","September 14, 2014","false","3.5"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","42","50","0","0"

The original Z was released in 1996 and became a cult hit for its twist on real time strategy.\nHowever, this here is not that game. It's the PC-port of the (2011) iOS-port of that game and it shows! You can even find the files for the iOS manual in the Steam folder and the tutorial still tells you to tap the screen.\n\nMuch of the original gameplay is still there and enthusiasts of classic real time strategy will find much to like here. The biggests downsides of the porting are however a less intuitive and more complicated control system (which can cost you seconds giving orders in comparison to the original) and a messy UI that fails to give you vital information quickly.\n\nWhile I still love the game itself it is a far inferior version to the original game.

The game itself is awesome. Bitmap Brothers did a great job on that 1996.\n\nSadly this is not a PC remake, but just a mobile platform port with all the limitations of a mobile platform... It just doesn't feel right to have an UI, designed for a Phone or a Tablet on a PC.\n\nHorrible controls for PC. AI bugs especially with path finding (worse than the ones in the original game). etc.\n\nThere are huge problems especially with Infantry Units' movement and firing. Also the Toughs' projectiles seem to be buggy compared to the original game.\nUnit AI is kind of weird. often Infantry Units get stuck near objects. When near enemy units often only one troop member attacks. The other ones are just walking around.\n\nCursor selection and utility needs some improvements. Especially with turret guns. Often you make a robot leave a defensive turret by accident.\nAlso you took away the possibility to make a rotating defensive turret keeping watch towards a direction of an approaching enemy, because you no longer can give an attack order out of the turrets range. This is taking away a lot of power from turrets. This was never a bug in the original game!\nIt was a good micro management feature!\n\nThe lack of a multiplayer is somehow disappointing. Even the original game had one in 1996(!).\n\nI know my review sounds harsh. But I am a software dev myself and I grew up with games like Z.\nDon't get me wrong. I think the idea to do a Z remake is great and I respect your attempt to do so. But a mobile platform port won't do the trick for a Z audience.\n\nIn Conclusion it is definetly a nice game to play on your smartphone or a tablet while being bored, travelling by train, sitting in a bus or something similar. But it's just not right for a PC experienced Z audience.\n\n\nIf you want to have the real Z feeling, get the original game and emulate it.\nOr even simpler, get the Zod Engine.

Games they produced already on Steam include The Chaos Engine and Speedball 2 HD. At the time they made very cool games that were both dark and comedic at the same time. This game sees you capturing territories with robots in jeeps and tanks whilst defending your fort. The animation is cute and it is actually quite challenging to get through the levels. There is only the story mode though and no multiplayer but it is still fun and stays true to the original. The way you move your troops reminds me of Cannon Fodder. This is where my my main criticism comes as they haven't moved with the times. Path Finding is not great and you have to click on each unit individually to move them, which leads to frustation when you notice them getting stuck on things as you are fighting on multiple fronts.

This Z looks right, but plays very wrong. As a result, it can't be recommended.\n\nZ was like the quintessential Real-Time Strategy game... You don't need to build structures or gather resources or such. Instead, you simply capture territories, and you get whatever factories that territory has, and those factories makes the units. There are different units: the grunts, the snipers, and they can capture vehicles, stationary guns, and so on.\n\nZ, when it launched, which was way back in 1996, was a revelation, proving that you don't need to make things too complicated for a fun RTS with bazillion build queues and unit trees and special abilitities, and whatnot. The main draw was the "AI"... If you run a unit next to an empty vehicle, it will "capture" that vehicle. If you put unit next to flag, it will capture the flag without prompting. This severely cuts down on the micro-management, freeing you to allocate the units and coordinate the attacks.\n\nWhile this game looks like Z, and feels like Z, it doesn't PLAY like Z. The units vary from smart (on the initial levels) to dumb<bleep>. On the early levels they do pick up grenades and vehicles and static guns  and flag automatically, but in later levels they simply stop doing so, when those objects are clearly in sensor radius.\n\nThe units also get separated easily (when you have a group of 3, they end up widely separated and impossible to cmmand). Inadvertant groups like accidentally grouping a tank and a couple infantry can't be separated, which often result in destruction of empty vehicles, when you clicked on infantry, then empty vehicle to capture it, only to see a vehicle also in the group open fire on the empty vehicle, destroying it.\n\nThe game also seem to have lost the ability to scroll with keyboard and/or use more than one mouse button at a time. In fact, this feels like (and probably is) a port of the MOBILE remake of Z, aka "Z Origins"\n\nAll in all, this REMAKE of a classic, is not the classic, but a pretender.","March 22, 2015","false","11.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","20","29","0","0"

Z eliminates most of the tedium that usually comes with RTS games, choosing to focus on tactics and management of assets. The gameplay is relatively straightforward. Each map is divided into territories, which the player must capture. Territories contain assets like factories and radar stations. The more territories a player controls, the more quickly their factories produce units. More powerful units require more time to construct. Players must marshal their forces and constantly keep them moving in order to succeed.\n\nI was very excited to see this classic title released on Steam, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the RTS genre, robots, and irreverent humor.","July 25, 2014","true","8.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I would highly recommend to buy this one on sale. Unfortunately, the user interface and menus do not hold the same nostalgia as the old one did.\n\nAlthough this "new" version of the game sort of kills the nostalgia for me, it still delivers the game I knew back in the day. The menu went from looking like a war game to a kids game (my biggest issue so far besides multiplayer missing). The cut scenes alone in the campaign make this game worth it. The cut scenes were outrageous back in the day and were using language not known to many. Getting yelled at by Zod constantly will bring players back to watch more scenes.\n\nThe actual gameplay consists of an RTS territory capture sort of game. Certain territories allow for buildings to be capture which produce either vehicles or units. Vehicles and sometimes gun turrets are by territory capture flags that definitely the player wants to get to first before the computer does. The more territory a player owns, the quicker their units build. The point of the game is to destroy the enemies fortress. These fortress themselves build units but are limited in what they can manufacture. They may add defensive turrets (gatling or rocket) to bolster defense. More manufacturing options open up as the player progresses. There are robot and vehicle type units. Some robot units include grunts, psychos (rapid weapon firing) and a sniper unit. Vehicle units range from jeeps, light tanks to heavy tanks. Some maps will have jeeps and tanks placed around certain territories. Robot units must enter these vehicles whereas a unit is manufactured to drive the vehicle at the depot. Buildings cannot be placed freely in this game!\n\nI would say buy on sale as it is an oldie and it's definitely worth the cutscenes (on sale may I add)!

It's not just unintuitive touchscreen controls that ruin the gameplay, but also the aforementioned buggy unit movement will certainly test your patience. The fact that the game is really, really slow just emphasizes this issue even more.\n\nAnd to be honest, the game itself isn't that great either. Nostalgia glasses off, the core concept is quite original for its time, and the artstyle really has a lot of charm, but when you think about it it's all about rushing early with initial units to get as many territories and abandoned vehicles as possible. The more territories you own, the quicker you produce units. There's little to no way of making a strategic comeback if one side owns way more territories than the other.\n\nPlus, the game is SO SLOW. Perhaps it's the increased FOV that makes it more noticeable, but it takes forever for units to move across the map. To the point you sometimes wonder whether they're moving at all. The irony is, it's also the shortest campaign I've ever played in an RTS, finished in about 3 hours.\n\nJust don't bother. Even if you enjoyed the original game you'll only end up annoyed by the terrble user interface and horrendous pathfinding issues.

Unfortunately I had to return it because my 486 pc couldn't run it.  Now 18 years later,  Z arrived on Steam platform for a sale promo under $6.  I decided to take a stab once more and see what I missed in this classic.  After a few hours of gameplay,  I'm sadden to wasted my money.\n\nThe AI in this game was infuriating to say the least.  I'm playing on Medium difficulty and had to retry multiple times to beat certain levels.  The computer AI cheats by have better "luck".  One time my lone heavy tank was dueling a lone enemy jeep and guess what?  My heavy tank's driver got sniped and the jeep came out victorious.  Another time I noticed the enemy light tanks shot twice as fast causing me to lose the battle which I shouldn't have.\n\nPathfinding for your units was horrible.  Instead of taking shortcuts,  they prefer to take long routes to their destinations.  Frequently, they often got stuck on obstacles such as white billboards, cliffs, and buildings. Sometimes they never follow your orders.  For example,  I ordered my toughs to blow up a factory but they couldn't comprehend.  The controls were awful as well.  Everytime you issue an order,  the selected unit get deselected.  Sometimes mouse clicks don't respond.\n\nLack of options didn't do the game any justice.  Changing the game speed and video resolution would have been nice.  Game speed felt running at a snail's pace.  The video resolution was probably defaulted at 640x480.  At the replay level on the main menu,  I can't seem to figure out how to play beyond level 5.\n\nAnother problem I had were the movie cutscenes.  Not only the visuals didn't age well,  the material wasn't humorous at all.  The story didn't make much sense either.  Most of the cutscenes were played the repeated same scened just with slightly altered dialogue or terrain.

A big problem appears if an infantry-unit is selected and you drag the cursor over a box of grenades to pick them up (or detonate it with a big mess, if the unit already has got grenades) because the mouse cursor doesn't show you if the infantry-unit will pick it up or detonate it (what normally destroys the infantry-unit also)\n\n-Placing a ground-mounted gun is very fiddly and not intuitive (I think because of the touchscreen conversion)\n\n-> NO MULTIPLAYER !!!\n\nConclusion:\nThe main negative aspects are huge control-problems and a missing multiplayer mode.

This could be a good thing and a bad thing.\n\nIt could be good, because original game was revolutionary in its time (I was kinda bored from c&c and warcraft battle) and still there is not a game like it. It is still fun to play, robots and their communication with you is hillarious. Bitmap Brothers take on RTS game is different and with this kinda gameplay you really have to think strategic to win every level.. Every decision is crucial and makes a different..\n\nIt could be bad, because I kinda feel tricked when developers don't add anything to this old games. They could at least work on cutscenes, make it hd or something.. They don't add any new thing to game play and it is kinda hard to play in high-res. Robots are too small and mouse arrow is too small to micro-manage everything. You have to select units everytime you need to give them orders. Menus are out of date and not very user-friendly. Also it would be great if you can select the level you want to play (like in red alert 3 or warcraft 3)\n\nIn conclusion, it is still a great game for the ones who played the original one. It has this nostalgic effect and you enjoy every part of it.. If you didn't play the original one but curious about this one, wait for a sale, so that you don't feel like they are trying to scam you.

I loved Z since I first played it on the PS1 ages ago and I still love it.\n\nBut this steam version is a bad port from mobile, missing a lot of functionality, still lacking multiplayer and there haven't been any updates in months. Also no word from the devs in months about wether they'll keep updating or not, but currently it looks like they abandoned it, only being interested in a cash-grab with a below average port and getting people nostalgic about this game to buy it.\n\nIf the devs actually come back and fix some issues, add more functionality (I mean the audio options amount to "music: on/off, sound: on/off", come on...) maybe even add multiplayer and/or level editor, I'll recommend this steam version.\n\nAs it stands, I would rather recommend you to find yourself an original copy of the PS1 or PC version, or look up DOSBox (or portable version of Z) or for possible multiplayer look up zodengine.\n\nEdit: The length of the game might also be of concern to some people. As it stands I have around 4-5 hours into the game and fully completed it. Of that, around one hour (maybe more) was spent idling in the menu, although I think it might not have correctly tracked my time, so maybe 1 hour was lost as well.\nAnyway, the game is rather short, unless you keep failing at the missions. (For some reason I beat every level on the first try, despite having quite some difficulty whenever I tried the older versions, a few years back, but maybe that's subjective).\nThe game lacks the extra missions that the former PC version has (I think they were in that version) and as mentioned above, neither level editor, nor multiplayer. So take into account that this game might only last you 3-8 hours or something along those lines, depending on how "good" you are at the game.","January 12, 2015","false","4.2"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

Simple touches like tanks obliterating basic infantry in one hit and lighter vehicles trying to avoid incoming fire on their own. A lot of little touches that still make this game playable today. The aggressive play style you need to adopt to capture territory is the cornerstone of more recent RTS games such as dawn of war and company of heroes. The lack of resource gathering in Z also deserves special mention, capturing territory also captures factories which churn out units after a certain amount of time elapses; this means you can concentrate on the fight rather than gathering minerals.\n","July 27, 2014","true","0.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Similar (if not identical) gameplay, same videos, sounds, music, levels, etc. Most reviews are brutally negative, and although some have good points, others are missing the target.\n\nControls: Yes, indeed, they are weird, but I got used to them very quickly. You select units with left-clik and give orders also left-clicking. When you give an order the unit is unselected but I think the original Z did that too (but not Zod Engine). Orders can also be general, so units will automatically attack, pick up grenades, etc. Right-clicking is used for dragging and creating complex units of different soldiers, vehicles, etc, like in many RTS games you use ctrl + number. It's not true, however, that they stick together forever. If you want to select a unit inside a "army" right click that unit, and then you can issue normal orders just to that unit. You can also click an icon in the botton of the screen (looks like two robots) and that will eliminate the complex unit.\n\nOh, if you want to attack the ground (to destroy a bridge, building or just shoot random animals) ctrl+left-click.\n\nImprovement: You should be able to pan with wasd or movement arrows. Also, although I don't have much of a problem with them, if you could change controls to be more like a normal RTS that would be an improvement.\n\nZon Engine: Many people have compared this game to the free version Zod Engine. ZE is amazing, but it's a multiplayer experience and is suited for that and for people who like tinkering. Playing with map_list & default_settings you can create almost a new game with your friends, but it's not an engine for new people to Z. In fact, I still don't know how to savegame in ZE (I think you can't) and the original videos aren't there. Heck, even if you lose, you go to the next map.\n\nIf you want multiplayer (and editing and tinkering) ZE is not only the best, it's the only alternative. However, if you want a single player experience similar (or identical) to the original game, this is pretty close.\n\nOther problems: (1) Language. Spanish doesn't work well. Sound is OK, but the menu is in some language I thought was italian but now I don't know if it even exists (easy- > fácil -> ¿Fécil?). Hints and descriptions seem to have been translated by a machine.\n\n(2) Better resolutions would be a welcoming improvement but I don't any problems about that and widescreen works well for me.\n\n(3) Very minor: Achievements. They are not good (build that unit, finish that level, etc.) but I guess Z doesn't have room for much improvement in that regard.\n\n(4) Editor: That would be amazing.\n\n(5) Expansion: ZE has the expansion, 11 new levels.","July 7, 2014","true","1.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

I've been looking all over for a fixed Z to play on Windows 7 etc. I grew up with this game so I really appreciates this! Thanks a lot! I have a few fixes/issues you may not have been able to fix yet. All units with explosive weapons aren't able to destroy those small animal houses. Instead they're trying to move next to it and gets stuck. Another issue is that sometimes when robots are trying to fight a gun especially, only one of them are shooting, the rest are just moving on the spot. Another is when you build something and you click on that building you'll have to click "Ok" to get that little window off. Last request/issue I can think of now is that you can't press "Space" to unmark a unit or check current action if there's one. You always have to target a unit or click on that little icon down the left corner to get to that action. I hope you'll look into it and find a way to fix it. At last I also have two questions.

One is just in time right back in the middle of the game. Trying hard to capture the sectors before the opponent will in order to get a little advance in production. You don't have to bother with the errection of buildings, but just have to capture those already on the map. They produce new units. They do it the faster the more sectors you own. There is nothing more satisfying than to capture an enemy sector just seconds before a new unit leaves the factory. On the other hand it's deeply frustraiting to loose a sector at that moment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/275530/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Z is a Real Time Strategy game from 1996, the same year that Diablo and Quake 1 came out, and the Steam release was not a “remastered” or HD version. You get the same game from almost 20 years ago. All the same, Z was never about the graphics, it’s about rapid blitzing to control the map in what is essentially a real time strategy capture the flag game.\n\nZ doesn’t really have a story in its campaign. The opening cut scene (all of them actually) is of 2 idiot robots piloting a small space ship around following the instructions of Commander Zod, who is sort of like a drill sergeant robot commanding the red colored army (the enemy is all blue robots).  The cut scenes don’t really have anything to do with the gameplay; they’re just there to add some comic relief between the levels since frantic blitzing can be stressful. In fact, the cut scenes actually repeat themselves several times throughout the campaign, with only minor differences such as background (snow, desert, etc.)\n\nIn each level, you and your computer controlled opponent start on opposite sides of a square map divided into a rough grid. Each grid has a flag and possibly some sort of unit production factory. When you touch the flag with any of your units, the grid block becomes yours and the factory automatically builds units for you one at a time. A very important note is that the more grid blocks you control, the faster units get produced. This means that you should always grab the flag, even if you can’t hold it, because during the short time you own it, all your other factories are producing slightly faster and your enemy is producing slightly slower. Also, if you manage to capture a flag right before the enemy’s unit is finished building, the unit will come out of the factory on your team, the build clock does not reset.\n\nTo win the game, you don’t actually need to control all the grid blocks, you just have to destroy the enemy fort, which is a very large factory on the opposite side of the map from you. Of course, if you control the whole map, you’ll be pumping out units fast enough to squash the enemy easily while they have to wait 10 minutes for a measly grunt unit. As for the types of units you can build, there are about 15 all in all, including some base defenses if you would rather turtle in your territories than go out capturing new ones. From my experience though, all you really need are light tanks and toughs (missile infantry).\n\nPros:\n+Nostalgia! I played this game close to 20 years ago and only ever got to try the shareware. I finally got the chance to finish it.\n+Some humor, not much, but it helps with the repetitive gameplay. The rapid deployment and almost total focus on offence prepared me for future games like Company of Heroes, where you need to attack, attack, attack.\n\nCons:\n-The game is damn old, and the graphics are terrible. It’s hard to tell the infantry units apart until you click on them and see the name. Also, the game seems to run at a flat 15 frames per second (just guessing).\n-Also related to the game’s age: The controls are clunky. Everything is controlled by the mouse left click button. The map scroll is very slow so if you need to move your vision around the map, you need to click on the mini-map or it will take forever.\n\nOverall, if you remember Z from the good old days and always wanted to play it, now’s your chance. The game has about 25 Steam achievements and they can all be very easily obtained in one “easy mode” play through. But if you have backlog and a list of games you’ve been wanting to try out, leave Z until later on your list.\n","April 16, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Carnagath/recommended/275530/","Carnagath","Carnagath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Carnagath/","374 products in account","This is a re-release of the classic RTS Z. The game has no base building. The way you build an army is by capturing territories, which control factories, and the factories automatically produce units on a timer. There are no different races either, it's pretty much a robot army civil war. The game is known for its tense pace and high difficulty. Finishing this game back in the day was something to really brag about in the schoolyard. You need to move fast and intelligently pick which units to send where and against what. Bunching up your entire army early in the game and just going from flag to flag will lead to certain defeat, so you need to split each squad, jeep and tank and choose which territories to grab first and how to proceed from there. This makes the gameplay feel very dynamic. Each map of the campaign plays very differently as well.\n\nThings to be aware of: There is no multiplayer, only a campaign (which is however very well designed). There is no skirmish mode. It runs on Win 7 just fine. They have not reworked the resolutions, so during gameplay 60% of your screen is covered by black bars. They have added difficulty selection, which was not there in the original version. Scrolling the map feels a bit sluggish and weird sometimes. The controls are right click to select units/group up units and left click to make them move/attack (might feel a bit confusing if you are used to Blizzard controls). You cannot rebind anything.\n\nConclusion: Z is considered a classic for a reason. It's a very tense and challenging strategy game which plays great even today. This is a reissue, not a remake, it works well on modern operating systems, but don't expect anything more. However, I think that for 5 euros it is definitely worth getting and playing through the campaign, so I will give it a thumbs up.","July 4, 2014","true","2.0"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","0"

It has good gameplay coupled with a sense of humour. I loved it when it came out and bought the Platinum edition way back in 1997. It cost $79.95 and came with Z X-tra, Z T-shirt, Z keyring, Z pin badge and a Z mouse mat. Good value in those days. I've just bought it on Steam for $5.59 and played through the first two missions and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This version is still a lot of fun and I don't really understand why so many people are complaning about it. I have a 27 inch monitor and the graphics look fine to me. I nearly didn't buy it because of the bad reviews here but I'm glad I listened to my inner self and bought it. It really doesn't play or look that bad considering how old it is. As for The Zod engine, sure it's free but I don't think it has been updated since 2011 and it doesn't have the humour that Z has. (I might be wrong about the Zod engine but I can't find any update after 2011). There is no multi player as on the original Z but the single player campaign is a blast, I always play it on the hard setting and it is very hard to beat some of the later levels.

Las unidades pueden capturar estas áreas, y en ellas hay edificios que nos permiten construir más tropas con las que poder superar a nuestro oponente. La velocidad de construcción de las unidades depende directamente del nº de territorios que controlemos, por lo que darse prisa y cubrir el máximo área posible (sin esparcirse demasiado para evitar dejar huecos en la defensa) es fundamental.\n\nYo ya había jugado al juego en su momento, y en general esta versión (una adaptación de un port de iOS según parece) es fiel al original, incluso añadiendo doblaje en castellano (desactivable, phew).\n\nDesgraciademente, esta versión ha introducido muchas cosas que resultan confusas y que, a menos que la memoria me falle, no estaban en el juego original, y creo que lo han roto, motivo de que mi review sea negativa:\n\n* Han optado por un HUD flotante, mostrándose por encima de la pantalla, en lugar del típico marco que tenía el clásico. Esto no tendría nada de malo si no fuese porque el minimapa ocupa tanto espacio en pantalla que los edificios y unidades en la zona inferior derecha de la pantalla quedan totalmente inutilizables a menos que ocultemos el minimapa. Error garrafal, se hubiese solucionado añadiendo un poco de borde fuera de la zona de juego para poder seguir haciendo scroll por ejemplo.\n* La IA de las unidades a pie está muy rota. No es sólo que se atasquen si la ruta es complicada (probablemente esto lo hiciesen también en el original), ¡es que la unidad líder de la patrulla ni siquiera dispara por muchas órdenes directas que le des! En un grupo de 3 unidades, sólo 2 dispararán, en un grupo de 2, sólo una, y si sólo queda una, pues adios muy buenas. Esto hace que los tiroteos con las unidades a pie sean una tómbola. Afortunadamente esto no sucede con los vehículos.\n* Sólo se usa un botón del ratón (por ser un port de ios), y por lo que he visto no hay manera de deseleccionar una unidad a menos que sea eligiendo a otra o dandole una orden (se deseleccionan tras darles una). Es posible que esto estuviese en el original, pero en cualquier caso esto ha provocado decenas de órdenes de atacar un edificio propio, cuando lo que quería era elegirlo para cambiar su producción.\n\nEn resumen, el juego sigue siendo tan original y frenético como siempre, y ha envejecido bien (excepto los videos), pero la adaptación/remasterización ha introducido errores que entorpecen la experiencia hasta el punto de romper el juego.","April 5, 2015","false","4.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/275530/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Z was initially released by the Bitmap Brothers in 1996, and overshadowed by the titans from 1995, Command & Conquer and WarCraft II. Back at that time, Real-time Strategy games were still trying to break new ground and each was trying to innovate in its own way. Which meant exciting games with their own spin on the formula... but still a lack of an established "great user interface/RTS controls".\n\nZ innovated with a map divided by areas to capture, and no base building. The unit factories are pre-determined on the territories, meaning that no two maps will play the same.\nAn usual RTS goes like this: gather ressources, build an army, conquer. In Z, the player has to start by quickly capturing territories and key vehicles around to provide the next reinforcements and establish dominance on the map, and be attentive to any hole in the enemy defenses. Some games can go very quickly with a Blitzkrieg leading to a snowballing advantage and victory within 5 minutes, while some games can lead to a standoff where both armies will have to build up some firepower.\n\nThe result is a very gripping and dynamic game, in which every single tactical decision counts. Without base building, the player is directly in the action.\n\nThere is not much of a story to talk about, but the atmosphere of the game is quite endearing with robots commenting on the action or talking to the player (also with each type of robot having their own AI, from stupid to clever, reflected in their in-game decisions), very nice and bright graphics, and many cutscenes.\n\nOverall, Z is a unique and fun RTS, that only suffers from controls that are a little bit outdated. The interface is not great, and it can make the player feel like the computer has the advantage to be able to be everywhere at once.\n\nHowever. As much as I like Z itself (and not the terrible sequel, Steel Soldiers), and being able to play it on modern systems with a high resolution, this port is technically bad and plagued with issues. The AI can be worse than the original with robots getting stuck in position (especially if a bridge is destroyed), the scroll speed is so slow that I ended up using only the minimap to navigate (WASD or arrow keys would have been my preference for movements in a specific area), the interface has not been improved (really a pain to scroll through all the available units that a factory can provide until choosing the one we want, there is no rally point for factories and no queue order whatsoever) and there are still the clunky old RTS controls that were so imperfect before StarCraft, the menus are terrible (don't forget to save when you start a mission, I was not able to scroll down in the mission select menu), there is no multiplayer (for multiplayer, check out the open source remake named Zod Engine). The only substantial addition, besides the resolution, is the possibility to select a difficulty level.\n\nI find that Z is a great game that would have deserved a better port, and controls more suited to modern standards.

The screen scrolls up and down very very slowly so the only way to jump around the view is by clicking the mini map. It was also void of any challenge, or fun for that matter. I completed three or four stages with almost no effort. I don't see why this is considered a cult classic. More like the half eaten chicken sandwich that the homeless guy finds in the dumpster and has for dinner along with a quarter of a can of pabst blue ribbon he finds in the alley but drinks anyway despite the risk of aids because he doesn't care because it was his raging alcoholism that lost him his job and family and put him in this position in the first place.","January 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biscuitdude/recommended/275530/","biscuitdude","BiscuitDude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biscuitdude/","473 products in account","Classic Z in all it's original fast-paced territory conquering glory...though not quite.\n\nWonky, bewildering, iOS inspired controls and interface seriously let it down. If a more robust, modern control scheme were implemented, at the very least, then I can give this a more enthusiatic recommendation.\n\nI'm fluctuating between recommending it and not. Z is one of those classic games worth experiencing. But...those controls, man. Those controls...\n\n***\n\nHowever! Since the recent update, Z is now more playable. Okay, so it's just an inversion of the existing control scheme, but at least it feels more familiar and not like playing twister with my fingers, being too used to modern mouse-mapping and all. Prattling aside, Z is an enjoyable game. Played it before? Play it again. Never played it? Check it out. You might just enjoy it.\n\nThe overall classic gameplay is still here; fast, relentless combat and territory control requiring you to be constantly alert. The moment you switch off is when it all goes wrong. Even the music tells you so! Whether battering your foe to smithereens or suffering sustained losses, the music adjusts tone and tempo. The only other game that immediately comes to mind with contextual music cues based on how you're doing is Red Alert 3.\n\nWith the arsenal balanced equally between player and enemy, it becomes more a case of skill and (in some cases) luck. Random factors can ultimatly lead to success or failure. Such as the probability of your tank shell hitting that enemy tank before he does you in. Or taking your precious Heavy Tank on a rampage against a squad of meek infantry, only for the driver to poke out and get himself nailed by that out of reach Sniper, leaving the tank free to be captured.\n\nThinking of sending that lone Grunt against that Medium Tank? Pfft, no way! He says. It's that kind of charm and random, unpredictable gameplay elements that makes Z shine. And sometimes frustrating.\n\nUnlike most RTS games where your infantry are sworn, come hell or high water, to attack whatever target you tell them to, Z gives you the finger reminding you: soldiers can be cowards, or jackasses...even if they are robots. Sometimes the AI (no pun intended) can struggle with pathfinding, or not quite do what you want them to do. It functions more than it fails. You don't need to always tell the robots what to do, if you tell them to go to point A, they will have the good sense to attack any enemies along the way...sometimes.\n\nSingleplayer is enjoyable enough. The jokes kinda feel outdated, but I still get a grin out of the quips produced from the FMVs and in-game scenarios. General Zod, would you mind blowing that HQ up to heavy metal and a machinegun please? Thank you.\n\nIf a patch for multiplayer (and/or skirmish) is added in a future update, or *shudder* DLC...then it'll greatly extend the longevitiy of this release. At the moment, I struggle to see myself playing beyond the campaign otherwise, same to any other players.\n\nFrom a technical aspect, the retro chip tunes, remixed slightly, unless my hearing is failing me, don't feel out of place. But some more graphics customisation options wouldn't go amiss. Higher resolutions maybe? The interface looks amateurish as well - it could do with some TLC. What was wrong with the classic interface? What works on a tablet, won't necessarily translate as well onto a desktop PC.\n\nI'm sure this classic title can only get better if the developers keep true to their word. But for now, I can enjoy Z again, and so should you!","July 4, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The controls have been improved a lot, the graphics look better. and the game now plays a lot more like the original. I can now safely recommend this to everyone. Thanks a lot to the dev team for sticking to this port and listening to the fans.\n\nUPDATE #1 (July 11th, 2014): Played the game with the first update. The control scheme has improved now that the mouse buttons have been re-mapped.\n\nStill needs to improve the pathfinding though, robots and vehicles will often take slow or impractical routes when you give them an order. They drive into buildings and sometimes this makes them easy targets during combat.\n\nI'm thankful for the team working on fixes. Hopefully, the experience will keep improving.\n\n-----\n\nI've been waiting for someone to rerelease Z on computers for a while. This is one of those games I spent entire nights playing as a child, even if I was terrible at it. It's really nice to see it again after so long.\n\nNostalgia aside, this port needs some work. Right from the start you notice this was ported straight from some tablet version. The mouse basically acts as a finger, which means clicking and dragging with the left button is interpreted as scrolling the map and menus. This can be cumbersome in battle, as some left clicks won't register correctly. In a frantic battle, this may cost you some units. You need to use right clicks to select several units, but you can only give commands with left clicks. The controls could use some fine-tunning for a better experience.\n\nI'm also having some weird video glitches. Whenever I select a soldier for the first time in the map, their status pop-up appears and the entire screen goes black. I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but it's very annoying. I have to play with those pop-ups disabled. The mini-map works, though.\n\nFinally, I'm disappointed there's no multiplayer enabled. As a kid I couldn't play online, so I missed that part of the experience. Hopefully it's not too late to add that feature in a patch? Otherwise this game will run out very quickly.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Z is as good a game as always, but I'm hoping this port gets some attention to make it better on PCs. If you're not willing to deal with the quirky controls, you might have to hold on until it gets fixed.","July 4, 2014","true","4.1"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","1"

For me personally it brings back memories!\n\nThe objective of Z is to destroy your opponents Command Fort or killing all the enemy units. The Unique RTS style game is created because you build no actual buildings (you can place turrets around your zones). The game is focused on you capturing and holding zones down for unit production. The more zones, the faster each of your zone buildings will produce. Be carefull though as if the enemy capture before the unit is built they get to have it!\n\nThe game is fun to play put does have some pro's and cons from the original Z and from other RTS games.\n\nPro's:\n- It is a classic!\n- Easy game style\n- Mission guides for the start of each mission\n- Unique RTS\n- End game progression steps up difficulty and adds more unit types\n- Blowing grenade stacks up and seeing debris destroy stuff. more games need this!\n- Difficulty settings can be increased to make it harder\n- Achievements and badges\n\nCon's:\n- The units seem to spread out way to much (over the original)\n- Some units will just stop on a wall and not move till you redirect them\n- Blowing bridges up and having a unit on the other side will glitch the CPU to have units on the other side of the bridge doing nothing. This also never happened in the original\n- Units will travel by road even when it is not the fastest or most direct route\n- Limited replayability\n- Units can be stuck in the enemy fort and not blow it up\n- Right click? what is this...\n- No unit groupings via numbers you click and drag which auto groups units\n\nOverall alot of the Negitives are because of the era this game was made verus the current RTS. I will continue to love the game and still play it!","March 29, 2015","true","1.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

It's really amazing stuff that old games are rereleased in remake versions BUT... yeah, there are always some buts. I should probably start with positive thing and being able to play once again this good old game on modern machines without (probably) any problems is cool. Old players will have some nostalgia attack and maybe there will be new players who will discover what really was "on top" many years ago. Saying something about the game itself would be rather pointless, since stuff like "TWENTY LEVELS FULL OF ROBOTS MAKING BOOM AND BANG WITH EACH OTHER" wouldn't grab many attention. If you are curious about old stuff just try it and play it - amazing atmosphere on every each of planet, accompanying by funny movie cutscenes and some strategy is what makes Z great.\n\nBUT since it's a mobile version, people will have negative attitude toward this game. They changed so many things, made some of them really annoying. They changed main menu for really ugly looking one - to be honest, it would fit for 90% of mobile games. You can't tell it's Z, there are big button everywhere and big annoying "X" in upper corner. And this "X" is also when cutscenes are playing. "Look at me, I'm just some poor mobile port", it's screaming on every move. UI also became something that's really annoying, and there is even stuff you won't probably notice since it's placed in very strange positions, like the number of units. Controlling you units is sometimes also hard. And, which is really important, where is multiplayer option? I guess since it's not in mobile version, because it wouldn't be made on mobile, we won't see it on PC. Really sad. Mobile edition didn't even get an extra missions or ZEditor.\n\nI got Z for cheap, so I'm not that much mad. Releasing once again a old version of Z, or some kind of REAL remake, would be amazing but hardly to pull. If you want to have it on Steam, if you want to get some nostalgia, if you really don't mind that's a mobile port - grab it.

The mouse controls are backwards. [FIXED]\n\nThis issue has been fixed with the latest update. There are some minor sensitivity issues... but I can forgive those.\n\n[FIXED] 2 . The videos are stretched in a widescreen-styled box. [FIXED]\n\nThis issue has finally been fixed with the latest patch.\n\n[FIXED] 3. No video settings of any kind. [FIXED]\n\nThey have added video settings in with the latest patch.\n\nPlease fix these issues as they are really hindering this port.\n\n[UPDATE]\nWith the mouse fix... I have updated my review. But I still can't recommend this port to anyone. I also have to add one more issue with this port.\n\n4. Lack of multiplayer.\n\nNow I'll admit I may have only played the multiplayer 20% of the time when I played this game originally. But I still liked to fire it up every now & then. The current lack of multiplayer really effects any sort of recommendation. Why was this cut when the game on steam is being touted as the definitive version? If a bunch of fans can create a multiplayer port for free like the Zod Engine... then surely a professional studio should be able to do it as well... right? Currently... besides this game... I have the Zod Engine installed. Multiplayer works great on it & I enjoy a small match every now & then. Either way, if this port is not going to have multiplayer, the word 'definitive' should be removed from the description as it is a false statement.\n\n[UPDATE 2]\n\nI have updated my review & most of problems I have had with the game have been fixed. The game still lacks the all too important multiplayer & the extra levels from the Z95 edition of the game to truly be called definitive edition. But even with all that in mind... as it stands now... I can recommend the game now. The developers have been really cool about listening to user complaints & such.\n\n[UPDATE 3]\n\nAfter a good length of time, I decided to go over my review of the game. I love the singleplayer portion of the game. Always have. But the lack of multiplayer & the extras levels in the Z Expansion (Z95) really hinder this game a great deal. I believe that after this length of time... the devs will not be adding either. That's unfortunate as this game really needs these two elements & it looked like the devs were going to as they were really responsive during the begining. As such, I've changed my recommendation to no.","July 5, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I dare say if I went up to the attic and found my CD copy from the 90's, ran dosbox or equivalent, sorted out the drivers and set the XMS memory allowance up properly I could have a more authentic experience.  However, much as I may be nostaligic about the "good old days" of DOS gaming the reality is that I'm just not going to find time to do all that these days, being maried with 2 children and a full time job.\n\nAs a way to relive a bit of my youth, albeit slightly flawed, this is worth the money to me.","April 15","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First time I played it when i was 8 or 9, so, it was a retrospective for me. To anyone who hasn't yet been introduced to this game, i'd suggest you to look away if:\n\n- you want as tactical RTS game as C&C, AOE1. This game is slow-paced and doesn't require much hassle and wits to be on top of the game.\n- you despise college humour from the 80's or consider the movie "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" as a total moodkill. Those cutscenes really set the mood by having these kinds of puns.\n- you don't like seeing cassettes or hearing some repetitive MIDI tracks ingame.\n- you hate repetitive levels. There isn't that much of story waiting to be unfolded in this game.\n\nCan't say that it's a bad game: it's just mostly about the nostalgic value.\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 26","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
