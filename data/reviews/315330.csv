Let me explain...\n\nEDIT: Continuing to update (thru Christmas patch) see bottom of main text for details.\n-----------------------------\n\nThe game starts by having you select some cosmetics and gear for your captain and crew. You then enter a staged tutorial battle where you learn the basics of shooting and moving your crew around the ship. You’re moved to your home port to begin the actual game. Here you hire some crew and outfit your first ship to begin your journey.\n\nUpon leaving port you can sail around a grid-type world map. You have instructions to head north and begin fighting. In truth, there’s really nothing else you could do (that giant squid beast you spawn next to is just eye candy) so you’ll head north a few spots and pick a battle location.\n\nYou’re given 10 seconds to allocate all of your crew (roughly 10 men). This is woefully inadequate and you’ll likely be at least 20 seconds into fighting before you’re satisfied with everyone being in their spot. Now it’s finally time to use those guns you were promised in the title.\n\nThere will be three types of enemies: small fighters, medium gunships and heavy gunships. They will attack you with a combination of bombs, machine guns and paratroopers. Your primary job is just to aim the guns so as to compensate for your target’s relative velocity and the bullet drop. Pew Pew Pew at the enemy for a few seconds and they explode quite satisfactorally. Do this well enough and you’ll hopefully survive the battle.\n\nIf you survive the battle, you’ll be rewarded with gold for your total number kills. If you're destroyed, you are sent back to home port (without losing anything) and can continue from there. Eventually you rack up enough gold to buy better guns and a bigger ship. The new equipment is roughly the same as what you had before with better stats (more guns / more damage / more armor / more health).\n\nNow you’d expect the enemies would scale up as well. They don’t. You’ll be fighting the same fighters and gunships through another 20 to 30 battles in roughly the same numbers as the first battle you fought. There aren’t any bosses or different game modes. You’ve reached the end of the current content. It’s a rather hollow feeling.\n\n(Note: there is technically an alien thing called “orbs” which you can battle, but they appear to be impossible to kill in the current game, which means it’s just a “You Lose” screen by another name.)\n\n-------------------------\nUpdates:\n\nHalloween: Added two guns and a new ship. Equipment too powerful for existing enemies\n\nNov. 8th: Port Siege mode added. A 3 to 6 minute 2D turret sequence with clunky WASD-based controls and excessive dirty lense effects. Not fun.\n\nDec. 1st: A few quality of life and partial price balancing changes.\n\nChristmas: Two new guns, two new reinforcement chips, one new ship. Equipment too powerful for existing enemies.\n-------------------------\n\nSo that’s why I’m not recommending it at the moment. There’s very little game here to recommend. The mechanics of it are sound, it runs decently well and it certainly has potential, but you’re buying a 2 hour demo of a good game, which is not worth $13 USD.\n\nIf there’s significant content added in an upcoming patch, I’d happily change my vote.","October 4, 2015","false","17.2"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","38","46","0","1"

You got big guns, explosions, hard metal and loads of sea...worthy vessels. All Guns On Deck brings its own unique take on these mammoth vessels with Action/RPG elements. This brings in ideas from FTL and combines them with the gun blasting action of an arcade game. There is loads of customization ranging from weapons, ships, parts, crew, and that's just in Early Access. Combat itself is quick, vicious, and full of satisfying explosions and crew maintenance. You may be gunning down enemies but don't pay attention and your ship is full of water and everyone drowns, or burns to death, or dies by radiation poisoning. There are many elements to master and battles to be won. This is what makes All Guns on Deck fun and unique. The drawback is that the game still has quite a long ways to go. There is plenty of room for optimization and tweaks that would make the game much more friendly to the average gamer. Things like tooltips, a decent tutorial and resolution control are still missing making the quality of life in the game difficult at times. All that aside there is still plenty of potential for some awesome dynamic combat. Throw in giant sea monsters and you got me hooked. Let's just hope the developer can deliver.\nI personally can't wait to see the final product and conquer the huge open world of All Guns On Deck!\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/8krEk37dFUg\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 30, 2015","true","1.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

The combat system consists of shooting down enemy air targets with your ship guns.\nOn it's current Early Access state, it might not be worth buying. YET. Though this game has a lot of potential and can surely be a smash hit when it comes out, I think it still needs a lot of improvement.\n============\nFull Review Below\nGameplayThe gameplay is simple. You start at a port with your captain and you can walk around and interact a bit with some buildings and NPCs (Non-Playable Characters.) From there you can build your first ship and start venturing yourself on the world with your ship and your crew.\n\nNow this game is like a cookie clicker, but a good one. And you are hearing this from a person that hates cookie clickers.\nWhen engaged in a battle, you'll have an awfully small time to put your crew on their designated positions and start shooting down air targets. You can either leave your crew taking care of the battle for you, or you can assist them.\nYou can also use the guns on your ship by yourself if you don't trust the AI to shoot. Plus it's a lot of fun to shoot with the guns from the ship, though it gets a bit boring after a while.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely repetitive and does not offer much options for you. Plus, the only kind of enemies you'll be finding are air targets. There are no other types of enemies, only and exclusively air targets. Another thing is the fact that in this game you have to pay attention to small details. Sometimes airborne troops might land on your ship and you'll have to deal with them, by just clicking on them. Plus if certain part your ship gets damaged in combat you will have to send a crew member to fix it. So pay attention to details.\n\nWhat got my attention the most, was the little complexity the combat system have. When hit by a bomb, for example, you might get some fire on your engines and other components. That fire will start damaging your ship, and if you are careless, you will die. The game has different status for your ship, like HP, armor, gun slots, but some of them didn't make much difference in combat. Though the crew will make a lot of difference.\n\nAnother cool feature this game has, apart from the combat, is the siege system. That said, you can invade enemy bases and destroy them. Though, I found it a bit... unfinished. The siege section of the game feels rather weird compared to the rest of the game. It is cool, but the animations feels completely not part of the game. To be honest, this section of the game feels like a game made on Flash.\n\nCurrently on the Early Access, the map that you can explore is really small. So you will likely finish this game quickly and will find yourself with nothing to do other than walk on the port and get killed by invincible sea monsters.\n\nPersonal OpinionThe problem about All Guns On Deck starts when the game fails to explain how everything works. It does explain, but it explains in a terrible way. When you start a new game, there will be a tutorial. In this tutorial, they throw you to fight against an invincible enemy without the basic knowhow of the game. Also the tutorial fails to make the information clear. So, if you wish to master this game, you'll have to find it for yourself. There's also a mini encyclopedia inside the game, that covers more information than just the tutorial, though, it lacks some explanation about a lot of stuff. But I guess that's alright considering the current Early Access status of the game.\n\nAnother issue with the game is that, there are for example, seven types of crew to choose from, but only four of them are explained. This is something that really annoys me in general. I hate when a game has a feature and this said feature doesn't have a meaning/explanation about it.\n\nYet another issue with information. In the game there's a equipment shop for you, but the game also fails to explain what some weapons, for example, do, or how much damage they deal and their stats. The problem I saw is that, you can only see their stats after you buy them. What if I don't like it? Well, to bad, no refunds for your guns. Plus, the map will eventually run out of enemies, meaning, you won't be able to make money when they are gone. So yeah, no replayability whatsoever.\n\nThe whole fact that you are defending your ship against planes and shooting them down with your big guns is amazing. The animations for this game are really nice considering the simplicity of it. The variation of guns is not immense at the moment but surely covers a lot for a Early Access. Plus there are some funny guns you can have, like the gift cannon that shoots presents at your enemies, or the cannon that shoots crew members. I wanna see more cool features like these in the future.\n\nPROS+ Addictive & fun gameplay;\n+ Quick to Learn;\n+ Skirmish Mode;\n+ No known bugs or major issues;\n+ Well detailed game;\n+ Well animated game;\n+ Various gun variations.\n+ Nice and simple graphics\n\nCONS- Repetitive combat;\n- Repetitive soundtracks;\n- Repetitive enemies;\n- Lack of information around game content;\n- Gets easily boring;\n- Could use more customization;\n- No replayability;\n- Definitely not worth the price (at current state;)\n- Game is awfully short (at current state;)\n- AI aiming is terrible (needs serious improvement;)\n- Needs difficulty balancing.\n\nGameplay - 6/10\nInterface - 4/10\n\n\nFINAL VEREDICT\n5.5/10 - Slightly Below Average (At current development state)\n\n\n\nNote for the Developer(s)Ok, let's begin with this. Your game needs to cover more information about the stuff it has. More info on the weapons, ships and stuff from the shop. More descriptive statistics and info about said features. Also while in the port, it would be nice to see a display with the current time and weather. Also a improvement on the character walking system would be nice too.\n\nAlso, why can't we skip the tutorial? It breaks the whole sense of having two options on the menu of the game. One for 'New Game' and another for 'Tutorial'.\nThe tutorial needs to cover more information about the ship, crew, and surroundings. It's like you throw me at a cage with a lion without proper training and expect me to win.\n\nAnother thing, I wish there could be more ways to interact with your ship, because I feel like the ship crew does everything, and I'm just there watching they have all the fun. The only cool thing I can do is shoot the guns. If you ask me what is your game good for, I won't be able to say a thing. Though again, it is addicting, it is fun, but lacks a lot of content on it's current state.\n\nNow, the crosshair customization, that is nice. One of the coolest features I've seem in the game. Now I wish there was more customization like changing the color of the ship, using other flags, and maybe even changing the interface a bit. That would be cool to see in the future.\n\nYour game is wonderfully cool and has a lot of potential. All it needs is a push in the right direction. I await anxious for the final version to come out. Until then I hope you will do the right thing for the game and update it, add more features, and hopefully this game can be a smash hit.\n\n\n\n============\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 24","true","5.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","2"

Not to mention, the few updates that do come out barely have any changes worth noting.  I mean come on, it's not a graphical masterpiece that needs a smart ai and a complicated story.  It's a simple game that has great potential, butit needs to be worked on.  Another reason I gave this a thumbs down is currently you are confined to one small area on the map.  Once you've battled your way to the next port, which doesn't take much time at all, that's it.  That's as far as the game has gotten in developement and you're waiting on the devs now.   Like I siad, I like the casual/simple game play and it has potential, but the price you pay right now for 1/8th of a game and the slow, I mean SLOW, updates from the devs with a game like this, does not make it worth getting right now.  If more updates start coming in consistantly, that actually start adding significantly to the game, then I will definitely change this to a positive review.","March 7","false","10.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

This game is no where near the same as FTL for replay or challenge. By the end all your doing is waiting for your ship to repair itself before you kill the last enemy to start the next wave. The crew alocation is also rather shallow you just load your ship up with 20 crew members and fill every slot not much depth to it. Also there are more than a few bugs including the inability to finish the last fight at times due to "target" glitches.\n\nInteresting idea that fell flat.","December 30, 2015","false","4.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

(And when I say overly challenging, if you happen to choose the ship with 1 or 2 gunplacements, you will likely always lose the first mission and may not understand what you did wrong)\n- After each battle you need to go back to port to heal, but typically it takes too much time to travel back so the quick way is to enter a new battle but click "retreat to port" before starting. I think this is a silly mechanic, and I feel like your boat should be immedietely healed after each battle considering your crew-members are constantly healing it anyway.\n- The difficulty curve is a bit too high it seems... I had trouble getting very far in the game as the enemies seemed to be overly difficult while I didn't seem to be getting enough money for upgrades.\n\n~ All the battles I've seen seem to be focused on air targets, it would be neat if you also had to fight enemy ships as well\n\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game, and feel like this is somewhat of a hidden gem currently.

The weapons and upgrade system is well fleshed out for such a small game, and I can't wait to see that be developed further.\n\nSo far I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who just needs a fun time-wasting game with some strategy to it.

If there was an option between yes and no I would have chosen that.\n\nAfter playing the game at this early stage there are things to like about the game but there are some things that need to be fixed before the game leaves early access.\n\nOverall I like the concept behind the game. The combination of combat with ship management is a good concept for a game. Individually the two concepts work pretty well at this stage.\n\nThe problems come from having to handle both aspects at the same time. The computer AI is terrible at aiming so you will have to kill most of the enemies yourself. Since you are so focused on shooting the guns though you don't have enough time to focus on tending to the ship itself. The game doesn't do a good enough job warning you when there are issues with your ship.\n\nIf the game can find a better way to combine the two main elements, All Guns On Deck could be a good game but at this stage it is a little rough around the edges.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of All Guns On Deck.

Simple as that.\n\nCons (since there are no positives)\n\n- AI is stupid as ♥♥♥♥.\n- You can't station your crew outside combat, rendering your crew useless before dying a couple of times when placing them.\n- No difficulty scaling, ammediately pitched against gunships and all that when you have a ship with 2 gun stations.\n- The game is just outright boring.\n\nDo NOT buy this game.","September 9, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 of 16 people (6%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","6","1","16","2","0"

And whern you get sinked you get less number of waves and get no doubloon\nand all ship can for now only get a limited number of crew whitch can be placed and only 1 engineer to repair only not 4 or 5 so we get sinked fast enough.\n\nSo I recommand wait and see.\n\nFor now my impression this game is in early alpha\n-no difficulty level\n-no option button\n-no name customisation\n\n-gameplay : for the crew the 2 basic ship expect to be killed easy.\nseems to be a mobile phone game not pc one\nshould have more deck to use more of the crew afterall (like interstellaria) the concept "modular system command for advanced customisation."\nneed more gun emplacement it's a pc dammit use the average 6-8 Go Ram and 2 Ghz (steam stats)\n\n-ship should have the way to escape battle when things turn bad\n\n-superpower limited use in addition to the long charging rate time expect to be killed fast\n\n-it should be like a shoot-them up for the guns if we have more guns and add evasion system to the ship (go left and go right) and some shield module for the end-tier cause if we got 26 crew on the 1stbattleship i don't expect them to be in the reserve due to the lack of slot and buggy specialisation.\n\nBuy this game only if you want to support dev and pray they won't let a beta unfinished like some other early access company.\n\nI think i gonna wait for 2017-2018 to see the result.(one game cycle is 3 year usually now from alpha to final)","August 28, 2015","false","0.5"," 11 of 50 people (22%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","22","11","50","3","2"
