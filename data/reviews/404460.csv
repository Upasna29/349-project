Runs extremly smooth, even when a room full of liquidy goo cascading towards your face. :) Fun music and some good challenge curve throughout the game. Once you get the hang of building, you can go basically anywhere. For $3, it's a 10/10. Would melt again.","September 27, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"
