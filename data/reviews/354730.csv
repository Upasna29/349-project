I'd done a ton of grinding, and my characters had literally the best equipment in the game. I had the expensive Iridium bow and arrows for Lorelei (the main character), the Irididium daggers for Glade, the super expensive dreadnought armour and gauntlets for Dori (the tank) and a whole bunch of other stuff besides. The game considered me overlevelled, and I was hardly getting any skill points from battles (more on that later).\n\nDespite all this, no matter what I did, I could not defeat the final boss. She is literally impossible, even with extensive grinding, to the point I don't think the devs even playtested this game. If she defeats one of your party members, she gets a ton of extra health, and you can't revive them for the rest of the fight. Basically, you have to beat her without anyone going down even once for the entire fight.\n\nThis would be fine, except SHE CAN KILL ANY OF YOUR CHARACTERS IN A SINGLE HIT, EVEN IF THEY HAVE FULL HEALTH AND YOU HAVE THE BEST ARMOUR IN THE GAME. Nothing you can do prevents this. The two tank-y characters, Dori (the armoured knight) and Glade (the evasive theif) both have moves that draw the enemy's attention, making it more likely they will be attacked instead of the other characters. However, even Dori can't stand up to this monster's attacks, and even with his evasion up move, Glade will be hit and instakilled. Have I mentioned she can inflict every status ailment, act several times in a single turn, and, best of all, the heroine's ultimate attack, supposedly designed for killing beings like the final boss does almost nothing to her?\n\nI gave up on this game because I couldn't beat the stupidly unfair final boss. Now I can't see the ending and feel like I've wasted all the time and effort I put into this game, not to mention my money. I have a few other issues with the game as well, however.\n\nThe game is very linear, which isn't a problem in and off itself for a game like this, but there is a noticeable spike in difficulty as you enter each new area. Pretty soon, you'll be struggling even with mook enemies if you haven't yet got the strongest equipment available at that point in the game.\n\nLevelling up does almost nothing- the stat gains are meagre at best. 50% of your characters' growth comes from equipment (weapons, armour, accessories) 45% comes from upgrading your charcters' skills (which is separate from levelling up and requires skill points that have nothing to do with experience points) and only 5%, if that, comes from gaining levels.\n\nThis makes obtaining gold of utmost importance, which brings me to my next gripe. In every area of the game there are enemies with an ability called 'mug'. Basically they hit you, and in addition to dealing damage, they take some of your coins. The amount stolen is a set percentage of your total gold carried, and you don't get it back when you beat the enemies, meaning if you're carrying more than a paltry sum of gold, you will start making a net loss in gold from enemies. This is very annoying because the dungeons are very long and convoluted, and most of the enemy encounters you will face will be in the middle of these dungeons where there is no opportunity to go back and spend your gold that you've been accumulating or convert it into gems (which can't be stolen). With the importance of up-to-date gear, this practically necessitates grinding.\n\nThere are several instances of typos throughout the story. I lost count of the number of times I had to read 'diety' instead of deity, and there are lots of other examples. Not a huge deal I admit, but that final boss has put me in a really bad mood.\n\nAlso there are a couple of stealth minigames shoehorned into the story and the second one is impossible to complete as intended. Your 'alert meter' (fail state when it fills up completely) rises rapidluy to full WHILE THE CHARACTER YOU'RE PLAYING AS IS STILL TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO AND YOU CAN'T EVEN MOVE. Like I said before, clearly not properly playtested. Fortunately, you don't have to succeed to move on with the story (not that this makes the game possible).\n\nIn summary, if you like seeing the end of games you buy, do NOT get this game. I thought I could be hardcore and power grind my way to victory against the final boss after my initial failures, but no, I am convinced it is literally impossible. Doing more than your max hp to your strongest characters even when you're a high level and have the best armour, and being unable to revive downed characters? What absolute garbage. Out of curiosity, I tried to youtube the ending, but I couldn't find any footage of anyone beating this game. Maybe that's because it's obscure, but I still find it very telling. As someone who has played this game up to its ludicrous final boss, my advice is: stay away.","May 8, 2015","false","26.4"," 93 of 116 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","93","116","8","6"

The gameplay is your standard RPG with the standard RPG about you being the chosen one and using your diverse party members to save the world. The gameplay was solid (rewards for exploring dungeons, combat, leveling up, etc.), the dialogue was good (with some humor and references to other games thrown in which was a nice touch) and overall a cute little game. I just wish you could explore the world because other than explore dungeons, they are no other side stuff to do.\n\nI was going to rate this game a 8.5 out of 10, but then I got to the final boss fight and my rating dropped considerably.\n\nThis boss is either programmed very poorly or is just bugged. When someone dies, you can't revive them and the boss gains 10,000 hp (Or if she kills the healer, she gets 100,000 so if that happens, just quit); this goes with the theme of the boss, but still it's very annoying. If the boss hits anyone, but the warrior, they are dead (being hit for 999 with no chance of dodging no matter how high my dodge was) so you can't make a mistake. After skipping through the dialogue for the 5th time and losing the battle, I decided to give up because I'm not grinding; I didn't have to grind for any other boss so I'm not wasting my time here.\n\nSo, if you like RPGs, you'll like this game, but fair warning on the final boss because she is cheap as hell.","April 2, 2015","true","21.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"

The dearth of reviews here also made me figure I would contribute.\n\nYes, this is an RPG maker game; but like DSII and SB, it has alot of custom content, probably moreso than most of the Aldorlea games (though those are fine too). I can say this with some confidence since I used to make a RMXP game myself but which never got finished due to my other projects.\n\nAnyway; I will say that DS1 is considerably more rough around the edges than its successor, though I guess this is to be expected.\n\nAfter 5 hours of play (just done the desert) my slight issues include:\n>> There is somewhat less freedom to build the party; for example, I built Teresa in DS2 as my prime DPS rather than my tank (which was Carrion), because I could; but here, for example, Dory is the only real tank. Its also rather hard to pull aggro off Winchester when Dory's biggest aggro pulling move requires 50 OD. Again though, this the hazard of playing the second game after the first.\n>> The plot just kinda happens to our good princess. I'm rather confused about her in general. On one hand, Lorelei seemingly has some clarity of the coup de tat that deposed her (?) since she talks about it early on. However, she later asks Winchester why he didn't tell her about the fact she was a princess. Perhaps I just missed or got confused over something there? Perhaps this will all be cleared up later on in the plot though.\n\nHowever, whats good:\n+ Though I moaned about customisation; thats only because I'm spoilt, its still pretty decent and way more involved than most RPG maker games. Only the other Dancing Dragon games and Doom & Destiny are comparable in the same category.\n+ The character battle animations are good. They're nicely hand drawn and well implemented, and I know that can be a serious pain in RPGmaker. Most of these games don't animate their actual characters at all (they just show the weapon/attack animation; and actually, that was my one big 'meh' point on Skyborn) so I give this a massive plus.\n+ Progression feels about right; I tend to be the sort to wander round and get all the treasure, but rarely did I feel like it was taking too long (except maybe a little towards the end of the desert).\n+ Its dangerous carrying a massive treasury. A little thing, but all those mugging thief enemies actually became the bane of your existence. The game tells you to carry your wealth in gems at one point, and you should listen! That said; WTF happens to the gold they steal; you never get it back!?\n+ Some other reviews comment on bugged maps and unbeatable bosses. Not seen any myself, though will update if I do.\n\nAnyway; its worth it enough, at least for me. I would also check out the other games by this group and I hope that they release an excellent DS3 or something eventually!","April 12, 2015","true","8.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I didn't actually beat this game, but I feel I've gone far enough to render an opinion.  This game is BS!  The beginning of the game isn't too bad in all actuality, but once you get to around chap3 this games difficulty gets a major spike.  To the point that I couldn't bean chap3.  There were so many bad balancing issues it's hard to quantify them.  This was one of the HARDEST games I've played in a long time.  I do not suggest it.","March 21","false","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
