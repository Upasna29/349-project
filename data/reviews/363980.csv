Usually known for putting together some harebrained ideas (like any creator) that should never seem to work out, I’m glad that they oddly do and really remind me why I like and play games in the first place. So why not make a game about growing plants? In an oversimplified nutshell that is the premise of Forget Me Not: My Organic Garden, a tale that follows a girl named Organa, that is working as an apprentice at her master Irene’s shop that specializes in growing plants...that produce organs instead of fruit? Yeah, told you it would be out there, but that is apart of its charm.\n\nFrom kidneys and hearts that grow on trees to whatever grows on vines are just some of the oddities you will have to cultivate and all you have to do is simply click on a water can, click on the plant in question, and watch the growth happen. Sounds simple, right? Well, that is because it is, but don’t let the simplicity fool you. As you progress through the game and unlock other plants, items, and even animals that can assist you with everything from quicker growth for organs to refilling your watering can at a faster rate, things can become somewhat difficult to manage. However, with no penalties or strict time limit on your actions, you are free to take your time and once you get the hang of micromanaging your resources, it becomes a very zen and relaxing experience. Of course, you won’t be growing organs without some kind of purpose and where the quest system comes into play. Like most fetch quest in RPG’s or item collection task in other genres, from time to time you will have different objectives you will be ask to accomplish. All of them are pretty simple and require you to either grow a certain number of organs or level up your animals, equipment, or plants to a specific value which will happen as you go. While only a handful of quest are needed to move the story along to the next chapter, there are various others that will help you accrue funds to buy more resources as well as provide extra vignettes that help flesh the world and what Organa and Irene’s day-to-day lives deal with.\n\nSpeaking of the story, there is one to My Organic Garden, with Irene trying to train up Organa so she can go traveling knowing that her business will be in good hands, but it is definitely nuanced to some degree - which isn’t a bad thing for a game of this nature. As aforementioned, as you complete quest to move the story forward, scenes will play out in a visual novel type fashion that reveal the nature of Irene’s business as well as the customers that come to her. Some the scenes are pretty short and straightforward, yet there are a few that border on a reflective and even deeply contemplative bent, but the writing is very simple and easygoing that it never feels stuffy or imposing (putting it nicely). It adds a lot of character to the otherwise simple and addictive gameplay that can stand on its own just fine.\n\nThe avant-garde artwork adds to the character as it features a very seemingly monochromatic palate for the background on top of an optical artstyle that doesn’t play the viewer eyeballs, but does look extremely pleasant. As simple as the character designs are, they also look very nice and give off a very haunting ambiance to what seems like a cheerful and relaxing title. The game does have some animation work, yet nothing horribly too interesting to note except for visual cues when organs are ready to harvest or animals scurrying in a stop motion style when they are doing a task or resting. Music is also something that isn’t much to write home about, but works for what the game is.\n\nAll-in-all, Forget Me Not: My Organic Garden is a very different and pleasant game, and do think that is worth checking out if you like the concept and gameplay style. Even though I'm only a few steps into playing (Chapter 2) and still feel that I have more of the game to see, the simple and addictive clicking gameplay coupled with story bits is managing to keep me satisfied, and can't wait to I get my hands on the next introduced resource. I would be remiss if I didn't say that it seems like this type of play can become repetitive, but with so much to do and events staving off that monotony, I don't feel it sitting in now or see it happening any time soon.  I do believe fans of anime and visual novels will definitely find this up their alley, but even if you're not, still a neat and crazy idea you will want to look into.","August 21, 2015","true","0.1"," 82 of 89 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","82","89","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/363980/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","IntroductionThe first thing that should catch your eye upon viewing the game’s store page is its extraordinary graphics/art style. Or its absurd premise: pick one. But is the game truly absurd, or is it just a beautiful, tender story wrapped in total weirdness? I’m not sure either to be honest, not yet, but maybe we can find out together? I’m almost sure we will know the answer by the end of this review, so... shall we begin?\n\nGameplayI thought I knew what the game would be about, roughly, but I was surprised to see that I was actually completely wrong this time. I expected a casual time management game, but what I got was actually a clicker game. You know, clicker games… like Clicker Heroes and Sakura Clicker. Where you just use the mouse to complete objectives. Except My Organic Garden has a story to tell, and unlike most of the other clicker games (I haven’t played them all) you can actually complete it given enough time.\n\nIn fact, there are several stories to follow. You have a main story, which involves you (Organa, an apprentice) learning the profession of organ harvesting, which I will get to in a minute. And then there are several side quests that contain shorter stories.\nAll of the stories are told in a style similar to visual novels, but the conversations are always kept to a minimum. The stories are also broken up, so every now and then you get to see a new part of it. A wise choice, because it keeps the game more interesting and makes you want to continue playing. Usually you play these sorts of games for 30 minutes or so – sure, there are exceptions – and then close them and open them a day or two later to see if ‘you’ have made some progress. Not in this case. Because of the story you might want to return to it faster than normal. In reality it still remains a clicker game, though, so this means that if you have little or no interest in these sorts of games this most likely doesn’t apply to you. Another reason to return to it sooner is the fact that the game doesn’t continue harvesting whenever you close the game. All harvesting has to be done by the player him- or herself (and with the help of your animals).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535049695\nThe gameplay consists of first having to manage one tree. Give it enough water and kidneys will grow on it. Give the tree even more water and the kidneys will grow until they’re finally ripe for harvesting. Harvesting levels up the tree and giving it water levels up the water can. Each time you level up you can do more. The water can, for example, allows you to have more water in it, while the tree allows you to plant even more kidneys. Later on you will also be able to grow even higher quality kidneys, as well as hearts and meat, for example. Since there’s a lot of micromanaging involved you ultimately have to purchase some animals from the (a different?) shop. There are frogs and birds, among a few other animals. Frogs will fill up the water can faster and birds allow you to produce more meat. These animals can all also be leveled up. In fact, I haven’t yet seen one thing that I wasn’t able to level up. Everything levels up, it’s crazy. Crazy, but necessary if you want to make good progress, though. There is no time limit, or any limit whatsoever, so you can take your sweet time growing organs and clicking things. The story does progress once you have completed enough or the right quest(s), though.\n\nThe quests themselves are simplistic and easy. They can just take a lot of time to complete. Invest enough of your time into the game and you’ll be able to finish all of the available quests. The goal is to always level up more, buy more and harvest more. There’s no real depth to them and the stories aren’t interesting enough (thus far) to make me care about any of the involved characters. I really want to see the complete story, including the side quests, but I don’t want to spend hours of my time just mindlessly (a keyword in case you want to argue!) and frantically clicking things.\n\nUltimately I guess it can be either a soothing experience if you really take your time, or it can be a really stressful experience if you’re the OCD kind of person or if you just fail to see the logic behind it. I fall into that last category I think. I don’t see the logic behind clicker games, although this game does have more to offer, but I also don’t find these games soothing or relaxing. And unlike the other clicker games Forget Me Not My Organic Garden isn’t free. Would the game be that much more enjoyable if it was free? Probably not, but I would rate it differently I think.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535049712\nAudio & VisualsThe music is kind of cheerful. To be honest I expected a sad, dramatic game, but it’s actually the opposite. It’s a strange feeling, hearing happy music during more serious moments. But it’s a feeling I seemed to enjoy nevertheless. There’s no voice acting at all: the animals do make some noises, however, and there are some sound effects to indicate you’re making progress (completing quests, and leveling up items and animals). Other than that, the music seems to be the main focus here.\n\nForget Me Not My Organic Garden uses a lot of fade-in and fade-out techniques. These techniques are accompanied by beautifully shaded and colored – sometimes (very) blurry - graphics, but except for a few animations most of the art is static. The few animations are shown in a way that it looks like stop-motion, but I thought it was a bit messy, because animals were moving to all sorts of places. It’s certainly unique, I’ll give it that, but it doesn’t help you when you have to keep track of so many things at the same time. I wish this was done a bit differently.\n\nLength/Replay ValueI’m not sure what the total length of the game is - I might get there eventually – but apparently the game is about 15-30 hours long from what I’ve read and seen. That’s impressive, but also understandable, given the mechanics. I personally consider it lengthy, but if we compare it to other clicker games it clearly isn’t, of course. Despite that, you can still get more than enough gameplay out of it. Just don’t expect as much.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535049677\nConclusionForget Me Not My Organic Garden is a well-made game all things considered. However, it isn’t what I expected it to be. I personally expected something a little… deeper, purely based on the screenshots. But if you enjoy frantically clicking your mouse then there’s plenty of fun to be had here, no doubt about it. I wouldn’t say it’s a case of style over substance (the stories might just give the game more substance in the end) but in the first few hours it will definitely feel like that.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Excellent art style\n+ Cheerful music\n+ Multiple stories\n+ Easy to learn and play\n\nMixed:\n+/- Can be soothing if you take your time, or just plain stressful\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive gameplay\n- Too much micromanaging\n- ‘Stop motion’-like animations make you lose track of things\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer.\nRating: 6.3 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nPlease feel free to join my group, DJ’s reviews, or follow me directly as a curator.\nDon’t feel like it?

And believe it or not in this game these three genres work well together.\n\nDefinitely not the usual type of resource management game since one plays as Organa, apprentice to Irene, the owner of a body organ shop who Organa calls Master.  Organa works in the greenhouse behind the shop growing and cultivating (on trees) body organs: kidneys, hearts, stomachs, livers, and colons (intestines).  As the organ trees grow, they level up (top level 100).  As they grow the organs becomes better quality: average, great, excellent.  Of course Organa is tasked with filling orders of certain quantities of each organ from customers of the shop.  Every chapter introduces a new organ and the sixth chapter is an ending.  The credits roll and Organa can return to shop to complete unfinished tasks and gets a whole set of new ones.  This after story gaming is basically for that visual novel "true" ending, and for achievement hunters and completionists since this part is a grind.  A very easy grind, but still a grind.  Also in this after the (first) ending part is the merchant storyline.\n\nNow back to the resource management, clicker, visual novel parts.\n\nAs a resource management game, this game is definitely different just in concept alone: body organs on trees.  Plus this is a vertical first person point of view versus a horizontal third person point of view.  Very different.  Fairly easy as far as gameplay goes but some strategy is involved.  Note:  Excellent organs are only able to be created once the tree levels up past a certain point.  Also the player ends up with a meat grinder which also needs to be leveled up.  Leveling occurs though gameplay so the game is not a grind, and though everyone differs, when the game started to feel like a grind for me, some thing occurred such as getting a greenhouse watering system or a meat rake or new tasks to do.  Plus upon completion of certain tasks the player needs to go chat with "Master" Irene, the boss.  This nicely breaks up that grind feel.  Also any time the door in the greenhouse becomes highlighted the player can go to the front and speak with Irene, for information (about animal helpers), task upgrades (watering system and meat rake), or simply to get more things to do (customer orders).\n\nAs clickers go I really have no comparison since I generally do not play clickers, but in this game, the player clicks of the organs at the appropriate time to get the desired quality and quanity needed for the task. Plus the player needs to click of the watering can to water the trees.  Now add to that 6 different helpers that need clicked on to encourage them to do their task since they tend to wander about at first while learning their task.  The helpers are toads, moles, woodpeckers, butterflies, lizards and homunculi all tasked with something different to speed along the watering and growing processes.  Later in the game, tree sap comes into play and quickly promotes growth and higher quality body organs.  (This is a strategic tool.)\n\nFor the visual novel part, there are 7 storylines plus Irene/Organa's storyline.  Each one has dark undertones and are a bit sinister in nature.  They border on the line of horror, in fact.  The 7 storylines come from the different customers who come to the store wanting and asking for different organs or ground up meat.  There is the boy and his doll, the girl and her cat, the stout (feret) family, the doctor, the boy, the quiet villager, the witch and the lady in black.  Organa makes comments at the beginning of each chapter and occassionally while she is working.  At the end of each chapter Irene has tea with her friend and they chat a bit.   No story segment is very long, and is clicked through manually.  (That is faster then having to reset the 'auto' talk feature each time.)\n\nWarning:  There is NO AUTO-SAVE.  So make sure to save the game before exiting.\n\nOverall, an interesting and for me at least a quite addicting game to play.","April 3","true","37.2"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","21","22","3","0"

In fact the automation is probably the most frustrating part. You can buy animals to speed up your production however this becomes more of a chore than a help as the animals will only stan where you need them to benefit from their buff for so long. That is to say the animals jump around the screen and you have to click them to make them go back and do their job. I find this mechanic extremely frustrating to say the least.\n\nThe story is enjoyable and has a simple premise: You're growing organs to help your master run an organ shop, each organ has a soul and people want them for different reasons. You see a bunch of different characters with different stories and they are all somewhat interesting. In fact these stories are the only reason I'm bothering to keep suffering through the gameplay.\n\nThe audio is admittedly terrible, everything you click makes a loud sound and there are lots of different sounds for each animal. I found my speakers making hideous noises repeatedly sometimes noises will overlap and cut out other noises thus making it even worse. However the music is pleasant and fits the atmosphere.\n\nIf you like games like Clicker Heroes and Cookie Clicker then this game is not likely for you as it has almost nothing in common with them. I'd love to reccomend this game because of the story, art, and music but with the gameplay being so unbearable I can't really say this is a good buy.","August 21, 2015","false","0.1"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","32","46","0","7"

Mechanically, it's a clicker, but there's no stress involved: failure to harvest organs as soon as they ripen have no negative connotations. It's a game where you can let it run in the background and just pop in once in a while to water and pick and boom, done. Granted, when you have more specific quests, you might need to focus up on it more so that you can get organs before they overripen, but that's an entirely minor point.\n\nThe storyline and the characters are thoroughly loveable. From the main owner herself to the random customers that pop in and out, everyone has a story, and I was always happy to see the different storylines unfold one knock at the door at a time. Some are cute, some are relatable, and a couple are downright sad, but they're all unique.\n\nSInce it plays like a visual novel (story-wise), I never really had control of what was unfolding, but the harvesting/clicking elements inbetween gave me a sense of accomplishment. And the fact that I didn't need to dump every second of my time into making sure it was clicking properly helped a lot. The music was ambient enough, and, overall, it was a relaxing time.\n\nBuy it and play it all the way through.

The atmosphere is what really sold me.  The setting is a bit sinister and horrific, but all painted over by bright, peaceful cheer, and that dichotomy of peace with a sense of something being very wrong is very engaging.  The music was really enjoyable (my favorite track was the loading screen bells), though sparse, since you spend most of your time in a garden which ends up rather crowded and noisy!  The story is quiet and minimalistic, and you get the sense that while the story segments all involve individual customers, you're really just being introduced to another world in bits and pieces.  This is appropriate, given you are an apprentice who doesn't really know much of anything!  In that atmospheric 'what is this place' sense, I am most reminded of another visual novel, "Sekien no Inganock -what a beautiful people-", which is also recommended if you can get it.\n\nThen we get to the gameplay.  No lie, it seems the weakest part of the experience at first.  This is a farming game which would be at home on a cell phone.  You water plants, wait for them to ripen, then harvest.  As you go through the cycle, the plants and implements you use for this task level up and progress.  You can buy critters to speed things up a bit, but they also require some poking and prodding to do their job until they level up themselves!  It is a test of patience.  Your fruit won't grow fast enough, and your water can never fills quickly enough, and now you have to click on those darn frogs to get them back to work, and you always want more more more, faster faster faster.  Until you give up and just go at the pace of the game.  Once I stopped trying to micro-manage the critters constantly and maximize my crop speed, what was initially a stressful impatient mid-game magically transformed into a relaxing activity!  Meditative, almost.\n\nThis is a clicker game that teaches zen; it's okay to let go, everything will happen in it's own time.  You don't have to make sure every newt and butterfly are on point, or that you optimize your crop to the nth degree.  It will all work out.  By the end game, the process is a little grindy, but if you're in the relaxation zone it doesn't feel like a bad thing, and you can learn little tricks with bonus stuff called sap to move things along.\n\nYou get the true ending when you finish the last (non-repeating) mission.  I found it poignant and completely fitting.  And then it is time to uninstall, but somehow calmer and more peaceful than before.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/recommended/363980/","silentcaay","SilentCaay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/","247 products in account","Kinda disappointed with this game because it turned out to basically be a clicker game and I expected more of a puzzle game after having 100% completed and loved This Starry Midnight We Make which was also made by Cavyhouse. That's my own misconception, though, so I won't hold it against the game. I just wanted to warn you right off the bat, though, if you don't like clicker games, you probably won't like this game.\n\nOn it's own, it's certainly a well-made clicker game and it has plenty of the Cavyhouse style that TSMWM has. My one complaint is how slow the game is to get started. You start with basically nothing: one tree and a watering can. However, you eventually have a screen full of stuff that requires constant clicking. Basic clicker game mechanics, in other words. That one tree and watering can you start with, though, stick around a bit too long. You first have to grow 1 kidney. Then 5. Then 10. Then 15. Then 30. During this part you're not doing much aside from waiting on the watering can to fill and then watering your one tree and finally harvesting when the fruits are ready. I think this initial 20 or so minutes of gameplay should have been condensed down to like 5 minutes.\n\nAfter that, though, the ball gets rolling as you get more plants and machines, your upgraded plants begin to bear more fruit and you start ordering animals that also need tending. At this point you constantly have things to do.\n\nThere is one main difference between this game's mechanics and most other clicker games that bears mentioning: the lack of automation. In most clickers the game plays itself, only requiring input from the user to speed up the current gameplay or to upgrade the automation. This game lacks any real automation. If you stop watering plants, they stop growing; if you don't harvest your fruit, you won't get any more; if you don't fill your mincemeat grinder, you won't get mincemeat; etc. You can walk away from the game at any point and you don't have to worry about plants dying or anything but your production will halt, regardless. This is kind of a controversial difference so I won't say it's a good or bad choice. It's really up to what the player wants and expects.\n\nLike in TSMWM, the story is delivered by short dialog cutscenes that occur every few quests you complete. Various people from town come to the shop for their own reasons and you learn of their situations that way. It's a nice bit of world-building but doesn't have any real bearing on the gameplay.\n\nSince the gameplay here is very simplistic there's not much else to say about it. If you like clicker games, you should check this out since it's well-made and has some great themeing but if you don't like clicker games, I'd avoid it simply because it doesn't do anything interesting enough to win you over.","December 26, 2015","true","2.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It is in no way complicated--you'll be clicking *a lot*--but it's still oddly enjoyable. It's one of those little games that you'll find addictive without really knowing why.\n\nStory:\nThere's not much of a main story. Your master runs an organ shop and you're her apprentice. You grow organs, harvest them, and sell them while she looks cute at the register. There are several side stories, however, in which characters visit and give you quests to do, which activate cut-scenes with unvoiced dialogue. The game is divided into chapters, though I'm not entirely certain why.\n\nFeatures:\nAnimals you can purchase, each of which effects your organ trees in different ways.\nLevels (for everything) that effect how well your trees/equipment/animal helpers work.\nA quirky cast of characters with their own back stories--some cute, some disturbing.\nSimple controls; you only need your mouse.\n\nGameplay:\nAs mentioned before, you click a lot. That's it. This game is a micromanagement title in which you'll click to water your garden... And to harvest your plants... And to go through text... And to interact with the various animals in your garden. After harvesting your organs (which sounds way more violent than it is), you turn them in for cash via quests. There are quests that advance the story and quests that simply exist to give you a feeling that you're accomplishing something. The game can get hectic depending on how many critters you've got on screen and the level of your plants (which increases the number of organs on your trees and the speed at which they grow).\n\nBGM:\nCatchy. It gets old quickly, in my opinion, but it fades into the background or is drowned out by your incessent clicking.\n\nGraphics:\nI adore the art style. It's cartoony and colourful. Interactive parts of your garden will go black if they aren't in use/need your attention and easily stand out amidst the bright shades of everything else--which is a very intuitive way to indicate that you need to tend to them.\n\nPrice:\nI bought this on sale for 4.99USD and I don't regret it. I think 9.99 may be a little steep, however, for what you're getting. I can't see much replayability and, once you see the end, you probably won't pick this up again. I'm not anywhere near finished with the game, mind you, and I'm almost at 4 hours as I write this, so you'll probably get quite a few hours out of this.\n\nBottom line:\nit's a great little time-waster. If you're looking for depth, look elsewhere. This frantic click-fest is a blast, but it is indeed a casual game. You can easily waste hours with this title or just play it in short bursts.","January 24","true","3.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Despite having very little dialogue spread throughout the game and taking place in pretty much a single location, it somehow manages to introduce a variety of interesting characters and a twist that I don't think you'll expect.  You get little pieces of their stories when completing objectives, and the writing is simple yet amusing.\n\nI'd like to make it clear that this game is not very exciting, it's strength is that it is simple enough to pretty much mindlessly play.  So, similar to a clicker, it is more of a game to pass the time when you don't have anything else to do.  It does this task admirably, providing just enough interaction to keep the player engaged; especially in the late game.  The gameplay is oddly addictive and I found myself coming back to the game frequently.\n\nThe visual novel portion of the game does have an ending, and a true ending after that (though you can continue playing afterwards).  My only gripe is that the very end is a bit drawn out, especially if you want the true end.  All in all, you'll probably have close to 20h of gameplay when you unlock the final achievement, with the option to keep playing if you find it especially enjoyable.\n\nThe art style of the game is visually pleasing and easy to look at, with interesting character designs being especially eye catching.  While the art is nice, the sound design is a bit much near the end of the game.  I personnally turned the sound effects down alot because the game gets very busy near the end.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game to fill in the boring parts of their day, or anyone who is interested in a light-hearted bite-sized gaming experience.","January 7","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game takes about 15-20 hours to complete, depending on the player.\nStory: 7/10\nGameplay: 5/10\nGraphics: 6/10\n\nWithout going too far into it, in Forget Me Not, you're an assistant to the owner of a shop that sells fresh-grown organs. You water the trees, and organs grow. The gameplay is simple, if grindy, so it's easy to pick up. In my opinion, it's a good game to wind down with, whether you need a break from more exciting games or if you need to kill some time. It's heavy on clicking, though, so if that isn't your thing the gameplay is going to bother you.\n\nThe graphics are pleasing to the eye and relatively simple. Cutscenes are more like slideshows, but it works well for this game and the artstyle. No flashing lights, no bells and whistles, it does what it needs to. It may just be that I haven't played enough games that use graphics like this, but it made the game more comfy and fit the atmosphere well, and I appreciate simple graphics from time to time.\n\nThe story is the only thing stopping this game from being filed into the "time-wasting clicker" genre, and is, in my opinion, the major selling point of the game. The story follows Organa, an assistant to the owner of an organ shop. At certain points during gameplay, you can head into the shop to view a cutscene and get more work orders to fill, and sometimes new equipment/trees. Many of the cutscenes were endearing, and had messages to impart to the player. The "main story" arc, however, carries a tone different than what the atmosphere for the game would otherwise suggest. The true ending actually managed to surprise me without making me do mental gymnastics to understand how it happened.","June 5","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a waste of time to be frank.\n\nGameplay\nIt's literally just a clicker game. It's not like an idle game like AdVenture Capitalist or Clicker Heroes, where you can leave it and it does things for you. Forget Me Not requires you to invest time into it. It kind of has a visual novel type of feeling to it, but the "story" part of the game is kind of useless. You complete "quests" by growing nice, cute-looking organs and fullfill "buy orders" of sorts. There's not much to it. The game is kind of relaxing if you just want to not think about anything.\n\nArt/Music/Sound\nThe art's pretty simple and cute, which is what made me buy this game. I didn't play the game with sound and music on, so I can't really judge that element of it. I liked listening to my own music while playing. There's not much else that can be said.\n\nCriticisms\nI wish it was an idle game, but it's not. Constant clicking gets annoying and the game only becomes more of an idle game when you're able to buy more "helpers". Even then, once you exit the game, it pauses. That's the biggest problem I have with this game.\n\nVerdict\nI still would recommend this game if you're looking for a useless clicker game that has more to it than other clickers, like AdVenture Capitalist and Clicker Heroes. The cute art style and unusual premise makes the game fun. Just remember that you're going to be wasting a lot of time until you get to around Chapter 3. Playing this game for achievements is stupid (I'm trying to do this and it's not fun), so I wouldn't recommend it. 5/10","January 31","true","18.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Growing ensouled bodily organs on trees?... OK.\n\nThis is a clicker/rpg hybrid game, the gameplay is pretty repetetive, but the sheer strangeness of it kept me interested. Combined with the Skinnerian rpg element, because everything levels up. Your watering can, your animal helpers, the trees, everything.\n\nDoesn't really have any replay value, as one of the driving aspects is the story, once I knew the ending, I was done with it. It's cheap though, and kept me entertained.\n\nIf you like clicker/rpg type games, worth a buy when it's on sale.\n\nPro-tip: Early game, keep on top of the frogs.

You are just repeatedly clicking, but it feels a bit more strategic (for instance getting rid of unripe organs so you can produce higher quality organs). The story is very intriguing and I can't wait to find out more about the characters. This game is unique and I will be thouroughly entertained with it for some time. Definitely money well spent.","September 14, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has its unique atmosphere and world, and gives you some short stories fitting the world very well. And I think these are what this little game wants to show us mostly.\n\nSo why not recommended?\n\nThis game seems quite good at the beginning, you water plants, harvest organs, sell them, at a certain point, some events show up. But this procedure becomes longer and longer. You may be doing the repetitive clicking work for half an hour just for a short event, that only have 10-20 lines of dialogue. (Yes, most events are that short, and I think there are only 50-60 events in total) I said the story is good above, but it's really too short. And not as dark as you may expect, It's heart-warming most times, as same as the first impression the introductions here would give you.\n\nAnother thing I want to mention is the gameplay, it's not the common clicker stuff. A big difference is that you have to click to progress, there's no "idle time bonus" or "slow but auto work helper". It could make you really boring and tired after several hours of playing, when there're only few story events to "take a rest". By the way, I took 8 hours to the normal ending, but the extra tasks after that (which I guess are the key to the true ending) seems to be asking another 8 hours, during which I would barely see an event. I felt really tired of this and quitted.\n\nSo, If you think you like the atmoshpere, and have enough patience, go for a try. If you are not, better wait for sale.\nEven now I don't regret buying this, I just don't have any motivation to go further.","May 30","false","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
