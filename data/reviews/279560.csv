Folks weren't kidding when they said the Steam version was missing alot of content.  I went to gameboomers and couldn't figure out why the game and walkthrough didn't make sense.  I have only gotten to the very first of the game and already there is a giant chunk that is missing.  I have the first three games on CD and really like them, but this sucks!  Guess I will have to buy Dracula 4 and 5 on CD so that I can play the whole game.  Seems like "Special Steam Edition" means bend over.  My review of this game is mixed...feel short-changed, but I do enjoy the Dracula series.  My recommendation is get the CDs!","October 11, 2015","false","4.2"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","29","33","4","0"

I have finished both games now. They are REALLY disappointing.\n\nI am a fan of previous Dracula games, but those two are just not in the same level.\nThe narration is extremely bad, while the story is also dull and way too short, which makes these two games like an incomplete demo of a real Dracula game. Even the puzzles in these two are too easy for players to get satisfied.\nThere are also merely any interesting historical reference in these two games like this serie used to have.\nFrankly, these games get nothing to hold players' interests. It is really sad to see this great series now becomes something like the Big Fish kids' games.\n\nIf you liked previous Dracula games, PLZ stay away from these two. Not only because they are expensive, but also because they will ruin your faith of this series.","July 5, 2014","false","6.1"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","0"

Dracula 4 seem like half of a chapter and 5 maybe a chapter, the game is extremely linear, there is no exploration, the adventure itself is cliche and predictable, eg. you find a device, batteries and cord in the same box, only to combine them in inventory, no real "investigation". the puzzle are annoying and complicated, not because they are hard but because they are tedious. would have loved this game to be really good but that's not the case","November 1, 2014","false","8.2"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

For 20€ you will get 2 Games which are both together only 5 hours short. Which is why I would recommend to buy this game on sale. The Voice acting was good and the animation was as in every point and click game not bad but not really amazing either. The Controls took me a while to get used to, as the mouse seemed pretty fast, also some of the puzzles are a bit buggy.\n\nNumber 5 has 2 different endings which I personally find amazing!\n\nThe Story was very interesting as it had some true elements in them.\n\nSadly it has no trading cards or steam achievements, only in game achievements. I would off loved to see steam achievements and trading cards for this price.\n\nAlthough Personally I got it for free from indie gala and for that price it was an amazing experience. But I can imagine that some people might be disappointed if they paid 20€ for it.\n\nI can recommend this game and if you get stuck (like I did a couple of times) Just search on youtube for a walkthrough. As there are no guides whatsoever on steam.\n\nGrab this game on sale for under 5€ and you won't be disappointed!","October 29, 2015","true","5.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Now the voice sync is way off but do not let that bother you.\nThe puzzles were at times very very hard. But the game allows you to skip them. Sometimes you can see the solution but not completely or to solve it is going to take awhile, for this I am glad for the skip feature.\nIf you like those sorts of puzzles, then this is for you.\nThe storyline was ok and at times a bit cheezy. However overall I am happy with the price I payed for both of them.","January 23, 2015","true","7.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It takes aways half of the puzzles making it easy for other people. The interface is nice but the old one, was way better!! If you never played 4 and 5 you could enjoy it but with all of the objects highlighting it just makes the game to easy. If you like dracula and its old roots just buy the series on gog website. Promise you, you will get the same game on how it comes on cd along with all the puzzles and video clips! Also its not as easy as this one!\n\nPROS:\n- Two games for the price of one\n- Both games actually look okay graphically.\n- Nice interface\n- It has a nice soundtrack.\n\nCONS:\n- Very bad storyline\n-Half the game is a missing with the puzzles just like all of the dracula games\n- Whilst graphically decent and some attention to detail the environments still feel somewhat empty\n- Puzzles are far too easy and tedious\n","February 14","false","10.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's nothing like those stupid games on Pogo.com my mother trys to get me to play. I really enjoyed this game & it's also goes with the few games that actually keeps my attention & interest well enough to play it all the way through.\nI've been playing games since a kid when Nintendo, Segs Dreamcast, even Atari came out on Doctors recomendations due to a consitration & focusing problem I have.\nSo, even as a 37 year old it's still hard to find games to help with those problems when they actually can't keep your interest long enough.\n\nI will recommend this game especially for those who have the same problems I do.","July 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

The game is a direct continuation of dracula 3 in some parts of it you see things or hear things that reminds you of the father of the third game. In this game the puzzles became a lot more straightforward than in the 3rd one, and that is good because i only was able to finish that one with help of youtube walkthroughs. The story is about Ellen a woman that works as a restorator in a museum and it is dying of a degenerative blood disease. So in the game you also have to take good care of your health besides solving the puzzles and following the path of an old portrait of the Lord of the Darkness himself to decide Ellen´s fate. All the time you will sense a presence "helping" you from the dark. The plot have some interesting twists too which made me like the game even more","July 22, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
