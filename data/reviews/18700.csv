The growth of mechanics become boring - or even frustrating - sometimes before you've finished seeing them for the first time.\n\nIt feels very much like a university game design project, made to demonstrate a combination of physics and creative obstacles. That might be because it is a university game design project. I'm not sure.\n\nThe game certainly had a lot of potential to be fun. Indeed for the latter half of the main game I was having fun, wondering what would happen next. But the game commits four cardinal sins each of which could ruin any game.\n\nFirstly, some of the mechanics are almost unplayable. The flint rocks and the spring-reeds are particularly worthy of note as elements that bring a sense of dread every time they appear.\n\nSecondly, the collision detection is unreliable at best. Sometimes you can survive a surprisingly long fall or getting crushed by rocks, at other times you can die from a much smaller rock touching you with barely any movement.\n\nThird, some of the additional challenges and achievements are terribly thought out.\n\nThe game has three bonus stages that are on a par with I Wanna Be The Guy for difficulty. There's an achievement for beating those, which makes sense. There are also achievements for beating 5 levels with limited rotations, or in a certain time, or without dying too much. Those make sense too.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense is the achievement for beating ALL levels - including those unreasonably hard ones - with limited rotations, in a certain time, and without dying too much. And further still, the one for doing all that with the fewest rotations possible, a ridiculously low time and without dying AT ALL.\n\nThere are also three speedrun achievements, the latter two of which rely almost entirely on getting lucky with the placement of randomised projectiles. Replaying the same twenty minutes over and over until it works right is not fun.\n\nThe last sin the game commits is adding content badly. Following its PC release a Wii version was made, which allowed for dynamic world rotation instead of the 90-degree locked turns in the PC version. The additional bonus levels and challenges were then retrofitted into the PC version, but the smooth rotation was not even though many of them were designed for it. This makes the PC version much harder than it should be for much of the content.\n\nI need to emphasize that finding the challenges unreasonable is not the whining of a bad player. I'd accept such a claim for middling no-death runs in Super Meat Boy, but these so-called challenges are just not viable for anyone. Experienced players unanimously conclude that including the bonus levels within the challenge modes when they were all added was either an oversight or a mistake.","January 19, 2014","false","19.2"," 89 of 117 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","89","117","0","0"

My first impression a while back wasn’t very positive. The controls were very much frustrating, so I lost interest in the game very quickly. Now the controls are still frustrating from time to time, but after a while you get used to it. Sometimes it seems though that certain actions depend a lot on trial and error. Also, the bamboo stick was annoying and I would much have preferred to not have it in the game. Also annoying is the fact you die very easy. The game looks nice and the puzzles are challenging, but not too difficult. The music and sound effects are irritating. Conclusion: average.

With WASD you control your character, and with the arrow keys you can control the world. Using a mixture of your own movement along with rotating the world, you pass through varied environments to reach your goal.\n\nThe platforming in this game can be very difficult at times, and some sections feel like they come down to luck, especially when you have to rely on a swinging platform, which don't automatically return to their position after you fail. There are plenty of checkpoints scattered through the levels, so at least when you do fail you can get back to where you were pretty quickly.\n\nI found the music to be really grating, and I turned it off after a bit. The graphics look pencil drawn, which can be impressive when done well, but I didn't find them to be all that attractive.\n\nWorld manipulation was at one time pretty unique, but now it seems it makes its way into almost every platform game. While this was a good gimmick upon release, it doesn't really hold up years later when its so common. There is not enough else to hold this game together.

It's classic running & jumping combined with the ability to rotate the game world in 90° and 180° steps. While this core gameplay is not too innovative, I liked the additionial mechanics that came with it, like rotating the world to change the direction of a flame in order to burn an obstacle.\n\nThis game's soundtrack seems to be composed entirely by human voices, which is nice and quirky to listen to. Like the audio, the graphical presentation is pleasantly different as well. In the later levels the game gets really trippy, moreso than you can see on the screenshots. Overall, AYIM seems somewhat strange, but not in a bad way at all.\n\nGame's pretty short, you won't need more than 2 or 3 hours to beat it, though there's additional play modes like time trial or survival and achievements to get.\n\nI had fun playing AYIM, but because of its short length I would recommend getting it when it's on sale, say.. 5 bucks at most.","May 11, 2014","true","2.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Rotations are made by steps of 90° or 180°. You have to be careful though, because you can only fall from so high before getting crushed to death in the process. And you keep your momentum even after rotating, so don't expect to cheat death by a last-minute rotation.\n\nYou will suffer tens or hundreds of deaths, but AYIM remains causal and mostly frustration-free, thanks to infinite lifes and the most generous distribution of checkpoints to ever grace a video game. Which also makes the gotcha-unfair kind of deaths much more tolerable than in other games.\n\nThe graphics are made of paper collages and give AYIM a look that remains unique and distinct, even all these years after its release. I sometimes wished for more variety though, as there only are 4 or so "themes".\n\n"Music" is made of blip-bloop noisy soundscapes, which works very well  but, again, more variety would have been welcome.\n\nBeating the game should take about two hours, and I think that's about tight: the end came just before it would have started getting too repetitive. If you're so inclinded, various modes (speed runs, ...) are available to add replayability, but I think most people will be content to just play through this relatively basic game once.\n\nOverall, AYIM has enough personality to warrant a recommendation. It's certainly much better than what I expected from the "mixed" Steam user reviews. Because it was offered in several bundles, it lies unplayed in many people's backlog. If that's your case, I encourage you to give it a try. I think it's good enough to recommend a purchase, but there's no question that it's a bit short to justify the non-sale price tag.","March 31","true","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Its ease of play, requiring only a jump button and three types of world rotation (Left, Right, and 180 degrees), makes it a cinch to pick up and understand. The mileage the developers got out of such simple mechanics is pretty amazing. From start to finish, you're presented with tons of unique challenges and brain teasers to sort out, with ideas hardly ever repeating aside from making sure you're mastering the fundamentals. And Yet It Moves is always throwing something new at you, which makes it easy to wanna try "just one more level" before you finally either shut it down for the night or complete it.\n\nThe only real issues with the game crop up with the sometimes wonky physics. At times it's hard to gauge when a fall will kill you and other times objects in a stage can react a little inconsistent creating some scenarios that will lead to multiple deaths, or on in one case I encountered, leave you stuck completely, which required a stage restart.\n\nThat said, the bad doesn't in any way outweigh the good, and if you're into puzzley platformers then you definitely need to give this one a spin.","August 13, 2014","true","7.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitetigershiro/recommended/18700/","whitetigershiro","Shiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitetigershiro/","450 products in account","And Yet It Moves is a quirky little platformer with the interesting mechanic of rotating the level to progress.  While some games have used it as a gimmick for a single level or area, none have really explored the mechanic in the way that AYIM does.  The entire world rotates around the player-character, quite literally, and not only does the rotation effect his gravity, but that of the physics within the world.  The game uses this shifting gravity to require the player to solve not only platforming puzzles, but puzzles where the physics of in-game objects need to be manipulated through a maze, or a flame needs to be pointed in a certain direction.\n\nUnfortunately, for all its uniqueness, And Yet does have a few glaring flaws that can make it difficult to enjoy.  Sometimes it's unclear where to travel next, requiring the player to just hurdle himself around the level trying to figure it out.  Some areas feel unfairly trial-and-error-based, killing the player with a hurdle that they couldn't possibly have known about, requiring them to go back to the checkpoint and retry now that they actually know what's expected of them.  The second act in the jungle comes to a screeching halt when the player is required to navigate platforming challenges that use bamboo stick trampolines with clumsy timing.  The player needs to gain enough air before rotating in order to make it to the next platform, but the game doesn't do a very good job of indicating when the jump button is meant to be pushed.  This leads to a lot of trial and error where even when getting it right, the player can still be left confused as to the timing needed.\n\nOver-all though, it's a unique gem in a sea of copycat wannabes.  For all it's flaws, I still give this game a recommendation simply out of its uniqueness.  While the game does admittedly drag for the second act, it makes-up for it in the third act.  The game is at its weakest when it wants the player to fumble about with clumsy physics like in Act 2, but it's at it's absolute best when it's exploring ways to challenge the way the player needs to think around the rotation physics to navigate through an area.  That's why Act 3 really shines; it keeps the physics light, and instead focuses on requiring fast thinking while the player navigates through some well-designed obstacle courses.\n\nAnd Yet It Moves is far from perfect, but chip past the slog of the levels that don't work that well, and it can be easy to see the diamond hiding behind it all.  If you're the kind of gamer who doesn't like dealing with the bugbears of an inexperienced developer, then it might be better to move on, but if you're someone who's willing to let unique gameplay excuse a few poor design choices, then this is a game that cannot be missed.  You'll be hardpressed to find another like it.","September 17, 2014","true","5.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/recommended/18700/","wirdjos5","Wirdjos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/","89 products in account","And Yet It Moves centers itself around a natural twist for the puzzle-platformer genre: if the jump is too long, then make the platform come to you. This ability to freely rotate the level does open up new strategies and keeps things fresh - though the 'freely' of that equation did not survive the transition to PC. In the Steam version of this game, rotation is locked to 90 or 180 degrees at a time, a fact the levels don't seem to have been optimized for. The main 'journey' of the game isn't terribly long - there's no story, implied or otherwise - but it does have the good grace to end before the interesting ideas run out.\nA variety of challenge modes and a few bonus levels help to extend And Yet It Move's playtime, but this is where its lack of polish really shines (or fails to as the case may be). The little paper avatar is incredibly fragile. A short fall by any other platformer's reckoning will tear him to pieces. The generosity of the main journey's checkpoints ensured this didn't become too much of a nuisance, but the increased difficulty of the bonus levels and the extra restrictions of the challenge modes negated said checkpoint's efforts. This makes for a painful experience, so much so that I found myself judging what I'd enjoyed earlier in a dimmer light. The ambient noises and the constant chime of having reached the next checkpoint are absent from the bonus levels as are the strange collaged images that make up the standard levels, leaving a dull and empty world behind. It's ironic that a game made from torn pages would end feeling rough and a bit flat, but without this sour finishing note, I imagine I would have left pleased - not ecstatic, but pleased at least.","May 19","false","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On top of that, I’d found myself avoid computer games habitually since my recent move to Durango, CO, and so I’m not sure I’ll ever get a chance to play, let alone truly appreciate, many of the fantastic independent titles I can now call my own.\n\nMy aversion aside, I saw As Yet It Moves in my library has a very high meta-score according to Steam; I’d briefly tried the game when I’d purchased my first bundle, but found the controls frustrating and the art bizarre.\n\nOh how wrong was I.\n\nAllowing myself to actually play the game, I quickly found it ingenious; the core mechanic is that of a platform game, but you can rotate the world 90 degrees whenever you choose. Simple, and probably not entirely innovative, but it is done so smoothly and so cleverly that I was riveted the whole game through. The puzzles showcased the bizarre logic of a rotating world, and the paper cut-out art became increasingly charming and colorful throughout the levels. The controls occasionally frustrated me, some sort of cue on screen to help me intuit which way I would rotate the camera with each button may have helped me, but ultimately it wasn’t a big deal – and maybe my brain grew a few new connections.\n\nI see the studio, Broken Rules, have made a new game called Chasing Aurora… I might just give it a try.","November 1, 2013","true","3.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The game is short; sometimes trippy, sometimes frustrating.\n\nThe art style is cutout-fashion, reminiscent of an Eric Carle book.  There is no story line.  Supposedly you are the protagonist, trying to find his home in a land of rotating paper.  There is no voice acting.

Now for the actual review.\n\nAnd yet It Moves is a puzzle platformer whose primary mechanic involves rotating the world around your character. The graphical style looks like cutouts from a piece of paper, and remains pretty unique to this day. However, the mechanics/hit detection/acceleration detection can be spotty at times, and the movement feels....un-fluid. Your character pauses every time the world rotates, the movement is slow, acceleration can be difficult to judge so that sometimes you'll die from a fall without expecting, and other times you'll live without any real expectation of doing so.\n\nThe game's alright - if you're really into puzzle platformers, it's definitely worth a look. It just feels a little rough around the edges, and (particularly this many years after release) the asking price is probably a little steep.","May 30, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Is the gameplay really that bad, you ask?  Honestly I don't know, as not once have I been able to play this game!  Every single time I try to boot this game it leads to a black screen while sounds play in the background, but the game never loads.  Worse yet, this black screen seems to lock my system and the only way to escape it is to physically power off my system and restart it.  Originally I thought this meant that something was wrong with my system, but after scouring the forums for this game it appears that several other people have encountered the exact same problem.  Even worse, if you look at the forums for the developer's second game (Rætikon), you'll see people complaining about not being able to boot that game either!  Long story short, there's obviously something wrong with the way this developer makes their games.  I've tried contacting them through the discussion boards for the game on Steam, but have received no reply.  (To be fair, the developer hasn't posted anything there in over a year and a half.)  I've also messaged support on the official website for this game, but have never received a reply.  I submitted a Steam refund request based on this, but was denied.  In short, I'm stuck paying money for a game that I cannot even play.  This game looks decent enough and those that have played it seem to indicate that it's an ok experience, but there's a very real chance that you might not ever get it to work.  If you feel like gambling perhaps it's worth it, but otherwise there are much better ways to spend your money on Steam.  0/10, as I spent money for nothing.","October 9, 2015","false","0.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

For how short the game is, there's quite a lot of level recycling as well.

To this game I'd have given 5-6 out of 10, yet (or therefore) I decided not to recommend the game and not even finish it...\n\nAnd Yet It Moves is a normal platformer with a twist which makes it quiet interesting and challanging - you're not simply moving your character but also rotating the world around in and affecting some other objects as well that way. Despite the interesting idea the game still felt somewhat sparse and lacking for me.\n\nAt first the game pretty much flows but on more advanced levels you may find yourself a bit stuck like I did. Which means that the game is challanging, of course, but when I quit the feeling like I'm playing for ages and saw I've only played 72 minutes IN TOTAL, I realized something's just not right.\n\nThe game seems pretty short (I think I've finished about half of the levels in those 72 minutes) and yet sometimes is challanging, and requires skill and patience. Which I usually have, but on this one it just felt like it's not worth it.\nWhile it is kinda interesting, as I already said, it still ended up feeling like an ordinary platformer for me, without too much content beyond the 'platforming'.\nThe graphics are very special but everything you see got a little repetitive in my opinion.\nThere's no music at all, barely any sounds, which could add a lot.\nStory doesn't exist.\nThere are additional gameplay modes which I didn't spend too much time on because I didn't enjoy that much the 'regular' mode.\n\nI can't help but feeling a bit bad about writing these things and abandoning the game, because I can't say it's bad, and I this it is very original and has interesting ideas. But it still didn't get me finish the game, although it is so short. So short, that I'm not even sure whether it should cost those 10 bucks.\n\nI guess some people would really like that, but personally I think this game could be way better.","May 9, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As others have pointed out the higher achievements and games modes were an afterthought and not many people would delve into these. Thus the game does feel a bit short. I prefer to play this with a controller as it feels more natural for a platformer style game (I didn't play much Jazz Jackrabbit or Commander Keen back in the day) and the trigger buttons are perfect for the rotation mechanic. The puzzles aren't too hard and are all the visual style puzzles that don’t require an explanation. The momentum mechanic is difficult to get used to as it's very easy to pick up too much speed and not be able to land without breaking apart but it is a nice change from the standard "your character can only jump an x distance before dying". I recommend this game as a casual game to relax with for a short sitting as that's how I feel it was meant to be played.","November 21, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There is an opening above you, but you can’t jump high enough to reach it.  What to do?  Easy.  Rotate the world around you.\n\nAnd Yet It Moves is a smart little platformer with unique papercraft graphics. There is no story to speak of, simply a set of gorgeous and inventive levels to jump, fall, and rotate through.\n\nYour little hand-drawn guy is pretty fragile and weak, as far as games go.  He can only be moving so fast before impact with the ground or an object will break him, causing the scraps of paper he’s made of to go flying off in different directions.  He also cannot jump very high, at least until you rotate the world and shift gravity 90 degrees.\n\nSimply solve the environmental puzzles to move on in each level.  There are no collectables to chase down, no secret rooms to find. This is platforming in a pure, unadulterated sense.  The game does offer challenges to its limited level list through limiting you to not walking, or to a limited number of rotations, or time trials.  These are all enjoyable enough but not necessary to really enjoy the game.  You have to beat every level to unlock those modes anyway.\n\nThe beautifully simple graphics are a real pleasure.  The ripped paper edges on everything lend a sense of imagination to this game, like you’re watching someone daydream in middle school art class.  The music and sound effects are subtle and quiet, and they don’t try to give this game emotional impact or tension it doesn’t need.  This is a game about exploration and experimentation, not conquest or drama.  Everything about its presentation reflects that.\n\nThe game can be unforgiving at times, as it can be a little difficult to tell when you are accelerating too much and have no hope to survive a fall.  Luckily checkpoints are pretty evenly spaced.  You will find yourself repeating somewhat simple sections of the level to reach the actual challenging puzzles though.  But I’m really searching to find these minor quibbles.\n\nAnd Yet It Moves is a great little “artsy” game.  Go play it if you want a unique, though simple, platforming experience.","December 13, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As with most users, I've amassed quite the collection.  I want to at least experience most of these games to the point where a real reviewer might play if they were pressed for time.  Gaming is a hobby for me, so I don't always complete games that I'm not completely enjoying.\n\nAYIM is one of the games where I can see the appeal. The puzzles in the early game get you used to the controls, challenge you a little bit, and even having you thinking "How am I supposed to get through this?" Exactly what a game like this should really aim to do, and it did that well.\n\nHowever, I found myself being extremely frustrated at certain points in the game.  The premier example of this for me was when you first encounter the "flint and steel" mechanic in the game.  I usually try to figure games out by myself, especially in puzzle games.  However, I had to resort to figuring out what the heck I had to do from Google to get through this section (killing the beehive)  which completely kills the immersion for me.  There was no explination of how  you should try to get through this section, and it seemed very unintuitive how it worked.  Eventually after a few searches of "How do I get past the beehive + and yet it moves" on google, I found the solution.\n\nThen I hit another section that required you to do the same mechanic time and time again.  I knew what I needed to do to progress but with how the game works and the requirements, I became incredibly frustrated again.\n\nThat's when I put the game down.  I realized that this puzzle game was not for me. I can see how some would like it; The art style is great, the music draws  you in, and the control over gravity and the camera is a neat mechanic.  However, I just really didn't like playing.  I can't quite put my finger on exactly what turned me off to the game, but I'm fairly done with it for a while.\n\nHowever, I do recommend this game to anyone that has it or has the chance to get it for cheap.  It's in Humble Bundles all the time, and it's one of the cheaper games on Steam, while providing a great artistic puzzle experience.  I got plenty of entertainment out of it and I might pick it up again at some point, but for now I'll move on to the next game without an incredibly bitter taste in my mouth.","December 22, 2013","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unlike The Bridge, you can only lock into 4 set perspectives that are at right angles from each other (up, down, left, right). The gameplay is a lot more active than the Bridge also, as in... you can jump. I have to say that I didn't get much enjoyment out of a lot of the levels and was exceedingly frustrated with the bouncy bamboo sticks (the jumping mechanism sucks and if you jump too late, your character will jump as soon as he gets back to the ground, resetting your momentum. Not fun.\n\nThe thing that kept me playing were the hilarious bosses, which were honestly the most fun and least frustrating challenges of the game, the bosses don't always readily present themselves and sometimes you'll beat them before you ever realize that it was even a boss, but all of them are really creative and make the game worth a short play-through (by short i mean, I played the whole game in less than 4 hours). I enjoyed These end of the level challenges and after the first third of the game, the main challenges of the level make up the back half of each level, so the levels from chapter 2 and 3 are way more fun.\n\nThe credits are awesome and I honestly believe that all games should follow a similar mold. No spoilers though, you'll have to spend 1 dollar and 3ish hours to find out what it is. Even though it wasn't really one of my top favorites, it was short and to the point and didn't drag on longer than was fun.\n\nOverall Score: 7.0/10","May 20, 2014","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because the levels are comprised of ripped and torn up paper, and even your character is paper, it looks a lot different to almost every game out there, even now, several years after its release, considering a lot of indie games go for the 8-bit look.\n\nThis is a very fun game, but it still comes with moments of frustration. The tilting of the screen to move between areas is done pretty well I thought, but there are stages where your timing and approach need to be more than exact, and it can get frustrating dying 20+ times in a row. While it does get repetitive, you're basically doing the same thing the entire game, just walking and rotating the level, it does look really cool and makes for a different game world.\n\nIt's a nice little indie game that you can lose yourself in for a bit. If you haven't played it, pick it up, maybe when it's on sale, and give it a go. 7/10","May 29, 2014","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game play mechanics are annoying, awkward, slow, and unintuitive. The repetitiveness in death is only a replacement for actual game content and game play. The puzzles are like chores, and not actually fun or entertaining. Within fifteen minutes you will grasp and understand the small amount of amusement this game offers, while at the same time growing tired of playing it with each passing minute. It is a lesson in poor game design and lack of creativity. There are barely any sounds nor music. There is no charm, fun, creativity, nor intrigue. And Yet It Moves is another independent showcasing of what game development should steer clear from. It is a cheap, short, flat, unexciting, unexceptional, deficient attempt at game design. There is nothing to see nor experience here. It is a freeware game disguised with an exorbitant asking price from developers who obviously lack shame and humility. And Yet It Moves is inadequate in every fathomable way, and it exemplifies everything that gaming should not be about. There is no actual game content and no game play.

It has cutout graphics and practically no sounds, it's all very simplistic, yet it doesn't have that clean look most of the other simplistic games have. The environments and character have plenty of detail actually, and that's partially because they're wrinkled and all.\nAnyway, the gameplay revolves around turning the level around using the cursor keys. So, as an example, if you see a small tunnel in front of you, that you really can't enter, you just turn the level around so you can drop into it.\nHowever, it's not just turning the levels around the entire game. You do walk around on your own. You also have to be careful that you're not falling too hard/fast or you'll have to restart from the checkpoint. Later in the game you'll also have to solve small puzzles and defeat enemies the same way you walk around.\nLike I said, it's solid.

I don't mean indie as in independently developed and published (although that's the case). I mean indie like hipsters before hipsters were hipsters. Back when they were just into indie stuff, I mean. This game is indie because it's a bunch of torn up paper, like the paper bags you used to get your groceries in before you started using canvas bags to be even more sustainable, and especially before someone told you that paper bags actually cause more pollution than plastic bags because they take more energy to produce. And the sound your character makes when he dies is a sort of "swoosh' sound that some guy makes with his mouth, which is totally indie. In any case this game is pretty great and if you're high because you got some dank nugs, this will either be a great experience or far too complex. Warning: game has bats. Hunter S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiyaki/recommended/18700/","Kiyaki","トップハットのきやき","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiyaki/","320 products in account","It's been some time since I played this game, but I surprisingly remember it rather well...and well, I suppose I can't really recommend it, based on memory.\n\nI'll be frank. I got AYIM as a single piece of one of Steam's first Indie Bundles. I played and completed it only on virtue of crossing it off my list of "Steam Games that I actually beat." It was interesting...at first. By the end of it however, it became more frustrating than fun.\n\nFirst off, the game is very short, and I remember completing it very quickly. Steam clocks my total play time at two hours total, and I have a tendency to leave a game open when I go away from my computer, so some of that time was more than likely not even spent playing the game. It was short enough that I remember thinking that I would have been irritated had I not gotten it as part of a bundle...but at the same time, I probably would not have gotten it period in any other case.\n\nThe game would best be described as a surreal puzzle platformer. It is built entirely around the gimmick that you have the ability to rotate the the level 90° left or right at any given time. Initially, it is a rather fun gimmick, but as the game drags on, it ultimately doesn't introduce anything new. Aside from that one concept, everything else is derivative of ever other platformer ever; booster jumps, disappearing platforms, time puzzles, etc. If you're a hardcore Platformer, than this probably wouldn't bother you, but to me, it got very, very old.\n\nThe other major...aspect(?) of the game would be it's art style. It is very styalized and surreal, as if you're playing some kind of modern painting in an art museum. It really is a love it or hate it kind of thing. I can't say it bothered me, but I can also say that it didn't particularly add to the game in any way for me either. There's only one level I recall that actually made really good use of the strangeness of the theme. It begins with you getting bit by a giant snake...and well, everything goes from there. I won't spoil it for anyone who intends to play because well, it was the only level that I can say I really really enjoyed.\n\nAll and all, I can't recommend the game overall. To me, the gimmick fell flat rather fast and it turned into a tedious "Ugh, how much longer do I have of this crap?" in the long run. However, if you're a fan of surreal art or gimmick platformers, there may be something here for you. Even then though, I'd at least make sure there was a deep discount going.","December 16, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visual and audio style is a little odd to me, but it works well as a whole, even when it veers toward creepy or psychedelic.  Rotating the world occasionally has surprising effects, several of which must be mastered to finish the game.\n\nReplayability is limited, and the completionist will be annoyed at the insane difficulty of certain (most?) achievements, but the experienced platformer looking for novelty will enjoy this for a few hours.","October 10, 2014","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is really great idea!\n\nI've tried first long time ago, from Humble Bundle, and played a bit. Didn't draw me "inside". When added to Steam I've tried it again with similar result. I don't mind lack of a music in background at all, I feel it is adequate to minimalistic graphic design. It has sound effects so it is not completly silent. I love the idea of moveing around not only the char but the world as well. For me it was a first game with such idea. This game is graphically interesting but not great. Bit boring levels.\n\n+ promising and simple idea\n+ not an easy game\n+ good puzzles\n+ quite balanced (I've played much more than 0.5 h but still starting levels)\n+ graphicaly nice\n\n- graphicaly nice but specific sp may be disliked by most\n- for me it went boring\n- I didn't connect with the character / The game didin't pull me into its world\n\nHowever, I cannot recomend it 100%.\nOn some discount it's worth a try - maybe for you it will be more interesting.","December 30, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiyaki/recommended/18700/","Kiyaki","トップハットのきやき","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiyaki/","320 products in account","It's been some time since I played this game, but I surprisingly remember it rather well...and well, I suppose I can't really recommend it, based on memory.\n\nI'll be frank. I got AYIM as a single piece of one of Steam's first Indie Bundles. I played and completed it only on virtue of crossing it off my list of "Steam Games that I actually beat." It was interesting...at first. By the end of it however, it became more frustrating than fun.\n\nFirst off, the game is very short, and I remember completing it very quickly. Steam clocks my total play time at two hours total, and I have a tendency to leave a game open when I go away from my computer, so some of that time was more than likely not even spent playing the game. It was short enough that I remember thinking that I would have been irritated had I not gotten it as part of a bundle...but at the same time, I probably would not have gotten it period in any other case.\n\nThe game would best be described as a surreal puzzle platformer. It is built entirely around the gimmick that you have the ability to rotate the the level 90° left or right at any given time. Initially, it is a rather fun gimmick, but as the game drags on, it ultimately doesn't introduce anything new. Aside from that one concept, everything else is derivative of ever other platformer ever; booster jumps, disappearing platforms, time puzzles, etc. If you're a hardcore Platformer, than this probably wouldn't bother you, but to me, it got very, very old.\n\nThe other major...aspect(?) of the game would be it's art style. It is very styalized and surreal, as if you're playing some kind of modern painting in an art museum. It really is a love it or hate it kind of thing. I can't say it bothered me, but I can also say that it didn't particularly add to the game in any way for me either. There's only one level I recall that actually made really good use of the strangeness of the theme. It begins with you getting bit by a giant snake...and well, everything goes from there. I won't spoil it for anyone who intends to play because well, it was the only level that I can say I really really enjoyed.\n\nAll and all, I can't recommend the game overall. To me, the gimmick fell flat rather fast and it turned into a tedious "Ugh, how much longer do I have of this crap?" in the long run. However, if you're a fan of surreal art or gimmick platformers, there may be something here for you. Even then though, I'd at least make sure there was a deep discount going.","December 16, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In And Yet It Move you play as a piece of paper in a paper world.  You have to manipulate gravity in order to reach the end of every level. It is a good mix of both 2D platforming and puzzle solving that keeps you hooked till the end. The controls are spot on and the level design is well done. As for the visuals they can be considered art among games. This game looks like an interactive art museum and you are a scrap of paper exploring it. Checkpoints are frequent and there are infinite live so although the game is challenging it is not unforgiving. It is a short game however but there is a time trial mode so at least there is something for replay value. If you see it on sale pick it up especially if you are into indie or 2D puzzle games.","December 2, 2012","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game frustrated me, due to the heavy reliance on physics-based puzzles (which I hate). Puzzles that have an element of chance, rather than solid deductive reasoning aren't puzzles... they're obstacles.\n\nThat said, this game has an interesting style brought fourth by hand-drawn and scanned ripped pieces of paper. It isn't exactly pretty, but I admire effort gone into making this outlandish style. The music is similarly strange, with most of the tracks and sound effects achieved by human verbal sounds (check out the trailer and you'll see what I mean). The music was the highlight of the game for me, evoking a very melancholic mood.\n\nIn the end it's a fairly straightforward puzzle platformer that won't challenge your brain or reflexes, but scores some artistic merit.

I think I was drunk and thought it was Waking Mars.\n\nI usually like platformers, but this was a bit difficult to suffer through.  There is no story or clear motivation for you to get to the end of the game other than achievements.  The gimmick here is that you can turn the world, something that is common in platformers nowadays, but this game somehow does it wrong.  Your character bumps slides and bounces off of everything and fall damage keeps you from really having fun with the mechanic.  Much of the music and sounds in the game are made by someone beat boxing into a microphone making the game sound like an episode of Doug, which gets annoying fast.  The early levels are a cave and a forest, both are really bland, but then in chapter three you get bit by a snake and start tripping; the levels and music becomes much better.  There are mods though, they can make the game a bit more fun.\n\nI can see how some people might like this game, but I can't recommended it to anyone at any price higher than two dollars.\n\n","December 29, 2013","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In And Yet It Move you play as a piece of paper in a paper world.  You have to manipulate gravity in order to reach the end of every level. It is a good mix of both 2D platforming and puzzle solving that keeps you hooked till the end. The controls are spot on and the level design is well done. As for the visuals they can be considered art among games. This game looks like an interactive art museum and you are a scrap of paper exploring it. Checkpoints are frequent and there are infinite live so although the game is challenging it is not unforgiving. It is a short game however but there is a time trial mode so at least there is something for replay value.

Add to this an upbeat, unusual soundtrack and the game is a pleasant romp about increasingly unusual environments.\n\nIt may even seem too short, yet the game is in some way open to mods, challenges and achievements to keep your interest if the game captures you enough to dig deeper into it. I may even revisit it sometime later, but for now, the campaign was enough to satisfy me, enough so that I very much recommend playing it if it's in your backlog or picking it up if you want a very unique "puzzle platformer". It's odd to call it a platformer when you rotate more than you jump, yet it seems the most apt descriptor for it for the time being.\n\nAs to what rotation entails, it literally rotates the level about, letting you navigate vertical structures as if they were horizontal ground for your character. You can flip upside down and fall into the sky, if you like, or fall through the entire level if you're skilled enough (though you will almost certainly tear(i.e. die) upon reaching the end).","February 24, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To do that, here, not only do you have to jump around like every other game, you regularly have to rotate the world as well - turn it upside down and the floor becomes the ceiling, turn it sideways and that hole in the ground is now a tunnel.\n\nThe graphics are wonderful, made of torn papers and camera pictures, and emulates caverns, forests and all sorts of fantastic landscapes. There is no story (you really just have to go from point A to point B) but the world itself really makes up for it. The designers kept the essentials of the game and made it perfect. Just walking around and visiting the world is fun.\n\nI found it sufficiently challenging, not too much nor too little, but for those who want more, the bonus chapter are the end are much more difficult.

The presentation is kooky verging on surreal. You control a little paper puppet who moves through an organic seeming world put together with torn up photographs of nature and bits of bark and leaves. The subtle, percussive soundtrack is supposedly someone beatboxing adding the atmospheric icing on the cake. The overall presentation seems more like an art project than a game and while I couldn't decide if I liked the aesthetic or not while playing, it had won me over by the end.\n\nThe game itself is a non-traditional platformer. Its main mechanic is based on the fact that the entire world of the game can be spun in 360 degrees around the player's avatar while the gravity stays the same. When the player reaches the end of a platform that is blocked by a wall, the world can be translated 90 degrees and suddenly the wall is a new platform to walk on. In a way, AYIM makes a nice companion piece to VVVVVV - another platformer whose gameplay mechanic is to flip gravity so that ceilings and floors become interchangeable. What separates AYIM from VVVVVV, though, is the inclusion of puzzles that add variety to the gameplay. While at the start, you merely try to make it to the checkpoint, there are small game-within-a-game sections that make use of the rotation mechanic. One crazy section requires you to feed a banana to a monkey by making rotations in a way that's reminiscent of playing a marble labyrinth. And in other sections you simultaneously control the main character plus its mirror image for a challenge that retro-gamers will be familiar with. These little puzzles and others add depth and variety to a game that, due to its duration, probably could have gotten away without them. It is rewardingly rich however and I found it to have a good balance of content and finished just as I was beginning to tire of it.\n\nI did begin to tire of AYIM though, mainly in some places that I found to be punishingly difficult. The post-credits content, as expected, was extremely difficult but the difficulty didn't seem to be balanced throughout the game. I found there to be stretches that were quite straight forward only to reach a section that required 10s of respawns before continuing onto more straightforward gameplay. Various game-modes are unlocked while playing. These include time-trial modes and a mode that limits the number of rotations you can make. They sound like reasonable modes to have but in practice I found that the skill I picked up in playing and beating the game did not bring me close enough to feeling I could complete the special modes, and so did not feel motivated to complete them. It's interesting because AIYM isn't a precision platformer like a Super Mario game Controlling the little paper man is nowhere near as responsive, so doing speed-runs relies more on remembering how to navigate mazes and actualising more efficient world rotations. It takes the challenge a step above the traditional muscle memory play through. For my own personal tastes, though, pursuing those achievements was unrewarding.\n\nOn the upside though, there is a nice selection of in-game achievements to be unlocked. If you're like me and feel unmotivated to exercise high-skills in the special modes, there are still plenty of things to accomplish within the reach of mere mortals. They did get me playing through a selection of the levels again and gave me the feeling of accomplishing something other than playing it through from A to B.\n\nIn all I was pleased with the game and would happily recommend it to anyone who enjoys platform, casual or indie gaming.","March 4, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/18700/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Platformers are an indie darling. Nearly every developer that wants to make a name for themselves crafts an old-school throwback in the form of a Mario Clone. A lot of older games never dealt with the idea of gravity. "And Yet It Moves" attempts to rectify that.\n\nThe game's big gimmick is that the player can rotate the world at their whim. Similar to "Portal's" momentum based physics, AYIM keeps the player's momentum upon rotating. This is used to some great effect in a lot of the early puzzles. After awhile, this trajectory mainly acts as another form of death.\n\nAnother gimmick is the game's graphical design. Everything is taken from public domain images and pieced together to look like paper scraps. This is very eye catching and looks splendid in HD (something the Wii version doesn't have). When you die, your character splits apart and a lot of the interactive objects crumble a bit when touched. It stays true to the artistic vision of the designer.\n\nYou'd think an idea like gravity manipulation would eventually run out of steam, but I can't say one way or another. AYIM is so short that you'd be forgiven for feeling a little ripped off. The price isn't excruciating, but the game can be finished in a little under an hour.\n\nThe level design always features something new, so you never run out of content to surprise you. Even after finishing the game, a few bonus levels crop up that up the difficulty quite a bit. I can't even finish them all, despite beating this game originally in 2011.\n\nThe music is also quite wonderful. A few of the later levels base their jumps on rhythmic cues and the levels feature some trippy scenery. While it may be a bit typically for an indie game, at least the journey is fun. I just wish developers would stop utilizing the "light/dark" trope.\n\nSometimes the physics of the game get in the way. A rock might block your path or your character might get stuck between an object. I also had one of the enemies glitch out on me and render a level unbeatable. Nothing is too long, but it does suck to have to restart when being so close to the end.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this at full price, but "And Yet It Moves" is a very quality title. I don't think I'm as fond of it now as I was 4 years ago, but another platformer in the vein of "Braid" isn't really a bad thing. That the game has the courtesy to not waste the player's time is also a bonus.\n\n6.5/10","March 26, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, that doesn't happen...\n\nInstead, when you land, you die! That's because of the speed of your fall...

Instead, it makes the most out of collage-inspired backgrounds and immersive sounds.\n\nIt's a little short, so I would recommend buying during a sale.

Second is be sure you have an active internet connection.  The game constantly tries to compare your scores against the online leaderboards even if you have it set to not upload ghosts / times for your runs, and this for some reason equates to massive lag when pausing the game at any point or changing any setting (it doesn't make sense but its what the devs said was the reason for it).\n\nThis game is... okay?  Visually it doesn't offer much and the game mechanics themselves (directional gravity) aren't new or used innovatively by any stretch.  I'm about halfway through the 'Journey' (aka main game) mode, and I'm not really thrilled by anything I've done or experienced so far.  The music is nicely ambient and un-obnoxious, which could have been a big downfall but luckily wasn't.  Aside from that it seems to have some normal time trialing and challenge options, nothing fancy.","November 27, 2011","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
