Even the stairways look like they were plucked directly from Anor Londo. But! I'm not going to name it as a con.\n\nI'll start with the negative aspects:\n-Stiff as wood animations all around, which makes most enemy attacks look goofy. I swear, that tri-headed demon has a grab attack during which the protagonist stays completely still. Same goes for death animation - Leopold doesn't die per se, he just slouches a bit, looking depressed. It looks less like real combat and more like an elaborate game of pretend.\n\n-Strange AI. Some enemies aggro only when you stand uncomfortably close to them, but can be provoked by locking on from afar. Which trivializes one of the bossfights, since you pick enemies one by one, lead them in a corner, then bash their heads in with a halberd.\nSame goes for certain bosses - they feel a bit too easy, having extremely long windup animations and enormous amount of dead zones.\n\nWould probably need adjusting for the final release.\n\n-Not exactly memorable layout for the palace. Maybe it's intentional, but most rooms and hallways look copypasted to hell and back. 1 entrance+ 3 doors, with only 5 or so grand halls, and only 1 of them has at least something worth noticing (namely the giant statue). I can understand if striving for minimalism was a choice in design, but right now it doesn't provide that "hollow" feeling, it just looks unfinished. Fitting for an Early Access game, I suppose.\n\n\nNow for something good. It's going to be a much shorter list.\n\n-Ambience and music are well-done, amplifying the somber atmosphere of the game.\n-Story is...not particularly captivating, but it's mysterious enough to draw the player in.\n-Potential. Yeah, I don't really say that often, but the game certainly has potential. It's not gonna get any GOTYs, that's for sure, but I can see it as a pleasant experience in the near future.\nAll that, plus the fact that the game was made by one person (or at least that's what I've reckoned after doing some background check) really makes me want to recommend it.\n\nAnd I will. But keep in mind, my decision is swayed by the fact that I'm a sucker for these kinds of games.\n\nSo if you want to play low-budget version of Demon's/Dark Souls, you can pick it up after the full release and just pretend that you're playing a game made by FromSoft's F-team. Or G-team.","December 9, 2014","true","7.6"," 55 of 74 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","55","74","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/318860/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSoft sprinklings of piano overwhelmed by the haziness of a roaring snowstorm, a melancholy scene of blurry white as our protagonist sits listening under the dome of an ancient structure. As we enter into this hellish palace however, the player realizes something is different; something ominous and evil.\n\nYou awake in a familiar and darkened library of a palace, the demonic statues peering down from before you as the crackling of a fireplace is heard. At first little is known of the surroundings we've become enshrouded by other than the need to explore and escape it. As you scour the dark hallways portraits and statues of former inhuman residents sit proudly on shelves and grotesque, surreal paintings line the walls. One thing is being made clear to the player; this palace is not of any realm within human knowledge.\n\nVenturing deeper into the heart of this ghastly mansion of antique oddities you come across various personalities who seem to be old acquaintances that have anticipated your arrival. They speak to you in cryptic messages bearing skeletal faces with no skin, claiming to wear their "masks of flesh" no longer. According to these dark personalities, this hellish realm is your home and where you belong.\n\nWill you succumb to their wishes and remain a piece of the palace enshrouded by snow and demonic mysteries, or will you escape the overshadowing blizzard with your life and defeat the chaotic souls that rule the pits of this Dante Alighieri's "Inferno" inspired Hell?\n\nFor a combat system that seems so simple, it offers a lot of variety in how you strategically approach each foul demon of Hell encountered in this strange palace. Tapping attack gives you quick but weak swings with your metal spear in rapid succession, whereas pressing forward in time with a swing performs a heavy lunge attack. As useful and strong as the lunge attacks are they leave you wide open to counters and should be saved for a final blow. Pressing back in time with a swing creates a quick back-step maneuver that the player will be forced to rely on to time and escape deadly blows and create the perfect opportunity for a counter attack.\n\nWhile it may not be as deep or flashy as the Dark Souls series, Malebolgia is clearly striving for the same kind of slow and calculated approach to long and brutal encounters with single diabolical creatures ranging from slow, lurching ghouls to terrifying and majestic chimeras. Endurance is the key to your survival as you go toe-to-toe with your enemy blocking, bashing, and taking only the most ample of opportunities to lunge and make your final strike.\n\nMalebolgia has a striking visual style and while many will find the minimalistic, archaic design of the palace to be drab it provides a deliberately moody and heavy atmosphere all around you. The muted and dull colors with black and white checkered floors bring out the distinct red found in various books or curtains, all looking like something out of Twin Peak's dreamlike "Red Room" scenes.\n\nThe chilling ambiance of the background music fits the harsh imagery, sounding like something straight out of the torture chambers of a medieval castle. The monsters are brought to life with ghastly grunts and haunting chants from later magical enemies that ring in your ears as you attempt to focus your energy into dodging beams of their evil energy.\n\nMalebolgia is a game that clearly puts an emphasis on atmosphere in the end, and it succeeds in providing a genuinely strange and creepy encounter many times over. The combat provides just enough engagement through your exploration of the surreal surroundings to keep you on your toes and wondering in fear which frightening creature will be around the corner to greet you next.\n\ntl;dr\nWith an already considerable amount of love and care put into patches and overall polish to the look and feel of the game, this is proving to be another one of the finer examples of exciting Early Access experiences to be a part of. Malebolgia's halls are already a deranged pleasure to explore and clearly hold even more potential for odd secrets and other cryptic strangeness, I'm eagerly anticipating what other surprises Jochen has in store.","January 16, 2015","true","14.5"," 45 of 62 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","45","62","6","0"

You play as a man named Leopold confined to the Palace Malebolgia. You fight for your life battling demons who have took over the palace and now rule it.\n\nPROS\nAmazing looking game and environments.\nCool story with satisfying ending.\nSpooky and is full of mystery.\nFun yet challenging boss fights.\nCan have your health and attack upgraded.  CONS\nThere isn’t much telling you what to do or where to go. Can leave you wandering around for a while.\nCombat is hard to get a hold of. But similar to the Dark Souls combat system.\nHealing is based off lighting candles. Only found in doorways and sometimes there are none. You will also need to light a couple to get back to full health.\nMap system is hard to use and read, yet sometimes necessary to use. OTHER FEATURES\nOther things in the game that really could be good or bad.\nConfined to one weapon, your halberd.\nSave system is based off finding a clock, only a few within the entire game.\nCan find “shields”. Locations of them will change and sometimes are necessary for boss fights. Overall this game was a lot of fun and made me wanting to go back and beat it. And I will probably be going back to play it again soon. But like I said, it is hard to know what you are supposed to be doing at first and it can be easy to get lost. By the end of the game you should know your way around fairly well and have a good idea of what’s going on. I’m not sure if it’s worth the base price but on sale is totally worth it.

Dev has done a good job compensating for lower modeling and graphics.\n- Decent playtime of around 6hr\n\nCons\n\n-Combat can be dull for normal enemies and controls can be a bit wonky at times.\n-Story can be a bit hard to follow and the objective hint is not always helpful, though I find it rather refreshing to have a game that doesn't just put checkpoint arrows everywhere you need to be. Pacing your gameplay can leave you wandering around wondering where you left off however.\n\n\nDev set out to make an indie Dark Souls-esque and Malebogia accomplishes that goal.

The difficult controls, unforgiving block system, and confusing map left me scratching my head. However, I am one to always try to finish a game, no matter how bad it is, so I pushed on.\n\nI'm so glad I did. This game really comes into its own later on. The map design becomes more intuitive as you continue to explore and the layout of the castle begins to take shape. The story, while rather confusing, had me intrigued. The combat became more fun and intense once I began relying on dodging instead of blocking.\n\nPros:\nCel-shaded graphics style\nInteresting and unique story\nSatisfying combat\nGreat map design\nA great developer who interacts with the community\nFantastic enemy design that keeps you on your toes\n\nCons:\nNo graphics options besides resolution, windowed, and shadow settings\nVague story\nFrustrating combat and exploration at first\nAs of this writing, the game's achievements are not working properly.\n(EDIT: There has been an update that apparantly fixes the achievements, so you can ignore this last point.)\n\nIf you're willing to ride out the confusing and frustrating first half hour or so, then I highly recommend this game, particularly to fans of the Souls series.

My initial problems were never with the world, or atmosphere. The dark castle makes me want to explore and uncover its secrets, and there is a foreboding of dread as you open each door. The gameplay is reminiscent of the souls games, but without the high grade of polish. However, the recent update has addressed some of its issues, and I hope more will come to fully flesh it out. The update has added side-stepping, which expands your combat options, and also increased the speed of the players attacks, making combat more reliable. It has grown from an experience that I had to persevere through in order to see what is truly a compelling world to something much more enjoyable. In a future update, I think the addition of unlocked combat would truly complete the system (the ability to attack and dodge without having to be locked on). I recommend this game and look forward to any future improvements.","May 27, 2015","true","6.8"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

I took around 6, though nearly an hour of that was trying to find a specific boss to progress.\n\nSCORE:\n3.5 out of 10\n\nEven though I started this game with great interest, I truly struggle to find positive things to say about it.  Despite what other reviewers have said, this is a far cry from Dark Souls.  But even without that unjustified comparison affecting my expectations, I would have been disappointed.\n\nIf the combat weren't so bland and unpolished, I could tolerate some of the other negative aspects of the game.  Having to explore to figure out where to go isn't necessarily bad, repetitive visuals make sense in a castle, a story told vaguely or indirectly can still be good, and animation isn't everything.  But all of these things become noticeable cons when the gameplay itself consists only of using the same two attacks and backwards dash (and occasionally timed blocking) against every enemy.  It doesn't help that, despite having a halberd, the player's attacks don't seem to have much greater range than enemies' claw swipes, or that a lot of combat takes place in confined areas with little room to dodge or make use of a halberd's range anyway.\n\nI realize that the developer is one person, but simple changes like faster attack and movement speed and a sideways dash (see UPDATE 2 below) would go a long way to improving the combat, though it will always probably be clunky and bland.  This in turn would make some of the other negatives more bearable.  The trouble is that, right now, no feature of the game is impressive enough to distract from the other shortcomings.\n\nFor its bland combat, meager story, poor direction, and repetitive environments, I give this game a 3.5 out of 10.\n\nUPDATE 1:  Apparently, the tutorial boss fight on each start-up is a sort of loading screen.  If one waits long enough, the game loads.  However, this is not made clear, so it is still a misstep.\n\nUPDATE 2:  In response to popular demand, the developer implemented faster player attack speed and a sideways dash, which does indeed improve the combat practically, but also aesthetically, as the player character can move more fluidly.  I have boosted my score (originally a 2.5 out of 10) accordingly.  However, this does not drastically improve the game as a whole, so the boost in score is small.","May 22, 2015","false","7.5"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","26","40","0","3"

I enjoyed this game for the most part.\n\nThe visuals are beautiful and very clever.  I really enjoyed the striking contrast of the colours with the simplistic polygon style.  Malebolgia comes off as clean and never overpowering or crowded. I loved the use of light and the torchlight really lent itself to the atmosphere.  I particularly enjoyed as the game progressed through the acts, the atmosphere became darker without being too obvious.  If there's any critique to be made, I feel that Leopold's model could play with light and shadow a little better, as he was a bit awkward looking at times.  I also understand that it's much more difficult to have light interact with dynamic objects though, so I am not too bothered. I also thought that important NPC's could have more defined models, as some of them share models with regular monsters.\n\nI enjoyed the OST for this game.  Very atmospheric and well done. I also enjoy a game that can appreciate  silence as  important in setting tone for a scene or area.\n\nNarrative is great.  I enjoy games that don't necessarily hand you the entire plot. The game trusts the player to remember small details and connect the dots themselves. The pacing is good, apart from the one of the last portions of the game, where it requires you to set specific things on fire.  I thought this was so out of place, especially right after a big boss battle. It was easily the poorest part of the game in terms of pacing and mechanic.\n\nGameplay is good. It differs from Dark Souls in that there is no customization or weapon/armour collection. The fighting system is particularly simple, probably because it takes a great deal of work to code this type of game. This game can be quite difficult if the player isn't acquainted  with Dark Souls style gameplay.  I found it to be a bit too easy at times, as some mobs could be defeated by backstepping > attack > backstep > etc. I didn't utilize the block function very often. I found it frustrating that I couldn't unsheathe my weapon unless there was a mob around, and that when fighting multiple enemies, I couldn't choose which one I wanted to target with ease.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Malebolgia and I look forward to seeing future projects from this game dev.","March 8","true","5.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"itself".\n\nThe setting is hell in the form of a Prussian Castle and every facet of this diamond points to Dante's Divine Comedy in the most direct and meaningful way. The character is a commander of a pre-industrial country that must come to terms with the impact his life's choices have made, whether he is alive or not. All manner of great demons, ghosts and people of his past inhabit the palace, yet it is dark, quiet and horrifically lonely. The lighting and setting in the game are above par, complimenting the flat-shaded look of the environment and cast - a candle flicker illuminates a three-story statue in a haunting way, for instance. The haunting and beautiful music is the perfect pairing to this look -- sparse and finely played piano and low, grinding melodies that echo throughout. All of the paths are carefully thought out and the palace changes per each victory, making the large structures even larger with new paths to explore.\n\nThis game is constantly referred to as a "Dark Souls clone", which I think the developer can wear with pride (imagine being compared to with one of the greatest games available today!) but it is his singular vision that made this game much more than its parts. It is a fun, well-made and supremely atmospheric romp through the dark that I will be talking about for years to come.\n\nI recommend this game (whole-heartedly!) and I finished the game in 14 well-spent hours, I cannot wait for more from this developer - whether it is more Melobolgia or anything else.","May 5, 2015","true","14.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","11","17","2","0"

The bosses are all quite unique and have interesting tricks that ensure you'll die a few times before you master the fight. The palace of Malebolgia is vast, creepy and a ton of fun to explore. The exploration is very "metroidvania", you'll cover the same ground a lot with different enemies or barriers introduced to keep it fresh. It's not really a horror game, there were a couple of parts that made me jump and overall it's sort of spooky how quiet and empty most of the palace is but I have a very low tolerance for scary games and I never had an issue while playing this.

Combat system was also really good, though, felt a slight bit stiff at times, and the targeting system was having a bit of a problem when it came to the last boss of the demo. Also the main character's walk/run animation is kind-of silly. Only thing I can say I really didn't like though were the spiders, in spite of how well designed they were. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, those things were straight out of nightmares, they were.","December 6, 2014","true","4.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"

Subtle, barely noticeable scares where you skip a heart beat for noticing it is, what I think, the game needs more of, that's dynamic with how the games world works.\n\nSpeaking of the games world, it's great with the way that it looks in the castle, and the little view you get for the outside. I like the simple visual design it's going for, especially with the shadow and shading effects, and how there will be "real-time shadows" added at some point during its development, but I do feel that it does need a little bit more..mixture in the textures of the levels? I don't know, it just feels too clean and grey, but aside from that the structure of the castles level, the assets, and the creature models are great, not too sure on the main character and other human characters though.\n\nTo give more feedback while I'm at it, the map navigation is alright but I'm having troubles with finding my self in one of the castles stories and just overall how to navigate through it, I'd suggest adding more details to the characters position/direction more noticeable, better outlines to the map, and more specified directions to where you can go that goes up and down a level.\n\nThe price is reasonable for what it is at the moment, and for what's to come later. My time playing the game was intense, exciting, and enjoyable, with how lovely its simple approach it's taking on both the thriller/horror and the action/adventure genre, and I want to play more of it.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","December 4, 2014","true","1.3"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","18","33","3","0"

Combat's a little stiff but I got used to it after a short while, it's very deliberate and good timing is needed. It's got a very eerie atmosphere, good music and an interesting plot. Yes, the animations aren't particularly fluid but considering this is a one-person project I'm fine with that. This is the only game I've played/seen that is described as similar to the Souls games that actually gets the feel of them. The unease due to enemies hiding behind corners, the tense combat/boss fights, the huge relief when you find a new save point, opening shortcuts etc. I really like it and not to be reductive but this is the game that made me excited to play Bloodborne after being put off by Dark Souls II.\n\nMost of the game takes place inside a giant mansion-like palace (in Ice Hell obviously) and has you going from room to room, sometimes looking for keys (thankfully not hard to find in the dark), a lot of the time exploring and a decent amount of backtracking. I didn't have trouble with it as I didn't really get lost much and the map, while somewhat different (kind of looks like the map in Dead Space but is a bit more readable than that) still helped when I did.\n\nThere are a good number/variety of fun boss fights with nice music accompanying them, giving a decent 5-7 hours of enjoyment, some interesting locations and thankfully some dedication to its theme. No breaking the mood for trash internet humour here.\n\nObviously there are some bugs because it's early access but even so, if any of what I've said sounds like your kind of thing, I'd say pick it up.\n\nNote: I probably won't edit this if anything changes, it was originally written on 26/03/2015 and I've already beaten it so I most likely won't be replaying it any time soon.","March 26, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I picked it up cause it looked like it could be interesting.\n\nI suppose I will get the positives out of the way first. I do quite like the atmosphere of the game. The odd dialogue and claustrophobic environment gives the game a almost nightmarish feeling. You end up expecting to wake up at any moment. Another plus is the artstyle itself, although it is very Lo-Fi it does manage to do something interesting with what it has. The red glowing eyes of the enemies is quite effective when you see them in the dark ahead of you.\n\nThe negatives of the game however are many and can be summarized by one phrase, a critical lack of polish.\n\nI can see what they were trying to do with this game but the problems really do pile up. From the fact that you have to go through the tutorial every time you want to continue your game. To the insanely clunky combat and extremely basic combat. (block, hit, block, hit) along with the slightly odd control scheme.\n\nI want to give this game more praise, it tried to do something interesting and I don’t think it is really a “bad” game. Considering most of the ♥♥♥♥ that gets pushed out onto Steam it is a shining beacon of quality. But the lack of polish and really limited combat and movement just make it hard to recommend.\n\nIf you are willing to give it some time and the benefit of the doubt then there is something to like here.

Yet.\nIt has the groundwork for being something quite special, but in its current state, it's a little disappointing.\n\nPeople will undoubtedly compare this to games like Dark Souls, and while they are similar, this game falls quite flat in comparison. As it currently stands, combat is simple and quite frankly, leaves a lot to be desired. Attacking an enemy usually involves attacking, retreating/parrying, attack, retreat/parry until one of you dies and it feels very much like you're just going through the motions against most enemies with little challenge.\n\nSomething that I think needs to be looked at is the tutorial text for controls. In the opening combat segment and in the books, you are shown buttons for controllers, but occasionally the game seems to forget to tell you which button to press on a keyboard.\n\nHere are some of my personal likes and dislikes so far -\n\nLIKES:\nThe cel shaded look is quite appealing.\nThe lighting is excellent\nThe map system\nMonster/Enemy variation\nHealth regeneration (quite unique)\n\nDISLIKES:\nLimited / simplistic combat maneuvers\nTutorial text sometimes does not show keyboard controls\nNo real sense of story/direction (to start with, at least)\nNot all that scary.\nSound FX seem a little dull.\n\n\nTL;DR - I believe with a few tweaks and fixes, this game would definitely be worth your time, but at the moment of writing this, I would recommend you save your money until it has been updated and polished a little bit.\n\nMy first experience - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qNJX5nwocA","May 8, 2015","false","1.1"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

The fighting is poorly done. There is a blocking function that doesn't work properly. Your character will block the attack, but the enemy will continue to try and hit you. Whenever you block though, you will be stuck in that animation for a second and your character is too slow to follow up a block with an attack, so you will have to back up when an enemy attacks and then move in immediately to hit them. It's poor design and looks even worse in practice. If you try to continue your game, you will have to go through the intro fight every time for some reason. The graphics are terrible.
